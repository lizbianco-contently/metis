Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, I believe it will be possible, with the sponsors of the bill, \nto reach an agreement that will obviate the necessity for a great deal \nof floor time or amendments on the floor. I have met with the sponsors \nof the bill and have presented ideas about ameliorating some of the \ndeficiencies the Department of Justice brought out about the \nlegislation. Last week, I had a long conversation with Senator Cornyn, \nwho is here. I believe if we can continue those discussions, in a very \nbrief period of time--perhaps by the end of this week--it would not be \nnecessary to devote a great deal of time to the consideration of the \nbill. Because of that, at this time, I will object to that particular \nprocedure, but I hope we can report back to the majority leader that we \nhave reached an agreement on the bill in the near future.\n  Mr. REID. I would be satisfied if the junior Senator from Arizona \ncould work on this. I hope there can be an agreement reached that we \ncan take this bill up maybe when we get back, with a limited amount of \ntime and amendments. It is very popular legislation--the Freedom of \nInformation Act--which our friends in the press\n\n[[Page S10340]]\n\nlove, and other organizations around the country. It is very important. \nI hope we can move forward on this bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, before I talk about the topic that brings \nme to the floor, I express my gratitude to the majority leader, Senator \nReid, for bringing up the freedom of information reform bill that \nSenator Leahy, the Senator from Vermont, and I have been working on for \na number of years. When I was attorney general of Texas, it was my \nresponsibility to enforce our open Government laws, and I became a big \nadvocate of greater transparency, more openness in Government, because \nI believe that only a public that is truly informed can give their \nconsent. It has to be informed consent. That is, after all, the very \nfundamental basis for the legitimacy of all of our laws.\n  When I came to the Senate, I was pleased to see that Senator Leahy, \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had been very active in \nthis area. We joined efforts in a bipartisan way to work on these \nreforms. I know Senator Kyl has some concerns. He expressed those this \nmorning. He has been good about working with us to try to work our way \nthrough that. I share his hope and aspiration that we can work through \nthe differences and perhaps complete our work on those Freedom of \nInformation Act reforms this week before we break for August. I think \nthat would be a very positive development and one that is certainly \nworthy of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10340-5", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10340-S10342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          QUALITY HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to turn to the topic that will \nengage us for perhaps most of the remainder of the week, and that is \nensuring that quality health care is available to the next generation. \nThis is, and should be, a top public policy priority for the Congress. \nCertainly, it is one of mine.\n  I think there will be a lot of attention paid to the reauthorization \nof the State Children's Health Insurance Program that will be on the \nfloor shortly. It is noteworthy that SCHIP, so called, was created by \nCongress in 1997 to fill a gap in our health insurance system. It was \ntargeted at working poor families who had too much income to qualify \nfor Medicaid but could not afford regular health insurance. This \nprogram has been enormously successful nationwide, lowering the \nuninsured rate by nearly 25 percent, and especially in my State of \nTexas, where we have about 25 percent of our total population currently \nuninsured. So this has gone a long way to make sure people got access \nto quality health care. Interacting with Medicaid, insurance coverage \nhas been extended under this program to more than 1 million Texas \nchildren who would have otherwise not been covered. So SCHIP deserves \nreauthorization and renewal.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate Finance bill that will come to the floor \nseems to take us on a path toward a major step that failed in 1994, and \nthat is a federally funded takeover of national health care. The Senate \nFinance Committee is proposing a near quadrupling--that is four times--\nof SCHIP funding that would increase taxes, weaken private insurance \ncoverage, and create a new de facto entitlement program for middle-\nclass families, all courtesy of the beleaguered American taxpayer. A \nclose analysis demonstrates that, if enacted, the Senate bill would \nactually have the unintended impact of degrading health care for many \nchildren and will not be as nearly beneficial to Texas as a more modest \nalternative, which I intend to support.\n  The original SCHIP program--again, it is worth spelling out the \nacronym--State Children's Health Insurance Program--was limited to \nthose families at up to 200 percent of the official poverty level or \n$40,000 for a family of four. But some States have found a way to \nexpand coverage from first children, then to parents, then to childless \nadults, and then to families with much higher incomes. Some States, \nsuch as New Jersey, now use SCHIP funds to cover families with income \nof up to 400 percent of the poverty level--up to $82,600 a year for a \nfour-person family. So that is what I mean when I say that SCHIP is now \nbeing transmogrified, transformed into a middle-class entitlement, if \nthis finance bill were to pass.\n  Minnesota, instead of using the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram to target relatively low-income children, as Congress intended, \nspends 61 percent of SCHIP funding on adults; and Wisconsin spends 75 \npercent of their SCHIP funding on adults. If this were the U.S. \nmilitary, we would call this ``mission creep.'' The Senate bill would \nencourage these distortions further. Nearly a third of the newly \ncovered, some 2 million children, already have private insurance.\n  So let me be clear. What this bill, if enacted, would do would take \nsome people who currently have private insurance and substitute \ntaxpayer-paid-for insurance under this program because, of course, why \nwould anybody pay for something that the Government starts giving away \nfor free? They will drop their private insurance and many of the \nparents will decide to drop theirs as well, transferring these expenses \nto the American taxpayer.\n  But many SCHIP programs pay physicians at Medicaid rates; that is, \nthe reimbursement for physicians--a reimbursement rate that is so low \nthat many doctors simply cannot afford to take patients based on those \nMedicaid rates and, thus, they are refusing new patients. Ironically, \nthe switch to Government-paid SCHIP could mean reduced health care for \nthose recipients who decide to give up private insurance to get free \ninsurance. But where reimbursement is at the Medicaid rate, where there \nare so few doctors who can afford to treat patients at those rates, \nchildren will end up with actually less care in some instances and not \nmore.\n  Many supporters are happy because funding for this expanded program \nwill be paid by tobacco users, through a 61-cent per pack cigarette tax \nincrease. But the accounting is fundamentally flawed. To make it \nbalance, the Senate bill pretends spending on this accelerating program \nwill go from $8.4 billion in 2012 to only $400 million in 2013.\n  As our Republican leader notes, ``Does anyone seriously think \nCongress will decide to cut SCHIP by $8 billion in one year, so that \nmillions who rely on it will lose their health insurance?'' Of course \nnot. This is phony accounting. No business in America could run its \noperations this way, and the Federal Government should not try.\n\n  Supporters of the finance bill claim a badge of fiscal responsibility \nbecause this bill only uses $35 billion of the $50 billion budget \nauthority it was given during this year's budget reconciliation. But \nthe finance bill gets that additional $15 billion in budget authority \nby setting aside billions of dollars for a so-called incentive fund. \nThe SCHIP program was designed as one huge incentive already for the \nStates. The creation of this program says to the States: Go cover \nchildren; Congress will give you more money for doing that than we will \nfor covering anyone else.\n  So why are we creating an incentive on top of another incentive? And \nthese\n\n[[Page S10341]]\n\nincentive payments, of course, will be used to go beyond covering \nchildren, which is, of course, Congress's original stated intent.\n  This goes from what I would call mission creep to another incremental \nstep toward a federally controlled, Washington-dictated health care \nsystem, paid for by huge tax increases on the American taxpayer. \nPerhaps the answer is that this fund exists to provide expanded \ncoverage for nontargeted populations; that is, populations Congress did \nnot intend--adults, for example. After all, States, under the Finance \nCommittee bill that is coming to the floor, will have relative freedom \nto use these funds as they see fit. Where, I ask, is the \naccountability? Where is the responsibility?\n  The finance bill also puts aside at least $2 billion in a so-called \ncontingency fund. First an incentive fund, then a contingency fund--\nboth slush funds. But this contingency fund will only be drawn down by \n$400 million total over 5 years. This represents less than 1 percent of \noverall spending. I think this blatantly shows the level at which this \nbill is overfunded. So while the bill is only claiming to spend part of \nthe budgetary authority it is given, it is still creating two budgetary \nslush funds. I think it is there for another purpose. I think this is \nanother attempt, as I said, to incrementally federalize health care.\n  There will be some of us who will join together, with our leader and \nSenator Lott, Senator Kyl, and others, to offer a scaled-down \nalternative called Kids First, which refocuses SCHIP on its intended \npurpose. It concentrates on outreach--locating and enrolling eligible \nchildren. Some 75 percent of uninsured children already qualify for \neither Medicaid or SCHIP. Kids First aims to sign them up. It also \nsubsidizes eligible families to keep their private coverage and doesn't \nprovide an incentive for them to drop their private coverage to get \nfree coverage courtesy of the American taxpayer.\n  The Senate bill increases spending by $35 billion over 5 years--I \nshould say so far because I know there are amendments that will be \noffered, and I think I have read Senator Kerry and others will offer \namendments to bump that figure to $50 billion, and we have seen even \nlarger figures suggested on the House side. So no telling what a \nconference committee will ultimately come back with. But Kids First, \nthe alternative which will be offered by this side of the aisle, will \ncost only $10 billion more than the current SCHIP program.\n  Ironically, under Kids First, the children in my State, Texas, would \ncome out far ahead over the Senate Finance Committee version. SCHIP, as \nwe know, is a joint Federal-State effort involving matching Federal \nfunds. After cutbacks for budget reasons a few years ago, Texas is now \nramping up its SCHIP program, enrolling additional eligible children. \nHowever, the Senate Finance Committee bill would confiscate about $660 \nmillion that Texas has so far left unspent from prior years because we \nhave been responsible, because we haven't used the money that was \ndesignated for children to cover adults, as 14 other States have. Under \nKids First, we would keep access to all unspent funds for 2 more years \nso we can locate and recruit and sign up more children--the designated \ntarget for this Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  But here is the bottom line: Texas would have $1.6 billion in SCHIP \nFederal matching funds available next year under Kids First and only \n$1.06 billion under the Senate bill. In other words, we would be better \noff under the alternative rather than the Senate Finance Committee \nbill, and so would the children, who would be the beneficiaries of \nthose funds. Additionally, any matching funds left unspent after that \nwould go back to the U.S. Treasury, and that would not be used to \nsubsidize other States that game the system and distort the program \nbeyond Congress's original intent.\n  One alternative provides the prospect of better health care for Texas \nchildren, plus lower taxes, a fiscally responsible government, and more \nmoney and more control for my State. For this and other reasons I have \nstated, I will vote for the Kids First Act, the alternative we will \noffer, and not the Senate Finance Committee bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime for the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Sixteen minutes and twenty seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wanted to rise to carry on the discussion \nwhich the Senator from Texas has so eloquently begun relative to the \nproposal that is coming forward to the Senate today called SCHIP. Under \nthe cloak of trying to address the issue of health care for children, \nwe are seeing an explosion in cost, the purpose of which is not \nnecessarily to cover children who need coverage because many of the \nchildren who are going to be covered here are already covered under \nprivate plans, but the purpose is actually to dramatically expand the \nrole of government in the area of limited health care in this country, \nand it is openly acknowledged as being an effort to move down the road \ntoward universal health care.\n  Independent of the substantive policy of how we approach insuring and \nmaking sure children get health insurance in this country, there is the \nancillary policy of fiscal discipline. This Congress, so far, under its \nDemocratic leadership has abandoned the concept of fiscal discipline. \nThey are spending money on all sorts of initiatives around here that go \nwell beyond even the extraordinarily high numbers which were put in the \nbudget under this Democratic Congress. We have returned, without \nquestion, to the days of tax and spend. In fact, it was interesting \ntoday that there was an article in the Wall Street Journal, an \neditorial that listed I think it was ten different areas where there \nhave been proposals to dramatically increase the tax burden on the \nAmerican people, to gather up funds by the Democratic Party so they can \nthen be spent on other initiatives.\n\n  This proposal, this SCHIP proposal as it comes forward to us under \nthe auspices of the liberal leadership of the Senate, is a classic \nexample of spending which can't be afforded and spending which uses \ngimmicks in order to mask its real costs.\n  This chart reflects the fact that the spending in this proposal jumps \n$35 billion--$35 billion--over a 5-year period, taking a program that \ncould be fully funded today for about a third of that but adding an \nadditional two-thirds on top of that in order to take care of \ninitiatives which basically fund two things: No. 1, they fund adults \nunder a children's health insurance program, and No. 2, they fund \nbringing children off of private insurance and putting them on the \npublic insurance system so that taxpayers generally have to pay for \nsomething which is now being paid for in the private sector.\n  So the cost of this program jumps radically over the next 5 years, \nand then, in the ultimate act of fiscal cynicism and fraud, they claim \nthe program will drop back down to being a $3.5 billion program after \nit has reached a peak of $16 billion in 2012. Are they going to abolish \nthe program in 2013? Of course not. But in order to avoid their own \nrules of how you have to pay for things around here or are supposed to \npay for things around here when you put a new program on the books, in \nan act, as I said, of fraud and cynicism, the liberal leadership of \nthis Senate has decided to claim that this program, which we will be \nspending $16 billion on in 2012, we will suddenly only spend $3.5 \nbillion in 2013. Ironically, that number, $3.5 billion, is even less \nthan what the program costs today, which is about $5 billion.\n  So this whole area in here, this white area, is totally unfunded, \nunless you assume this program now being put on the books is going to \nsuddenly end 5 years from now--which is, of course, absurd. We don't \nend programs in the Federal Government. We certainly don't end a \nprogram that is focused on trying to fund health care for children. So \nwhat happens is that $40 billion over the next 5 years which will be \nspent on this program, no doubt about it--in fact, a lot more than that \nif the House bill passes--is treated as if it is a virtual number, as \nif it doesn't exist, as if it is some sort of nonspending event by an \naccounting mechanism which claims that actually we are not going to \nspend that $40 billion, we are just going to spend this $3.5 billion on \nthat program on an annual basis.\n\n[[Page S10342]]\n\n  The disingenuousness of this reaches a new level of misrepresentation \nto the American taxpayer as to what the burden is that is going to be \nput on them as a result of this proposal. Now, why do they do this? Why \ndo they deny there is $40 billion of spending, which they know is going \nto occur, which my colleagues on the other side of the aisle absolutely \nknow is going to occur? Why do they deny it is going to happen? Why do \nthey use this gimmick where they claim we are going back to a cost of a \nprogram which is less than it is today after we put a cost on the books \nthat is three times what it is today? Because they want to avoid \nsomething called pay-go--pay-go--which is their representation of how \nthey discipline the Federal budget.\n  Every time you listen to a colleague from the other side of the aisle \ntalk about disciplining the Federal budget, you will hear those words: \nI am for pay-go; I am for pay-go. We hear it from the budget chairman \nincessantly. We hear it from other members of the other side of the \naisle. Pay-go is the way we will discipline the Federal budget.\n  Well, let's see what they have done to pay-go since they have been in \ncharge of the Congress. There is no more pay-go. It should be fraud-go. \nIt is actually Swiss cheese-go since this Congress has been dominated \nby the Democratic Party.\n  I will bet you that everybody who ran for election from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle to this Congress said they were going to \ndiscipline the Federal deficit using pay-go. Since they have been in \noffice, since they have been running this Congress, they have either \nwaived or gotten around pay-go on about 12 different occasions, \nrepresenting billions of dollars of cost to the American taxpayer, of \nwhich this $40 billion item we are doing today is one of the biggest. \nWith minimum wage, they went around pay-go; with the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, they went around pay-go; with PDUFA, they went around \npay-go; with immigration reform, they went around pay-go; with the \nEnergy bill, they went around pay-go; with the MILC bill, they went \naround pay-go; with the county payments or payments in lieu of taxes, \nat $4 billion, they went around pay-go; with the new mandatory Pell \ngrants, $6 billion, they went around pay-go; and now here, with SCHIP, \nthey are going around pay-go to the tune of $40 billion. Almost $90 \nbillion has been proposed to be spent by the other side of the aisle \nsince they took control of this Congress which should have been subject \nto pay-go but where they have either waived, ignored, or gimmicked pay-\ngo out of existence. So where is the fiscal discipline? It doesn't \nexist. It doesn't exist.\n  The only thing they intend to use pay-go for is to force taxes to go \nup on American workers. They will use it for that, there is no question \nabout that. When we get to the point where some of these tax issues are \nraised by expiring, they will say pay-go applies to that and we have to \npay for that, so taxes will go up on the American workers and on the \nAmerican economy. But when it comes to spending money, there is no \ndiscipline of pay-go from the other side of the aisle.\n  Anyone who stands on the other side of the aisle and claims that pay-\ngo is a viable vehicle for disciplining the Federal deficit, well, the \nnext thing they are going to tell you is they have a bridge to sell you \nin Brooklyn or that the check is in the mail.\n  The simple fact is, it is a fraud on the American taxpayer when that \nstatement is made. This bill pretty much completes the thought that \nthere is no more pay-go.\n  Then, on top of that--they are not comfortable enough in this bill to \nspend $40 billion and claim they are not spending it, which is exactly \nwhat they do in the second 5 years--that is not enough for the other \nside of the aisle. In the House, they put in language repealing one of \nthe most important enforcement mechanisms to discipline the cost of \nMedicare, which is, if for 2 years the payment for the cost of Medicare \nfrom the general fund exceeds 45 percent of the overall cost of \nMedicare--as we all know Medicare is supposed to be an insurance \nprogram that is paid for by the HI insurance, but it also gets support \nby the general fund--if that cost exceeds 45 percent for 2 years in a \nrow, then we, as a Congress, are supposed to take another look and say \nthat is not the way Medicare is supposed to be funded. It is supposed \nto be funded through the HI insurance. We go back to look at \ndisciplining Medicare spending and making it more affordable.\n  No. Not any longer. The House of Representatives not only spends $40 \nbillion they claim they are not spending and don't pay for, they also, \nin their bill, repeal the 45-percent rule, one of the few disciplines \naround here which allows this body to stand up and say we are \nprofligate. Let's get this under control.\n  I think the American consumer needs to know that they get what they \npay for. In the last election they got a Congress which has a \nphilosophical viewpoint which has not changed a whole lot in the last \n50 years. I was here the last time Congress was dominated by the \nDemocratic Party. I was here when Tip O'Neil ran the House of \nRepresentatives. Wow, did we spend money back then. Let me tell you, we \nare back to that style of governance. Only this time it is being done \nwith the representation that there is discipline because we are using \npay-go. Unfortunately, however, pay-go doesn't exist when it comes to \nspending. It is ``fraud-go,'' it is ``Swiss cheese-go,'' and the \nAmerican people get stuck with the bill.\n  Our children and our children's children get stuck with the bill \nbecause, in order to address certain political constituencies, the \nother side of the aisle believes it needs to spend the money, and it \ndoes not have the courage to stand up for its own rules, the rules they \nput forward.\n  I have always said pay-go was a fraud, but the other side of the \naisle marches behind that banner in budget after budget, claiming that \npay-go gives us fiscal discipline. Here is $90 billion of spending in \njust 6 months. They have only been in charge for 6 months--$90 billion. \nThat is a lot of money in 6 months that should have been subject to \npay-go, which has been gamed, ignored, or claimed an emergency so that \npay-go would not apply.\n  As a practical matter, let's have no more talk of pay-go in this \nbody. Let's talk about what we are really doing on this SCHIP bill. We \nare going to spend $40 billion, and we do not pay for it. That is just \nin the next 5 years. If you extrapolated this, it actually works out to \nbe somewhere in the $2 trillion to $3 trillion range over the life \nexpectancy of the program, the 75-year life expectancy, which is the \nway we calculate things around here that deal with entitlements.\n  This is not fiscally responsible, and it is clear, if we continue \ndown this path, we are going to set up a train wreck for those who come \nafter us and have to pay the costs of this type of profligate spending \nwhich has no discipline attached to it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today is a day which can be historic. \nImportant items will be discussed on the floor of the Senate, including \nhealth insurance for literally millions of American kids. At the same \ntime, there is a debate that has been started in New York at the United \nNations Security Council. It is a debate about a genocide.\n\n[[Page S10343]]\n\n  It is, thank goodness, rare that we have to address the issue of \ngenocide in this world, but today we must. We are talking of a genocide \ntoday, in New York, at the Security Council, that has caused untold \nhuman misery, mass murder, dislocation, torture, rape, and the torching \nof entire villages. For 4 years the world has watched this tragedy. \nThat's right, for 4 years.\n  Haven't we learned our lesson when it comes to letting genocide \ncontinue without taking action?\n  There is a great Senate story involving former Wisconsin Senator Bill \nProxmire. In 1967, Senator Proxmire began a streak in the Senate that \nhas never been broken. Mr. President, 18 years earlier, in 1949, \nPresident Truman had sent the United Nations Genocide Convention to the \nSenate for advice and consent. In 1967, it was still languishing, held \nup by a small band of Senators who opposed it. Many Senators just shook \ntheir head because of this opposition. Bill Proxmire rose to his feet.\n  Starting in 1967, Senator Proxmire made a speech every day the Senate \nwas in session, for 19 years, imploring the Senate to adopt the \nGenocide Convention. All together, he gave 3,211 speeches--each one of \nthem different. In 1986 the Senate gave its consent to the treaty.\n  Why did Senator Proxmire continue to give all those speeches, day \nafter day, year after year? It wasn't just stubbornness. It was a moral \nobligation, and because he understood genocide was happening again. At \nthat time it was happening in Cambodia.\n\n  Between 1975 and 1979 the Khmer Rouge murdered 2 million people. The \nUnited States wisely and bravely led the international effort to hold \nthe Nazi co-conspirators to account at Nuremberg. We and the rest of \nthe world failed to act while Cambodia was being turned into killing \nfields.\n  In 1994 we failed to act again when between 800,000 and 1 million \npeople were murdered in Rwanda in 1 month.\n  Sadly, we have failed to take the necessary action to stop the \ngenocide in Darfur. More than 2\\1/2\\ years have passed since the U.N. \ncommission of inquiry concluded that:\n\n       Crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed \n     in Darfur and may be no less serious and heinous than \n     genocide.\n\n  Earlier this year, President Bush declared:\n\n       For too long, the people of Darfur have suffered at the \n     hands of a government that is complicit in the bombing, \n     murder and rape of innocent civilians. My administration has \n     called these actions by their rightful name: genocide. The \n     world has a responsibility to put an end to it.\n\n  Yesterday, the new British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, said in a \njoint press conference with President Bush that:\n\n       Darfur is the greatest humanitarian crisis the world faces \n     today.\n\n  Yet it is not simply enough to acknowledge genocide. We need to \nfollow Senator Proxmire's example in having the courage, in real time, \nto act against it.\n  The crisis in Darfur has been repeated over and over. Paul Salopek, a \nChicago Tribune reporter, was captured and jailed by the Khartoum \ngovernment for 34 days last year. He wrote a haunting description of \nwhat one sees when you fly over the villages of Darfur. This is what he \nwrote:\n\n       Their torched huts seen from the air, look like cigarette \n     burns on a torture victim's skin.\n\n  Most recently, Refugees International released a report documenting \nthat:\n\n       Rape on a mass scale is one of the hallmarks of the \n     conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan. An estimated 300,000 \n     people in Darfur have been killed during this genocide; \n     300,000 people in a country of 40 million. In the United \n     States that would be the equivalent of over 2 million people \n     killed.\n\n  Incredibly, the Sudanese Government claims the atrocities are part of \ntheir war on terror. At a press conference in Washington earlier this \nsummer, Sudan's Ambassador to the United States compared the slaughter \nto a family quarrel, and he said:\n\n       Just you and your cousin fighting with you.\n\n  Just this last week, Sudanese President Bashir visited Darfur and \nsaid:\n\n       Most of Darfur is now secure and enjoying real peace.\n\n  People there are ``living normal lives.''\n  These are lies. This is genocide. It is calculated. It is happening \non our watch, in our time.\n  This week, the global community has a chance to finally make a \ndifference. I am going to join today with Senators Feingold and \nMenendez in calling for a decisive vote at the United Nations on an \nexpanded peacekeeping force and renewed diplomatic effort in Darfur. \nThe U.N. Security Council will vote this week, maybe even today, on a \nnew United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force that can make a \ndramatic difference in stemming the violence in Darfur. It also \nprovides an equally important opportunity for peace negotiations.\n  After years of duplicity in the genocide, Sudanese President Bashir \nagreed last month to the significant expanded joint United Nations-\nAfrican Union peacekeeping force. Yet a series of his recent comments \ncontradict that commitment, and a history of involvement in violence \nmakes immediate action all the more important.\n  The need is simple--rapid deployment of the new peacekeeping force \nand a renewed diplomatic effort at a long-term political settlement.\n  I have tried in some small way to urge the members of the United \nNations Security Council to act swiftly. I discussed urgency of these \nmatters with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and the Ambassadors of \nChina, Ghana, Republic of Congo, Russia, and South Africa. All were \ncurrent or permanent members of the Security Council. It is the first \ntime I have ever picked up the phone to call Ambassadors from other \ncountries about a vote in the United Nations Security Council, but I \nthink it is that important. It is my hope that our U.N. Ambassador, \nZalmay Khalilzad, will work closely with these nations and Secretary \nGeneral Ban to make these steps a reality.\n  I stressed to the Secretary General and to the Ambassadors that the \nSecurity Council should be firm in its mandate. We need a force with \nsufficient resources and numbers; a strong mandate to protect \ncivilians, peacekeepers, and humanitarian workers; a clear U.N. command \nand control structure, and benchmarks with the threat of sanctions that \nhold the Sudanese Government accountable; no room for further stalling \nor delay by the Sudanese Government; a renewed diplomatic effort to \nbring about a long-term political settlement, including naming a \nSpecial Representative of the Secretary General to monitor \nimplementation of a comprehensive peace agreement; and the force must \nbe deployed as quickly as possible.\n  Congress, the administration, and the private sector--we all need to \ntake action to end the genocide in Darfur. In Congress we have passed \nthe Genocide Accountability Act, which allows the prosecution of \ngenocide committed by anyone currently in the United States, regardless \nof where the genocide occurred. We have passed language in the Iraq \nsupplemental bill that requires the Treasury Department to submit to \nCongress a report that lists the companies operating in the Sudanese \nnatural resources industry, and requires the General Services \nAdministration to report to Congress on whether the U.S. Government has \nan active contract with any of those companies.\n  Later today the House is expected to pass a bill that would support \nState and local divestment efforts, require companies to disclose \nSudanese-related business activities, investigate whether the Federal \nRetirement Thrift Investment Board has invested funds in any of these \ncompanies operated in Sudan, and bar the U.S. Government from operating \nwith any companies operating to benefit the Sudanese regime.\n  A few weeks ago, the Senate passed the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Enhancement Act, which increases civil and criminal \npenalties associated with violating American economic sanctions such as \nthose against Sudan. I encourage our House counterparts to pass this \nbill as well.\n  I have introduced legislation similar to the bill the House is \nexpected to pass today that would support State governments that decide \nto encourage public funds to divest from Sudan-related investments. \nThat bill has strong bipartisan support, nearly a third of the Senate.\n  We tried to pass it, but someone in the Senate has put a hold on that \nbill.\n\n[[Page S10344]]\n\nThey have decided we should not move quickly to try to divest and \ndiscourage genocide. I urge whatever Republican colleague on that side \nhas put a hold on this bill to seriously stop and consider the impact \nof this political move. We need to make sure the House and the Senate \nare on record on a bipartisan basis, clearly, unequivocally.\n  I have also included in the Senate Financial Services and General \nGovernment Appropriations Act language requiring the administration to \nreport on the effectiveness of the current sanctions regime and \nrecommended steps Congress can take.\n  Personally, some of us have decided to divest from Sudan-related \ninvestments in our own portfolios as a gesture of solidarity. The \nadministration has taken some important steps. In April of this year, \nat the Holocaust Museum, President Bush declared rightly that the \nUnited States has a moral obligation to stop the genocide in Darfur. \nRecently the President took the first step toward meeting that \nobligation by ordering the U.S. sanctions against Sudan be tightened.\n  The Treasury Department is adding 30 companies that are owned or \ncontrolled by the Government of Sudan to a list of firms that are \nbarred from U.S. financial assistance. The Office of Foreign Assets \nControl within the Treasury Department, working with other agencies, \nhas worked hard to tighten economic and political sanctions.\n  Although these are important steps, I wish the U.S. Government, the \nCongress, and the President, had taken these steps sooner. Ultimately, \nwe and the private sector must do all we can to ensure the genocide in \nDarfur once and for all is brought to an end.\n  I am going to end today with a quote from Nobel laureate and \nHolocaust survivor Eli Weisel:\n\n       Take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the \n     victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the \n     tormented.\n\n  I see on the floor my colleagues from Wisconsin and New Jersey who \njoin me today in this floor effort, this message to the United Nations. \nI wish to thank Senator Menendez for his continuing interest in this \nDarfur genocide. He has carried on in the Senate a tradition started \nwhen I first came here by his predecessor, Senator Corzine.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Feingold, who is chairman of the African \nSubcommittee of Foreign Relations. He has a special interest in that \ncontinent and a special dedication to ending the genocide in Darfur.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to thank my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, for bringing us together today to talk about \nthe ongoing genocide in Darfur and, more specifically, the upcoming \nU.N. Security Council resolution and for his continuing efforts in the \nSenate.\n  I am also honored and pleased to be with Senator Feingold, who has \nbeen such an incredibly powerful voice on this issue, both in his \nposition as the chairman of the African Subcommittee on Foreign \nRelations and in his principle position itself. I am honored to join \nwith them in this effort.\n  Today, as we speak on the Senate floor, the U.N. Security Council is \nnegotiating a new Darfur resolution. So today we are on the Senate \nfloor to send a loud and clear message to the United Nations. The \npeople of Darfur need a strong and meaningful resolution that puts into \naction the end of the genocide and ensures that a United Nations-\nAfrican Union troop force gets into Darfur.\n  Today, we are here to add our voices to those who call for a U.N. \nresolution with strong authority, for a robust hybrid United Nations-\nAfrican Union force, and a full mandate and speedy deployment. It has \nlong been clear that the overstretched and underfunded African Union \ntroops cannot end the genocide. If this new force is not allowed in, \nthe carnage and the destruction we have witnessed now for over 4 years \nwill continue.\n  We have known that a U.N. force is the key to ending the violence in \nDarfur, and we have tried in the past to put it into place. Over a year \nago, when I first came to the Senate, I got the Senate to pass an \namendment for $60 million to fund the U.N. peacekeeping force in \nDarfur. I was joined by my colleagues in that effort.\n  Almost 1 year ago, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1706, \nwhich called for 22,500 U.N. troops and police officers to support the \nAfrican Union force in Sudan. Yet we still see no hybrid force on the \nground. We still hear of attacks on humanitarian workers, we still \nlearn of atrocities against civilians.\n  The lives of these millions of displaced persons now hang in a \ndelicate balance between life and death. If we were in the refugee \ncamps being attacked, who among us would be content with the counsels \nof: patience, patience, and delay. Who?\n  Let's be frank; it has been the Government of Sudan that has kept \nthis force from entering. Now they recently have agreed to allow a \nforce in. Yet we have heard these words before. Words mean little \nwithout real action. That is why I am pleased this new U.N. Security \nCouncil will likely include the transfer of authority to a hybrid \nUnited Nations-African Union mission that will allow the use of force \nto ensure the security and movement of the mission's personnel and \nhumanitarian workers.\n  But to be meaningful, this force must be deployed, and it must be \ndeployed as quickly as humanly possible. I am disappointed, however, \nthat after rounds of negotiations, the resolution was ultimately \nwatered down. From what I understand, there will be no reference to \nsanctions, there will be no right to seize and dispose of illegal arms, \nthere will be no reference to the jingaweit, the brutal pro-Khartoum \nmilitia force responsible for many of the atrocities.\n\n  While I understand the need to negotiate a resolution that will pass, \nultimately, we cannot let this manipulation continue. We cannot let \nSudan's Ambassador have veto power over these lives. We cannot let \nnations with permanent seats and veto power on the Council continue to \nact irresponsibly. That is where I wish to close.\n  China says they generally approve, generally approve of the new \nresolution. They have been working, however, behind the scenes to \nweaken it. They reportedly helped remove references to sanctions. They \nreportedly objected to its ``controversial tone'' about genocide. \nSimply put, they continue to act in their own economic interest. We \nhave seen them take some positive steps in the past, and it is positive \nthat they are reportedly not going to block this resolution and that \nthey may even support it.\n  But such a small step when China is under public international \npressure is simply not enough. That is why I am pleased my resolution \non China and Darfur passed the Senate last night. This resolution, \nwhich my colleagues on the floor supported, calls on China to use its \nunique influence and economic leverage to stop the genocide and \nviolence in Darfur.\n  China has longstanding economic and military ties with Sudan, and \nthey must use their economic leverage to do more than fill their \nwallet. As China prepares to host the 2008 Olympic Summer Games, we \nmust hold the Chinese Government accountable to act consistently with \nthe Olympic standard of preserving human dignity around the world, \nincluding in Darfur.\n  Once again, the international community finds itself with another \nopportunity to bring about real change in Darfur. The resolution being \npassed by the U.N. Security Council will only be meaningful if measures \nwith teeth are included.\n  As John Prendergast, senior adviser to the International Crisis \nGroup, said recently in testimony before Congress:\n\n       Barking without biting is the diplomatic equivalent of \n     giving comfort to the enemy.\n\n  Time has run out for negotiations. Time has run out for the Khartoum \nGovernment to balk. Time has run out for watered down U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions. We must get that hybrid force on the ground. We \nmust end the genocide.\n  If ``never again'' is to have real meaning, if those words we use are \nto have real meaning, it has to have strong action to stop the \ngenocide, strong action that history will judge as among the righteous, \nanything less will lend to our collective condemnation, and to the \never-nagging conscience that will not rest as others die.\n  That is the choice before the U.N. Security Council. I am glad those \nof us here are making our voices felt so, hopefully, the Council will \nact and we can have meaningful action to ``never again.''\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on \nthe floor today to raise the critical and timely issue of the U.N. \nSecurity Council's authorization of an expanded peacekeeping mission \nfor the Darfur region of Sudan. Senator Durbin has been a stalwart \nadvocate for the people of Darfur for years and I admire and appreciate \nhis dedication to keeping their plight at the top of Congress's agenda \nand to making sure we finally take strong action to help the more than \n2 million displaced Darfuris who are languishing in squalid camps and \npunish those who continue to be responsible for their plight.\n  The United Nations Security Council is currently considering a \nresolution expected to authorize a robust peacekeeping mission to \nprotect the innocent people of Darfur. This is of course a welcome, and \noverdue, effort. By now, there is little disagreement anywhere in the \nworld that the current force of just over 7,000 courageous but \nunderequipped and beleaguered African Union peacekeepers is not \nadequately protecting civilians or aid workers from attacks by rebels \nand government-sponsored militias, nor are they able to sufficiently \nsafeguard humanitarian access to the tens of thousands whose survival \nnow depends upon outside assistance. The AU force in Darfur has \nrepeatedly been deprived of adequate resources and equipment, and yet \ndespite this inconsistent support they have remained committed to the \njob. Support from the United Nations has been in theory forthcoming, \nfor quite some time. In principle, the roadblocks have been many and \nthe unfortunate result of this hobbled mission transition has been more \nviolence, more displacement, and more death throughout Darfur.\n  The recent acceptance to expedite the transition of this mission to a \nmore robust U.N.-AU mission is a step in the right direction, but we \nmust bear in mind the number of agreements that have long since been \noverlooked, ignored, or flat-out rejected by the Sudanese Government.\n  And while a draft resolution being circulated indicates that the \ninternational community is actively moving forward to deploy this \nhybrid force, I am very disappointed that the resolution's cosponsors \nhave succumbed to pressure from the Sudanese and deleted language which \ncondemned the government for violations of past U.N. resolutions and \npeace agreements and removed the threat of sanctions in the event of \ncontinued noncompliance. The United States Ambassador to the United \nNations, Mr. Zalmay Khalilzad suggests that the United States has been \n``flexible'' and ``open minded in terms of non-core issues'' when \nnegotiating this resolution, and I can only hope the administration \nwill not .show flexibility when firmness is required. I certainly \nunderstand the necessity of diplomatic compromise; however, I feel \nstrongly that the draft resolution being circulated in New York has \nbeen unacceptably weakened.\n  The amended resolution begins by ``Recalling all its previous \nresolutions and presidential statements concerning the situation in \nSudan.'' In fact, however, this new proposal steps back from nearly a \ndozen Security Council resolutions, dating back to July 2004. Those \nresolutions were not just addressing the ``situation in Sudan''--they \nwere expressing concern over the rising violence in Darfur and the role \nof the Sudanese Government in perpetuating the conflict. The \ndistinction here is an important one and should not be overlooked.\n\n  The preamble goes on to detail the development and endorsement of the \nso-called Addis Ababa Agreement, which laid out the three-phased \napproach to an unprecedented joint United Nations-African Union \n``hybrid'' peacekeeping mission. At that time--8 months ago--then-\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan seemed confident that troops would be \nmobilizing soon, and the U.S. administration promptly welcomed what it \ncalled ``the successful outcome of this historic meeting.''\n  What appears to have been forgotten in November, and again in the \ncurrent U.N. debate, is that in August of 2006--just about a year ago--\nthe Security Council passed Resolution 1706, which authorized up to \n22,500 U.N. troops and police officers for a robust United Nations \npeacekeeping force with the power to use all necessary means to protect \nhumanitarian aid workers and civilian populations, as well as to seize \nand dispose of illegal weapons. The new resolution currently being \nconsidered in New York does not reference Resolution 1706 or the \nSudanese Government's defiant refusal to comply with its provisions. \nNor does it draw the appropriate lessons from the failed attempt to \ndeploy U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur almost a year ago.\n  Rather than include stronger monitoring and enforcement mechanisms to \nensure that the Sudanese Government and other parties to the conflict \nabide by existing agreements and cooperate with the new peacekeeping \nmission, the resolution's cosponsors appear to have backed down to \nSudanese pressure. Their weakened resolution omits a condemnation of \nSudan for failing to ensure humanitarian aid reaches those in need, \ndeletes reference to evidence of violations of the UNSC-mandated arms \nembargo--which many outside experts have noted has been repeatedly \nviolated with little consequence--drops a request that the Secretary \nGeneral immediately report any breach of this or previous resolutions \nand agreements, and removes a threat that the U.N. would take ``further \nmeasures''--in other words, sanctions--in the event of noncompliance. \nHow can we believe that individuals will be held accountable for their \nactions when we have seen such entrenched impunity?\n  In terms of the peacekeeping mission envisioned for Darfur,this new \nresolution is much less ambitious than Resolution 1706. The new \n``UNAMID'' mission is referred to as an ``operation,'' rather than a \n``force,'' and rather than giving peacekeepers the authority to ``use \nall necessary means'' to protect civilians and aid workers, the new \nresolution allows them only to ``take all necessary action.'' These \nsemantic distinctions reveal a worrisome retreat from the robust, \ncapable mission authorized in Resolution 1706. And yet, the Sudanese \nGovernment has criticized even this diluted resolution. As I said \nbefore, diplomatic compromise is important, but not as important as \nmaking sure we finally have the tools to punish and put a stop to \natrocities.\n  Sudan's obstruction of this most recent international effort to end \nthe genocide in Darfur should not surprise anyone. After all, this is \nthe same regime we saw attack its own citizens in indiscriminate \nbombing raids and obstruct humanitarian access during 2 decades of \nbloody civil war with southern Sudan. These same tactics are being used \ntoday in Darfur.\n  Last week, in its first overall review of Sudan's record for more \nthan a decade, the U.N.'s independent Human Rights Committee said that \n``widespread and systematic serious human rights violations--including \nmurder, rape, forced displacement and attacks against the civil \npopulation--have been and continue to be committed with total impunity \nthroughout Sudan and particularly in Darfur.'' The only thing more \ndisturbing than the Sudanese Government's practice of organized \natrocities as a method of governance is the inability of the \ninternational community so far to put a stop to these crimes and secure \njustice for the victims.\n  How many more families must be displaced? How many more innocent \nlives lost? How many more U.N. resolutions, presidential statements, \npolitical speeches, and public rallies will be needed? How much \nevidence of calculated persecution will it take before the \ninternational community stands up to the Sudanese Government and the \nrebels, brings them to the negotiating table, and deploys an expanded \npeacekeeping mission to protect civilians and ultimately, help secure \nthe peace, in a region that for too long has received much attention \nbut little action?\n  Although the revised resolution omits the original reference to Chad \nand the Central African Republic, it does express ``concern that the \nongoing violence in Darfur might further negatively affect the rest of \nSudan as well as the region.'' The short- and long-term impacts of the \ncrisis in Darfur are real, far-reaching, and very troubling. The \nhumanitarian consequences will require massive logical coordination and \nrehabilitation assistance. Economically, the rebuilding of \ninfrastructure and livelihoods will demand additional resources and \ntechnical support. And this will be required not just for\n\n[[Page S10346]]\n\nDarfur but for the whole of Sudan, as well as the broader region.\n  If this U.N. resolution is passed as it currently stands, we can \nexpect the Sudanese Government to try to evade its requirements and \nagreements without a single consequence. Should that happen, the toll \nof the genocide in Darfur will continue to mount--in lives lost, in \npersons displaced, and in fundamental human values that the \ninternational community has failed to uphold.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I call up my amendment at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Hatch, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2530.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate now has before it the \nreauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, otherwise \nknown as CHIP. Pending is a substitute amendment that reflects the bill \nreported by the Finance Committee by a vote of 17 to 4, a strong \nbipartisan vote.\n  The bipartisan package Finance Committee colleagues and I crafted \nwill give millions more American children the healthy start they need \nto lead a long, productive life.\n  Behind me is a photo of Abigale. Who is Abigale? Abigale is from \nMissoula, MT. At the time the photo was taken she was 4 years old. \nAbigale has two siblings, and they live with their mother and father. \nAll three of the children participate in the Montana Children's Health \nInsurance Program. When Abigale was 2\\1/2\\ years old, she fell down, \nsplit her head open and had to have nine stitches. Her medical care was \ncovered by the Children's Health Insurance Program. That same year her \n6-year-old brother broke his arm twice and CHIP paid for the surgery, \nthe hospital stay, and all of the medical care he received.\n  Fawn, Abigale's mother, is thankful to have CHIP not only for the \nemergency care it provides but also it helps immunize children against \nchildhood diseases and allows them to get the checkups they need for \nschool each year.\n  Not having health insurance clearly affects a child's life. Uninsured \nkids do not go to the doctor. They do not have checkups. They remain \nundiagnosed for serious childhood conditions such as asthma and \ndiabetes. They do not have vaccinations, and they put themselves and \ntheir schoolmates at risk for serious illnesses. Kids without health \ninsurance do not have eye exams and are less likely to get glasses, and \noften cannot see the chalkboard at school. They are not diagnosed with \nlearning disabilities, and they struggle through their classes. Kids \nwho do not have insurance do not see the dentist. They do not get their \ncavities filled. They do not get braces, and they risk serious illness \ndue to poor dental health. Adequate health care creates a critical \nfoundation for a healthy life.\n  No one wants innocent children to suffer. Investing in children's \nhealth is the compassionate choice, but it is more than that. Insuring \nour children is a smart economic investment in our Nation's future. \nWhy? Because it is the only choice, if we wish to imbue future \ngenerations with strong minds and healthy bodies. It is quite simple. \nHealth insurance has a direct effect on a child's performance at \nschool. Healthy children are more likely to go to school, and they are \nmore likely to do well in school. Then they are more likely to become \nproductive members of the workforce.\n  Children with health insurance are less likely to receive expensive \nemergency room care. Parents of children with health insurance are less \nlikely to miss days at work to care for their sick children. When \nAmerica insures our children, we are all better off, we all benefit.\n  Health insurance is especially important to the success of minority \npopulations. African-American, Hispanic, and Native American children \nare all less likely to have health insurance. They are more likely to \nbe poor. Providing affordable coverage is one of the best ways to \nreduce the gap for these kids.\n  CHIP has already helped to narrow racial and ethnic disparities in \naccess to care among low-income children. But we can do better. We can \ncontinue to narrow that gap.\n  Health insurance is also a key ingredient to alleviating child \npoverty. Low-income families without insurance often get stuck in a \nbitter cycle of medical debt. Parents struggling to make ends meet \nshould not have to choose between buying asthma inhalers for their \nchildren and putting dinner on the table.\n  So I hope my fellow Senators will make the right choice, the only \nchoice. I hope they will join me in making our children's future, and \nAmerica's future, a brighter one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this debate is not just about extending \nhealth care to our children. It is about our national priorities. It is \nabout who we are as a nation. It is about which side we are on.\n  For the last 6 years, we have had a President who has insisted, as \none of his major priorities, on more and more tax breaks for the very \nwealthiest people in our country. People who are worth millions of \ndollars and people who are worth billions of dollars have, \ncollectively, received hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in \ntax breaks. But when it comes to those people most in need, those \npeople who are most vulnerable, including the children of our country--\nthe kids who are 2 or 3 years of age--who have health care needs, this \nPresident, tragically and embarrassingly, has not been there. If you \nare wealthy and powerful, he is there. If you are a child and \nvulnerable, AWOL--he is not listening. In fact, he has been in \nopposition.\n  It is no secret to the American people that our current health care \nsystem is disintegrating. Today, 46 million Americans, including over 9 \nmillion children, have no health insurance whatsoever, and tens of \nmillions more are underinsured, with high premiums and copayments. \nCosts are soaring every single year, and small businesses in my State \nof Vermont and throughout this country are no longer, in many cases, \nable to offer any health insurance. Throughout the country today \nworkers are being asked to pay a higher and higher percentage of the \ncost of their health insurance, and many of them cannot afford to do \nthat because health insurance premiums have been rising four times \nfaster than workers' earnings since the year 2000.\n  In the midst of all of that--more and more uninsured, costs soaring--\nwe end up spending twice as much per capita\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\non health care as any other country and remain--we remain--the only \nNation in the industrialized world that does not guarantee health care \nto all our people as a right of citizenship. Today, we are debating \nabout whether we should expand the SCHIP program to 3 million more \nchildren. But all over the industrialized world, every child in those \ncountries has health care as a right of citizenship.\n  Despite the over $2 trillion--$2 trillion--we now spend on health \ncare--money which, to a significant degree, goes to enrich the \ninsurance companies and the drug companies--our health status measures, \nincluding infant mortality and life expectancy, rank among the lowest \nof developed countries. We spend twice as much as other countries per \nperson on health care--with over 9 million children who have no health \ninsurance--and yet health status measures are lower than many of our \nallies around the world.\n  There is no question but that in the face of rising costs and a \nbroken health care system, we need to make fundamental changes in the \nway we do health care in this country. We need to develop a cost-\neffective national health care program which guarantees health care to \nall our people, and study after study suggests we can do that without \nspending any more than we currently spend on our wasteful and \nbureaucratic nonsystem. That is what we have to do, and that is what I \nwill fight for as long as I am in the Senate.\n  Today, we are discussing, despite what some may say, what is, in \nfact, a modest proposal--a modest proposal. We are discussing an \nexpansion of the SCHIP program, which would expand health care to some \n3 million more children. Over 9 million American children today are \nuninsured, and all we are doing today is saying: Let's expand health \ninsurance to one-third of those children. If this bill were passed in 5 \nminutes, two-thirds of the uninsured children would remain uninsured, \nand in the United States of America we can do a lot better than that.\n  As Chairman Baucus has said, as Senator Olympia Snowe said last \nnight, investing in the health insurance of our children is a good \ninvestment. It is cost effective. Today throughout this country there \nare children who are unseen by medical professionals. They are \ndeveloping illnesses which are undetected. Those illnesses become worse \nas they get older. They end up in the hospital. It costs significant \nsums of money to treat these young people, as they age, in hospitals, \nwhen we could have eased their suffering and saved money by getting to \ntheir illnesses when they were young, if they had the opportunity to \nsee a doctor.\n  As Chairman Baucus also mentioned, there is the issue of dental care \nin this country. In my own State of Vermont and throughout this \ncountry, there are millions and millions of young people who simply \ncannot gain access to a dentist who have teeth rotting in their mouths \nin the United States of America, in the year 2007. That is not \nacceptable to me, and I hope it is not acceptable to my colleagues in \nthe Senate.\n  Given this sorry state of affairs regarding health care in this \ncountry in general, and the needs of our kids in particular, I find it \nironic we are having any debate about increasing health insurance \ncoverage for children under the SCHIP program.\n\n  Let me be very clear, in terms of providing health insurance to our \nkids, I would go--and will go--a lot further than this legislation. I \nhave, in fact, recently introduced S. 1564, the All Healthy Children \nAct of 2007, which would provide health insurance to every child in \nAmerica. That is where I think we should be going.\n  Some people, including the President of the United States, are \nsaying: My goodness, this bill will cost $35 billion over a 5-year \nperiod; we can't afford that.\n  But I find it ironic that many of those same people, including the \nPresident of the United States, believe, among other things--among many \nother things--that we can afford to repeal entirely the estate tax, \nwhich would benefit only the top three-tenths of 1 percent of the \nAmerican people. The very richest people in this country would, if the \nPresident had his way, receive $1 trillion in tax breaks over 20 years. \nThat is $1 trillion in tax breaks over 20 years going to the wealthiest \nthree-tenths of 1 percent of the American people. That we can afford. \nBut when it comes to spending $35 billion over a 5-year period for the \nchildren of our country, we do not have the money.\n  I find it ironic, if we repealed the inheritance tax, one family, the \nWalton family who owns Wal-Mart, would receive $32 billion in tax \nbreaks. Yet we are trying to insure 3 million children today for $35 \nbillion. So $32 billion for one family; $35 billion for 3 million \nchildren.\n  To my mind, what this debate is about is getting our priorities right \nas a nation. I am getting a little bit tired of hearing many of my \ncolleagues, and hearing this President, talk about family values, when \nwe have almost 10 million children in this country uninsured. If you \nare interested in family values, you are interested in the future of \nthis country, you are interested in the children of this country.\n  This is a modest proposal. It is a first-step proposal, and it should \nbe passed and passed immediately.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might ask how much time the Senator from \nNew Jersey would like to consume. I very much appreciate and admire him \nand thank the Senator from New Jersey for speaking on this amendment. \nIt would be helpful to know how long he would be speaking. He can have \nwhatever time he wishes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I would say between 15 and 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey be recognized to speak for 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, not only for making the time \navailable but, more importantly, for his leadership on this critical \nissue of insuring the Nation's children. There is no stronger voice in \nthe Senate on this issue. I am incredibly proud to have worked with \nSenator Baucus, someone who is keenly interested in this program. I \nappreciate what he has done in bringing a solid bill to the floor.\n  I rise today on behalf of our Nation's children and working families. \nI am reminded every day when I come to the Senate that it is my \nprivilege--privilege--to represent these individuals in the Senate, and \nwith every vote I cast in this great Chamber, I try to always ensure I \nam protecting and serving our hard-working families.\n  This week, we are considering a bill to reauthorize our children's \nhealth program--a program that affects millions of families across the \ncountry. This week, every vote--every vote--we cast will have a direct \nimpact on the health and well-being of our Nation's children and their \nfamilies.\n  I cannot overstate how important and how successful this program has \nbeen. It currently provides health care to 6.6 million children. \nSometimes I think it is important to remember exactly what it means to \nprovide health care for children. It is the immunization shot before \nschool begins. It is a well-child doctor visit that catches early signs \nof cancer. It is the emergency care coverage after a car accident. It \nis the new eyeglass prescription to finally see the blackboard. It is \nan x ray for a broken ankle and a prescription medication for a strep \nthroat. It is about ensuring the well-being of that child so they can \nfulfill their God-given potential.\n  Proper coverage can be the difference between life and death, between \nhealth and sickness, and between compassion and heartlessness.\n  In the next few days, we have choices to make, and I hope each of my \ncolleagues ask themselves one question before they cast their vote: Is \nthis good for our Nation's children? Because that should be the only \nquestion and the only goal.\n  I am proud of my home State of New Jersey for always keeping this \ngoal in its mind. Our program, New Jersey FamilyCare, currently covers \nover 126,000 children and 80,000 parents. These are working families \nwho don't qualify for Medicaid but can't afford\n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\nprivate coverage, and they don't get health care at their job. They \nwork at some of the toughest jobs our State has to offer. They get up \nevery day, 5 days a week--sometimes more--to try to make ends meet for \ntheir families, but they don't have health insurance. These are \nfamilies who, without the children's health program, would yet be \nanother American family cast into the ocean of the uninsured. This \nprogram saves them from that fate.\n\n  Let me take a moment to humanize what we are talking about, because \nwe talk about these programs in the abstract. They are about lives; \nthey are about people. Elizabeth Geronikos relied on the children's \nhealth program for her necessary allergy and asthma medication when her \nfather suddenly lost his job. Jonathan Hale, who discovered a cyst in \nhis brain, was able to get medical attention that his family would not \notherwise have been able to afford because of the children's health \ninsurance program. The Cannon family no longer has to worry about their \nson Jason, who now has a constant supply of asthma medication and has \nsuffered no serious asthma attacks since being on the Children's Health \nInsurance Program. This is truly a life-changing, if not a lifesaving, \nprogram.\n  But there are also stories of children who were not so lucky. Devante \nJohnson, who depended on Medicaid for his cancer treatment, died, not \nfor failed chemotherapy, but because his paperwork was never processed. \nHe was 14 years old. Deamonte Driver died because he did not receive \ntreatment for an abscessed tooth--something that, if treated early, \nwould clearly not have been fatal. He was 12 years old. These stories \nare heartbreaking not only because a child's life was lost but also \nbecause it could have been prevented.\n  We must ensure that no more children go without treatment they need \nand that no more lives are lost. Our job as Senators is to protect \nthese children. What greater honor and responsibility do we have but \nprotecting our children? As a father, I can't imagine the anguish I \nwould feel if I could not provide health care for my son and daughter. \nThus, as a Senator, I feel it is our obligation to provide health care \nfor every single child. I strongly believe we have a responsibility to \nensure that no child in America goes to bed at night without proper \nhealth care and treatment, and that is why this reauthorization is so \ncrucial.\n  Under this bill, over the next 5 years we would be able to continue \ncovering the 6.6 million children currently enrolled, and we would be \nable to reach out and cover an additional 3.2 million children. So the \nanswer to the question, Is this good for the Nation's children, is \nclearly yes, especially for those 3.2 million children waiting to \nreceive care. That answer is a resounding ``yes.'' There are even more \nwhom we must work to cover.\n  I want to ask my colleagues who say they may not support this bill, \nWhere are the values we talk about in this institution? Where are the \nfamily values voices that so often are heard in this Chamber? Now is \nnot the time to be silent. Now is when families need you most. Now is \nthe time to stand by your values and stand up to protect our future \ngeneration.\n  To these colleagues, I wish to take a moment to answer some questions \nabout New Jersey's effort to reach out and enroll more children. Over \nthe past few weeks, New Jersey has received a lot of attention for \ncovering children up to 350 percent of the Federal poverty level. In \nour regard, we think we are doing the right thing, and the statistics \nprove we are right. I can understand that some might think these \nfamilies have enough money to afford private insurance, but for New \nJersey families, that is simply not the case. New Jersey families face \nhigher living costs, and they get less return on their Federal dollar, \nso we cannot set a policy that suggests that one size fits all.\n  I did some of the math which I want to share with my colleagues. At \nthe top end, a working New Jersey family, their family budget, shows \nthey have about $4,428 in income. Housing in New Jersey is incredibly \nexpensive, about $1,500 a month. Food for that family is $547; \ntransportation to get to work, or if they happen to have a car to pay \nfor their commutes back and forth, with the high gas prices, $820; \nchild care, if they are not in school, and health insurance. I looked \nup under the Bureau of Banking and Insurance what is the average health \ninsurance coverage for a family a month--a month. The statistic on the \nWeb site is $2,065. So that puts this family, if they have to be forced \nto purchase health insurance, in the negative $1,200 a month. That \nmeans they can't make ends meet. This doesn't take into account any \nunforeseen circumstance on the family budget. So it doesn't end up \nadding up. That is why this program is so important.\n  That is why, when New Jersey enrolls children up to 350 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level, they do it because without this coverage, we \nwould have thousands more children more without health insurance. \nPurchasing a private plan, no matter what tax incentives you give--I \nhear some of our colleagues talk about giving a $5,000 maximum credit \nper family. Well, that is great. That buys us 2\\1/2\\ months of \ninsurance. What do we do for the rest of the year for that family? Do \nwe roll the dice on their health care? I don't think so--not when we as \nan institution have some of the best health care in the Nation.\n  I am grateful to the Finance Committee for recognizing what we \nalready knew on a bipartisan basis: The one-size-fits-all approach \ndoesn't work. Remember, our objective is to cover more children, not \nless. I can't believe I even need to mention what I am about to say, \nbut in light of some of the comments I have heard over the past few \nweeks about the President saying: Well, let them go to the emergency \nroom, I think it might be necessary to look at what happens to children \nwithout health insurance and how they suffer serious consequences.\n  Research has shown that uninsured children not only miss regular \ncheckups and visits to the doctors for less serious conditions that \nultimately become far more serious in their personal health and far \nmore consequential and far more expensive, but they also receive less \nthan lower quality care. In fact, uninsured children admitted to a \nhospital due to injuries were twice--twice--as likely to die while in \nthe hospital as their insured counterparts, and that is simply \nunacceptable.\n  There is no morality if upon hearing this, every Member of this \nChamber does not do everything in his or her power to cover more \nchildren. It is, I believe, a moral obligation. I often hear about the \nvalue of life and I cherish it as well. Now is the time to honor the \nvalue of the lives of these children.\n\n  Another way New Jersey has been successful in covering more children \nis because we also cover low-income and working parents. In New Jersey, \nwe have found a strong correlation between enrollment of parents and \nenrollment of children. After the State implemented its parent \nexpansion in 2000, not only did it experience rapid enrollment of \nparents, but it also saw a significant increase in the enrollment of \nchildren, which is our goal. In 2002, the State stopped enrolling \nparents, and what happened? As parent enrollment began to fall, \nchildren's enrollment began to level off. Once the State began \nreenrolling parents in 2005, children's coverage began to rise again. \nThere is clear evidence that by allowing those States that choose to do \nso to cover parents, you increase the number of children who have \nhealth coverage, achieving our ultimate goal of covering more children \nand, by the way, we end up covering more Americans.\n  To further prove this point, former Congressional Budget Office \nDirector Peter Orszag recently stated that:\n\n       Restricting eligibility to parents does have an effect on \n     take up among children, in part because when you pick up the \n     parent you are more likely to pick up the child.\n\n  Thus, if we stop covering parents under the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, as some in the Congress and the White House want to \ndo, you end up covering fewer children.\n  In fact, Peter Orszag said:\n\n       For every three of four parents you lose, you lose 1 or 2 \n     kids.\n\n  Based on this, in New Jersey, if we were forced to disenroll all of \nour parents, over 40,000 children would lose their coverage. This \ndoesn't help us achieve our goal of covering more children.\n  So again, we have to ask: Is covering parents of eligible children \ngood for our Nation's children? The answer is clearly yes.\n  As I said at the beginning of my statement, I fully support the \nlegislation we are considering today. Senator\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\nBaucus has done an excellent job. I appreciate the bipartisan vote of \nthe committee. I am proud of the reauthorization bill because of what \nit prioritizes, but also because I know how hard it was to reach this \ncompromise. This is a bipartisan bill that Members of both sides of the \naisle support. I know it has taken long nights and serious conversation \nand many difficult decisions to reach where we are today. I appreciate \nagain Senator Baucus's incredible efforts, the members of the \ncommittee, as well as Majority Leader Reid, for their efforts on behalf \nof the program.\n  That being said, I simply want to say that if I had my druthers, I \nwould have sought to achieve a greater height. I understand that so \nwould many of the Members who actually created the compromise. I would \nhave liked to have seen, as I did as a member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, $50 billion provided. I worked hard to make sure we had that \nin the budget resolution. I know that is the funding that will be \nnecessary to reach out to the 6 million eligible but uninsured children \nin America, and it is the funding these children deserve.\n  Another area of major concern is the lack of language to provide \nhealth care for legal immigrant children and pregnant women in the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. I am a proud cosponsor of the \nbipartisan Legal Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act, also \nknown as ICHIA, which would have repealed the morally objectionable law \nthat prohibits new legal immigrants from accessing Medicaid and CHIP \nuntil they have lived in the United States for 5 years. I think we \nshould have the flexibility for States to make that decision.\n  I am proud that in my home State of New Jersey, they have taken it \nupon themselves to use 100 percent of State funds to cover over 8,000 \nlegal immigrant pregnant women and children at a cost of over $22 \nmillion. The State has temporarily fixed the problem, but I had hoped \nCongress would do the same. How can you tell a 7-year-old child with an \near infection he has to wait 5 years to see the doctor? How can you \ntell a child who may have the incipiency of some incredibly terrible \ndisease you have to wait 5 years to go see the doctor? It seems to me \nwe can't bar these families from accessing our health care supply \nsimply because they haven't lived here long enough. During the \nimmigration debate, our colleagues emphasized the difference between \nthose who are here legally and those who are not. So it is appalling to \nme that a legal immigrant child--one whose family waited their time to \ncome to this country, came here legally, obeyed the law, are working, \npaying taxes--is still subject to the lash of those people who, even \nfor a child who is here legally, seem to punish. It seems to me that is \nsimply wrong.\n  Let me close by addressing the President's veto threat. He is \nbasically opposed to this bill because he says it covers too many \nchildren and families. I don't know how more outrageous and \nunacceptable a statement can be. I find it embarrassing that some in \nWashington--those who have the best health care coverage in the world--\nwould propose to cut America's neediest families--neediest families who \nwork hard every day, because if you are poor, you are on Medicaid. \nThese are families who get up and work hard, don't have enough to pay \ninsurance, don't have coverage through work, and can't afford it. Yet \nthe President of the United States, who has the best coverage in the \nworld, and the Vice President of the United States, whom we saw \nrecently in the hospital--happy that everything went well for him--have \nno worries. They have no worries every night--and for them to say these \nchildren are less worthy than them. If the President had his way, over \n110,000 New Jerseyans would lose their coverage, and tens of thousands \nmore across the Nation would lose their coverage. I find that morally \nreprehensible.\n  I find it ironic that the President doesn't want to cover parents \nwith this program, considering the fact that since 2001, it was his \nadministration that granted 24 waivers for adult coverage in 15 States, \nincluding my home State of New Jersey. In fact, when a waiver was \nissued in 2003 to New Jersey, the administrator of CMS, the Federal \nagency that supervises the program, said:\n\n       New Jersey is setting an example of how Federal waivers can \n     help them cut into the numbers of citizens with no health \n     coverage.\n\n  Tom Scully, Administrator of CMS, the Federal agency overseeing this \nprogram, said we are setting an example.\n  In 2004, President Bush made a promise to insure all of the Nation's \nchildren, but his latest proposal would only serve to cut children and \nincrease the number of uninsured. Rather than adding to the ranks of \nthe uninsured, we should be working together to expand access to even \nmore children and families. Mr. President, it is time to make good on \nyour word.\n  It is time to make good on your promise. It is time to cover all \nchildren. At the end of the day, this bill is about low-income and \nworking families getting much needed care. This is about our Nation's \nchildren having access to a doctor for preventive care and receiving \ntreatments for more serious conditions. This is about the health and \nsafety of current and future generations.\n  There is only one question left to be asked: Is this good for our \nNation's children? The answer is yes.\n  Let me close with a great Republican I admire, Abraham Lincoln. He \nsaid:\n\n       A child is a person who is going to carry on what you have \n     started. He [and I add she] is going to sit where you are \n     sitting, and when you are gone, attend to those things which \n     you think are important. You may adopt all the policies you \n     please, but how they are carried out depends on him. He will \n     assume control of your cities, states, and nations. All your \n     books are going to be judged, praised, or condemned by him. \n     The fate of humanity is in his hands. So it might be well to \n     pay him some attention.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to now pay attention to our children and support \nthis important bill. It is important our children. It is for our \nfamilies. It is in pursuit of our values, and it is for the well-being \nof our country.\n  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  (Ms. KLOBUCHAR assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I highly compliment the Senator from New \nJersey. He is a tireless advocate to make this legislation even better \nthan it was, especially on behalf of parents. There are other groups in \nhis State that are very deserving. I thank him publicly. He has talked \nto me many times very earnestly, with a real desire to make sure the \npeople in his State are adequately taken care of. I thank the Senator \nfor his tireless advocacy.\n  I inquire of the Senator from Arkansas, roughly how much time does \nshe wish to consume?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I hope I can have somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Arkansas be \nrecognized to speak for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I thank Chairman Baucus for his \ntireless effort here in really portraying what I think is a tremendous \npriority for so many of us in the Senate and certainly in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  As a mother of twin boys--and I know our Presiding Officer is a \nmother of a daughter who is a year older than my boys--I know all too \nwell of the importance of reliable health insurance coverage for \nchildren. My husband and I have experienced the sleepless nights \nlooking after a sick child. But we also have the comfort of knowing \nthat when dawn comes, we have the opportunity, through health \ninsurance, to seek out health care through a pediatrician or, if it \nshould be worse, to be able to go to the emergency room and know we are \ncovered, to know we can seek that health care for our children when \nthey need it the most, with the confidence that with that health \ninsurance we can continue to care for their needs.\n  In situations such as these, health insurance coverage is critical \nnot only to the lifelong health of a child but also to a family's peace \nof mind. I think that is what we are about here today--our ability as \nSenators to be able to step outside the box of being a Senator and \nreally think about what it means to be a hard-working American, to be a \nparent, and to not just think of what it means to us and our families \nas Federal employees and what we have access to in health care but \ntranslating that to the needs of all hard-working\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\nAmericans and to understand how important it is to them and to their \nchildren too.\n  We have to, in this debate, step outside and put ourselves in the \nshoes of the hard-working Americans who need health insurance for their \nchildren. That peace of mind should not only belong to those families \nwho can afford private health insurance; it should also belong to \nworking families who are struggling to make ends meet in today's world, \nwho are the strength of the fabric of this Nation, those hard-working \nfamilies who are going to jobs day in and day out--and sometimes more \nthan one job--to keep the needs of their families, as was listed by the \nSenator from New Jersey, to make sure their families stay whole.\n  Coming to the bottom of that list and recognizing how expensive \nhealth care costs are for their children, we need to make sure the \nfabric of this Nation stays strong. We do so by not only supporting \nthose working families and their children but by establishing \npriorities in this country. That is why I rise to speak on behalf of \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, a Federal-\nState partnership which today provides much needed health care coverage \nfor more than 6 million children across this great country.\n  In conjunction with Medicaid, CHIP has been tremendously successful \nin reducing the number of uninsured children in my State and across our \ncountry. Since the program's inception 10 years ago, the number of \nchildren without health care coverage has dropped by one-third. That is \nsomething we can be proud of and that we can build on.\n  During that time, I am proud that Arkansas has become a national \nleader in reducing its number of uninsured children from over 20 \npercent in 1997 to 10 percent today. Now, nearly 65,000 of Arkansas' \nchildren currently receive coverage through CHIP or, as we know it in \nArkansas, ARKids First.\n  Despite this success, an estimated 9 million children remain \nuninsured, nearly two-thirds of whom are already eligible for CHIP or \nfor Medicaid nationwide--9 million children, Madam President. Those \nchildren belong to parents just like us. Their parents care for them \njust as we try to care for our children--yet not having the comfort of \nknowing their health care needs could be and should be covered.\n  I am certainly proud that the Senate Finance Committee has recently \ntaken steps to reach more of these children, and I do wish to commend \nChairman Baucus and Senators Grassley, Rockefeller, and Hatch, as well \nas their staffs, for their incredible dedication, the vision and \nleadership they have shown on this issue, their tireless energy \nin sticking with coming together to bring about a compromise--a much \nneeded compromise--and the extraordinary effort they have put forth \nparticularly over the past few months, which has made renewal of CHIP \nmuch more of a reality for America's families.\n\n  The CHIP reauthorization package that was overwhelmingly approved in \nour Finance Committee--by a vote of 17 to 4--applies the lessons of the \npast 10 years and builds upon the success of the program by giving \nStates more of the tools they need while preserving their flexibility \nto strengthen their program and ultimately cover more children. In \ndoing so, it would provide an additional $35 billion over 5 years that \nwill allow States to preserve coverage for the children who are \ncurrently enrolled, while reaching an additional 3.2 million uninsured \nlow-income children.\n  This proposal would also provide much needed funding to States for \noutreach and enrollment efforts to reach many of those who are \ncurrently uninsured and yet eligible. It also takes steps to ensure \nthat they get a healthy start by providing care for pregnant women and \nestablishing pediatric quality measures to improve the level and \nefficiency of the care they do receive. How important that is as we \nhave begun in this country to look at the quality measures of health \ncare, particularly for our elderly. Why is it not equally important to \nlook at the quality measures for the pediatric care that goes to our \nchildren?\n  I have long supported improving access to health care coverage for \npregnant women, not only because it is vital to the health of mothers \nand infants, but it also often reduces future health care costs. What \nan incredible return on our money--to see expectant mothers going full-\nterm to deliver a child that has a much greater opportunity to perform, \nto be healthy, and to be less costly later in life due to health care \nneeds. In fact, it was reported in 2005 that the socioeconomic costs--\nmedical, educational, and lost productivity--associated with preterm \nbirth in the United States was at least $26.2 billion. Every year, more \nthan 500,000 infants are born prematurely, an increasing number that \nnow affects nearly one out of every eight babies.\n  This is of particular concern to me because, in recent reports, more \nthan 13 percent of births in our State of Arkansas were premature, \nranking it among the States with the highest incidence of preterm \nbabies. So many of us have been faced with those choices. I know when I \nserved in the House of Representatives and my husband and I were so \nexcited to receive the news that we were expecting twins, I also \nreceived the news that at my age, and certainly the work environment I \nwas in and all of the pressures, I was also at risk for a premature \ndelivery. I had the wonderful opportunity to make a decision that I \nwould not run for reelection and that I could minimize my job in order \nto do everything within my power to bring those children into this \nworld in a safe manner.\n  I look across this great country, and not all working mothers have \nthat opportunity. They don't have those choices to be able to step \naside and do everything they possibly can with the health care they \nreceive to bring their babies into this world in the healthiest \nfashion. One thing we can do is to provide them the prenatal care they \nneed and the advice and consultation to be able to do what they can to \nensure those babies are delivered after a full term.\n  By taking needed steps to improve access to care for pregnant women, \nI am confident we can make strides to improve health outcomes for them \nand for their children. If, in fact, we don't want to do it for the \nsake of bringing healthy babies into this world, who are going to be \nfuture leaders of this country, we should do it as an investment. The \nlong-term investment of a healthier child being born makes so much more \nsense than the long-term cost of a premature delivery and the health \ncare needs that child would have for the rest of his or her life.\n  The Finance Committee proposal would also provide the Federal \nauthority and resources to invest in the development and testing of \nquality measures for children's health care. Of the 146 medical schools \nin this country, every one of them has a department in pediatrics. We \ncan make an incredible investment in quality measures that would give \nus not only the outcome we want but also the cost savings in overall \nhealth care we so much desire.\n  This provision would help ensure that States and other payers, \nproviders, and consumers have the clinical quality measures they need \nto assess and improve the quality and performance of children's health \ncare services.\n  Additionally, the bill would allow some States to use income-\neligibility information from other Federal programs, such as school \nlunch programs, to speed up the enrollment of eligible children into \nCHIP or Medicaid. The Senator from New Mexico has done so much hard \nwork on making good common sense out of the mounds and mounds of \npaperwork people already have to fill out, using the knowledge we \nalready have and those mounds of paperwork to get those children \nenrolled in the program for which they already qualify. It would \nsimplify the administrative process for States and certainly reduce the \npaperwork burdens on our families.\n\n  The bill would also provide greater access to much needed dental care \nfor lower income children and would ensure that children enrolled in \nCHIP would have access to mental health care that is on par with the \nlevel of medical and surgical care they are currently provided.\n  As we look at our children and their growth, understanding the \nunbelievable essentials in dental care, not only so our children can \nget the nutrition they need but they can pay attention in school, they \ncan get the education they need, which allows them to grow and be a \npart of this incredible Nation\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\nin a productive way, the success of CHIP over the past 10 years is \nitself a great example of the things we can accomplish when we reach \nout across the aisle, when we work in a bipartisan way, when we come \ntogether on our priorities and put aside the partisan differences.\n  This bipartisan proposal we are considering today is another. We \nshould all agree that providing health care for our children is \ncertainly one area where partisan politics should be placed aside. \nThere is no room for partisan politics as we address our children. \nAfter all, it is a moral issue, an investment in our Nation's most \nprecious resource--our children; an investment in a future of our \ncountry, its leadership, and its productivity. Who can disagree with \nthat?\n  As we move forward together to reauthorize this successful program, I \nam hopeful we can do so in the same bipartisan spirit that was \ndemonstrated in the creation of this program, the 10-year \nimplementation of this program, and in the recent reauthorization of \nthis program in the Finance Committee.\n  It is unfortunate the President and the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices feel differently. In fact, their proposal to increase the CHIP \nfunding by only $5 billion over the next 5 years falls so short of the \nfunding needed to simply maintain coverage of those currently enrolled \nin the program. To justify their proposal, the administration actually \nclaimed the number of uninsured children in our Nation was only 20 \npercent of the estimates calculated by the nonpartisan CBO.\n  Instead of forcing over a million children--a million children--to be \ndropped from their current health insurance provider, shouldn't we all \nagree that at the very least absolutely no child should lose coverage \nas a result of reauthorization?\n  The President has been adamant about leaving no child behind when it \ncomes to their education, but shouldn't we apply this to their health \ncare as well? Shouldn't we recognize the reason, or a part of the \nreason, our No Child Left Behind in education has been less productive \nis because we failed to provide the resources--the much needed \nresources--to implement good policies, basic policies? It is fine to \ntalk about these things, but if we don't put our money where our mouth \nis, the health care doesn't get to the children who need it.\n  Moreover, shouldn't we all move forward in covering as many of the 9 \nmillion uninsured children we possibly can; finding the middle ground, \nas we have done in the Finance Committee? I wholeheartedly believe so, \nand that is why I rise in strong support of this legislation.\n  Some of my colleagues have raised concerns about our efforts to \nexpand this successful program. They have argued the $35 billion \ncompromise that was reached in the Finance Committee is too much money. \nYou know what. It is going to cost us something to cover more children. \nLet us take a step back and get some perspective on how much money we \nare actually talking about.\n  Our current proposal to reauthorize CHIP provides a total of $60 \nbillion over 5 years--$25 billion in the baseline, with an increase of \n$35 billion. In contrast, our operations in Iraq are now estimated to \ncost taxpayers $10 billion per month. So for the amount of money, \nnonbudgeted money, we now spend in Iraq every 6 months, we can cover an \nestimated 10 million lower-income children with much needed health care \nfor 5 years--5 years. We are talking about money that is completely \noffset--a program that is completely paid for.\n  How you spend your money--and this goes for families and for \nGovernment--tends to reflect your values and your priorities. We all \nhave to look at where our priorities are in our own family, and we as \nSenators and stewards of this land and this great country and its \nresources have to set priorities as well, and they should reflect our \nvalues--our values and our priorities. So I ask my colleagues today: \nWhat could be a bigger priority than the well-being of our Nation's \nmost precious resource, our children?\n  Look at our families, the families who are the fabric of this \ncountry. One of the things they need the most is time--time to be a \nfamily, to sit down to dinner with their children, to be able to go to \na PTA meeting or a parent-teacher conference, to take a small vacation, \nto care for an aging parent. They need time to do that. It is not easy \nto find that time. If you are a single parent, perhaps a single mom, \nbut even if you are a working family, a lower income working family, \nworking two or three jobs to be able to hit that budget the Senator \nfrom New Jersey talks about, to make sure you can hit all those issues \nyou have to deal with, whether it is rent or groceries or certainly any \ntype of health care you could access, it takes time--time away from our \nfamilies, the time needed to build strong families, to keep their \nchildren whole and focused on the good values we want our children to \nhave.\n  Minimum wage was a great example. Minimum wage was much needed, with \nover 10 years of not having seen that increase. What an important role \nit plays in providing our families greater time to be a family. At a \ntime when more and more Americans are struggling to find affordable \nhealth care, CHIP has allowed us to make coverage more accessible for \nmillions of children, coverage that is critical to the lifelong health \nof a child and to a family's peace of mind. I urge each and every one \nof my colleagues to explore your own conscience, not just thinking \nabout your family but thinking about the millions of American families \nout there today who want nothing less for their children than what we \nwant for ours.\n  Let's set aside partisan influences and support this critical effort \nto invest in the health care of our children, not only for the future \nof our Nation but for the well-being of millions of American children \nin working-class, lower income families. They are depending on us, the \nstewards of this body, the stewards of this country, and it is time we \nfulfill our commitment to them. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting legislation to expand health care coverage for children.\n  I have been proud to work with Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley \nand others in this effort, and I certainly commend them for their \nleadership and good work. I look to this body to stand up and to show \nwho it is we are and what it is we are made of on behalf of America's \nchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before she leaves the floor, let me thank \nmy seatmate on the Senate Finance Committee for a passionate and \neloquent address on behalf of this country's children. I commend her \nfor it.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time between now \nand 12:30 be divided equally between the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, would the Chair please advise me when \nhalf the time allotted to me has been used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I wish to congratulate the majority \nleader for taking this time to bring the reauthorization of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program to the Senate floor. Since this \nprogram was created, through a bipartisan effort in 1997, the number of \nuninsured Americans has grown by millions. At the same time, the \npercentage of low-income children in the United States without health \ncare coverage has fallen by a third. So this is a remarkable \nachievement, and this program is a large share of the reason for that \nachievement.\n  The program is critically important to my home State of New Mexico. \nIt currently permits the State to cover over 14,000 low-income New \nMexicans and will play a critical role in ensuring that all low-income \nNew Mexicans have access to meaningful health care coverage. I strongly \nsupport the reauthorization we have reported from the Finance \nCommittee. Of the many issues before the Senate, I believe \nreauthorizing this legislation needs to be at the top of our list.\n  Unfortunately, there seems to be a huge gap between what the \nadministration would like to see done on this subject and what in fact \nis needed. The President has proposed such a small sum of new funding \nover the next 5 years, $1 billion per year of additional\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\nfunding, that if we were to accept that proposal, we would have a \nsignificant reduction in the size of the program and the number of \nchildren covered by the program.\n  Instead of reaching a larger percentage of the 9 million uninsured \nchildren in our Nation, the President's proposal would not add to the \nnumber of children covered. In fact, it would result in hundreds of \nthousands, if not millions, of low-income children losing their \ncoverage.\n  I also wish to commend Senator Baucus, Senator Grassley, Senator \nRockefeller, and Senator Hatch, all four of these individuals, who \nworked in a selfless and bipartisan way to come up with a proposal they \ncould embrace and they could bring to the full Senate. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates the $35 billion over 5 years \nauthorized in this legislation will fill in the shortfalls in funding \nthat have plagued the program for many years. It will allow us to \nexpand coverage to nearly 4 million additional low-income children.\n  Although I strongly support this bipartisan compromise, there are \nseveral aspects of the legislation I hope we can still strengthen as we \nmove forward. First, of course, I would like to see greater funding \nthan the $35 billion over the next 5 years that is called for in this \nlegislation. If we could go to the full $50 billion we provided for in \nthe budget resolution, and that I believe the House is trying to enact, \nwe could expand coverage to an additional 5 million children who would \nremain uninsured at the bill's current funding levels. So there are \nways we can improve this bill.\n  I am also disappointed in changes that were made to coverage for \nadult populations in this program. I will not oppose the compromises \nthat were reached on the issue, but I firmly believe the \nreauthorization program should not result in the narrowing of the \nflexibility States have had through this program to cover uninsured \npopulations, including adults. In particular, let me discuss a little \nof the rhetoric that has circulated around this subject.\n  Coverage of adults is very important to the efforts of my State and \nother States in our efforts to cover low-income parents and childless \nadults, but in fact, this program is overwhelmingly a program that is \nfocused on providing coverage to children. Less than 10 percent of the \ncoverage under the SCHIP program currently goes to adults. I believe \nthat has been somewhat taken out of context by many who have discussed \nthe issue.\n  We should also note States are relying on waivers in covering the \nadults who are covered under the program. States are relying on \nwaivers, most of which were approved and authorized in this Bush \nadministration, to cover these populations. These are not Democratic-\nproposed waivers, these are waivers a Republican administration has \napproved. Tommy Thompson, our former Secretary of Health and Human \nServices under President Bush, in his first term stated in 2005, upon \napproving New Mexico's ability to cover adult populations:\n\n       This approval means health coverage for tens of thousands \n     of uninsured New Mexico residents--including many uninsured \n     parents whose children are already covered. By giving States \n     like New Mexico greater flexibility in the way they provide \n     health care to low-income citizens, we are helping millions \n     of people across the country to gain access to quality health \n     care.\n\n  Madam President, how much time remains for my half?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me also go to one other issue \nwhich I think is important to deal with, another shortfall in this \nlegislation, and that is the failure of the program to provide dental \ncoverage.\n  According to the Children's Dental Health Project, of the 4 million \nchildren born each year in the United States, more than a quarter of \nthem will have cavities by the time they are toddlers, and more than \nhalf will have cavities by the time they reach second grade. This is \nconcentrated in low-income rural children who suffer disproportionately \nfrom these problems.\n  I believe strongly the Children's Health Insurance Program should be \nexpanded to cover dental care for children across this country, low-\nincome children. This is something we are not able to do as part of \nthis legislation, but I hope we can revisit this issue before final \naction is taken.\n  A final issue I wanted to discuss relates to important improvements \nin legislation I hope we can make for legal immigrant children and \nlegal pregnant women. Under current law, these individuals are \nprohibited from receiving most CHIP or Medicaid coverage for the first \n5 years they are resident in the United States on a legal basis. Very \noften these children and these legal pregnant women, U.S. citizen \nchildren I point out, will become eligible for CHIP and Medicaid. It is \ncounterproductive to prevent these legal immigrants from accessing \nservices at the time they become legal residents of our country.\n  Today there is a 5-year bar in place to them receiving Medicaid and \nCHIP coverage. It exists even though the vast majority of these \nimmigrants are working or are in families with working parents and are \ntherefore paying Federal and State taxes. They contribute significantly \nto the system, but they are barred from receiving the services they are \nsubsidizing. I highlight that legislation to remove this 5-year bar. I \nwant to highlight that this proposal to remove the 5-year bar has \nbipartisan support. It has passed the Senate as part of the 2003 \nMedicare Modernization Act. I hope very much that before we complete \naction and send the bill to the President, we can deal with this issue \nhere.\n  I urge each Member of the Senate to focus on what is the important \nwork that we can accomplish in the Senate, how we can help the lives of \nchildren growing up in this country, and how we can make them more \nproductive citizens in the future. Expanding this health care coverage \nto cover more children is obviously the first and best thing we can do. \nI hope very much we can pass this bill, go to conference with the \nHouse, and come up with a bill the President can be persuaded to sign.\n  Again, I congratulate the Finance Committee for the good work they \nhave done bringing the legislation to the full Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I also extend my commendations and \nthanks to Senators Baucus and Grassley for producing this bill. This \nbill is a long step forward. Although I think it is quite apparent that \nwe need even more than this generous attempt to meet our needs, the \nfact is, it is a very good bill. But it is surprising to me that we \neven have to debate this bill.\n  As we stand here, there are 9 million kids in the United States \nwithout health insurance; 250,000 of them live in my State of New \nJersey. Every day that we wait to reauthorize and expand the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program we risk more children's illnesses and even \npermit them to die because they have no health care.\n  In 2010 there are going to be more than 83 million children, from \nnewborns to 19-year-olds, growing up in America. We have an obligation \nto make sure those boys and girls have health insurance so they can see \ntheir doctor, get a prescription, or visit the hospital if they need \nto. That is exactly what the CHIP, Children's Health Insurance Program, \nhelps them do. It will ensure that kids have insurance to get regular \ncheckups, to pay for emergencies, or to fight illnesses such as \ndiabetes and other illnesses that afflict children terribly in their \nlives.\n  Children without insurance are twice as likely to die from injuries \nwhile they stay in the hospital than children who have insurance, and \n12 percent of children either delay getting care or do not get any care \nat all because their families cannot pay for it. It is simply not \nright. It is those children who need this program the most, but this \nvital children's health program is set to expire on September 30, just \n2 months from now.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is the only way that 6 \nmillion of America's children can afford health insurance. Their \nparents are typically hard-working people, but they simply cannot \nafford expensive private insurance, and they make too much money to \nqualify for Medicaid.\n  For example, in New Jersey, our State program helps to keep 126,000 \nlow-income children in good health. Considering how many kids the \nprogram is keeping healthy in New Jersey\n\n[[Page S10353]]\n\nand across the Nation, we would expect that President Bush would keep \nthis program healthy, but he has not, and the long-term health of this \nprogram hangs in the balance. The President's proposed budget for \nfiscal year 2008 is $10 billion short of what we need to keep our \nchildren healthy. Without more money, we cannot cover the young people \nwho currently get children's health insurance, and we cannot add any \nnew children, no matter how much they need it, to the ranks of the \ninsured.\n  By 2009, States will be facing more financial shortfalls. They will \nbe forced to cut coverage for our kids. It is unacceptable, so the \nSenate is offering a better bipartisan plan. I am proud to support the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which Senators \nBaucus and Grassley introduced and the Finance Committee approved. This \nbipartisan bill will provide $35 billion in new funding. Most of us \nwould have preferred even higher levels of funding--$50 billion--and I \nplan to support amendments to increase the funding amount. But there \ncannot be any doubt that this bipartisan compromise that we have before \nus is a crucial step forward in improving children's health. It would \nmaintain insurance for the 67 million children who are currently \ncovered, and it would insure more than 3 million new kids who do not \nhave any health insurance at all now.\n\n  It would also continue giving States flexibility in covering these \nyoungsters. We know the cost of living and the cost of health care \nvaries from State to State, and that must be a consideration in \ncoverage.\n  President Bush ran on a campaign pledge to get millions more kids on \nhealth insurance. Instead of pledging to sign the bipartisan Senate \nbill--it is incredible but true--President Bush is threatening to veto \nit. A veto means putting millions of children at risk for illness and \ndisease. It means going back on the President's pledge, and it shows, \nby his action more than his words, that the President's priorities are \nnot the same as America's.\n  President Bush's lopsided tax cuts are projected to cost $252 billion \nin 2008 alone. We spend $3 billion a week on this war, and we have \nsupplementals in between there. We have already spent more than a half \ntrillion dollars on this war. When you think about it, this bill asks \nfor only $35 billion over 5 years, $7 billion a year, to provide for \nchildren's health. It is roughly 2 months of keeping this war going.\n  In those 5 years we could keep millions of kids healthy and help them \nbecome productive members of our American society.\n  Martin Luther King said:\n\n       Of all forms of injustice, inequality in health care is the \n     most shocking and inhumane.\n\n  To let millions of children go without health insurance is an \nabsolute injustice. To stand by while they get sick and cannot afford \ncare is both shocking and inhumane. We are the wealthiest country in \nthe world. We also should be the healthiest country in the world. But \nwe do not seem to be able to tie in these domestic needs with the \nopportunity that faces us, despite the shortage of revenues because we \nhave become so generous with people who are billionaires, in terms of \ntheir taxes. Those who make $1 million a year get tax cuts that are \nsubstantial, so it does cut into our revenues. So, as I mentioned \nbefore, does the war.\n  I hope all my colleagues will support this bipartisan Baucus-Grassley \nbill.\n  Last, we plead with the President to keep his promise, not to veto it \nbut sign it, to do the best we can for our children and our country.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the quorum \ncall be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent now we recess for the \ncaucuses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10353-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think we are awaiting the arrival of \nSenator Grassley. While he is getting ready, I could not be more \npleased to have a better partner than Senator Grassley. He and I worked \nvery closely together, and he and I and Senators Hatch and Rockefeller \nworked very hard to put this current legislation together. I thank the \nSenator from Iowa for his dedication and public service. He does a good \njob.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I appreciate those kind remarks. I obviously have \ncommented many times on this floor in the last 6 years about the close \nworking relationship I have had with him and his efforts, because most \neverything that came out of our committee in the last 6 or 7 years has \nbeen bipartisan.\n  As we all know, nothing gets through the Senate that is not \nbipartisan, and so you might as well start at the committee level if \nyou are going to get anything done. I think we have gotten a lot done. \nI thank the Senator for his kind comments.\n  Obviously everybody knows we are just beginning, yesterday and today \nand probably this week, and hopefully completing work this week, on the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program. So we are going to \ncontinually refer to the acronym known as SCHIP.\n  This, as I said yesterday, is a product back from 1997, now \nsunsetting 10 years later, by a Republican-led Congress. It is a very \ntargeted program, because too often some people giving speeches on the \nfloor of this body want to leave the impression, or maybe they think it \nactually is, an entitlement program. This is not an entitlement \nprogram. An entitlement program is when a program goes on forever, and \nif you qualify, there is automatic access to the program, and \nwithdrawal from the Federal Treasury. This program is not an \nentitlement program because it is based upon a specific amount of money \nappropriated for the program. That money has got to be divided up among \nall of the States and among all of the participants. So it is not an \nentitlement.\n  I think you are going to hear a lot of debate this week that people \nwant you to think this is an entitlement. This program, targeted as it \nis, is designed to provide affordable health coverage for low-income \nchildren in working families. These families make too much to qualify \nfor Medicaid, which is one of those entitlement programs--and \nlegitimately an entitlement program--but these are families who earn \ntoo much to qualify for Medicaid but struggle to afford private \ninsurance.\n  It is important that we reauthorize this very important program \ntargeted for children. The Finance Committee's bill proposes a \nreasonable approach for reauthorizing SCHIP that is the product of \nmonths of bipartisan work in the committee. I emphasize the word \n``bipartisan.'' As I have said so often, this Finance bill is a \ncompromise. I think it is the best of what is possible. Clearly folks \non the left wanted to do more, and if you did what they wanted to do, \nyou would have a Democratic bill. My colleagues on the right wanted to \ndo less, and if you did and even go in a different direction, if you \ndid what they wanted to do, you would have a Republican-only bill. So \none way or the other, you have got 51 to 49, and nothing is going to \nget done. You have got to have bipartisanship, because it takes 60 \nvotes around here to shut off debate, to go to finality.\n  Neither side got what they wanted. I would suggest to you this is the \nessence of compromise. This compromise bill maintains the focus on low-\nincome, uninsured children and adds coverage for an additional 3.2 \nmillion low-income children, children who could presently qualify but \nnot enough money is available or States were not doing their job of \noutreach to bring these people in.\n  I have heard some harping from different quarters about the role \nSenator Hatch and I have played in developing\n\n[[Page S10354]]\n\nthis important piece of legislation. Some on my side, meaning the \nRepublican side, have suggested our efforts at finding compromise have \nbeen inconsistent with advancing the Senate Republican agenda. For a \nperson like me who has been chairman of a committee for the last 6 \nyears, getting a lot of Republican programs through, I take exception \nto someone who says I am not concerned about Republican principles and \ngetting a Republican program, so I want to put this harping in context. \nI wish to remind the critics that we would not have made tax relief law \nif we had not found a way to compromise with Democrats who shared some \nof our tax reduction goals. The bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001, \n2003, 2004, and 2006 could not have passed the Senate on Republican \nvotes only.\n  During the 4\\1/2\\ years of my chairmanship, we were able to enact \nalmost $2 trillion in broad-based tax relief that was not tax relief as \nan end in itself but was meant to stimulate the economy, and did \nstimulate the economy to a point where we have had $750 billion more \ncoming into the Federal Treasury than anticipated as a result, as \nChairman Greenspan said, of these tax bills expanding the economy and \nproducing 8.2 million new jobs in recent years.\n  None of that would have happened if Republicans were working by \nourselves, just by ourselves. It took bipartisanship to get that done. \nSo while the temptation is always there for some Members on both sides \nof the aisle to not engage the other side, rarely if ever will that \npolicy result in sustaining itself.\n  When it comes to the Republican agenda here, I have not heard any \nRepublicans say to me in the 5 months we have been talking about \nreauthorizing SCHIP that we should not provide coverage to low-income \nchildren. I have not heard anyone say we should not reauthorize this \nspecific bill. Quite to the contrary.\n\n  First, the President himself made a commitment to covering more \nchildren. I wish to refer to the Republican National Committee in New \nYork City in 2004, and President Bush was very firm in making a point \non covering children. Let me tell you what he said.\n\n       America's children must also have a healthy start in life. \n     In a new term [meaning when he was reelected] we will lead an \n     aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are \n     eligible but not signed up for the Government's health \n     insurance program. We will not allow a lack of attention or \n     information to stand between these children and the health \n     care that they need.\n\n  That was back in New York City, early September, 2004. Three months \nlater the President is reelected, with a mandate. It seems to me the \nPresident was very clear in his conviction then. Let me repeat his \nwords because I think they are important. He said he would lead an \naggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children in Government \nhealth insurance programs.\n  President Bush, this is your friend Chuck Grassley, helping you keep \nthe promise you made in New York City, and helping you keep your \nmandate that you had as a result of the last election. But somewhere \nthe priorities of this administration seem to have shifted. The \nCongressional Budget Office reports that the proposal for SCHIP \nincluded in the President's fiscal year 2008 budget would result in the \nloss of coverage, not an increase of coverage as the administration had \nbeen advocating for in the year 2004; and that loss of coverage would \nadd up to 1.4 million children and pregnant women.\n  Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt has also \nsupported expanding SCHIP. Secretary Leavitt is the President's Cabinet \nmember for health care. When Secretary Leavitt was Governor of Utah, he \nfavored expanding SCHIP during a public media availability on SCHIP \nfollowing a meeting with the President.\n  Here is what he, now Secretary Leavitt, but then Governor, had to say \nabout that meeting:\n\n       There was a discussion on children's health care. A lot of \n     celebration among governors and the President on the \n     successes that we have had in implementing the Children's \n     Health Insurance Program. Over the course of the last couple \n     of years, it has been a very successful partnership. And we \n     discussed [I assume that ``we'' means the President and the \n     Governors] ways in which that could be expanded.\n\n  That is Michael Leavitt.\n  Also there was a Governor Glendenning at that time representing the \nDemocratic Governors, holding a roundtable with the President.\n  Now, however, Secretary Leavitt wrote the Finance Committee to say \nthat the President would veto the Finance Committee's SCHIP bill. But \neven in that letter, he does not call for ending SCHIP. He does not \nsuggest we should not cover kids through SCHIP, not at all. Here is \nwhat he said about SCHIP:\n\n       The President and I are committed to reauthorizing a \n     program that has made a significant difference in the health \n     of lower-income children. Through 10 years of experience and \n     bipartisan support the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program serves as a valuable safety net for children and \n     families who do not have the means to purchase affordable \n     health care. We are committed to its continuation.\n\n  I appreciate this support in the past for expanding SCHIP from both \nthe President and Secretary Leavitt. Now, however, some around here say \nwe should not update the SCHIP program regardless of what the President \nsaid in the past in New York City, regardless of what Secretary Leavitt \nsaid. These people are basically saying the program is fine as it is \nright now. They want a simple continuation of the current program and \ncurrent funding.\n  I will soon say what is wrong with that. But the current program does \nnot work, and the current levels of funding will not do the job \neverybody says they want to do. Under current law, the current program \nis authorized to spend $25 billion over the next 5 years. That is if \nthis program were not sunsetting, just continuing on as is. That is \nwhat we call a baseline amount. But the Congressional Budget Office \nsays the $25 billion baseline amount will not fully fund the program.\n  CBO says that without more funding, 800,000 kids would lose coverage. \nTo the chagrin of many Republican Senators and even some Democratic \nSenators, the administration in the last 6 years--in fact, in one case \nin Wisconsin, in the last 3 months--has allowed adults to get covered \nunder a program for children. That is not what we intended with the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. SCHIP is for kids, not for adults. \nThere is no letter ``A'' in the acronym ``SCHIP.'' A simple extension \nof current law, however, means that adults, about whom everybody is \ncomplaining for being on a program only for children, would stay on the \nprogram. A simple extension would also mean more adults would be added. \nOf course, the reason for that is that States will continue in the \nfuture to ask for waivers and, be those waivers granted, they would be \nfree to get approval for more childless adults and parents to be on a \nprogram that was not intended for anything but children. Covering \nadults drains scarce resources away from what we consider a priority--\nchildren's coverage first.\n  We may end up having to pass a short-term extension of the current \nlaw for a few months before work is finished on this reauthorization. I \nhope not, but that is a possibility. This is something we have to live \nwith while Congress finishes work on a final version of the \nreauthorization. If that happens, so be it. But hopefully we can avoid \na long-term extension of current law.\n  The SCHIP formula funding in current law doesn't work either. It \nactually gives less money to States that get their kids covered. That \ndoesn't make sense. An extension of current law won't fix the formula.\n  The current formula also penalizes small rural States. That is \nbecause uninsured kids are not counted accurately in small rural \nStates. That has resulted in funding shortfalls in those States. An \nextension of current law means this inaccurate funding formula would \ncontinue. That means more shortfalls for these States.\n  Another problem with current law is that there isn't enough funding. \nUnder a straight extension of current law, there are going to be \nadditional State shortfalls. We dealt with that earlier this year. I \nbelieve 14, 15, 16 States had shortfalls. The Congressional Budget \nOffice says those shortfalls would cause 800,000 kids to lose coverage.\n  When Congress has faced these shortfalls in the past, what have we \ndone? We just handed out more money to the States. Congress did that on \nthree separate occasions. So that would keep those 800,000 kids from \nlosing coverage, but this wouldn't fix any of the other\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\nproblems. In fact, it would perpetuate the problems about which \neverybody is complaining--the funding coverage of adults, No. 1; and \nNo. 2, a fundamentally flawed formula that our legislation takes care \nof.\n  That is why an extension of current law won't work. More adults? \nThink of all the Senators who have been complaining to me because there \nis no ``A'' in ``SCHIP.'' It wasn't meant to cover adults. It just \nleaves things as they are--more adults. We have a broken funding \nformula. We have some States coming up short. So you have to \nappropriate more money. And most importantly, you have 800,000 kids \nlosing coverage. So what other options are there?\n  Well, there is the President's proposal. I am not here to bad-mouth \nthe President's proposal or any of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle who are working on proposals. I am not going to, obviously, bad-\nmouth anything Senator Wyden is doing in the same respect on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle. These policies are good. But I am going \nto tell the President: Now is not the time.\n  Going back to the President's program on SCHIP, the President's plan \nis in his budget. It proposes a $4.8 billion increase in SCHIP, but it \ndoes not work either. What many have overlooked is that the President's \nplan assumes a massive redistribution of about $4 billion in SCHIP \nfunds that States have in reserve. So the President assumes States will \nwillingly relinquish all of those SCHIP reserves. It assumes the \nSecretary will redistribute those funds to States that currently have \nSCHIP shortfalls. As someone who was worried about State SCHIP \nshortfalls before, worrying about SCHIP shortfalls was cool, I tell my \ncolleagues: That dog won't hunt. It is robbing Peter to pay Paul. There \nis no way a proposal that sucks $4 billion out of State coffers will \never fly around this Senate.\n  That is not all. Under the President's plan, 1.4 million children and \npregnant women would be cut off of the program between now and 2012; \n1.4 million would lose coverage, to emphasize. That is the end result \nof the President's plan: Rob Peter to pay Paul; 1.4 million children \nlosing coverage.\n  Then we are going to hear about a more comprehensive plan. This is \nthe one I was referring to when I referred to Senator Wyden and when I \nwas referring to the President having a proposal and some well-meaning \npeople on my side of the aisle. Most of the news is from either Senator \nWyden or from Republican colleagues of mine, a well-meaning approach, a \nproposal to use the Tax Code to cover many millions of uninsured \nchildren and adults through private health insurance. Again, I don't \ndisagree with that policy, but now is not the time for it.\n  I said during Finance Committee consideration of this bill that I \nwould have liked the debate about SCHIP to focus on a larger effort to \naddress the millions of Americans who are uninsured. I think we are \nmissing an opportunity by only focusing this debate on SCHIP \nreauthorization. Too many Americans don't have health insurance, and we \nneed to address rising health care costs. That approach will help that \nas well. I agree that we should be doing more, and I want to see \nCongress consider proposals to reform the tax treatment of health care \nto increase coverage for tens of millions of the 46 million people who \ndon't have insurance today. But in terms of this bill and the whole \nissue of SCHIP reauthorization, that is not realistic.\n  I continue to be disappointed by the fact that there isn't bipartisan \nsupport for trying to do more as part of SCHIP. I urged the \nadministration months ago to get bipartisan support--I emphasize \nbipartisan support because that is the only way we get things done in \nthe Senate--if they want the President's initiative to be successful. I \nnever saw any effort beyond maybe talking to Senator Wyden. It just \ndidn't happen. I looked far and wide. I can't find a single Democratic \nSenator who will support a tax reform alternative to the SCHIP bill. \nEven though it won't happen with this bill, we still need to work for a \nbroader package to address the more fundamental problems of rising \nhealth costs and the uninsured.\n  Until then, I see SCHIP as a stopgap measure--5 years in duration, 5 \nyears to do something bigger. The $35 billion we are investing in \nchildren's health coverage over the next 5 years is a drop in the \nbucket. When I say $35 billion is a drop in the bucket, somebody will \nsay: You have been in Washington too long. Let me explain. That is one-\nquarter of 1 percent of the $14 trillion that will be spent on health \ncare in this entire country, public and private expenditures, between \nnow and the end of this authorization, 2012. Economists generally agree \nthat if a condition cannot persist, then it won't persist. The current \nspending on health care cannot persist.\n\n  Members on both sides of the aisle have worked on proposals to \naddress the broader issues of the uninsured and health reform overall. \nI have already referred to Senator Wyden as a leader among Democrats on \nthis issue. He has Senator Bennett of Utah as a Republican working with \nhim. They have been championing a more comprehensive approach to cover \nthe uninsured. Many Republican Senators want to make changes in the Tax \nCode to help cover tens of millions of Americans of all ages instead of \nthe few million kids whom we do with this legislation. I am looking \nforward to a fruitful debate on this issue of health reform and the \nuninsured through the Senate Finance Committee but not until we \ncomplete action on this bill. SCHIP must be passed.\n  Turning back to the Finance Committee bill, meaning the SCHIP bill \nbefore us, I am rather surprised at the overheated rhetoric that has \nemerged from both sides of the aisle. It has really been pretty \nunbelievable. On one side, I hear that nothing less than $50 billion \nwill do the job, and if that number is not reached, children are at \nrisk of dying. On the other side, I hear maintaining coverage for kids \ncurrently on this program and covering about half the kids eligible for \nMedicaid or SCHIP represents a slippery slope that leads us to the \nGovernment takeover of the entire health care system. Both sides need \nto call time-out to cool down, stop the hysteria, and take a look at \nwhat we actually have before the Senate in this Finance Committee \ncompromise.\n  In 1997, SCHIP was conceived as a capped block grant program, not an \nentitlement. That was very important to Republicans. It is our model \nfor how a safety net should work. It is not an open-ended entitlement. \nThe Finance Committee bill maintains the block grant. It does not \ncreate an entitlement. I warn my colleagues, they are going to hear \nthis too much, and they are going to hear me wake them up that this is \nnot an entitlement. I believe they know better, but we know the game \nthat is played around here.\n  In 1997, SCHIP was intended to encourage public-private partnerships. \nThe Finance bill improves and strengthens private coverage options. In \n1997, SCHIP gave States the tools they needed to control costs. These \ntools included allowing waiting lists, adding reasonable cost sharing, \nand limiting enrollment. The Finance bill maintains the flexibility \nwhich was in that 1997 act.\n  In 1997, SCHIP gave States the flexibility to address geographical \ndifferences in health care costs. States determine eligibility for \nbenefits and tailor the benefits to their needs. The Finance bill \naffirms the States' role in managing this program.\n  SCHIP is also a humble program when compared to Medicaid. Medicaid is \nthe bigger and more expansive entitlement program. Medicaid is a \nprogram for low-income individuals, pregnant women, and families. The \nbill before us today represents a modest update of the SCHIP program \ncreated by the 1997 act.\n  So what does the bill before the Senate actually accomplish? The bill \nbefore the Senate extends the program and fixes problems with current \nlaw, first, by extending the program that would otherwise expire \nSeptember 30, doing away with the sunset or extending the sunset 5 \nyears; No. 2, eliminating shortfalls that have plagued the program; No. \n3, eliminating enhanced match for coverage of parents and childless \nadults--in other words, saving money so you spend more on kids; and No. \n4, preserving the original SCHIP mission, coverage of low-income \nchildren.\n  The bill before the Senate continues and focuses coverage on low-\nincome children by doing the following: No. 1,\n\n[[Page S10356]]\n\nit provides additional resources targeted toward covering low-income \nchildren. No. 2, it extends coverage for the 6.6 million children \ncurrently enrolled in SCHIP. I want to emphasize, 91 percent of these \nfamilies have incomes below 200 percent of poverty. No. 3, it covers an \nadditional 2.7 million children already eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP \nunder current law. No. 4, it provides coverage for an additional \n600,000 uninsured low-income children.\n\n  The Finance Committee bill provides targeted incentives to precisely \nand, more importantly, efficiently cover the lowest income children. It \ndoes this by doing two things: one, by providing precisely targeted \nincentives that use an incentive fund to encourage enrollment of the \nlowest income children--in other words, go after those with the most \nneed--and, two, by encouraging States to increase outreach and \nenrollment.\n  The Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dr. Peter Orszag, \ncharacterized the incentive fund ``as efficient as you can possibly get \nper new dollar spent.''\n  The Finance Committee bipartisan bill also removes childless adults \nand limits payments for parents. It eliminates coverage under SCHIP for \nchildless adults within 2 years. Those are the people who are already \non the program. It eliminates the enhanced match for parents covered \nunder SCHIP. It prohibits new State waivers to expand coverage for \nparents.\n  Now, again, I wish to emphasize this point. It does away with State \nwaivers. You get back to every complaint I hear about this bill. You do \nnot hear complaints about covering kids under 200 percent of poverty \nfrom Republicans or Democrats. But you hear an awful lot from both \nRepublicans and Democrats about covering adults because there is no \nletter ``A'' in the acronym SCHIP, and those adults are covered because \nthe law allows waivers. So this bill does away with waivers, so you do \nnot get the adults on the program the way they have gotten there in the \npast.\n  Next, it reduces spending on adults by $1.1 billion.\n  Finally, the Finance Committee bill spends less than the $50 billion \nauthorized in the budget. Now, once again, let me emphasize, there are \npeople around here who say $5 billion in addition to what we are \nspending now is enough. Then, you have people who say only $50 billion \nmore than what we are spending now is enough. Somewhere in the middle \nis where you end with compromise.\n  Now, for Republicans who are irritated because I am here with a \nbipartisan compromise, along with 16 other members of the Finance \nCommittee--17 to 4 this bill was voted out--we are $15 billion under \nwhat a lot of people in this body would like to spend. I think for some \npeople maybe $50 billion would not have been enough.\n  Continuing SCHIP with static enrollment would cost $14 billion over 5 \nyears over the baseline anyway. At $35 billion, the SCHIP \nReauthorization Act will cost $15 billion less than what was included \nin our budget. This additional funding goes toward coverage of lowest \nincome children.\n  This bill does not include everything on everybody's wish list. I \nworked hard for a responsible, bipartisan agreement because I wish to \nsee this bill pass. I think we have done a good job. But I also wish to \nmake one more point very clear. My support for this legislation, in the \nend, will depend upon the outcome of the floor debate and the \nconference. I am not going to be able to support a bill that changes \nsignificantly from what we have in this proposal.\n  I appreciate very much the leadership Chairman Baucus has provided. I \nthank him and Senator Rockefeller for what they did to reach a \nbipartisan agreement.\n  I also extend my sincere thanks to Senator Hatch for the hours and \nhours he has put into this effort. Senator Hatch was the main \nRepublican sponsor of the bill that created the SCHIP program 10 years \nago. His commitment to the ideals and fundamentals of the program is \nsteadfast, and the program is better for it.\n  I also have to say I am disappointed by the way the Democratic \nleadership is handling the process of bringing this bill up for \nconsideration on the floor. It does not bode well for the outcome of \nthe bill. In the Senate, process matters as much as policy, and this \nprocess has not been managed in a bipartisan or responsible manner. \nHowever, the Finance Committee SCHIP bill is still one I can support. \nIt is a compromise. It is based upon reality. This bill is for kids.\n  So I will end with an analogy from a child's bedtime story. This bill \nis not too big, it is not too small. It is not too hard, it is not too \nsoft. It is not too hot, it is not too cold. It is just right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, since the Senator from Iowa has been \ntalking about the efforts of Senator Bennett and I and how it relates \nto the children's health program, I wish to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss that relationship.\n  First, I think Senator Baucus, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Grassley, \nand Senator Hatch--through the hours and hours of effort they have put \ninto making the children's health proposal ready for floor action--have \ndone a great service. They have done a great service, first and \nforemost, to the country's kids.\n  It seems to me every single Member of the Senate can say today we \ncannot afford, in a country as good and strong and rich as ours, to \nhave so many kids go to bed at night without decent health care. As a \nresult of the bipartisan work of four Members of the Senate--two \nDemocrats and two Republicans--we have laid the foundation to take \nsteps immediately to help youngsters who are falling between the \ncracks.\n  I have long felt the challenge with respect to health care today is \ntwofold. First, you act immediately to help those who are the most \nvulnerable in our society. That is, in fact, what four members of the \nSenate Finance Committee have helped the Senate to promote today. \nSecond, we ought to be taking steps on a broader basis to fix health \ncare in our country.\n  We are spending enough money on health care today. We are not \nspending it in the right places. We are spending enough money today on \nAmerican health care to be able to go out and hire a doctor for every \nseven families in the United States. That doctor would do nothing \nexcept take care of seven families. Pay the doctor $200,000 a year, and \nmy guess is, the distinguished Presiding Officer would probably have \nphysicians in the State of Delaware come to him and say, ``Where do you \ngo to get your seven families?'' because they would all like to be \npracticing physicians again. So we are spending enough money on health \ncare today. We are not spending it in the right places.\n\n  At a time when our population is growing so rapidly, when costs are \nskyrocketing out of control, we need to fix American health care. But \nin order to get to the broader health reform effort--an effort that is \nbipartisan, with Senator Bennett joining me in the first bipartisan \nhealth reform bill in 13 years--you have to take steps to meet the \nneeds of youngsters today.\n  The Senate has already said that on multiple occasions. We said it \nfirst by passing the children's health program, and now, through the \nreauthorization effort, we say kids will come first. We also said it, \nin fact, through the budget resolution, where there was an effort to \nlook at the relationship between broader health reform and care for \nkids, and the Senate, again, said children will come first.\n  So I am very hopeful. I believe consideration of the children's \nhealth program is, essentially, the opening bell of round one in the \nfight to fix health care. If we can tackle the issue of children's \nhealth in a bipartisan way--the way the Senate Finance Committee has \ndone--it ought to be possible, even in this session of Congress, to \nmove on to broader health reform.\n  Now, I am very hopeful the Administration will join in this \nbipartisan effort. We have all read about discussions about a possible \nveto message. I am very hopeful the Administration will join \ndiscussions in the Senate, join discussions in the other body, and help \nus to move quickly on the issue of children's health.\n  If we do that, it ought to be possible, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa has indicated, to move on to something the Administration \nfeels strongly about, where I happen to think, by and large, they are \ncorrect. The Federal tax\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\nrules, as it relates to health care, are a mess. Essentially, they \nreward inefficiency. They disproportionately favor the most affluent. \nIf you are a ``high flier'' in our country, you can go out and get \nevery manner of deluxe kind of health service and write it off on your \ntaxes; but if you are a hard-working woman in Delaware or Oregon or \naround the country and your company does not have a health plan, you \nget virtually nothing.\n  So I come to the floor today to say what Democratic economists have \nsaid, what Republican economists have said, what the administration \nofficials have said: There ought to be an effort to fix the Tax Code as \nit relates to health care, and I and Senator Bennett and others want \nto; and we want to fix it in this session of the Congress. But to get \nat that issue you are going to, first, have to meet the needs of \nchildren.\n  I was asked today what the implications of the children's health \nprogram are for bipartisanship. I think if this body can pick up on the \nbipartisan work of the Senate Finance Committee, there are \nextraordinary opportunities for broader health reform in this session \nof Congress. I do not think the country wants to wait 3 or 4 or 5 more \nyears to fix American health care.\n  I have heard the discussion about how there is a Presidential \ncampaign coming up, and let's wait another 2, 3, 4 years to talk about \na more comprehensive effort to fix American health care. I do not think \nany of us got sent here to tell businesses that are trying to compete \nin tough global markets, to tell those who cannot afford the \nskyrocketing premiums: Well, we are not going to work on broader health \ncare reform for another 3 or 4 years. I think they want to hear how we \nare going to deal, in a bipartisan way, with the premier domestic issue \nof our time. Senators Baucus and Grassley and Hatch and Rockefeller \nhave given us an initial dose of bipartisanship, an initial dose of \nbipartisanship in an area the country cares about, and cares about \nstrongly, and that is meeting the needs of our children. But in the \nspirit that Senate Finance Committee quartet has worked, I and Senator \nBennett and others would like to pick up on that kind of bipartisan \ntheme and move aggressively to looking at the health care system as a \nwhole and taking steps to transform it.\n  I will say, I am struck again by how every single day it seems to me \nopportunities for bipartisanship on health care abound. I was very \npleased that the nominee to head CMS, the agency that deals with \nMedicare and Medicaid, reacted very positively to our ideas on \npreventive health care. The fact is, in this country, we really don't \nhave health care at all. We have sick care. We wait until somebody is \nflat on their back in a hospital--and the Medicare Program shows this \nclearly by paying those bills under Part A of Medicare. Part B of \nMedicare, on the other hand, the outpatient part of Medicare, pays \nvirtually nothing for prevention, virtually nothing to keep people \nwell.\n\n  We have known about the value of prevention for quite some time. The \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, has been talking about the \nvalue of health care prevention for years and years. What I and Senator \nBennett have proposed for the first time under Federal law is that \nMedicare would be given the legal authority to go out and lower \npremiums for seniors who reduce their blood pressure and reduce their \ncholesterol and take the kind of preventive steps that everyone \nunderstands makes sense and helps to prolong an individual's good \nhealth and also saves money for the Medicare Program. We were very \npleased that the nominee to head the agency that deals with Medicare \nand Medicaid was supportive of those changes and indicated he wanted to \nwork, if confirmed, in a bipartisan way.\n  So the fact is, there are great opportunities for bipartisanship on \nhealth care in this Congress if we can get past this initial effort at \naddressing American health care. The Senate has indicated, through the \ninitial authorization of the children's health program and through the \nbudget resolution, that this is the program with which it wants to \nbegin the debate on health care.\n  In the discussions in the Finance Committee, I followed very closely \nall of the different alternatives. It was a big bipartisan lift to get \na 17-to-4 vote in the Senate Finance Committee. A lot of colleagues \nwanted to spend more. A lot of colleagues thought the program ought to \nbe available to other groups of citizens. Some felt there wasn't much \nof a role for Government at all and that even the existing children's \nhealth program was too expansive. But the committee came together on a \n17-to-4 basis.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Iowa has returned. If we can \npass this legislation with the kind of bipartisan support that was \ninitially demonstrated in the Senate Finance Committee, I think it is \nvery possible, in spite of all of the popular wisdom to the contrary, \nthis Senate can achieve broader health care reform in this session of \nCongress. I see one poll after another which indicates that health care \nis the premier domestic issue of our time; that it is the most \nimportant issue to our citizens--in many polls by something like a 2-\nto-1 margin. So I think in addressing this issue today--health care for \nchildren--the Senate can lay a bipartisan foundation for broader \nreforms.\n  I think Senator Bennett and I have provided some direction for the \nSenate to go from here, but we would be the first to acknowledge there \nare many Senators with ideas on these issues, and many of them are \ngood. I have already indicated I think the Administration has a valid \npoint with respect to these tax rules on health care. The distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee is back, and he and I have listened \nto one economist after another testify before the Finance Committee--\nDemocrats and Republicans--talking about how the Tax Code on health \ncare makes no sense and largely comes out of the 1940s.\n  So we have Senators of both political parties who would like to work \non broader health care reform, but first we have to pass this \nlegislation. I hope we will pass it with a resounding bipartisan \nmajority vote so that we could truly lay the foundation for significant \nand comprehensive health reform to be considered by this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2538 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The preceding sentence constitutes budget \n     authority in advance of appropriations Act and represents the \n     obligation of the Federal Government to provide for the \n     payment of such amount to States awarded grants under section \n     2113 of the Social Security Act.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I offer this amendment to the SCHIP \nbill. This is the same amendment I offered during the Finance \nCommittee's consideration of this legislation.\n  I have heard a lot of talk about how the Baucus bill puts the focus \nfor SCHIP back on low-income children--so much talk, in fact, that one \nwould hardly know that the Baucus bill allows certain States to provide \nfamilies making up to $70,000 or $80,000 a year in income with \nGovernment-run health care.\n  Let's start from the beginning. The way the SCHIP and Medicaid \nProgram work is States get Federal matching dollars to help fund their \nprograms. The SCHIP match from the Federal Government is higher than a \nState's Medicaid match. This means for my State, the Federal \nGovernment's match for Medicaid is about 70 percent, while the State \npays the remaining 30 percent. For SCHIP, the Federal match is 80 \npercent, while the State match makes up the remaining 20 percent.\n  SCHIP was intended to help States provide health care coverage to \nchildren and families whose incomes were below 200 percent of the \nFederal poverty line. These families were likely working but making too \nmuch money to qualify for Medicaid and couldn't afford private health \ninsurance. I would like to note that 200 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel is about $41,000 a year in income for a family of four.\n  The Baucus bill allows States to expand their SCHIP programs and \nreceive the higher SCHIP matching rate for families with incomes up to \n300 percent of the poverty level, or almost $62,000 for a family of \nfour. Personally, I think that in and of itself is too high, especially \nwhen the national median income in this country was about $46,000 a \nyear in 2005. In the Baucus bill, States that choose to go above 300 \npercent of poverty would receive their Medicare matching rate for those \nfamilies which, remember, is the lower reimbursement rate.\n  However, the Baucus bill thinks families in New Jersey and New York \ndeserve special treatment under SCHIP. The bill provides an exemption \nfor States that have already gone above or are currently trying to go \nabove 300 percent of poverty for SCHIP coverage. New Jersey already \nprovides coverage for families up to 350 percent of poverty. New York \nis working to get approval to extend coverage up to 400 percent of \npoverty. I want to make sure everyone understands, 400 percent of \npoverty is $82,600 a year for a family of four; 350 percent of poverty \nis $72,275 per year. Are we really going to be providing Government \nhealth care for families making $70,000 to $80,000 a year?\n  My amendment is fairly simple. It strikes the exemption the Baucus \nbill has given to just New York and New Jersey so they have to play by \nthe same rules as every other State. If these two States want to \nprovide health care coverage to families above 300 percent of the \npoverty level, they can do so--they just cannot get a higher SCHIP \nmatching rate. They would get their Medicaid matching rate. That at \nleast leaves the playing field level.\n  There will be obviously some small savings from this if my amendment \npasses. My amendment would take these savings and provide additional \nmoney to outreach and enrollment grants.\n  Some people will try to say it is more expensive to live in these two \nStates than it is in other States, and that is probably true in certain \nareas. However, SCHIP is a Federal program, and all States should play \nby the same\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\nrules. Also, these two States can still cover these higher income \nfamilies if they choose. They just have to get the lower Medicaid \nmatching rate to do so.\n  If New York and New Jersey feel so strongly about letting families \nmaking $70,000 or $80,000 a year have Government health care, then the \nStates should be willing to pay a little more from their own tax \nrevenue. The last time I checked, money doesn't grow on trees around \nhere--or at least it very rarely does. The Baucus bill is requiring \npeople in other States such as Kentucky, New Mexico, Florida, and Maine \nto pay more so New York and New Jersey can cover families at these \nhigher income levels. To me, that is grossly unfair.\n  Some people may also try to argue that New York is only thinking \nabout going to 400 percent of the poverty level, and they would have to \nget a waiver or a plan approved by the Department of Health and Human \nServices for this increase. OK. So then why give them this special \nprotection in the Baucus bill? Why create special rules for New York \nwhen they haven't even gotten approval yet? To me, it is outrageous \nthat a program designed for lower income kids is being expanded to \ninclude families at 350 percent or 400 percent of the poverty level. \nThat is too high, and it is unfair to ask people in other States to pay \nfor these types of expenses.\n  So with my amendment, you have two options: more money for outreach \nand enrollment efforts and requiring all States to play by the same \nrules or covering kids and families most of us probably don't consider \nlow income--those making up to $72,000 or $82,000 a year for a family \nof four.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on my amendment when it is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Senator from Colorado is to be \nrecognized next. I say to my friend from Kentucky, I think the Senators \nfrom the two States that will be directly affected by the amendment \nwill be coming to the floor to speak in opposition. When they do, those \nSenators will be recognized. In the meantime, I urge the Chair to \nrecognize the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise to support the effort we have on \nthe floor to address a national health care imperative, which is \nproviding health insurance to 10 million young people in our country \ntoday.\n  For me, when I come to this Senate every day and speak on behalf of \nthe millions of people in my State of Colorado and around the country, \nI think about the biggest issues we are faced with, the biggest \nchallenges of our time, the imperatives of the 21st century, and there \nare three in my mind.\n  First is the questions we face in terms of foreign affairs and how we \nprotect America and homeland security. We will have other occasions \nwhere we will deal with the fundamental issue of protecting America and \nmaking sure our homeland is secure. We took significant steps last week \nin that direction when we adopted the 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n  The second issue is how we move forward and embrace a clean energy \neconomy for the 21st century. With the committees that have reported \nlegislation, including the Energy Committee, which adopted bipartisan \nlegislation here, we took a step forward with that international \nimperative.\n  The third issue that I think is an imperative of the 21st century is \nhow we take the health care crisis we have--a system which is not \nworking for the people today--and fix it. Today and this week is an \nopportunity for us, the Senate, to take a very major step toward making \nsure we are moving toward addressing the complex issue of health care \nand providing health care insurance to the 10 million children of \nAmerica who, without this program, would wake up after September \nwithout the health insurance that provides them with an opportunity to \nlive a healthy American life. So this legislation is very important for \nus to move through this body.\n  I say also at the outset that we would not be here today had it not \nbeen for the bipartisan efforts of Senators Baucus and Grassley, in the \nleadership in the Finance Committee, joined by Senators Rockefeller and \nHatch. The four of them moved this legislation forward today in the \nframework that gives us the great possibility of receiving an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote as we move this legislation out of the \nSenate.\n  By all measures, we know our health care system is in crisis. We have \n47 million Americans without health insurance today, and 9 million of \nthem are kids. In Colorado, 20 percent of our population--1 in 5, or \n780,000--lacks health coverage; 180,000 of those people in my State of \nColorado are children.\n  These are middle class citizens who are getting squeezed by the \nballooning costs of health care. Two-thirds of Americans and 70 percent \nof Coloradans without health insurance work full time. They play by the \nrules, but still find coverage out of reach.\n  For those who are able to afford health insurance, the picture is \nalso grim. Health insurance premiums for family coverage have risen by \nover 70 percent since 2000. An employer-sponsored family coverage plan \nnow costs nearly $10,000 a year. This is a huge chunk of a working \nfamily's income.\n  Our health care system is in dire need of triage. We must start with \nthose who are most vulnerable, our children, and see to it that they \nhave the health care coverage they deserve.\n  Covering our kids, providing them preventive care from doctors and \nnurses, ensuring that they grow up healthy and strong--this has been \nthe focus of our health care work over the last several months in the \nSenate Finance Committee. This week we bring the bill to the floor with \nthe hope that we will pass it swiftly and with broad, bipartisan \nsupport, so that we can give 10 million more kids the opportunity they \ndeserve to live up to their potential.\n  The reason we focus our first reforms of the health care system on \nour children is simple: every American child deserves the opportunities \nthat come from a healthy start in life.\n  The fact that 9 million of our kids--180,000 in Colorado--have no \ncoverage is simply unacceptable. It is a massive liability not just for \nthe health of our kids, but for their education and for our future \neconomic security.\n  The impacts of a lack of health coverage are clear: uninsured \nchildren are 6 times more likely to have unmet medical needs; uninsured \nchildren are two and a half times more likely to have unmet dental \nneeds; one-third of all uninsured children go without any medical care \nfor an entire year; uninsured children are less likely to do well in \nschool due to absences from unmet health needs; and uninsured children \nare more likely to seek care from hospital emergency rooms, which are \noften the provider of last resort, the most costly venue for care, and \nthe least equipped to provide the type of preventive and comprehensive \nfollow-up care children need.\n  As sobering as these statistics are, the stories of families and \nhealth care providers are even more compelling. Earlier this year, at \nSenator Baucus' suggestion, I traveled to Greeley, Fort Morgan, Fort \nCollins, Steamboat, Silverthorne, Grand Junction, Durango, Alamosa, \nPueblo, Colorado Springs, and Denver to meet with health care \nproviders, State officials, children's advocacy groups and families \ninterested in the reauthorization of the Children's Health Plan.\n  I heard harrowing tales about delayed health care that caused \nchildren's health to worsen. One school nurse told me of a boy who \ninjured his leg during a school football game. Because his family could \nnot afford to take him to a doctor, they applied ice to his leg and \nprayed it would get better.\n  Unfortunately, the boy's leg, which was fractured, grew progressively \nworse, swelling to two times its normal size. The school nurse told me \nof the pain and anguish the child endured because his parents could not \nafford an expensive doctor's visit.\n  I heard countless other stories of colds that turned into pneumonia, \nof ear aches that developed into ear infections, and of other illnesses \nthat grew\n\n[[Page S10360]]\n\nworse because parents could not afford to seek medical care for their \nkids. These families eventually had to take their kids to the emergency \nroom for treatment, the most expensive venue for care, and one which \ntypically doesn't provide the type of preventative or comprehensive \nfollow-up care that our kids need.\n  For millions of children and their families, for our hospitals, \nclinics and health care providers who can no longer shoulder the burden \nof uncompensated care, the time has come to provide health insurance to \nchildren in need.\n  I am proud of the work that we have done on this bill in the Finance \nCommittee. It will cover 10 million uninsured children. It is a huge \nstep toward providing coverage for every uninsured child in America, \nand we have done it with overwhelming bipartisan support in committee.\n  Unfortunately, the President seems to have a different perspective. \nHe has already issued a veto threat. I believe he is wrong. For the \nsake of our children we must reauthorize the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, and we ask the President to help get it done. CHIP \nhas become a critical resource to us in Colorado and nationwide, \nproviding health care coverage to children who would otherwise go \nuninsured.\n  I believe that it is our moral and economic obligation in Washington \nto invest in our children's healthcare, as our investment today, will \npay off tomorrow. The President should embrace this proposal for \nchildren across the country, and I strongly urge the President to help \nus get it done.\n  I want to take a moment to talk about what the bill does, because the \nveto threat implies a deep misunderstanding about its benefits.\n  On the broadest scale, the bill before us provides insurance coverage \nto 3.3 million children who are currently uninsured, while maintaining \ncoverage for all 6.6 million low-income children currently enrolled in \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  The bill includes significant incentives for States to enroll more \nchildren onto CHIP, particularly children in rural communities where \ngeographic distances and the lack of health infrastructure create \nbarriers to enrollment. Twenty percent of all low-income children live \nin rural areas, and a significant percentage of them are uninsured. We \ncan do better.\n  The CHIP reauthorization also allows States to cover pregnant women. \nChildren who are born healthy have a far greater chance of a healthy \nlife. Healthy children save Medicaid and CHIP significant resources in \nreduced health care costs. It is sensible that they can receive this \ncoverage under our program.\n  The bill also provides grants to States to improve dental benefits \nand helps improve coverage for mental health. In order to receive the \nFederal match, States that offer mental health services will be \nrequired to provide coverage on par with medical and surgical benefits \nunder CHIP. Finally, the bill reduces bureaucratic hurdles and improves \nthe program's efficiency by setting quality standards, by allowing \nStates to verify citizenship through the Social Security \nAdministration, and by establishing a pilot program to allow States to \nimplement express lane enrollment.\n  These are only a few of the key provisions in a bill that \ndramatically increases coverage for uninsured children across America.\n  I look forward to a lively week of debate on this bill with the hope \nthat we can further strengthen the package.\n  Finally, I want to briefly talk about an amendment that I intend to \noffer, which will help States create and expand home visitation \nprograms. In a home visitation program a nurse, social workers, \nvolunteer, or other professional works with families in their homes to \nprovide prenatal care, parenting education, social support, and links \nwith public and private community services. Home visitation programs \nhave existed in the United States since the 19th century and have a \nlong and solid track record in improving children's health.\n  My amendment is straightforward. It would create a $100 million grant \nprogram to fund cost-effective home visitation programs. It would also \nrequire a study of the cost-effectiveness of adding home visitation \nprograms to coverage under CHIP.\n  From my experience with these programs in Colorado, I think we will \nfind that expanded investment in home visitation programs is a logical \nstep toward improving children's health care.\n  Nurse Family Partnership, one of our home visitation programs in \nColorado, is a great example. It operates in 150 sites in 22 States, \nproviding 20,000 low-income pregnant women with help from trained \nregistered nurses. These nurses work closely with the families to \nincrease access to prenatal care, foster child health and development \nand promote parental economic self-sufficiency.\n  The statistics prove the success of the program. Nurse Family \nPartnership has been shown to reduce child abuse and neglect by 48 \npercent; reduce child arrests by 59 percent; reduce arrests of the \nmother by 61 percent; reduce criminal convictions for the mother by 72 \npercent; increase father presence in household by 42 percent; reduce \nsubsequent pregnancies by 32 percent; reduce language delays in 21-\nmonth-old children by 50 percent; and reduce behavioral/intellectual \nproblems of children at age 6 by 67 percent.\n  A report recently released by the Brookings Institute praised Nurse \nFamily Partnership as one of the most effective returns on investment \nin the healthy development of the next generation.\n  Our amendment builds on the great promise that home visitation \nprograms offer and strengthens CHIP's investment in the healthy \ndevelopment of our children. I urge my colleagues to support our \namendment when we offer it.\n  I want to again thank Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member Grassley, and \nSenators Rockefeller and Hatch for their bipartisan leadership on this \nbill. This is a giant step forward in our Nation's steady march toward \nproviding every child in America the chance to chase their dreams.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the amendments are starting to come \nbefore the Senate and that is good. The other news is that all Senators \nwho have lined up to speak at certain specified times are going to have \nto be very accommodating to other Senators and squeeze down the amount \nof time they want to speak. Perhaps they can consult with the floor \nstaff to see when they might be able to speak.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Oregon, Senator \nSmith, be recognized to speak next and, immediately following him, that \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey, be recognized to speak. I \nurge both Senators to limit their remarks as much as possible. Please \ntry to use a little more brevity so we can get to the next speakers. \nSenator Menendez is also here and he wishes to speak on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: When the Senator \nsaid ``limit the time,'' I am not sure what the Senator meant by that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Well, I have a list of Senators who wish to speak. I have \ntimes next to the Senators as to when they are going to speak. I also \nhave time allocated on how much time they think they are going to \nspeak. I am asking all Senators to basically speak for fewer minutes so \nthat all Senators can speak at their allotted times.\n  Mr. CASEY. My colleague from Montana has been generous with his time \nand has shown great leadership. I want to make sure I have the time I \nwant on this, so I will wait. I will play it by ear, depending on my \ncolleague from Oregon.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I wish to assure the manager of the bill \nthat I will be as brief as I can on this big issue.\n  All of us who are parents know that the health of a child is \ncritically important in ensuring they have the opportunity to reach \ntheir full potential. Yet today in America there are approximately 6 \nmillion children who are eligible for either Medicaid or SCHIP who are \ngoing without health care nevertheless. In Oregon alone, there are\n\n[[Page S10361]]\n\napproximately 60,000 kids eligible for assistance who are not getting \nthe help they need. Therefore, the debate before us is about whether we \nas a country will invest in our young people by providing access to \nhealth coverage or whether we will leave these children without the \nessential building blocks of health care upon which they can build \nsuccessful lives.\n  I believe in the promise that SCHIP represented in 1997. It was one \nof the first bills I worked on, with an amendment in the Budget \nCommittee. I urge my colleagues to support the bill the Finance \nCommittee has now produced which sees this whole promise of CHIP one \nstep closer to fulfillment. This bill will allow States to cover an \nadditional 3.3 million children, and in Oregon that would allow an \nadditional 100,000 children to receive health care coverage.\n  When thinking about our response to the children, I often like to \nquote one of our Nation's health care leaders, the former Surgeon \nGeneral, Dr. C. Everett Koop, who said:\n\n       Life affords no greater responsibility, no greater \n     privilege than the raising of the next generation.\n\n  The reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program \nfulfills the Government's responsibility to take care of our Nation's \nchildren. It also lives up to the expectations of the American public--\nwe the people--who want Congress to pass this bill and extend health \ncare coverage to America's underprivileged children.\n  This bill is also a testament to a bipartisan legacy of the Finance \nCommittee. It contains less money and benefits than some desire, while \nmore than others have indicated they will support. Yet when you look at \nthe actual policy, I believe you will find that it deserves the full \nsupport of the Senate.\n  My colleagues and the American public should know that this bill is \nnot, as some have claimed, an expansion, and it is not the \nfederalization of health care. In fact, it simply takes a step, a \nreasonable step, toward achieving the original objective, the original \nvision for SCHIP. It will provide adequate funding and make some \nprogrammatic enhancements to help an additional 3.3 million children \ncurrently eligible to enroll in the program. I wish to emphasize that \nthese children are currently eligible. This just makes the program \navailable to them.\n  This package which many of us have worked to craft does not create a \nnew Government-run health care system. In fact, 48 States, including my \nState of Oregon, utilize private health insurers to deliver the SCHIP \nbenefit package. Like Medicare Part D, it is a highly successful \nmelding of Government and private sector care.\n  I also believe it important to note that SCHIP is an efficient and \ncost-effective health care program. Its overhead ranges from about 5 \npercent, compared to the commercial market, which is over 10 percent. \nPerhaps most importantly, this bill returns the focus of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program to children.\n  Many on both sides of the political aisle were amazed and \ndisappointed to learn that the administration has allowed States to \nextend coverage under SCHIP to adults. This proposal puts the brakes on \nthat practice and says: Enough is enough. Upon enactment of the bill, \nthe administration no longer will be able to extend waivers to States \nto cover any adult. Further, by the end of 2009, those States which \ncurrently cover childless adults will be required to move those people \ninto Medicaid, and any parent currently covered will be moved into a \nseparate block grant starting in 2010. This represents a bipartisan \nagreement.\n  For those of us who have battled over the years to ensure mental \nhealth parity, I am pleased to report that the committee accepted an \namendment from me and Senator Kerry, and this bill now delivers a \nvictory to those who advocate for mental health parity. It requires \nStates that offer access to mental health care to provide coverage that \nis on par with coverage for physical illnesses. As a parent whose child \nbattled a mental illness, I know how important it is for our young \npeople to have timely access to mental health care treatments.\n  Each year in the United States, 30,000 people die by suicide. That is \nmore deaths than by drunk driving and homicides combined. Yet, with \nproper treatment, these deaths are preventable. Our Nation and our \nGovernment simply cannot continue to ignore this problem. That is why \nthis amendment was included, so that we will now begin to reverse this \nFederal discrimination as it relates to mental health care. I believe \nthat by ensuring equity among mental and physical illnesses, this bill \ntakes the first step toward eliminating the discrimination against \npersons with mental illnesses that has existed in our Federal and State \nhealth care programs for generations. It is an important first step and \nfulfills the promise of SCHIP for all children, including those \nchildren with a mental illness.\n  For those who believe SCHIP will erode health care coverage through \nemployers, do not believe it. This bill takes a significant step toward \noffering access to privately delivered options and helps small \nbusinesses gain access to affordable health care coverage for all of \ntheir employees.\n  I authored a provision that allows States to create an employer \npurchasing pool under the premium assistance section of SCHIP. My \nprovision will allow small businesses with less than 250 employees to \nbuy health insurance coverage through a State-sponsored employer \npurchasing pool. Employers that participate will have access to a \nchoice of privately delivered, quality health insurance products for \nall of their employees and will receive reimbursement for those \nemployees or their children who are eligible for SCHIP. It is a win-win \narrangement that I hope will lead to more extensive coverage among \nemployees and small- and medium-sized businesses.\n  Finally, this package rightly utilizes the 61-cent increase in the \ntobacco products excise tax, which I proposed during the Senate's \nbudget debate, to pay for the cost of reauthorizing SCHIP. Increasing \nthe cost of tobacco products not only puts real dollars on the table to \npay for SCHIP, but over time it will lower the cost of tobacco-related \nillnesses for all Federal and State health care programs and will deter \nyoung people from smoking.\n\n  Why is this important? My State of Oregon was the first in the Nation \nin 1987 to begin tracking the number of deaths that were related to the \nuse of tobacco. In 2005, the most recent year for which data is \navailable, there were a total of nearly 7,000 deaths in Oregon due to \ntobacco. This means that tobacco contributed to 22 percent of all \ndeaths in the State of Oregon. In fact, from 1996 to 2005, tobacco use \nhas consistently contributed to more than one-fifth of all Oregon \ndeaths, ranging from 21 percent to 23 percent of the total deaths per \nyear.\n  Officials in my State explain to me that to determine the death rate \nin the State, they often look at it in terms of the number of deaths \nper 100,000 Oregonians. In 2005, the death rate due to tobacco was \nabout 13 times the rate of death from the following causes: alcohol-\ninduced deaths, drug-induced deaths, motor vehicle accidents, and \ndeaths from an infection or parasitic disease. What is more, the State \nestimates that an additional 800 deaths were attributable to secondhand \nsmoke in 2005. That means in 1 year, 7,721 Oregonians needlessly died \nbecause of the use of tobacco.\n  So for those who question raising the rate of the Federal tobacco \nexcise tax, I say: Look at these numbers. Look at the 7,000 deaths from \ntobacco in the State of Oregon in 2005 alone and understand that this \nFederal rate increase could dramatically lower the death rate from \ntobacco. That is why this bill rightly includes a 61-cent increase in \nthe excise tax.\n  In closing, Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley have a long \nworking tradition of tackling challenging issues and developing \nbipartisan solutions. The development of the Children's Health \nImprovement Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 is no different. Many \nhurdles were encountered, and many are yet to come, but if the Senate \ncan follow the example set by Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley, I am confident we will see SCHIP reauthorized by the end of \nSeptember. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I thank the Chair for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, Senator Casey has been seeking \nrecognition, and I assured him earlier today that he would be able to \nspeak at about this time.\n\n[[Page S10362]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Casey be able to speak and that \nfollowing Senator Casey, the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I thank Chairman \nBaucus for his leadership and for the way he has conducted the debate \non this bill.\n  I wish to make a couple of points that probably haven't been made \nyet--some have, in different ways--and the first thing I wish to say is \nthat this bill, overall, provides what a lot of Americans expect us to \nprovide in a bill such as this: It lowers the rates of uninsured \nchildren in America, just as the original Children's Health Insurance \nProgram did some 10 years ago now; it strengthens the program by \nincreasing and targeting funding for our children; and it also gives \nStates the tools they need to do the outreach that is required to get \nour children enrolled and to do that in a way that spends money wisely.\n  One of the things that has been missed in this debate is that this is \nreally about all of America. This isn't simply about one State or one \ncommunity. One of the population sectors that I think has been ignored \noften in this discussion by some people who have talked about this is \nrural children. You can see on this chart to my right what children's \nhealth insurance--this program--means to rural children.\n  Rural children are far less likely to have access to employer-based \nhealth care plans because most of these families that have had to \nstruggle are not getting jobs that offer affordable health insurance. \nThat number has gone far too high in terms of the number of rural \nfamilies that have lost jobs or are seeking jobs with health insurance.\n  Secondly, rural children are difficult to enroll in children's health \ninsurance even when they are clearly eligible. Outreach and enrollment \nefforts are critically important to those communities. That is why the \nfeatures of this bill that deal with outreach--television advertising \nand other kinds of advertising--are critically important.\n  The second point about children who live in rural communities across \nAmerica--and I have to say in Pennsylvania we have literally millions \nof Pennsylvanians who live in communities that are defined \ndemographically as rural--is that they are more likely to be poor. \nNearly half of rural children live in low-income families at or below \n200 percent of the poverty level. So you are talking about a doubling \nof the number, just a little more than $40,000 of family income.\n  Additionally, rural children increasingly rely upon children's health \ninsurance, this program. In rural America, more than one-third of all \nchildren--one-third of all rural children--rely upon the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program or Medicaid.\n  Another point on benefits, if we can go to the next chart. There has \nbeen a lot of talk about what this program means and how much it costs. \nIt is interesting to debate that, but let us get back to what this \nprogram means to families. It means immunizations, routine checkups, \nprescription drugs, dental care, maternity care, mental health \nbenefits, and down the list. You can see what this means to the life of \na family and to the health of a nation. I think it bears repeating just \nhow important those benefits are.\n  In the next chart, we focus on an example from Pennsylvania. There \nhas been a lot of talk on this floor already, some of it inaccurate \ntalk, so let's get back to the facts. This is what the children's \nhealth insurance income levels mean in Pennsylvania. What we are \ntalking about here is $41,300 of income and below, under 200 percent of \nthe FPL, the federal poverty level. Care is free for those families, \nand the average premium is, of course, zero. But the next category, \n$41,301 to $61,950, above 200 percent of poverty, up to 300 percent, \ncare is provided at a low cost but a cost nonetheless. They pay a \npremium--a range of a premium.\n  Finally, looking at the higher income groups and some people, it is \nvery misleading. For those with incomes of $61,951 and above, at that \nincome level care is provided at cost, and the average premium is $150. \nWe should stop misleading people, talking about wealthier families \nmaking $80,500. Others will discuss this later. We have already had a \nlot of misleading--and I hope it is not deliberate, but there has been \nmisleading rhetoric on the Senate floor already about those families.\n  Just for the record, not only are there no families at $80,000 in the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, there are only about 3,000 kids \nenrolled in the health care program today out of 6.6 million who have a \nfamily income of 300 percent of poverty or more. Let's speak the truth \nand adhere to the facts instead of what we have heard already: \nmisleading statements on this floor about these income levels.\n  One more point about minority children in America. We have heard a \nlot about what this means and whether it is working. We have lots of \nproof already that minority children have already been helped. Since \nthe inception of this program 10 years ago, the percent of uninsured \nHispanic children has decreased by nearly one-third; for African-\nAmerican children by almost one-half. So don't tell us this is not \nworking. Some people on the other side have made that point. This is \nworking for rural kids, and it is working for minority children all \nacross the country, not to mention what I have seen in Pennsylvania.\n  This will be our last chart. We have heard a lot about what this \nmeans for the broad spectrum of America. Here is the fact again: 78 \npercent of the kids covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program \nare from working families. I think that is an important point to make \nwhen we talk about who is helped by this program.\n  If we want to go the way the President has taken us and cut off kids \nfrom children's health insurance--1.4 million kids will lose their \ncoverage under the President's plan--here is what happens when a child \ndoesn't get dental care. We heard this story a couple of months ago. It \nbears repeating again--12-year-old Deamonte Driver, from Prince \nGeorge's County here in Maryland, died because he didn't have coverage \nfor a routine $80 dental procedure for his infected tooth. Without that \nsimple treatment, the infection spread to Deamonte Driver's brain and \nkilled him.\n  Let's put aside some of the mythology about what we have heard from \nsome people--not everyone but some people in this Chamber--about what \nthis means. If that child had received an $80 dental procedure he might \nbe alive today. But, of course, we hear political rhetoric in here to \nback up the President. I think it is important to remember why we are \nhere.\n  I have two more points to make, to keep within my time. John Dilulio, \nJr., a distinguished Ph.D., worked for President Bush to lead his \nfaith-based initiatives in the early part of the administration. He \nwrote an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer a few months ago.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Philadelphia Inquirer]\n\n     Bush's Stand on Insurance Plan Contradicts Words of Compassion\n\n                        (By John J. Dilulio Jr.)\n\n       Eight years ago this week, on July 22, 1999, George W. Bush \n     delivered his first presidential campaign speech, titled \n     ``The Duty of Hope.'' Speaking in Indianapolis, he rejected \n     as ``destructive'' the idea that ``if only government would \n     get out of the way, all our problems would be solved.'' \n     Rather, ``from North Central Philadelphia to South Central \n     Los Angeles,'' government ``must act in the common good, and \n     that good is not common until it is shared by those in \n     need.'' There are ``some things the government should be \n     doing, like Medicaid for poor children.''\n       I helped draft the speech and served in 2001 as an adviser \n     to Bush. He has made good on some compassion pledges. For \n     instance, he has increased funding for public schools that \n     serve low-income children. His $150 million program for \n     mentoring 100,000 children of prisoners has made progress. In \n     May, he pledged an additional $30 billion in U.S. aid to \n     combat the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and save Africa's \n     affected children.\n       On the other hand, poverty rates have risen in many cities. \n     In 2005, Washington fiddled while New Orleans flooded, and \n     the White House has vacillated in its support for the \n     region's recovery and rebuilding process. Most urban \n     religious nonprofit organizations that provide social \n     services in low-income communities still get no public \n     support\n\n[[Page S10363]]\n\n     whatsoever. Several recent administration positions on social \n     policy contradict the compassion vision Bush articulated in \n     1999.\n       In May, Bush rejected a bipartisan House bill that \n     increased funding for Head Start, a program that benefits \n     millions of low-income preschoolers. His spokesmen claimed \n     the bill was bad because it did not include a provision \n     giving faith-based preschool programs an absolute right to \n     discriminate on religious grounds in hiring.\n       That reason reverses a principle Bush proclaimed in his \n     1999 speech: ``We will keep a commitment to pluralism, not \n     discriminating for or against Methodists or Mormons or \n     Muslims, or good people of no faith at all.'' As many studies \n     show, most urban faith-based nonprofits that serve their own \n     needy neighbors do not discriminate against beneficiaries, \n     volunteers or staff on religious grounds. These inner-city \n     churches and grass roots groups would love to expand Head \n     Start in their communities.\n       Last week, Bush threatened to veto a bipartisan Senate plan \n     that would add $35 billion over five years to the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The decade-old \n     program insures children in families that are not poor enough \n     to qualify for Medicaid but are too poor to afford private \n     insurance. The extra $7 billion a year offered by the Senate \n     would cover a few million more children. New money for the \n     purpose would come from raising the federal excise tax on \n     cigarettes.\n       Several former Bush advisers have urged the White House to \n     accept some such SCHIP plan. So have many governors in both \n     parties and Republican leaders in the Senate. In 2003, Bush \n     supported a Medicare bill that increased government spending \n     on prescription drugs for elderly middle-income citizens by \n     hundreds of billions of dollars. But he has pledged only $1 \n     billion a year more for low-income children's health \n     insurance. His spokesmen say doing any more for the \n     ``government-subsidized program'' would encourage families to \n     drop private insurance.\n       But the health-insurance market has already priced out \n     working-poor families by the millions. With a growing \n     population of low-income children, $1 billion a year more \n     would be insufficient even to maintain current per capita \n     child coverage levels. Some speculate that SCHIP is now \n     hostage to negotiations over the president's broader plan to \n     expand health coverage via tax cuts and credits. But his plan \n     has no chance in this Congress; besides, treating health \n     insurance for needy children as a political bargaining chip \n     would be wrong.\n       Bush should return to Indianapolis. There, SCHIP covers \n     children in families with incomes as high as three times the \n     federal poverty line The Republican governor who signed that \n     program into law is Mitch Daniels, Bush's first budget office \n     director. For compassion's sake, the president should \n     compromise on SCHIP--say, $5 billion a year more--and work to \n     leave no child uninsured.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I will not read it, but I want to highlight some of what \nhe said. He talked about the President and what has been happening with \nthis debate on children's health insurance. He made this point in the \nsecond to the last paragraph:\n\n       Treating health insurance for needy children as a political \n     bargaining chip--\n\n  And he's referring to the President's other health care ideas----\n\n       would be wrong.\n\n  He talks about the fact that Mitch Daniels, who worked in a \nRepublican administration--he is the Governor now, Governor of Indiana, \nalso a great supporter of this program. Mr. Dilulio concludes this way. \nHe says:\n\n       For compassion's sake, the President should compromise on \n     SCHIP . . .\n\n  And allow this to move forward.\n  I have to say, some of what we heard in the last couple of days has \nbeen misleading. In the end it is about this: It is about whether we \nare going to be fair to families across America, not whether the Senate \nlikes a program or doesn't like it. This is about whether we are going \nto be fair to families.\n  Anyone who has had the experience of being a parent knows when their \nchild is born, that parent, whoever they are, falls in love again. My \nwife and I have four daughters, and we know that feeling. So many \nothers here do as well. As a parent, you always want to love your \nchildren and protect them. When a child is injured or gets sick, the \nfirst instinct of any parent, but especially a mother, is to hug that \nchild, to dry their tears, and to soothe their pain immediately--not \nmonths later, not days later, but immediately. Of course if it is more \nserious you want to get them to a doctor or a hospital.\n  But for millions of parents--that is why this bill is so important to \nget done--for millions of parents that hug that they give their son or \ndaughter, that warm embrace and the comfort that a hug can bring to a \nchild--that will often be all that they have at the end of the road \nbecause their son or daughter has no health insurance, like the \nmillions of children we have talked about in the last couple of days. \nIf that child cries in the dark of night from pain or if they endure \nthe slow ache of disease or sickness, the mother cannot bring the full \nmeasure of her love to that child. In essence, the mother is rendered \npowerless because of that. Just think of what that does to a mother and \nto a family.\n  When we have debates on this floor about this bill, none of it \nmatters--none of the debate in the last couple of days will have \nmattered if it does not result in a total commitment to the children of \nAmerica. Unfortunately, if the President gets his way, we will have \nfailed that basic test about a full commitment to our children.\n  I will conclude with one line. When my father served as Governor of \nPennsylvania, it was one of the first States to have a children's \nhealth insurance program. He knew the benefits of it. His test for \nevery public official in every difficult fight was very simple, but it \nis a very tough test: What did you do when you had the power?\n  This Senate has the power this week to tell the President that he is \nwrong about children's health insurance, but more important to tell \nAmerica that we have made a full commitment to the children of America. \nIf we pass that test we will have done our job. If this body does not, \nit will have failed that test when we had the power to positively \nimpact millions of children, to have exercised that power on behalf of \nthat child, his or her family, and all of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe remarks of Senator Allard, during which he will offer an amendment, \nthen the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, be recognized; \nfollowing Senator Menendez, Senator Lott be recognized; and following \nSenator Lott, Senator Obama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask the pending amendment be set \naside, and we call up Allard amendment No. 2536.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2536 to amendment No. 2530.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To standardize the determination of income for purposes of \n                         eligibility for SCHIP)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. STANDARDIZATION OF DETERMINATION OF FAMILY INCOME.\n\n       (a) Eligibility Based on Gross Income.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 2110 (42 U.S.C. 1397jj) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(d) Standardization of Determination of Family Income.--A \n     State shall determine family income for purposes of \n     determining income eligibility for child health assistance or \n     other health benefits coverage under the State child health \n     plan (or under a waiver of such plan under section 1115) \n     solely on the basis of the gross income (as defined by the \n     Secretary) of the family.''.\n       (2) Prohibition on waiver of requirements.--Section 2107(f) \n     (42 U.S.C. 1397gg(f)), as amended by section 106(a)(2)(A), is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) The Secretary may not approve a waiver, experimental, \n     pilot, or demonstration project with respect to a State after \n     the date of enactment of the Children's Health Insurance \n     Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 that would waive or \n     modify the requirements of section 2110(d) (relating to \n     determining income eligibility on the basis of gross income) \n     and regulations promulgated to carry out such \n     requirements.''.\n       (b) Regulations.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall promulgate interim \n     final regulations defining gross income for purposes of \n     section 2110(d) of the Social Security Act, as added by \n     subsection (a)(1).\n       (c) Application to Current Enrollees.--The interim final \n     regulations promulgated under subsection (b) shall not be \n     used to determine the income eligibility of any individual \n     enrolled in a State child health plan under title XXI of the \n     Social Security Act on\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\n     the date of enactment of this Act before the date on which \n     such eligibility of the individual is required to be \n     redetermined under the plan as in effect on such date. In the \n     case of any individual enrolled in such plan on such date \n     who, solely as a result of the application of subsection (d) \n     of section 2110 of the Social Security Act (as added by \n     subsection (a)(1))) and the regulations promulgated under \n     subsection (b), is determined to be ineligible for child \n     health assistance under the State child health plan, a State \n     may elect, subject to substitution of the Federal medical \n     assistance percentage for the enhanced FMAP under section \n     2105(a)(1) of the Social Security Act, to continue to provide \n     the individual with such assistance for so long as the \n     individual otherwise would be eligible for such assistance \n     and the individual's family income, if determined under the \n     income and resource standards and methodologies applicable \n     under the State child health plan on September 30, 2007, \n     would not exceed the income eligibility level applicable to \n     the individual under the State child health plan.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, today I come to the floor to offer an \namendment for the purpose of upholding the original intent of the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, which is commonly known as SCHIP. \nIn 1997, a Republican-led Congress passed SCHIP to help States provide \nhealth coverage to low-income children. Current law defines a targeted \nlow-income child as one who is under the age of 19 years, uninsured, \nand who would not have been eligible for Medicaid in 1997.\n  States may set the upper income eligibility level at 200 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level or 50 percentage points above the State's \nMedicaid income level. But that is not what is happening today.\n  In my State of Colorado, we had a health care summit meeting early on \nin the year. It was very popular, well attended by representatives of \nhealth providers all over the State of Colorado. They had this to say: \nWe think the SCHIP program is successful, and we think it ought to \nprovide care to needy children, those who are uninsured. They further \nstated that there needs to be some equity among the various States and \nthe money they get for SCHIP.\n  Today, anywhere between 12 and 15 States have income thresholds above \n200 percent of the Federal poverty level or 50 percent above the \nState's Medicare income level, which was provided for in the original \nlegislation. So we have 12 or 15 States that have figured out how to \nget around that provision. States such as California, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Vermont use \nincome disregards to expand their income thresholds beyond the intent \nof the SCHIP program.\n  As of July 2006, just a year ago, New Jersey topped the list at 350 \npercent of the Federal poverty level, at $72,275 for a family of four, \nI am told.\n  In fiscal year 2005, nearly half of all children in the United States \nwere covered by Medicaid or SCHIP. SCHIP was never intended to cover \nall 77 million children in the United States. It was never intended to \nmake all children, regardless of income, dependent on Government for \naccess to health insurance.\n  In April, New York passed its budget which expanded SCHIP to 400 \npercent of the Federal poverty level or $82,600 for a family of four. \nBy disregarding specific types of incomes, States can ignore earnings \nbetween 200 percent of Federal poverty level and their upper limit, as \nif that income did not even exist. States should not be disregarding \nlarge portions of income to avoid SCHIP eligibility levels. Rather than \nreturning SCHIP to its true intent, the pending legislation makes a \ndeliberate choice to drive up eligibility levels.\n  My amendment brings the language back to the original intent of \nSCHIP. My amendment would require that a family's gross income be used \nto determine eligibility for SCHIP, and that the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services would determine new regulations for eligibility for \nSCHIP by establishing what is referred to as ``gross income'' and \nhaving that defined at a certain level.\n  States would still have the opportunity to cover any child who was \ndetermined to be ineligible for SCHIP based on the changes made by this \namendment. They would remain eligible for the program, but the State \nwould be reimbursed according to the Federal medical assistance \npercentage rate rather than the enhanced Federal medical assistance \npercentage rate.\n  So I ask my fellow Senators to support me and fellow Republicans in \nsupporting the SCHIP reauthorization. My amendment tracks current law \nthat upholds SCHIP's original intent, and that is for low-income \nchildren. Supporting this alternative is a step toward renewing our \ncommitment to America's most vulnerable population; that is, our \nchildren.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if the distinguished Senator would \nwithhold so I could just address a couple of questions to him on his \namendment? The amendment would say that the States have to take into \nconsideration the gross income of the family, not including certain so-\ncalled income disregards.\n  That is the way we talk in Washington, but to the average man and \nwoman, what are we talking about? Are we saying, even though we think \nthey may have other sources of income--I don't know what that might be, \nand I was going to ask you, are you talking about rental income? Are \nyou talking about some part-time income? I wonder, what types of things \nare used by these various States to reduce the gross level of income so \nthey can get under this, whatever it is, 350 percent of poverty or--400 \npercent of poverty is the newest application, I understand, from New \nYork. Do you have any information on that?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his question. \nHere is what my amendment does. It directs the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to establish rules and regulations to set a uniform \ngross income among the States. He has 90 days, once the bill becomes \nlaw, to do that. This will give the States further opportunity to give \ntheir input to the Secretary, and it gives him some flexibility to \nlisten to what their concerns are, but says then these States all have \nto operate under the same rules.\n  Some States, for example, when they looked at total gross income, \nhave not included income benefits from other programs. Some States \nhave. So this amounted to a considerable amount of discrepancy, \nparticularly in high-income States where the benefits are running much \nhigher.\n  So we see some States that are getting a much higher rate of benefit \nthrough SCHIP than perhaps the more responsible States, such as your \nState of Mississippi, my State of Colorado, for example.\n  So this is an important amendment to bring some integrity to the \nprogram.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for his explanation and for his \namendment because it is clear that through these waivers or through \nmoves by various States, without questioning their motives, they have \nbeen able to develop a system which is very unequal among the States.\n  I found, for instance, the reimbursement rate to the States--by the \nStates--as required by the States for Medicaid, for instance, varies \ngreatly from as low as 50 percent to as high as 80 percent. That is not \nfair, and we need to do something about it. I thank the Senator for \nyielding.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to, first, \nthe Bunning amendment, which is the one I particularly wish to talk \nabout because it is a direct attack on children in New Jersey. I did \nnot think I would come to the Senate and see such a refined focus on \nthe children of anyone's State. But that is what the Bunning amendment \ndoes.\n  I am sure I could draft amendments that would hone in on the \ninterests of any given State, but I do not think that is where we want \nto go as a Congress, as a Senate. I do not think that is particularly \ngood public policy. So right now I am fuming.\n  Let me start off by saying I thought this was one country. One \ncountry. There are a lot of things I have voted for in the Senate and \nin my 15 years in the Congress, in the other body before I came here, \nthat clearly did not specifically benefit my State, from crop disaster, \nto ethanol, I cannot get an E-85 pump in New Jersey; a whole host of \nthings for farmers and the list goes on and on.\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\n  I looked at it, I always looked at it as one country. Sometimes in \nthe allocation of resources there are certain needs that get taken care \nof in one part of the country, where in another part there are \ndifferent needs. Those amendments are an attack directly upon that \nnotion that this is one country.\n  I also think it is very easy to talk about income but never talk \nabout costs, as if living in one part of the country automatically \nmeans that those costs are the same in another part of the country. \nWell, they are not. We recognize that in a variety of laws in which we \ngive differentials to a whole host of different elements, from Federal \nemployees to differentials for the military to a whole host of people \nbased upon where they are stationed, because we recognize that, in \nfact, there are different costs of living in this country.\n  So it is interesting to talk about income but not talk about costs. \nYou know what I am for? Let's make sure anyone in the Senate--I am sure \neverybody here makes in excess of 350 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel. Let's eliminate health care for all of those that you ultimately \nget by virtue of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  Do you deserve health care more than children who happen to fall into \nthat category? These are the children of working families. They are not \npoor, as in not working, because if they were, they would get Medicaid. \nBut they are the children of those individuals who are working, and \nwork at some of the toughest jobs, and yet make an income that does not \nallow them to purchase health insurance and their job does not seem to \noffer health insurance.\n  There is a great universe of Americans whom we are trying to cover \nunder the Children's Health Insurance Program. I agree. What is the \ngoal? The goal is to cover children, children who do not have coverage \notherwise. Well, this is exactly what we seek to do.\n  Now, you know, in New Jersey, we do cover 126,000 children. And, yes, \nwe cover children up to 350 percent of the Federal poverty level. That \nmeans there are 3,000 New Jersey children who happen to fall in this \ncategory who are in the direct aim of the Bunning amendment, 3,000 \nchildren who today get health care who would be knocked out by virtue \nof the Bunning amendment, and there may be one or two other States that \nfocus on children as well.\n  My question is: Why are you targeting these children? What did they \ndo to you? What did they do to you? You know, the difference is, maybe \nif I lived in Kentucky, I could afford to get health care based upon \nthe incomes, but first of all, we have heard a lot of numbers bantered \naround here, some of which are clearly not true.\n  Three hundred fifty percent of the Federal poverty level is $60,095 \nfor a family of three. So it is not $82,000, as some suggest, for \nstarters. In fact, there is no child in this country, no child in this \ncountry covered up to that dollar amount--in the entire country. That \nis a scare tactic. It is shameful. We need to cover children up to 350 \npercent because New Jersey families face higher living costs.\n  They get less of their return on the Federal dollar, so again we \ncannot have a policy that doesn't take all of that into account. But \nlet my lay it out for you. At the top of New Jersey's current \neligibility level, a family might make somewhere around this $4,428.\n  Well, when you deduct housing costs in New Jersey, when you deduct \nfood costs, when you deduct transportation to get to work, and I think \na byproduct is that we want to, in our values, make sure we value the \nwelfare of these children we are talking about and their health care, \nwe also want to value work. One of the things these parents are doing \nis they are working. Now, they could not be working and be on welfare \nand ultimately be eligible for Medicaid. But we want to value work as \nwell. They are working.\n  So they have to get to work. They have child care costs. Here is what \nthe Department of Insurance in New Jersey says is the cost monthly--\nmonthly--for family care in New Jersey, for family health insurance: \n$2,065. Now, this does not have utility costs, this does not have \nclothing, this does not have any emergency expenses for the family. \nThis is no buffer. No buffer. What is the consequence of that to this \nfamily if they were trying to have health insurance? They would be in \nthe red each month by $1,200, which means that they simply will not \nhave health insurance, they simply will not have health insurance, and \nthese kids would not have health insurance.\n  Now, that is the goal of the program, to provide health insurance for \nchildren who are not so poor that they would get it under Medicaid, \nbut, in fact, are in a set of circumstances where because their parents \nwork, and not getting insurance at work, they find themselves in that \ncategory for which there is no coverage and no money to be covered by \nvirtue of their family income.\n  So it simply does not do it. It simply does not do it. It is basic \nmath. That is why New Jersey enrolls children up to 350 percent of the \nFederal poverty level, because if you live in New Jersey with that \nincome, without this coverage, children would not have health \ninsurance. Purchasing a private plan--no matter the tax incentives, I \nhave heard some of the tax incentives that are being offered. There is \nsome suggestion of a $5,000 tax credit. Great. Well, that is 2\\1/2\\ \nmonths of health care coverage in New Jersey.\n  What do we do for the rest of the time? Do we roll the dice? Are we \nsupposed to hope for the other 10 months they do not get sick, they do \nnot get preventative care? That is what our public policy is all about? \nThat is what our values are as a Senate, as a country? I do not think \nso.\n  Now, the fact of the matter is, I urge my colleagues to think about \nthis, because in New Jersey, you need to have $43,060 to purchase the \nsame goods in Kentucky for $32,669. That is about $11,000 more to do \nthe same thing as if you are living in Kentucky.\n  Now, the realty is, that is why one-size-fits-all does not work. I \nhave heard many times on the debates here: States know best, let's have \nflexibility.\n  Well, this is a perfect example of how that flexibility has given us \nthe wherewithal to cover children. I must say, I wish to warn my \ncolleagues that supporting the Bunning amendment is about dumping \nchildren off the Child Health Insurance Program. It is the beginning of \na slippery slope. So now we begin to eradicate those who are at 350 \npercent, we take them off; so then somebody comes up with another \namendment, let's do 300 percent, let's eliminate that; then let's bring \nsomeone else who brings in 275 percent, and then the list goes on and \non.\n  Before you know it, instead of having a program that covers more \nchildren in our country, we have less children covered. Less children \ncovered in our country. I believe that, in fact, what we want to do is \nquite different. That is why I respect what the Senate Finance \nCommittee did on a bipartisan basis. They looked at all the issues, all \nthe costs, they looked at the goal of achieving, insuring more children \nin our country, keeping those who are in the 6.6 million, adding \nanother 3.2 to 3.4 million, trying to reach the goal of insuring all \nour kids and doing it within a fiscal context that would allow it to \nhappen. That is what this is about. That is what this is supposed to be \nabout.\n  So I hope my colleagues do not join on the slippery slope that begins \nto cut back and cut back and cut back, that takes children off health \ncare coverage because it would set a precedent that I think none of us \nwould want to do at the end of the day, not only on children's health \nbut on other issues that may be critical to our States.\n  I think this is about a set of values in the Senate. What are our \nvalues? We hear so much about children are our future. Yet our values \nspeak to, if we pass this amendment, cutting children off health care, \neven though clearly there is a far greater cost to living in a State \nsuch as New Jersey than there is to living in a State such as Kentucky.\n  Now, there are a lot of things that go on in the Senate on different \nissues that clearly there is an appeal because of the nature of the \nunique challenges that States face. Well, we face a unique challenge. \nWe want to make sure our children who are already on--by the way, these \nare children who already have coverage, who will lose coverage as a \nresult of the Bunning amendment.\n  I am simply baffled. I thought we were about family values here. I\n\n[[Page S10366]]\n\nthought we were about protecting children. I thought we were about \nincreasing opportunity for children to ultimately be covered. I thought \nwe were about enhancing the quality of life and protecting life. \nObviously, it is the lives of children whom we are talking about, whom \nwe put at risk by knocking off their coverage.\n  So I find it embarrassing that some in Washington, some in the very \nSenate who have about the best health care coverage in the world can \ncome and offer amendments that they cannot live under, that they could \nnot live under if, in fact, they had to.\n  What Member of the Senate does not make more than 350 percent of the \nFederal poverty level? Do you not deserve to have the Government \nsubsidizing your health care? You should be out then. Let's have the \namendment make that happen too before you take 3,000 kids off the Child \nHealth Insurance Program. It is just incredible in my mind.\n  So I urge my colleagues, when the time comes, and I hope there will \nbe a timeframe when that amendment is to be pursued because I will be \nvigorous in pursuing it on the floor, that we do not head down the \nslope of pitting one part of our Nation against another, pitting the \nrealities of the difficulties of living in one part of our Nation \nversus the other, pitting children in one part of the Nation versus the \nother, pitting the very essence of preserving children and their health \nagainst some simple formula number that ultimately Members of this body \ncould not live under themselves.\n  I think if it is good enough for us, it is good enough for these \nchildren. I would not want to see a vote that ultimately undermines the \nability of thousands of children who presently get health care under \nthis program to be eliminated. That would be a dark day in the Senate's \nhistory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, notwithstanding an earlier agreement, I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Obama be recognized to speak next \nand, following Senator Obama, Senator Lott be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, let me begin by thanking the Senator from \nMississippi for allowing me to speak first. I appreciate his courtesy.\n  I also congratulate the Senator from New Jersey for his outstanding \nstatement, sentiments which I fully share.\n  I will be brief.\n  As I have traveled across the country during these past several \nmonths, there are few issues that show a greater disconnect between \nwhat the American people want and the way Washington works than health \ncare. Every single year people put it at the very top of the list of \ntheir concerns. Every year more people lose their insurance or watch \ntheir premiums skyrocket or open up medical bills they can't pay. Yet \nwhenever the issue actually comes up in Washington, they watch health \ncare debates play out that are filled with half truths and scare \ntactics. They see insurance companies run ads telling folks they will \nlose their doctor or wait forever if universal health care is passed. \nThey watch the industry spend billions on lobbyists who use undue \ninfluence to block much needed reform. At the end of the day, nothing \ngets done, and we move on to fight about something else.\n  To most Americans, we seem completely disconnected from the reality \nthey are living every single day, especially when we have a President \nwho has actually said, and I quote:\n\n       I mean, people have access to health care in America. After \n     all, you just go to an emergency room.\n\n  That is what passes for universal health care in the greatest, \nwealthiest country on earth--overcrowded, understaffed emergency rooms \nthat raise everyone's premiums and cost taxpayers more money. It is \nshameful. What is even more shameful is that 9 million of the Americans \nwho are forced to wait in emergency rooms when they get sick, who have \nno health insurance at all, are children--children who did not choose \nwhere they were born or how much money their parents have, children \nwhose development depends on the care and nourishment they receive in \nthose early years, children whom any parent anywhere should want to \nprotect at any cost.\n  We can shade the truth and pretend there are only 1 million \nuninsured, as the President says. We can make excuses for this neglect, \nwe can start getting into an ideological argument, or we can just \nignore the problem altogether. But as long as there are 9 million \nchildren in the United States with no health insurance, it is a \nbetrayal of the ideals we hold as Americans. It is not who we are, and \ntoday is our chance to prove it.\n  We know CHIP works. Because of CHIP, 6 million children who would \notherwise be uninsured have health care today. Because of CHIP, \nmillions of children are protected when their parents lose their health \ncare. Because of CHIP, individual States such as my home State of \nIllinois are building on its success to expand health coverage even \nfurther. And because of CHIP, millions of children with asthma, \ntraumatic injuries, and mental health conditions are able to see a \ndoctor and get the treatment they need.\n  Even though the uninsured rate among low-income children fell by more \nthan one-third in the years after CHIP was enacted, the trend reversed \n2 years ago. Since then, we have seen growing numbers of uninsured \nchildren. That is why I am always puzzled when we start getting into \nthese debates that are ideologically driven about whether Government \nshould provide coverage. If market-based solutions provided affordable \ncoverage options for these children, then it wouldn't be necessary for \nthe Government to help provide coverage, because these children \nwouldn't be uninsured. The reason they are uninsured is because their \nparents can't afford private coverage.\n  Uninsured children are twice as likely as insured children to miss \nout on much needed medical care, including doctor visits and checkups. \nOne-quarter of uninsured children don't get any medical care at all. \nThose who do get lower quality care. Even with the same illness and \nconditions, whether it is an ear infection or appendicitis, studies \nhave found that uninsured children get different treatment and often \nsuffer more as a result. One study even found that uninsured children \nwho are admitted to a hospital with injuries are twice as likely to die \nas children who are admitted with health insurance.\n  To put this problem in the larger context, we know that when a child \ngets sick and can't get treated or receives inadequate treatment, he \nmisses more days of school. When he misses more days of school, he \nbegins to do worse relative to his peers. That can have long-term \nconsequences on his chances in life. That is not something I want for \neither of my two young daughters or for any American child. This body \nshould not want it for any child either.\n  Let's get serious and solve this problem. Let's reauthorize CHIP. \nLet's make sure that the 6 million children who are now covered through \nthe program continue to be covered. Let's extend coverage to an \nadditional 3.2 million uninsured children.\n  We also know the question of children's health care is tied to the \nlarger question of universal care in this country. Because we know that \nwhen we cover parents, we also cover children. That is something we \nhave seen in Illinois. When I was a State senator, I was able to help \nextend health care coverage to an additional 150,000 parents and their \nchildren. So if we are serious about covering every child, at some \npoint we are going to have to cover every parent as well.\n  The American people have been waiting for us to act on health care \nfor far too long. Starting by covering more children should not be a \ndifficult issue to agree on. I urge every Senator to vote for this \nbill. I know the President has threatened to use his veto, which he has \nso sparingly used, to deny health insurance to America's children. I \nurge my colleagues to stand and fight that veto every which way we can. \nThere is not a single person here who, if their child were sick and \nthey couldn't afford health insurance, wouldn't be begging the \nGovernment to give them some help. We wouldn't be having these \narguments. Let's show some empathy for the families out there, many of \nwhom are working every single day, sometimes working\n\n[[Page S10367]]\n\ntwo jobs and still don't have health insurance. Let's make sure they \nhave what every parent wants, which is some assurance that if their \nchild gets ill, they are going to receive the kind of care they \ndeserve.\n\n  Let's cover our children and remind the American people who we are \nand why they sent us here in the first place.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we were alternating back and forth on both \nsides, but the Senator from Illinois had a need to go forward. I agreed \nthat he would go first and then I would follow.\n  Let me say on the bill we have here, again, it is very easy to get up \nand talk about children and the need to help children. That affects us \nall. I am a parent. I am a grandparent. There is nothing that excites \nme more in the world than going to see my four little grandchildren. I \ncan't stand the thought of children anywhere, regardless of income \nlevel, not getting the kind of health care they need. That is why I \nvoted for SCHIP in 1997. I remember Senator Kennedy was in the debate. \nSenator Phil Gramm of Texas had a little different point of view. \nSenator Hatch was involved. We came to a conclusion. We got a good \nprogram to help children who did not have health care. I thought we had \ndone a good thing.\n  The problem here is, we are exploding the program in terms of costs, \ntax increases, or cuts in the House. They are not doing the tobacco tax \nincrease. They are cutting Medicare Advantage which affects people at \nthe other end of the age schedule, people who need Medicare Advantage \nto get health care in rural areas in States such as mine.\n  There is a balance here. Why can't we agree on a reasonable increase \nto make sure we continue to cover children who would not be covered \notherwise. Also what is happening here is a steady march toward higher \nand higher and higher income level children. You heard Senator Allard \ntalk about the fact, now we are up in the range of $73,000 income for a \nfamily of four. The ultimate goal is for all children to be covered by \n``Mother Washington,'' Washington bureaucracy health care. Why should \nany family have to worry, regardless of income, or any State have to \nworry about children being covered of all ages, forever, for \neverything, including dental care?\n  I agree, dental needs can be as damaging healthwise as any other \nillness. I am connected to a family of dentists, dental hygienists, and \ndental technicians. But the question is, how much can the Government \npay for? Why can't we keep some limits? Why do we want to force people \noff of private insurance? We are going to have children now covered by \nprivate insurance going into SCHIP or Medicaid. Why are we trying to \nforce everybody on to SCHIP?\n  This chart shows what is happening. When we started this program in \n1997, the next year, 1998, the children enrollment in Medicaid and \nSCHIP, the children's health program, was 27 percent covered by \nMedicaid, 1 percent was covered by the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, and 72 percent by other programs including private insurance. \nBy 2005, it had grown to 37 percent covered by Medicaid, 8 percent by \nthe CHIP program, and 55 percent other. With this bill, the underlying \nbill going into effect the way it is now, it will jump to 71 percent of \nall children will be covered by Medicaid and SCHIP, and only 29 percent \nother. You see the steady march toward every child being covered by \nthis particular program.\n  The problem with this bill can be described with A, B, C. Not only \nhave you had the steady march of higher and higher income level \nchildren being covered, adults are being covered. Where is the ``A'' in \nSCHIP? Again, it is a creeping thing. First, gee whiz, yes, it is \nsupposed to be for children, but pregnant mothers should be covered and \nwhat about parents of children. There are some other adults that maybe \nneed some extra consideration, too. So it is not only higher and higher \nincome children, it is adults and more adults and even more adults. So \nthe first appropriate problem is adults, A.\n  B, we are talking billions here. The underlying program is $25 \nbillion. The Finance Committee adds 35 at a minimum on top of that. And \nin the outyears it expands tremendously, up to, I think in the year \n2012, the number is maybe 37 billion in that single year. Remember, if \nwe pass the Finance Committee bill, that 60 billion--25 plus 35, it \nwill be 60 billion--the House is going to pass a bill at what, 80, 90, \n100 billion, paid for by taking money away from Medicare beneficiaries \nand we go to conference, if we go to conference. What will happen? What \nalways happens, you split the difference. We are at 60; they are at 90. \nHow about 75, $75 billion? How is that going to be paid for? It is \ngoing to be paid for by cutting benefits for the elderly and/or raising \ntaxes for all kinds of people.\n  We can fix this, though. It gets back to the A, B, C. Keep to the \ncore mission, children who are low-income families. We need to get back \nto that. We have some good amendments pending. We should pass the \nBunning amendment which would eliminate the high income eligibility \nabove 300 percent, the Allard amendment which would stop the income \ndisregards which drives the income level up steadily, and I understand \nthat Senator Gregg will have one that will strike the adult coverage.\n  We can fix this. We could get together on a bill that would be \nbipartisan and would help the children who do need it, the ones we \nstarted out to help before we got the bright idea we will cover \neverybody by the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I was wondering if the Senator would \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I see the Senator from Wyoming. I want \nto address the Senate for a minute, but I want to inquire of the good \nSenator from Mississippi if I could engage him in a question or two.\n  I listened with great interest to the Senator from Mississippi \ntalking about the cost of this program and the paying of this program. \nDoes the Senator agree with me that every Member of the Senate has a \nhealth insurance program that is funded and financed 72 percent by the \nFederal taxpayer? Does the Senator agree with me on that?\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, we do have a program that has input from \nthe Treasury, yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the input is 72 percent for every Member in our \nhealth insurance program. Every Member's program, Republican and \nDemocrat, is paid for by the American taxpayer, No. 1. Secondly----\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, if I can respond, I have a solution. Let's cut that. \nMaybe we are not entitled to that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator wants to offer that amendment, fine. I \nhear him talk about children, but I do not hear him talk about that.\n  Secondly, would the Senator not agree with me that Members of the \nSenate have access to Bethesda Naval Hospital and Walter Reed Hospital \nand virtually free care at those places, which the children of America \ndo not have? Would the Senator not agree with me that we are treating \nMembers of Congress one way and the children another way?\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, now, Madam President, I might say, the Senator has \nbeen here much longer than I have, and I presume he would know the \norigin of how these programs were created and voted for or against \nthem. But I want to correct something he said right at the beginning. I \nhave not advocated cutting children. I advocate covering the children \nwho are now covered and making sure we cover the children we have \ncommitted to. What I am opposed to is the ever increasing income level \nand number of children and adults.\n  What about adults who are being covered by this program? If it is \ngoing to be ``ACHIP,'' adults-children health insurance program, that \nis one thing. But I would like to keep the focus on covering the \nchildren who really need it and would not be able to get it perhaps \nthrough a private insurance program or in Medicaid.\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\n  But if the Senator wants to propose we cut the Senator's benefits, I \nwill be glad to join him in that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am for having a universal----\n  Mr. LOTT. Everything we are doing to ourselves, we might as well do \nthat too. That would be fine with me. If we could control the growth of \nthis program, I would be more than glad to help pay for it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for one more question. He was \ntalking about coverage. We have 9 million children who are not covered. \nAll of our children are covered. We have $160,000 in income, and every \none of our children is covered. Why is the Senator so concerned about \ntrying to cover the remaining children who are not covered in this \ncountry? Under this program, we cover 4 million more. All of our \nchildren are covered. We have $160,000 in income.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am perfectly delighted to do that. Of course, my children \nare grown, and they are not covered at all by this, but I would be \nglad, to control that, to do anything the Senator wants to do to the \nSenate. I suspect it richly deserves it.\n  And another thing, what I am saying is, one State is only covering \nchildren up to 200 percent, other States now have 350 percent, or even \none of them is now wanting 400 percent of poverty for children and \nadults.\n  All I am saying is, stick with the program we intended. Let's not \nturn this into just a Washington bureaucratic health-run program. That \nis what this is all about. This is about moving us toward a system we \ncould not get any other way, where the Government will pay for and \ncontrol everything in terms of health coverage in America. I do not \nbelieve the American people want it.\n  I worry about my children and grandchildren in this respect. What \nkind of burden are we putting on their backs in terms of what they will \nhave to pay for in the future? Does nobody ever think about that \nanymore? Every program is growing exponentially; every one of them. So \nI worry about my grandchildren having to pay for all the things we are \ncoming up with here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the Senate has been very gracious in \nworking out times. Two Democratic Senators spoke, and Senator Lott had \nthe floor. So I ask consent now that the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nBarrasso, be able to speak--that would be two Republicans in a row--and \nfollowing him, if he wishes, that Senator Kennedy be recognized to give \na statement on the bill for about 15 minutes. I thank the Senator.\n  So I ask consent that Senator Barrasso be recognized, and following \nSenator Barrasso that Senator Kennedy be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Today, I rise to speak about health care for children. We are talking \nabout the SCHIP program, and I come to the floor with great interest \nbecause the ``S'' in SCHIP stands for State, and the ``C'' stands for \nchildren.\n  For the last 5 years, I spent time in the Wyoming Legislature on the \nLabor, Health, and Social Services Committee, where we worked closely \non the issue of children's health, and specifically worked closely with \nSCHIP.\n  I have been a fan and a supporter of children's health, and \nspecifically of SCHIP. In Wyoming, SCHIP has been a very successful \nprogram. In Wyoming, right now, there are over 5,000 young people who \nare in this program. Madam President, 5,642 was our count in July. We \ncall the program Kid Care. That is because kids can be born with club \nfeet. Kids can fall at the playground. Kids can have problems with \nmeasles or mumps.\n  Nationwide, this very successful program has covered over 6 million \nchildren. It is a good program. Some folks confuse SCHIP with Medicaid. \nThey are very different. Medicaid is designed for people below the \npoverty level. SCHIP is for people above the poverty level, but in that \nincome range of up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. For us, \nthat is an income of about $40,000 a year for a family of four.\n  In Wyoming, if you talk to anyone in the legislature, from both \nparties, they will tell you this program has been cost effective. It is \nnot an entitlement. It is done through a combined partnership with Blue \nCross-Blue Shield, a public-private partnership. It covers the people \nin Wyoming who are intended to be covered.\n  Many Government programs do not work well or produce results. Yet \nSCHIP very successfully achieved what it set out to do about 10 years \nago when the program began. We have significantly reduced the number of \nuninsured children in America. It has worked. That is why I want to be \nclear from the outset, as we go into this debate, I am 100 percent \ncommitted to reauthorizing this very important safety net program for \nkids. I strongly supported the program as a State senator. I will \ncontinue to do so in my capacity as a U.S. Senator.\n  Madam President, 5,642 Wyoming children depend on SCHIP right now to \nstay healthy. There are additional young people in our State who are \neligible for SCHIP but who are not yet enrolled. So I want to do more \nin terms of outreach, working on outreach and enrollment efforts to \nfind these people, to target these low-income children, and get them \nenrolled in the program.\n  I want to support and enhance public-private collaborations to make \nsure we are doing the most cost-effective, efficient, and quality \nhealth care possible for these young people, but mostly I want to make \nsure this Senate and this Congress produces a reasonable, commonsense \npiece of legislation that we can send to the President and that he will \nsign.\n  I have concerns with the bill that is in front of us. This bill, this \npiece of legislation, reported out of the Finance Committee, takes a \nsuccessful spending program and uses it as a vehicle to create a new \nentitlement. The bill that I look at today covers high-income people, \ncovers people who already have insurance, and covers adults. To me, \nthis bill should be all about children.\n  Well, let's look at those three concerns.\n  High-income people: This bill allows families at 400 percent of the \npoverty level to be covered. In New York State, that is an income of \n$82,600 a year. In New Jersey, 350 percent of the poverty level is an \nincome of over $72,000 a year. At home in Wyoming, we play by the \nrules. It is 200 percent of the poverty level. That is what we need. \nThat is what works.\n  Are there kids in New York and New Jersey who need to be covered? Of \ncourse. There are kids everywhere who need to be covered. But why the \ndifferent rules for different States? And why so many high-income \npeople as part of the program?\n  So that is No. 1.\n  No. 2, people who already have health insurance: When you start to \ncover children in families above that 200 percent of the poverty level, \nmany of those children are in families where they already have \ninsurance. Madam President, 77 percent of the children in families \nbetween 200 and 300 percent of the poverty level have private health \ninsurance. When you go above that, above the 300 percent level, between \n300 and 400 percent of the Federal poverty level, 89 percent of those \nchildren are in families where they have private health insurance.\n  When you do the math and look at the numbers, people in those \ncategories will be financially compelled to take their children off of \nthe private, usually employer-sponsored health care plans, and put them \non the taxpayer-supported plans.\n  The Congressional Budget Office looked at this, and they think, with \nthis plan, 2.1 million people will move from private coverage to \nGovernment dependency, if this legislation is enacted.\n  This is supposed to be a program to help children, children who do \nnot have health insurance. It seems as if some in this body may be \ntrying to use this plan to nationalize health insurance.\n  The third thing I see that is a concern with this plan is in some \nplaces it covers adults, not just children. It covers the parents of \nchildren. Nowhere--nowhere--in the word ``SCHIP'' is there the letter \n``A'' for adults. The ``C'' stands for children.\n  This country does need to have a serious debate on health care, and \nit should not be on the backs of these children covered under SCHIP. In \nthe future, we need to debate health care\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\nin America, how we pay for health care, how we encourage people to \nbetter care for themselves, to take more responsibility for their own \nhealth, what incentives we can have for people to stay well, how \ninsurance is used in this Nation. Should it be deductible for all, \ninstead of just in businesses and not by individuals? Should there be \ntax credits? Is there a way we can set up small business health plans \nto help people who need insurance?\n  I find that people are very thoughtful when it comes to how they \nspend their own money. So often, in the medical world, very few people \nspend the same kind of time making those financial decisions as they do \nwhen they are spending money out of their own pocket, when it is a \nthird-party payer who is doing the spending.\n  In the future, we need to have a debate and discussion about how we \nhandle medical errors in this country: No. 1, how to prevent them from \never happening; and, No. 2, how to deal with the fact that when they \noccur, we want to make sure people are taken care of quickly, and that \nanything that goes to them goes more to the injured party than it does \nto the system.\n  We need to find ways to lower the significant cost in America of \ndefensive medicine.\n  These are all very serious issues. They all deserve a serious \nnational debate, and that day will come. But the bill today wrongly \nattempts to massively expand a successful program under excessive \nspending for many people who do not need it, and it avoids a debate we \nneed to have on health care in America.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I believe I have 15 minutes. Am I \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is not limited.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Madam President, I think the floor manager \nintended to yield me 15 minutes, for which I am very grateful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask my friend, how long does he wish \nto speak, 15, 20 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Fifteen minutes.\n  I see the Senator from Connecticut on the floor. I know we had \naccommodated the Senator from Illinois a short while ago. I do not mind \naccommodating him. I see, then, the Senator from Kentucky on the floor.\n  Could I ask my friend from Kentucky, if we do not exceed 15 minutes, \nwould he mind if I yielded a few minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut? We basically are going from one side to the other.\n  Mr. BUNNING. To the Senator from Connecticut? That would be perfectly \nall right, just so long as I get the time that was allotted to me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, if it is agreeable with the floor \nmanager, I would take 11 minutes and yield the Senator 4 minutes, if \nthat is OK. Would the Chair remind me when I have used 10 minutes and I \nhave 1 minute left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, many of the best ideas in public policy \nare the simplest.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program is based on one simple and \npowerful idea--that all children deserve a healthy start in life, and \nthat no parents should have to worry about whether they can afford to \ntake their child to the doctor when the child is sick. CHIP can make \nthe difference between a child starting life burdened with disease, or \na child who is healthy and ready to learn and grow.\n  This need not be a partisan issue. My good friend Senator Hatch and I \nworked together in 1997 to create this program that was our shared \nvision for a healthier future for American children. This year we have \nonce again worked together to find common ground on covering the \nchildren who deserve decent, quality health care.\n  In Massachusetts in the 1990s we agreed that health care coverage for \nchildren is a necessity and that action needed to be taken. In 1993, \nthe Massachusetts Legislature passed the Children's Medical Security \nPlan, which guaranteed quality health care to children in families \nineligible for Medicaid and unable to afford health insurance.\n  A year later, Massachusetts expanded eligibility for Medicaid and \nfinanced the expansion through a tobacco tax--the same approach we used \nsuccessfully a few years later for CHIP and he same approach that is \nproposed in the bill before us now.\n  Rhode Island followed and other States took similar action and helped \ncreate a nationwide demand for action by Congress to address the unmet \nneeds of vast numbers of children for good health care.\n  In 1997, Congress acted on that call, and the result was CHIP. \nSenator Hatch and I worked together then--as we have this year--to \nfocus on guaranteeing health care to children who need it. Now, in \nevery State in America and in Puerto Rico, CHIP covers the services \nthat give children a healthier start in life--well child care, \nvaccinations, doctor visits, emergency services, and many others.\n  We know that CHIP works. Children across America depend on it for \ntheir health care, but there are still too many children that are left \nuninsured.\n  In its first year 1997, CHIP enrolled nearly a million children, and \nenrollment has grown ever since. An average of 4 million are now \ncovered each month, and 6 million are enrolled each year. In every \nState in America and in Puerto Rico, CHIP covers the services that give \nchildren a healthier start in life--well child care, vaccinations, \ndoctor visits, emergency services, and many others.\n  As a result, in the past decade, the percentage of uninsured children \nhas dropped from almost 23 percent in 1997 to 14 percent today. That \nreduction is significant, but it is obviously far from enough.\n  Children on CHIP are more likely to have a regular source of care \nthan uninsured children. Ninety-seven percent of CHIP children can see \na doctor regularly compared to only 62 percent of uninsured children.\n  What does this mean for these children? It means that their overall \nquality of life is improved because they can get the care they need \nwhen they need it. Their parents are more confident that they can get \nthe health care they need, they are more likely to have a real doctor \nand a real place to obtain care, and their parents don't delay seeking \ncare when their child needs it. Children on CHIP also have \nsignificantly more access to preventive care.\n  Studies also show that CHIP helps to improve children's school \nperformance. After just 1 year on CHIP, children pay better attention \nin class and are more likely to keep up with all school activities. \nWhen children are receiving the health care they need, they do better \nacademically, emotionally, physically and socially. CHIP helps create \nchildren who will be better prepared to contribute to America.\n  CHIP has perhaps had the greatest impact on minority communities. \nSadly, we still have persistent racial and ethnic health disparities in \nAmerica. African Americans have a lower life expectancy than Whites. \nMany Americans want to believe such disparities don't exist, but \nignoring them only contributes more to the widening gap between the \nhaves and have-nots. Minority children are much more likely to suffer \nfrom asthma, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and other diseases than their White \ncounterparts.\n  Minorities are more likely to be uninsured than Whites. More than \nhalf of all children who receive public health insurance belong to a \nracial and ethnic minority group. The good news is that since the \nbeginning of CHIP, the number of uninsured Latino children has \ndecreased by nearly one-third and the number of uninsured African-\nAmerican children has decreased by almost half.\n  Having CHIP works for minority children. CHIP all but eliminates the \ndistressing racial and ethnic health disparities for the minority \nchildren who disproportionately depend on it for their coverage. \nMinority children are more likely to have their health care needs met. \nIn other word, they can see the doctor when they need to, go to the \nhospital and get the medicines they need, just like other children, \nwhen they are on CHIP.\n  They are also more likely to have a real doctor--not just sporadic \nvisits to the emergency room--when they are covered by CHIP.\n  For specific diseases like asthma, children on CHIP have much better \noutcomes than when they were uninsured.\n  CHIP's success is even more impressive and important when we realize\n\n[[Page S10370]]\n\nthat more and more adults are losing their own insurance coverage, \nbecause employers reduce it or drop it entirely.\n  That is why organizations representing children, or the health care \nprofessionals who serve them, agree that preserving and strengthening \nCHIP is essential to children's health. The American Academy of \nPediatrics, First Focus, the American Medical Association, the National \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals and countless other organizations \ndedicated to children all strongly support CHIP.\n  A statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics puts it this way:\n\n       Ennrollment in SCHIP is associated with improved access, \n     continuity, and quality of care, and a reduction in racial/\n     ethnic disparities. As pediatricians, we see what happens \n     when children don't receive necessary health care services \n     such as immunizations and well-child visits. Their overall \n     health suffers and expensive emergency room visits increase.\n\n  Today, we are here to dedicate ourselves to carrying on the job begun \nby Congress 10 years ago, and to make sure that the lifeline of CHIP is \nstrengthened and extended to many more children.\n  Millions of children now eligible for CHIP or Medicaid are not \nenrolled in these programs. Of the 9 million uninsured children, over \ntwo-thirds--more than 6 million--are already eligible for Medicaid or \nCHIP. These programs are there to help them, but these children are not \nreceiving that help either because their parents don't know about the \nprograms, or because of needless barriers to enrollment.\n  Think about that number--9 million children in the wealthiest and \nmost powerful nation on Earth. Nine million children whose only family \ndoctor is the hospital emergency room. Nine million children at risk of \nblighted lives and early death because of illnesses that could easily \nbe treated if they have a regular source of medical care.\n  Nine million uninsured children in America isn't just wrong--it is \noutrageous, and we need to change it as soon as possible.\n  We know where the Bush administration stands. The President's \nproposal for CHIP doesn't provide what is needed to cover children who \nare eligible but unenrolled. In fact, the President's proposal is $8 \nbillion less than what is needed simply to keep children now enrolled \nin CHIP from losing their current coverage--$8 billion short. To make \nmatters worse, the President has threatened to veto the Senate bill \nwhich does the job that needs to be done if we are serious about \nguaranteeing decent health care to children of working families across \nAmerica.\n  We cannot rely on the administration to do what is needed. We in \nCongress have to step up to the plate and renew our commitment to CHIP.\n  The Senate bill is a genuine bipartisan compromise.\n  It provides coverage to 4 million children who would otherwise be \nuninsured.\n  It adjusts the financing structure of CHIP so that States that are \ncovering their children aren't forced to scramble for additional funds \nfrom year to year and so that Congress doesn't have to pass a new band-\naid every year to stop the persistent bleeding under the current \nprogram.\n  Importantly, this bill will not allow States to keep their CHIP funds \nif they aren't doing something to actually cover children.\n  Equally important, this bill allows each State to cover children at \nincome levels that make sense for their State.\n  The bill also supports quality improvement and better outreach and \nenrollment efforts for the program. It is a scandal that 6 million \nchildren today who are eligible for the program are not enrolled in it.\n  In sum, this bill moves us forward together, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, to guarantee the children of America the health care \nthey need and deserve.\n  Our priority should be not merely to hold on to the gains of the \npast, but to see that all children have an access to decent coverage. \nFamilies with greater means should pay a fair share of the coverage. \nBut every parent in America should have the opportunity to meet the \nhealth care needs of their children.\n  In Massachusetts, I met a woman named Dedre Lewis. Her daughter \nAlexsiana developed an eye disease that if left untreated would make \nher go blind. Because of our State CHIP program, Masshealth, Dedre is \nable to get the medicine and doctors visits need to prevent Alexsiana's \nblindness. Dedre said this:\n\n       If I miss a single appointment, I know she could lose her \n     eyesight. If I can't buy her medication, I know she could \n     lose her eyesight. If I didn't have Masshealth, my daughter \n     would be blind.\n\n  This is the impact CHIP has on families across America.\n  Let me say that quality health for children isn't just an interesting \noption or a nice idea. It is not just something we wish we could do. It \nis an obligation. It is something we have to do. And it is something we \ncan do today. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure \nthis very important legislation is enacted.\n  I want to pick up on a theme I mentioned just a few minutes ago, and \nI stand to be corrected. I would say there is not a single Member of \nthe Senate who doesn't take, effectively, the Federal employees \ninsurance program, and in our situation, the Federal Government pays \nfor 72 percent of it. We have one Member, and I admire him--I have just \nlearned of his name, and I will not mention it here; I will ask whether \nI can include it as part of the Record rather than embarrass him--but \nit is a noble act on his part when he said that until we get universal \ncoverage, he wasn't going to take this.\n  But the idea that all Americans ought to understand now is what we \nare standing for--and I again commend the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Iowa and my friend, Senator Hatch, when we worked together \nyears ago, and Senator Rockefeller on this program--is a rather simple \nand fundamental concept, and that is this: Every child in America ought \nto have a healthy start.\n  Here in the Senate, we are about expressing priorities. Those of us \non this side of the aisle and a group on the other side--a small group \non the other side, a courageous group on the other side--have stated \nthat same concept, that every child in America should have a healthy \nstart, No. 1; and No. 2, that every parent in America should be \nrelieved of the anxiety of worrying about whether they have sufficient \nresources to be able to make sure their child is going to receive \ndecent quality health care. Those are revolutionary thoughts, are they \nnot? Those are surprising concepts; isn't that right?\n  Evidently, our friends on the other side of the aisle get all worked \nup about those two concepts--that all children in this country should \nhave a healthy start and that mothers and fathers should be relieved of \nthe anxiety that when their child has an earache or their child has a \nsoar throat or their child has a headache, they have to wonder whether \ntheir child is 150 dollars or 175 dollars sick because that is what it \ncosts to take them to the emergency room. So they wait overnight. They \nlet the child get a little sicker. They have a sleepless night. They \nworry. They hope and they pray that their child gets better. Well, we \nin this body say that America can do better.\n  I listened to my friend--and he is my friend--from Mississippi \ntalking about the cost of this program: $60 billion over 5 years. That \nis what we are spending in 5 months in Iraq--5 months in Iraq. What \nwould the American people rather have--coverage for their children or a \ncontinued conflict in Iraq where we are losing the blood of our young \nmen and women? This is the issue. Let's not complicate it. Let's not \nmake it difficult. Let's not make it unreasonable. That is what this is \nabout.\n  Sure, we have listened to the arguments: Oh, someone is going to have \nto pay for it. Yes, it is going to be those who are smoking. What is \nthe result of increasing the tobacco tax? What is the direct result? \nTobacco--cigarettes--when used as advertised increases deaths in \nAmerica. Among whom? Among children. Every day, 2,800 children become \naddicted. Every year, 500,000 people die because of the use of tobacco. \nSo what happens if we raise the tax 61 cents on cigarettes? You know \nwhat happens. Children stop smoking. Oh, they do? Yes, they do. Who \nsays so? Who says so? Just look at the history of what has happened \nwhen we have increased the tax on cigarettes.\n  So I commend those on the Finance Committee for finding a revenue \nmeasure that will ensure--not that all children will stop smoking and \nend it but\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\nthat this will be a major disincentive for young people to smoke. On \nthe other hand, it gives children a healthy start and relieves the \nanxiety for parents.\n  So this is a measure which speaks for action. It speaks for justice. \nIt speaks for fairness. It speaks for our values. I, for one, strongly \nbelieve in the concept of comprehensive health care, and we will have \nthat debate at another place and at another time.\n  I know my children were covered. They are grown now, as others have \nbeen here, but I know when they needed health care, they were able to \nreceive it. I remember very clearly that when my child lost his leg to \ncancer, we saw families in that chamber who were absolutely driven into \npoverty because they couldn't afford the same kind of health care we \nhad.\n  This is a statement that we in the Senate find children to be a \npriority and find their parents to be a priority and find it to be in \nthe interest of children to increase the tobacco tax.\n  This legislation makes a great deal of sense, and I again commend the \nsponsors for it.\n  Whatever time remains I yield to my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to begin my comments by thanking \nour colleague from Massachusetts once again for giving heart to an \nargument that sometimes gets lost in statistics and numbers.\n  As all of us know, every one of us has watched either fellow Members \nor others--our staffs or constituents--who have gone through the \ndreaded situation of watching a child in need of health care. We know \nhow fortunate we are to be Members of Congress, as we receive a \ntremendous amount of support for health care services. The fact that we \nare living in a day and age in the 21st century when so many of our \nchildren, growing numbers in our society, are without any kind of \nhealth care coverage at all. It is shameful, to put it mildly. I \ncommend the distinguished Senator from Montana, the chair of the \nFinance Committee, and once again the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis tremendous support of this effort.\n  I wish to offer an amendment at the appropriate time. As many of my \ncolleagues know, over a period of 7 years, three Presidents, and two \nPresidential vetoes, I worked toward passage of the Family Medical \nLeave Act. It finally became law in 1993. Today, more than 50 million \nAmericans have been able to take advantage of the protections of that \nlaw. It is related to the subject matter of the bill at hand, a little \nbit off center, but it's about caring for our families.\n  Last week, Senator Dole along with Donna Shalala and others, offered \nrecommendations from the President's Commission on Care for America's \nReturning Wounded Warriors. They urged Congress to draft legislation to \nallow up to 6 months of family and medical leave for family members of \ntroops who have sustained combat-related injuries and meet the other \neligibility requirements of the law. We believe this is a worthwhile \nproposal, so I introduced the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act \nlast week with several of my colleagues.\n  I am very grateful to Senator Dole, a former colleague of ours, and \nthe entire Commission for their thoughtful work on this crucial issue.\n  For 20 years, we have worked on legislation to extend family and \nmedical leave to families in this country. So I hope that at the \nappropriate time, my amendment on this matter will be considered and \nunanimously adopted. There may be an argument on germaneness, but we \ncan't wait to help the men and women who are injured in service to our \ncountry. I can't think of a more appropriate step for us to take than \nto allow these veterans who are recovering from their wounds to have a \nloved one with them during that period of recovery.\n  I wanted to lay out for my colleagues the value of this amendment, \nhow valuable the protections of family and medical leave have been for \nfamilies. In fact, we have introduced legislation to provide paid \nfamily and medical leave. I won't be offering that at this juncture, \nbut now offer an extended unpaid leave program. My amendment would \nsimply extend the period of job protection for up to six months for \nthose who care for our returning heroes as they recover from their \ninjuries. The reasons are obvious.\n  In the Wounded Warriors Commission survey, 33 percent of Active-Duty \nand 22 percent of Reserve components and 37 percent of retired/\nseparated servicemembers report that family members or close friends \nrelocated for extended periods of time to be with them while they were \nin the hospital. Twenty-one percent of Active-Duty, 15 percent of \nReserve components, and 24 percent of retired/separated servicemembers \nsay friends or family gave up a job to be with them or act as their \ncaregiver.\n  It seems to me they shouldn't have to give up a job in order to be \nwith a recuperating servicemember coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan. \nThe Commission's findings indicate the critical role that family and \nfriends play in the recovery of our wounded servicemembers. Currently \nFMLA provides for 3 months of job-protected unpaid leave to a spouse, \nparent or child acting as a caregiver for a person with a serious \nillness. The report indicates that many servicemembers rely on other \nfamily members or friends to care for them. My amendment allows these \nother caregivers--siblings, cousins, friends or significant others to \ntake leave for up to six months, when our returning heroes need them \nthe most, without fear of losing their jobs. My amendment goes beyond \nsome other proposals in other ways as well. It covers caregivers \nstaying with the recovering servicemember in a military hospital as \nwell as those providing care at home. This proposal would apply to all \nindividuals currently covered by FMLA, including federal civil \nservants, who might find themselves caring for a wounded warrior.\n  My amendment only addresses servicemembers with combat-related \ninjuries. This is a narrow universe of individuals who experience \nextraordinary circumstances. Taking care of our soldiers, sailors, \nairman and Marines returning from Iraq and Afghanistan was the point of \nthe Commission and the Wounded Warriors Act that we recently passed. I \ncan't think of anything more important that we could do this week \nbefore August break than to pass a proposal that would provide these \nservice men and women the opportunity to have a loved one with them as \nthey recover.\n  I send my amendment to the desk. I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts for his tireless work, the Senator from Montana, of \ncourse, and the Senator from Iowa, who have worked hard on children's \nissues, and ask them to consider this amendment at the appropriate \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I would like to talk about the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, also known as SCHIP.\n  A few weeks ago, the Finance Committee passed the Baucus bill to \nreauthorize this program. I did not support this bill in committee and \nI will not be supporting it on the floor. Today, I would like to take a \nfew minutes to explain my concerns with the Baucus bill. I would also \nlike to talk about the SCHIP reauthorization bill I will be supporting \nthis week and have helped to craft over the past couple of months--the \nKids First Act.\n  This bill is a good piece of legislation that reauthorizes this \nimportant program in a fiscally sound way and keeps the focus of the \nprogram on what it was originally for, which is low-income children.\n  I have significant concerns with the budget gimmicks used, the SCHIP \nprovisions, and the tax increases in the Baucus bill. The budget \ngimmick used to fund the Baucus bill is irresponsible, jeopardizes \ncoverage under the program, and basically guarantees another tax \nincrease 5 years from now. Under the bill, SCHIP spending in 2012 \nreaches $16 billion; however, the very next year, spending drops to \n$3.5 billion. While this strategy helps the drafters hide an additional \n$40 billion in spending, does any Member of the Senate really think \nthat SCHIP spending in 2013 will be $3.5 billion? That is below the \ncurrent spending level of $5 billion a year. Does any Member really \nthink we will kick millions of kids off\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\nthis program in 2013 to accommodate this lowered spending? Of course, \nthe answer is no. That means Congress will have to come up with a \nsignificant amount of money to pay for the increased spending, which \nwill likely mean reaching into the wallets of hard-working Americans \nagain.\n  I also believe SCHIP should be a program for low-income children. \nWhen Congress created the program in 1997, it was intended for children \nwithout health insurance who lived in families making less than 200 \npercent of the Federal poverty limit. For 2007, 200 percent of poverty \nis about $41,000 in income for a family of four.\n  Not many people realize adults are now covered under SCHIP. Most \npeople rightly think this is a program only for children since it is \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program. That is its name. Over \nthe years, the Department of Health and Human Services has approved \nexpansions to the program to allow States to cover these adults. These \nexpansions should not have been approved in the first place, and it is \nCongress's responsibility in the reauthorization to rein in these \nabuses.\n  While the Baucus bill at least ends coverage for childless adults \ncurrently on SCHIP, it still allows other adults--specifically, \nparents--to stay on the program in certain States, and any State that \ncurrently covers parents can keep adding new parents to their programs.\n  The Kids First Act, which I am supporting, responsibly reauthorizes \nthe SCHIP program and keeps the focus on low-income children. This bill \nreauthorizes the program for 5 years at a cost of about $39 billion. \nThis would still be a significant but responsible increase over \nspending in the first 10 years of the program.\n  The bill would require States that want to cover children and \npregnant women above 200 percent of the poverty level, or $41,000 for a \nfamily of four, to pay more from their State coffers than they do now \nto do so.\n  The bill also takes steps to limit the number of adults on the SCHIP \nprogram. While we would not require States to remove any adults \ncurrently on the program from their rolls, we would reimburse States at \na lower amount for the childless adults and parents they currently have \non their programs.\n  Also, States could not add any new childless adults or parents to \ntheir SCHIP rolls. If they want to cover these individuals, then they \nneed to do it under their State Medicaid programs.\n  The Kids First Act also stops the Department of Health and Human \nServices from approving any more waivers or demonstration projects for \nStates that want to cover parents or childless adults.\n  The Kids First Act is a good proposal that I hope will get full \nconsideration on the Senate floor. It keeps SCHIP focused on low-income \nchildren, curtails States' ability to add new parents or childless \nadults to the program, and makes sense from a fiscal standpoint. \nUnfortunately, the Baucus bill falls short on these key points.\n  Also, the tobacco tax in the Baucus bill is fundamentally unfair to \nmy State and the surrounding States. I want to show you a chart I have \nhere, which shows the 50 States. This illustrates the real problem. It \nis compiled from data drawn from a CDC database on tobacco consumption \nand projections by Families USA concerning SCHIP spending. You will see \nhere that there are big winners in this program, and they are in dark \ngreen on the chart. You can see Texas, California, Arizona, New Mexico, \nNew York, and California, which is $2.564 billion. New York is $1.684 \nbillion. It shows Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, \nVirginia, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, and particularly \nFlorida; it shows those States as dead net losers--$703 million in \nFlorida; $602 million in Kentucky; $517 million in Indiana; $536 \nmillion in North Carolina, and so on. It also shows States that are \nneutral, such as Oregon, Idaho, Nebraska, and some other States that \nare kind of in the middle, such as West Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, \nMississippi, and so on. You can see from the chart that we pick big \nwinners and big losers, some neutral and some lower losers, not big \nsuch as the ones in dark brown. It is very important that you realize \nthat is a completely unfair reason and method of funding SCHIP.\n  The problem with the tax is that the money comes from low-income \nsmokers in my State and all of the dark brown States on this chart, and \nit is going to pay for an extravagant expansion of SCHIP in California, \nNew York, Texas, and the States depicted in green.\n  This bill will also, without any doubt, add an enormous boost to \nblack-market tobacco smuggling and counterfeiting. The plan would be a \ntremendous gift to organized crime and the black-market kingpins, who \nwill profit handsomely from it in future years. There is plenty of past \nevidence of this. In 2002, for example, New York City increased its \ntobacco tax from 8 cents per pack to $1.50 per pack. The city's revenue \nestimators predicted an additional $107 million in revenue. Do you know \nwhat they got? It brought in $43 million. What is more, the tax \nincrease on cigarettes cost the State over $600 million in tax revenue \ndue to lower sales at convenience stores throughout New York State. An \neconomist found that most of the reduction was due to smuggling, cross \nborder sales, Internet sales, and sales on Indian reservations.\n  Even supporters of this bill acknowledge that the higher tax will \nhave an impact on demand. It will reduce legal consumption of \ncigarettes. It is not likely to reduce total consumption, as the \nsupporters of the bill say it will, because it will also increase \nsmuggling. But legal consumption is what matters to the United States \nbecause that is the only part that is taxed.\n  The revenue estimate provided by the Joint Committee on Taxation \nshows this. Revenue is projected to decline by $700 million per year by \nthe last year of the estimating window. That is right. Understand this \nnow. Revenue is expected to go down over time as the number of legal \nsales of tobacco products declines.\n  Whatever its other problems, the tobacco tax is a poor foundation for \nSCHIP. We are matching a declining source of revenue with a growing \nFederal problem. This does not make any fiscal sense.\n  If we were honest and we truly wanted to fully fund SCHIP spending \nwith a tobacco tax, the Federal Government would have to encourage \npeople to smoke.\n  That is what this next chart shows: additional smokers. The Federal \nGovernment would need an additional 22.4 million smokers by the year \n2017. Of course, I don't support such an effort, but this highlights \nthe budget gap, as you can see, from 2010 up to 2017. The revenue for \nthis program is going to have to come from more tax increases down the \nroad.\n  We all say we oppose regressive taxes, but what we are considering \ntoday is a highly regressive tax. In fact, this tax is among the most \nregressive type of tax we could consider.\n  In my State of Kentucky, the impact on low-income taxpayers will be \ncompounded. It will hit low-income Kentuckians, Kentucky tobacco \nfarmers, and every citizen in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Although \nthere has been a dramatic decrease in the amount of tobacco farmers in \nmy State due to the tobacco buyout, tobacco continues to play an \nimportant role in Kentucky's agricultural landscape. Tobacco barns and \nsmall plots of tobacco still dot the Kentucky landscape. Cash receipts \nfor tobacco are projected to contribute between $300 million and $350 \nmillion to Kentucky's economy this year.\n  An increase in the excise tax on tobacco will drive down demand for \nconsumption, which will result in less tobacco being purchased from \nKentucky tobacco farmers by manufacturers--both cigarette and non-\ncigarette. It will likely force the specialty growers in my State--\nKentucky burley leaf and Kentucky-Wisconsin leaf--completely out of \nbusiness. These are small family farms in rural Kentucky that rely on \nthese revenues for their crops. The money they get from the tobacco \npays for their mortgages, puts their kids through school, and allows \nthem to keep farming.\n  The CBO has estimated that the SCHIP proposal will result in a 5 to 6 \npercent reduction in demand for tobacco during its first year in \nexistence. This will likely cause a $5.4 million reduction in payments \nto rural farmers\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\nin my State under the master settlement agreement we signed a few years \nago.\n  Some people will say there is nothing wrong with all of this because \nit will force some people to quit smoking and we are using the money to \nhelp poor children. But who gets credit for this supposed act of \ncharity? This plan would take money from one group of poor people and \ngive it to another.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Baucus SCHIP bill and support the \nKids First Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have two requests. First, I ask \nunanimous consent that at 5:20 today, the Senate vote in relation to \nthe Allard amendment No. 2536, with the time from 5:15 to 5:20 p.m. \nequally divided between Senator Allard and myself or our designees; \nthat no second degree amendments be in order to the amendment prior to \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the vote on the Allard amendment, Senator Dorgan then be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, can I ask the Senator to change the \nunanimous consent request to add myself after Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I so change my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Allard amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Thank you.\n  Madam President, I plan on going ahead and, if I understand what we \nhave agreed to, I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes to speak. I plan on spending a \nminute or minute and a half to talk about my amendment, and then I will \nyield and wrap it up later. I would appreciate it if the Chair will \nalert me when I have spoken for about 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the normal order is that the sponsor of \nthe amendment speaks first and those opposed second. If we can maintain \nthat, it would be 2\\1/2\\ and 2\\1/2\\.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is fine.\n  Madam President, I rise to encourage my colleagues in the Senate to \nvote with me on this important amendment. What we see happening now is \nthat there is a discrepancy between the calculation of gross income \nbetween the various States. Because of the way the various States are \ncalculating their gross income, some States are getting more benefit \nunder SCHIP than others. The State of Colorado, for example, is not one \nof those States. There are 12 to 15 States that have made some \nadjustments in the way they figure gross income, and that entitles them \nto more Federal dollars as far as SCHIP is concerned.\n  So what my amendment does, if it is adopted, it will direct the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to put in regulations the \ndefinition of gross income. This is going to have a 90-day period in \norder to establish this value, and this will then allow the States an \nopportunity to come and give their input as to what they think the \ncalculation of gross income should be. Then, when that rule and \nregulation is enacted, all the States are going to be acting under the \nsame rules so they will all be figuring their gross income in the same \nway.\n  I think this is an important amendment. I think when we are talking \nabout equity of benefits to the various States, it is extremely \nimportant we make sure they are operating under the same rules. Right \nnow we have some of the States that disregarded the original intent of \nSCHIP and, as a result of that, they are receiving considerably more \nbenefit as far as SCHIP is concerned than some of the other States.\n  My hope is my language will be adopted, and then we can move forward \nwith this program. It has been working. We have to create some equity \namong the States.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 12 seconds; the \nSenator from Montana has 2 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I don't want to belabor the issue, so I will use all my \ntime.\n  Mr. President, the hallmark of the CHIP program, the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, is block grants, not entitlements. That is \nfirst. Second, it gives the States flexibility. States design their own \nprogram. This is a State Children's Health Insurance Program. Different \nStates are different. Different States have different needs. Different \nStates have different costs of living. Different States are different.\n  Many States find themselves in a situation where a law might restrict \nthem. If the States did not have flexibility, many people who earn a \nlittle too much might find they cannot get health insurance, and so \nthey quit their jobs. The goal is to get people to work. People want to \nwork. The goal is to make sure people have health insurance. People \nneed health insurance. But in many States, people are just above the \nlevel here, and if they can't find health insurance, they quit their \njobs so they can be in the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  I think States should have the right to make some adjustment to keep \npeople working so they get health insurance. Now, if this amendment \npasses, 30 States will be adversely affected. Children in 30 States \nwill be adversely affected. I don't think we want to do that. States \nneed flexibility. Many Senators in this body have said many times, we \nshouldn't have one size fits all. We need flexibility.\n  There are very definite Federal limits on how much States can make an \nadjustment--that is, not include a certain amount of income--so those \npeople don't have to quit their jobs and can keep their private health \ninsurance.\n  So I would say I understand the basic theory, but we can't let \nperfection be the enemy of the good. We cannot. We cannot take away \nhealth insurance coverage from kids in 30 States. I do think the goal \nis for people to work. We want people to work. We should not adopt \npolicies, which this amendment in effect would do, and say: OK, people, \nsorry, you can't work. You can't work so you can qualify for children's \nhealth insurance. I think we want people to work in States so they can \nget health insurance.\n  I strongly urge Members to not agree to this amendment. It has \nsurface appeal but only surface appeal. If you dig down and find out \nwhat is happening in many States, I think Senators will realize this is \nnot the right thing to do and will oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this is a matter of fairness among the \nStates. Any child determined to be ineligible for SCHIP would remain in \nthe State program, but the State would be reimbursed according to the \nFMAP rate rather than the enhanced EFMAP reimbursement rate.\n  I think this is an important issue as far as equity among the various \nStates. I ask Members to join me in voting for this particular \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is to be recognized, followed by the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthose two Senators receiving recognition, Senator McCaskill then be \nrecognized; that following Senator McCaskill, Senator Gregg be \nrecognized for an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Ohio for a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment 2551 \nbe modified with the changes at the desk, notwithstanding the fact that \nthe amendment is not pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think the regular order is to recognize \nthe Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from North \nDakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleagues, \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, for bringing to the floor the piece of \nlegislation called the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is a \nvery important bill. It will add several million more children to the \nhealth insurance rolls and provide important health insurance for kids \nwho otherwise would not have it. I believe all of us in this Chamber \nwould believe that children's health care should not be a function of \nhow much money their parents may have in their pocketbook or their \ncheckbook. A sick child needs health care. This legislation moves in \nthat direction. I am pleased to support it. I thank my colleagues for \nthe work they have done on it.\n  I do wish to offer an amendment at this point, and I wish to talk a \nbit about a very important issue that also relates to health care.\n  My amendment deals with the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. It is \ntrue that we will now improve the lives of 3 million children with the \nunderlying bill. I fully support that and compliment my colleagues for \ndoing that. It is also true that there are at least 2 million American \nIndians in this country living on Indian reservations who are seeing \nhealth rationing virtually every day of their lives. It is unbelievable \nthat that condition continues to exist.\n  We have a trust responsibility for those people. The American Indians \nare a group of people in our midst with whom we made treaties, we made \nagreements, and we have the trust responsibility for Indian health \ncare. We have not nearly met those responsibilities.\n  I would observe that we have a responsibility for the health care of \nthose who are incarcerated in Federal prisons. Guess what. We spend \ntwice as much per person on health care for Federal prisoners as we do \nin meeting our health care responsibility for American Indians on a per \ncapita basis.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2534\n\n (Purpose: To revise and extend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act)\n\n  Let me say that I have filed amendment No. 2534. Let me call up that \namendment, which is at the desk. I offer this on behalf of myself, \nSenator Johnson, Senator Murkowski, Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nStevens.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I was \nwondering if I could ask the Senator from North Dakota how long he \nexpects to debate this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I intend to speak about 25 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Johnson, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Stevens, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2534.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me describe now, if I might, the issue \nof health care for American Indians, which I believe is an urgent \nnational need. We have a trust responsibility for their health care. We \nhave a piece of legislation that exists in law called the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act, but it needs to be reauthorized. It has not been \nreauthorized for 15 years. It expired 7 years ago. We need to do this. \nYear after year after year, this Congress postpones it. We have passed \nlegislation out of the committee; it does not get to the floor; it does \nnot get done.\n  Let me show my colleagues a picture of a young 14-year-old girl. This \nprecious child--her name is Avis Littlewind. Her relatives gave me \npermission to use her picture. Avis is dead. Avis committed suicide. I \nwant to tell you the story about Avis because I went to talk to the \nschool officials, the tribal officials, the mental health officials, \nand those who were in the extended family.\n  This 14-year-old girl took her own life. It probably should not have \nbeen a surprise to anyone because for 90 days this little girl lay in \nbed in a fetal position, missed school. Something was very wrong. This \nlittle girl had a sister who, 2 years previous, had committed suicide. \nThis little girl had a father who took his own life. This little \ngirl had another parent who was a very serious drug abuser. She laid in \nbed 90 days before she took her life.\n\n  Now, one might ask the question: Why does this 14-year-old girl just \nfall through the cracks? She thinks she is in a situation that is \nhopeless. She feels helpless and she takes her own life. But this \nlittle girl had a full life in front of her.\n  You know something? On that Indian reservation where Avis Littlewind \nlived, there were no mental health treatment facilities for someone to \ntake this young lady, this young girl. One might ask and certainly \nshould ask: Why is it in this country that mental health treatment is \nnot available to a young child like this? Why is it that the person \nresponsible for trying to give this young lady some help did not even \nhave a car or any transportation? Even if you could find a mental \nhealth professional to treat this person, there is no transportation to \nget the person to treatment. Why is it that for 90 days this young lady \nlay in bed, and nobody from the school, nobody from the area, said: All \nright, there must be a big problem here; let's find out what is going \non.\n  The fact is, this is one precious child who took her life. We have \nhad clusters of teen suicides on Indian reservations. This is but one \naspect of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, but it is not just \nmental health. The bill covers virtually every aspect of Indian health.\n  We are told that about 60 percent of Indian health care needs are \nmet. That means 40 percent of the health care needs are unmet. There is \nfull-scale health care rationing on Indian reservations. If we were to \ndebate that on\n\n[[Page S10375]]\n\nthe floor of the Senate, people would be appalled. You can't ration \nhealth care. Yet, that is what is happening.\n  We have a trust responsibility, and yet health care is being rationed \nwith respect to Native Americans. American Indians die at higher rates \nwith respect to tuberculosis, 6 times the national average; alcoholism, \n5 times the national average; diabetes, 180 percent higher than the \nnational average. In Alaska, Native communities in Alaska have fewer \nthan 90 doctors for every 100,000 Alaska Natives. That compares to 229 \ndoctors for every 100,000 Americans. Heart disease, diabetes, blood \npressure, stroke--you name it. The incidence of most diseases affecting \nour Native Americans are at much higher rates than for non-Indians. \nCervical cancer for American Indians and Alaska Natives is nearly four \ntimes higher than cervical cancer for other women in this country.\n  I mentioned before that Federal prisoners, for whom we have a \nresponsibility for health care, receive twice as much funding per \nperson on their health care needs than do American Indians for whom we \nhave a trust responsibility. Stated another way, we spend twice as much \nper person on Federal prisoners than we do with respect to American \nIndians, and we have a trust responsibility in law to deal with \nAmerican Indian health issues.\n  I want to show a photograph to describe health care rationing. This \nis a photograph of Ardel Hill Baker. She has also allowed me to use her \nphotograph. Ardel Hill Baker was having a heart attack. As she was \nhaving a heart attack, she was taken from the Indian reservation by \nambulance to a hospital. When they offloaded her from the ambulance \nonto a gurney to take her in the hospital, this woman, at the emergency \nroom entrance, having a heart attack, had a piece of paper taped to her \nthigh. The hospital dutifully looked at that piece of paper. The piece \nof paper that was taped to her thigh said that the Indian Health \nService contract health care is not an entitlement program, meaning \nthere are no funds to pay for this service because it is not a life-or-\nlimb medical condition.\n  Let me say that again. Someone is having a heart attack. When they \nare brought to the hospital, they have a big piece of paper taped to \ntheir leg. It says to the hospital: By the way, if you admit this \nperson, you are on your own because our contract health care money is \ngone. In fact, this is the piece of paper which was taped to the leg of \nan Indian patient coming into a hospital, having a heart attack. What \nwould anybody in this Chamber think if this were taped to the leg of \ntheir spouse or their son or their daughter? They are having a heart \nattack, but the hospital is told: You know what, we do not have any \nmoney for this person; if you admit this person, you are on your own. \nContract health care. It is called health care rationing.\n  Tribal chairmen tell me that the refrain on their reservation is: \nDon't get sick after June because if you get sick after June, there is \nno money in contract health care. By the way, you can get a little help \nstill, but it has to be life or limb. You must be threatened with the \nloss of a limb or the loss of your life; if not, tough luck.\n  We would be outraged, outraged, every single one of us, if this were \nour relative. But it was not. It was Ardel Hill Baker. She survived, \nbut there are plenty who do not.\n  This is Lida Bearstail. Lida Bearstail had a serious problem with her \nleg. The bones in her knee were rubbing against each other; cartilage \nwas worn away. She was in great pain, in great discomfort.\n  The normal treatment for perhaps someone in this Chamber or perhaps \nfor a relative of someone in this Chamber would be to get a knee \nreplacement, but in Lida Bearstail's case, Lida Bearstail was not given \nthe option of getting a knee replacement.\n  Despite the great pain, it was not determined to be priority one, \nlife or limb. She wasn't going to lose her limb or her life. She could \njust live with the pain. So because it wasn't priority one, life or \nlimb, this woman whose bones were rubbing together in the knee in \nunbelievable pain was told: There is no health care available for you.\n  We have hearings to talk about all these issues. A doctor comes to \nour hearing and says: I had a patient come to me with a very serious \nproblem with a knee. It was a ligament problem, very serious, very \npainful. That patient went to the Indian Health Service and they said: \nWrap that knee in cabbage leaves for 4 days and you will be OK.\n  It is pretty unbelievable. Yet we can't get a bill on the floor of \nthe Senate to deal with Indian health care. That is unbelievable. We \nhave a responsibility to pass this legislation. I passed it out of the \nIndian Affairs Committee. Now we need to move it through the Senate and \nthen the House so we can say to these people who need health care--the \nfirst Americans, Native Americans that this country understands its \nobligation, understands its trust responsibility, and we are going to \ndo what we need to do to pass the legislation.\n  It is almost unbelievable that with all the priorities we discuss, we \ncan't somehow make this a priority. In my State, we have some wonderful \nIndian tribes. The Three Affiliated Tribes is a wonderful tribe. It \nincludes the Mandan, the Hidatsa, and the Arikara Nations. If you get \nsick on that reservation in Twin Buttes, ND, your nearest health \nfacility is a little old building with a couple of tiny examination \nrooms. If you are lucky enough to get sick on one of the right days \nwhen a nurse is there and one of the few days when a doctor might be \nthere, you might do OK. But this is a 1-million acre reservation. It is \na big place. We had testimony from law enforcement the other day on \nthat reservation. The first you would expect to be able to get someone \nto come to deal with a law enforcement call, no matter how serious, \nwould be about an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half. So call \nwhile a crime is being committed and, perhaps an hour and a quarter \nlater, if you are lucky, someone from law enforcement will show up. You \nmight understand then that if you need a prescription or if you have a \nhealth care emergency, the dilemma Indians face on reservations.\n  A mother who has a feverish child who needs an antibiotic, or a \ndiabetic who needs insulin--who don't have ready access to health care \nfacilities, in circumstances such as that, we must find ways to meet \nthese health care needs.\n  There are some who say--and I agree--we need substantial change. My \ncolleague from Oklahoma is here. He talked about the prospect of \nsaying: All right, let's have dramatic change. I am perfectly willing \nto work on dramatic change, to say that if we have a trust \nresponsibility for someone for health care, let's let them show up at a \nhospital someplace and let's pay the bill so they can go to the \nproviders who have the capability. We have the responsibility to do \nthat. The problem is, we can't get a bill such as that through this \nSenate. I have offered time and again on the floor to add funding. The \nlast time I tried to add $1 billion. It went down on a partisan vote. \nYou can't get money added in this Senate to meet the responsibility we \nought to meet with respect to Indian health care.\n  We have worked in a bipartisan way on this legislation in the Indian \nAffairs Committee. The vice chairman of the committee, Senator \nMurkowski of Alaska, is a cosponsor as well. The Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act is legislation that begins to answer and advance the \ninterests of providing health care to American Indians and meeting our \ntrust responsibility to do so. We would authorize additional tools to \ndeal with the issue of teen suicide on Indian reservations.\n  I began by talking about Avis Littlewind, but I could have talked \nabout many others. I have had several hearings on this subject. The \nbill also includes new provisions to address lack of health care \nservices. We have begun trying to find a different construct of \nconvenient care for American Indians on reservations. It includes \nseveral Medicaid provisions that are in the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee. The Finance Committee is going to be holding a markup. We \nwill talk with the chairman and ranking member about including this \nbill in that markup.\n  My point today is very simple. I understand the need to provide \nadditional health care opportunities for 3 million American children is \nvery important. It is no more important than providing the health care \nwe promised we would provide to 2 million American Indians who live on \nreservations for whom we\n\n[[Page S10376]]\n\nhave trust responsibilities. We have broken far too many promises to \nAmerican Indians. We have done it for far too many decades. It is time \nfor this Congress and the country to keep its word and meet its \npromise. We don't have a choice, and it is not going to break the bank \nto do that.\n  I encourage all my colleagues, go to the Indian reservations. See for \nyourself. See a dentist practicing in an old trailer house for 5,000 \npatients, operating out of an old trailer. Go see that. Then ask \nyourself: Is this the kind of health care we promised? Are we \ndelivering what we promised? The answer is a resounding no.\n  I understand in this Chamber there are priorities. With respect to \nthe priorities all of us have, we all have different things we are \npassionate about. We have now on the floor a health care bill. This \nlegislation is important. The reason I offer this amendment is, when we \ntalk about health care, I think we have a responsibility to address \nIndian health as well. If we can, we need to, either tonight or \ntomorrow, get a commitment on dates to mark up and bring to the floor \nof the Senate the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which is 7 years \noverdue and 15 years since it was last reauthorized. If we can get that \ncommitment, I will know we are going to get this through the Senate. \nThat is the goal.\n\n  I am going to visit with Senator Baucus. Let me also make the point, \nSenator Baucus has been a very strong supporter of Indian issues. I \nhave been happy to work with him. The Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct was sent to the Indian Affairs Committee. We have moved this out of \ncommittee. I think we have written it in a way that substantially \nimproves Indian health care. Now it waits, as it waited last year, the \nyear before and the year before that and the year before that. Every \nsingle year it is the same thing. I am flat out tired of it. I will not \nlet it happen this time. One way or another, this needs to get done by \nthis Senate because this Senate has a responsibility to do it. We have \nnot met this responsibility for too many years. This year I insist we \ndo so. The fact is, kids are dying. Elders are dying because the health \ncare doesn't exist that we had previously promised. We have a \nresponsibility to do something about it.\n  I say to the chairman of the committee, I will visit with Senator \nReid, and I know Senator Baucus is a strong supporter of Indian issues. \nI hope if I can get a commitment that we can get from the Finance \nCommittee a markup--and I know the Senator wants to do that--if I can \nthen get a commitment from Senator Reid to bring this to the floor, I \ndon't intend to interrupt the children's health insurance bill, but if \nI can't get that commitment, I fully intend to interrupt this bill as \nlong as I can interrupt it because it is that important.\n  To my colleague from Montana, let me say thank you for allowing me to \nat least at this moment offer this amendment, and let me ask my \ncolleague if I can get some hope that the two of us, working with \nothers, can move together to get this through the Senate in a \nreasonable time. I am going to ask the same of the majority leader, who \nI know also is very supportive of Indian issues and very much wants to \nget this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from North Dakota. \nIf our colleagues could see the conditions of health care on the \nreservations of this country, they would be appalled, absolutely \nappalled. It is as bad as a Third World country. It is disgusting the \nlow quality of health care on the reservations. The Senator from North \nDakota earlier mentioned the life-and-limb provision. Basically, the \nIndian Health Service does not take people unless it is for life and \nlimb, unless you have lost a limb or your life is in jeopardy, nothing \nless. That is not entirely true because it depends upon the allocation \nof the various Indian Health Service hospitals around the country. But \nvery quickly, those hospitals get to the point where they are at the \nlife-and-limb threshold. They have used up what few paltry dollars they \nhave. So on the Blackfeet Reservation of Montana, someone is ill, a \nchild is ill. If they have reached that reservation and reached the \nlife-and-limb limit--which happens, I am told, midway through the \nyear--that is it. They don't get any health care. It is an absolute \noutrage.\n  We all know the health conditions on Indian reservations are much \nworse. Statistics show it is much worse than the national average. \nAbout 27 percent of Indian kids don't have any health insurance \nwhatsoever. I might also say the tuberculosis rate on the Indian \nreservations is about 7\\1/2\\ times that of the general population. The \nsame is true of the suicide rate and so on. I say to my good friend \nfrom North Dakota, absolutely, I am committed. We passed this bill out \nof committee. It passed last year. It passed by unanimous vote in \ncommittee. I am very committed to having a markup. Indeed, I think we \nscheduled September 12 to get this out of committee so we can find a \nway to get this bill enacted this year. I share the conviction. We have \nto find a way to get this done this year. It is an outrage, a total \noutrage in the United States of America to let these conditions \ncontinue. Frankly, this legislation is only the beginning to bring the \nlevel totally all the way up to what it should be.\n  I thank the Senator for offering this amendment tonight. I am \ncommitted to find a way to get this enacted into law this year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say thank you. If we can get a \nmarkup in the Senate Finance Committee on September 12, that allows the \nbill to move to the floor of the Senate. I am going to talk to Senator \nReid, who I know is a strong supporter of Indian issues and feels very \nstrongly about this. If I can get a commitment, I know he wants to \nprovide that commitment to get to the floor of the Senate, then I will \nseek to withdraw the amendment from this bill. But I do want to visit, \nand perhaps in the morning on the floor, with Senator Reid on that \nsubject.\n  I wished to make two more points, and then I know my colleague from \nNorth Carolina seeks recognition.\n  This chart shows the expenditures per capita relative to other \nFederal health expenditure benchmarks. This deals with Indians versus \nall others--Indians get far less. Here is the expenditure per capita \nfor Medicare, the Veterans' Administration, Medicaid, Federal \nprisoners, the Federal Employees Health benefits. Here is Indian Health \nService. It is unbelievable to me how much less it is. In many ways, \nall of this is intertwined--social services, health care, law \nenforcement, housing, education, it is all intertwined. What got me \ninterested and involved in Indian issues--and I am privileged to serve \nas chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee and feel a deep \nresponsibility to force us to do the right thing--what got me involved \none day was a young girl named Tamara.\n  Tamara was a young 3-year-old American Indian girl who was put in a \nfoster home. But the person who was handling the social services cases \nwas handling 150 cases, so they did not bother to check the home this \nlittle girl was going to be put into. It was not long before, at a \ndrunken party, that little girl had her nose broken, her arm broken, \nand her hair pulled out at the roots. It will scar that little girl for \nlife. I met her. I met her granddad. I talked to the social worker. I \nfixed that social worker problem by getting additional workers in, so \nthat it does not happen again.\n  The fact is that should never happen. These incidences should not \nhappen. We do not have the resources to do what is necessary, to do \nwhat needs to be done. Nowhere is that more true than in health care. \nHealth care is not a luxury. When there is a sick kid someplace, or a \nsick elder, when somebody has a health problem, we have a \nresponsibility to find a way to help.\n  For those who might listen to this and say that Indian health care is \nnot our responsibility, oh, yes, it is. We signed treaties. We made \npromises, and we broke them every chance we got. Maybe in the year 2007 \nwe can begin keeping a promise or two. These are promises we have a \nresponsibility to keep. It is our trust responsibility.\n  There is a lot to do in health care, but there is nothing more \nimportant than meeting our obligation to provide health care for Native \nAmericans because we made that agreement with them, and we need to keep \nthat agreement.\n\n[[Page S10377]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the SCHIP bill. I have an \namendment to the SCHIP bill, but I do not intend to call it up at this \ntime. I wish to speak on SCHIP, as well as on my amendment.\n  I also take this opportunity to ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nDole as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I think it is safe to say that health care \nis probably one of the most important things this body can debate. I \nthink you have to look at our overall health care system today to \nunderstand why it is so important. It is because we have the best \nhealth care delivery system in the world, bar none.\n  We have seen other countries try to develop a system that fit within \na budget framework that, over time, as the dollars got tight, \nconstricted the level of care delivered, creating waiting lines for \nindividuals who had certain health conditions. But the United States \nhas always been considered the innovative health care delivery system \nof the world. It was accessible for most, regardless of region. I think \nit is safe to say for a long period of time it was very affordable. But \nthat has all changed.\n  The U.S. system still provides a level of security if, in fact, you \nare insured. If you are not insured, I am not sure the sense of \nsecurity--just knowing there is a hospital or doctors--necessarily \nprovides you with a tremendous amount of security.\n  With every day that continues on, the level of choice that exists \nwithin the United States health care system begins to get less and \nless. Most of us have been here for the debates of the creation of HMOs \nand PPOs, and all the products that employers, insurers, and \nindividuals desperately try to create to address this rising cost of \nhealth care, while maintaining some degree of benefit for the \nindividual and for their family. But over time, we have continued to \nsee changes to those products, to where there is very little difference \nbetween the products now except for what we call them. Clearly, that \nhas eliminated many of the choices.\n  What has happened to the U.S. system, over a very slow period of \ntime, maybe the last two decades? Over 50 percent of the American \npeople are now on a Government health care plan. It is no longer \nprivate-sector driven. We are here with this big question mark about \nwhy market conditions do not affect the cost of health care or the cost \nof premiums or that they do not create choice. In fact, over half of \nthe American people are now in a Government-run system, one that \nmirrors more what others in the country have tried, only to find out \nthat unless you have an unlimited pool of money, they do not work.\n  Well, what do Government systems eventually create? They create a \nsystem that has less doctors, less nurses, less hospitals, which means \nless care for those in the country.\n  I know the ranking member represents a State that is considered to be \nrural. North Carolina is a State considered to be rural. If you have a \ncontraction of doctors, if you have a contraction of specialists, if \nyou have less nurses in the pool, it means there is not enough to go \naround all the facilities. There are many regional areas of my State \ntoday where we cannot find OB/GYNs to deliver babies.\n  Now, sure, I can look at a pregnant woman and say: Within a 30 or 45-\nmile radius, you will be able to get delivery care. But try to explain \nto a mother, when her water breaks and she goes into labor, that the \nperson who is going to deliver that baby is 45 miles away. In fact, the \nprenatal care, for that individual who needs it, is now 45 miles away \nbecause that is where her OB/GYN is, and we are not going to be able to \nget the level of prenatal care in rural America that we want.\n  What has the Government controlling more of health care produced? \nLess choices, fewer providers, and less services, and especially for \nthose limited amounts of services that are preventive.\n  Let me state from the beginning of this debate, I am for \nreauthorizing the SCHIP bill. I will support the substitute that \nSenator McConnell will offer which provides $38.9 billion over 5 years, \nwhich is an increase of $13.9 billion.\n  I also was in the House, on the Energy and Commerce Committee, in \n1997, when we enacted the first SCHIP bill, which was a $40 billion \nFederal commitment over 10 years to those children at 200 percent of \npoverty or less. Many States expanded that SCHIP program to cover \nparents of SCHIP kids and childless adults.\n  The McConnell reauthorization protects the original SCHIP program by \nmaking sure that low-income children are the focus of our effort.\n  Now, I will say, North Carolina has one of the best SCHIP programs in \nthe United States. I am pleased that Senator McConnell's \nreauthorization will give North Carolina the additional funds it needs \nto continue serving low-income children. But I am, sadly, here today to \ntell you I am not for expanding the rolls of SCHIP. The Finance \nCommittee bill adds more than $30 billion to the current SCHIP base \nbudget--$25 billion--to, roughly, cover 3.3 million additional \nchildren.\n\n  Now, CBO scored what the State and Federal Government spending will \nbe per child. Let me put that up for everybody: $3,930 per child. Yet, \ntoday, the average private health care plan in the private sector is \n$1,130. My question is, if we are going to spend $3,900 per child in a \nGovernment plan, but we can insure them fully in the private sector \ntoday for $1,130, where is the choice? As a colleague of ours in the \nHouse used to say: Beam me up, Scotty. Something is wrong here. This \nseems like a no-brainer. This is not an investment that one can make on \nthe part of American taxpayers and feel good about.\n  In 1997, we spent $40 billion. It was an honorable goal. Quite \nfrankly, the program has been very popular. The Baucus reauthorization \nplan, though, would spend $60 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Now, people will talk about budget gimmicks. I am not here to talk \nabout that. I think they are here. I think it hides millions of dollars \nthat I think are extra spending--and maybe they are going to insure \nthis 3.3 million, and $3,900 per child is incorrect, or maybe there are \nmore people who are going to be covered, and many of them outside of \nthe ranks of low-income children--but there is no question the Baucus-\nGrassley bill expands SCHIP so much that I feel children who need it \nthe most will get lost in a new, larger Government-run program.\n  As a matter of fact, if SCHIP works as well as I think it does, why \nwould we change it? I think some would tell us we are not here changing \nthe SCHIP program. But I would only point to section 606 of the \nGrassley-Baucus bill, where they remove the word ``State'' from the \nname of SCHIP. See, SCHIP is the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. It was always designed as us being an enhanced share for the \nStates, and the States running the program. Now, SCHIP is going to be \ncalled the Children's Health Insurance Program. It sounds like a big, \none-size-fits-all Government program to me.\n  The solution to our health care crisis is not to put every child in \nAmerica in a Government program. Today, one out of every two children \nin America is in a Government program. They are either enrolled in \nMedicaid or SCHIP.\n  The Baucus plan puts more children into Government health care. A \nrecent CBO analysis concluded that for every 1 million additional \nchildren covered under SCHIP, an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 will be \nswitched from private insurance to the new public SCHIP coverage.\n  Now, let me say that again. CBO estimates--this is not me--CBO \nestimates that for every 1 million new kids we put into SCHIP, \nsomewhere between 250,000 to 500,000 will switch from their parents' \ninsurance to the new Government plan.\n  Now, that is 3.3 million kids, which means 1.65 million could be \nswitched from private insurance to Government insurance, at 3,900 and \nsome dollars, estimated by CBO. Again, where is the sanity and the \nobligation and fiduciary responsibility we have to the taxpayers? Why \nin the world would we create an avenue for people to go off their \nfamily's plan and come on a Government plan, where we are committed, as \nCBO said, to spend $3,900, roughly, per child?\n  Now, before people think we are all insane--they know I am now--what\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\nshould we be discussing? I believe we should be discussing how do we \nreform the health care system? I do not think I would find much \nopposition except on how we do that because there are 45 million \nuninsured Americans today. If they are sitting at home listening to \nthis debate about covering 3 million low-income children, or wherever \nthey are on the income scale, for a person sitting at home, who is an \nadult today, they are saying: What about me? What about the fact that I \ndo not have insurance?\n  If they have no job, and they have no income, we know they are on \nMedicaid. If they have a job, and they do not qualify financially for \nMedicaid, then where do they go? Well, there are 45 million of them out \nthere somewhere who are in this classification. Some of them are kids \nand some of them are adults. Every time they access health care, and \nthey cannot pay for it, an incredibly predictable thing happens: The \ncost that is unrecovered is shifted to everybody else in the system.\n  In North Carolina, there are 1.3 million who are uninsured. Seventeen \npercent of the North Carolina population is uninsured, and 16 percent \nof the American population is uninsured. Yet our debate is limited to \n3.3 million children.\n  It is not about how we insure America. It is not about the rising \ncost of health care. It is not about the fact that health care premiums \nhave, in fact, doubled in the country since the year 2000. If compared \nwith the growth of inflation since 2000--at 18 percent--and the growth \nof wages--at 20 percent--health insurance premiums for family coverage \nhave increased 73 percent over the last 5 years. Health care costs are \nrising three times the rate of inflation, and with no corresponding \nrise in quality.\n\n  Now, there is the red flag. We have seen a 73-percent increase in the \npremium. If you could turn to something tangible in the system to say \nthat quality has gotten that much better, then one could maybe \nrationalize this increase. But the fact is, there has been no \ncorresponding rise in quality. As a matter of fact, today there are no \nhealth care plans that are focused primarily on wellness and \nprevention.\n  I remember when we tried to get mammographies and PSAs covered in \nMedicare, and we tried to get an array of preventive health care, it \nwas the hardest thing I have ever worked on in health care to try to \nget added to a system. I guess it is because Medicare beneficiaries are \nold to start with, and why would we do anything preventive. Yet if we \nlook at the research that goes on every day, and that we pay for, we \nfind the earlier we can detect cancer, the earlier we can detect \ndiabetes, the more we can monitor disease management, the better the \noutcome is but, more importantly, from a taxpayer's standpoint, the \nless it costs the system.\n  We know that happens in the Government system. We don't implement \nwellness and prevention like we should. If we did, we would require it \nin Medicaid. But we have an opportunity--as we talk about redesigning \nthe American health care system, we have an opportunity to build \nwellness and prevention as the main piece of this broken system.\n  Today we have a system that only triggers when you get sick. It \ndoesn't trigger when you want to stay well. It triggers when you get \nsick. But if you look at companies that have said: There is no way I \nwill ever be competitive if, in fact, the health care system doesn't \nchange in America--they made a decision that they are going to go \noutside of the insurance products that are available today, and they \nare going to do things that are creative out of the box. And they are \nself-insured and they have gone out and partnered with somebody to \nadminister their plan. What do you find? It is Dell Computers, which \nnow has about 4 years of experience with disease management and how to \nbring down the overall costs of health care for their employees--not \njust corporately but for their individual costs to their employees--all \nthe way to Safeway, that has a model that I know every Member on the \nHill has probably been briefed on--what Safeway is doing, which is \ngiving people control of their care but, more importantly, stressing to \nthem that prevention and wellness is something for which they will \nactually receive an incentive.\n  People without access to employer-sponsored coverage are severely \ndisadvantaged under the current system. I know both of the Senators who \nare in charge of the tax committee probably would agree that we have \ninequities. Ninety-one percent of workers in large firms have health \ninsurance. Sixty-six percent of workers in small firms--10 employees or \nless--have health insurance. Twenty-nine percent of the uninsured work \nin small business. The percentage of employers offering coverage has \ndropped 8 percent since the year 2000.\n  Whoa. Global economy. That is what has happened since 2000. There is \na global economy where it doesn't matter where you manufacture. All \nthat matters is where are your customers. Most U.S. businesses have \nchanged from a model that was predominantly for domestic consumption to \na model today where 60 or 70 percent of their business is \ninternational, and 30 or 40 percent of it is domestic--in the United \nStates. We ought to look at some of the decisions they have made and \nwonder: why didn't we have this challenge before this point with those \nemployers, looking at their business model and saying: How can I \ncontinue to pay a health care cost that rises in double-digit ways each \nyear with inflation and remain competitive with my global competition \nwhich doesn't have that cost?\n  Well, I am going to put the Senate on notice: This is happening at an \nalarming rate. If U.S. businesses determine that they are not \ncompetitive in the marketplace they are selling to, which is global, \nand health care cost is the No. 1 issue that makes them noncompetitive, \nin the absence of us reforming the system and creating a way for them \nto provide health care--not that seeks double-digit inflation every \nyear but begins a downward pressure on the cost of health care--I will \nassure you they have two choices: they eliminate the benefit or they \nleave the country, and both of them are devastating to the United \nStates.\n  If we don't reform health care, what happens? Health care becomes \nunaffordable for people. U.S. businesses become uncompetitive. \nGovernment will have its normal reaction. It will ratchet down the \nreimbursements that we pay through Medicare and Medicaid and the effect \nof that is that private insurance sees that as an opportunity to \nratchet down the provider reimbursements. Doctors and nurses get paid \nless. More people go on Government health care. Doctors and nurses will \nbecome Government employees. Hospitals will become Government property. \nInsurance companies will become paper pushers. We must all agree that \nthe outcome has to be better for us.\n\n  By the way, taxes will rise too. I am not sure whether it is \nindividual or corporate, but let me assure my colleagues, though some \nbelieve that health care is free, somebody pays for it. Look at the \nsystems around the world where the government is in control of their \nhealth care, and the beneficiaries may think it is free, but one of the \nproblems--one of the reasons they are ratcheting back the scope of \ncoverage they have is the fact that as the government runs out of money \nand can't find ways to raise revenues, they have a choice. They can tax \nindividuals, they can tax corporations, or they can reduce benefits. \nWhen you look at the prevailing tax rate they have now, you understand \nwhy their only choice is to cut benefits. The likelihood is that we \nwill be faced with the same thing as socialized medicine is just around \nthe corner, and I think time is actually running out.\n  The current tax structure for health care benefits exists for \nemployer-focused plans. Employers get a tax deduction for the amount of \nthe health care benefit provided for their employees, but the deduction \nunfortunately doesn't exist for individuals who shop in the \nmarketplace. We spend 50 percent more of our GDP--16 percent--on health \ncare than the next three spenders--Germany, Japan, and France--but we \naren't any healthier. It is time we begin to focus on how our system \nbecomes more efficient, healthier, and more affordable.\n  One out of every four dollars in health care spent in this country \ndoes nothing to help patients. It is actually wasted on defensive \nmedicine, unnecessary paperwork, and outright fraud. When you put \nindividuals in charge of\n\n[[Page S10379]]\n\ntheir health care--not just constructing it or negotiating it, but \nresponsible for whether the system is efficient and effective--you \nwould be amazed at how you wring out that 25 percent, that one out of \nfour. The source of the problem is runaway health care costs which is \ncaused by a lack of choice and a lack of government control.\n  Now, let me assure you that in Sweden today, heart patients wait 25 \nweeks to be seen. In England today, Heritage said cancer patients \nsometimes wait a year between their diagnosis and their chemotherapy \ntreatment. Canada's Supreme Court Justice, Beverly McLachlin, said it \nbest in a 2005 ruling:\n\n       Access to a waiting list is not access to health care.\n\n  We have a roadmap as to where we are going, and we have an \nopportunity to change that today.\n  What happens if the Senate, if the Congress of the United States, \nbecomes the visionary body that it needs to be and the reform body that \nit has to be if, in fact, you want to protect the delivery system in \nthis country? Americans have to have three things: They have to have \nchoice, they have to have ownership, and they have to have control. \nThey have to have the ability to construct their insurance policies to \nmeet their age, their income, and their health condition. Health care \nneeds to be portable, just like a 401(k).\n  When you give an individual ownership of a 401(k), they are no longer \nstrapped to an employer about their pension or retirement; they have \nthe ability to take that money with them to the next job. Well, we have \nreached the point now that health care should be the same thing. It \nshould be ownership, and we should have the ability to take that health \ncare from employer to employer where we are not locked in, and for the \nfirst time Americans would have the freedom to make decisions about \ntheir future and about the future of their families.\n  Innovation works. We all know it. A year ago, a 46-inch plasma TV \ncost as much as $11,000, but today you can buy the same TV for $2,839. \nIn 1908, Henry Ford made a car for $850. Eight years later, Henry Ford \nproduced the same car for $360.\n  Innovation also works in health care--don't fool yourself. Between \n1999 and 2004, the cost of LASIK surgery, which is set by the market \nforces and outside the current system, went down 20 percent while \nhealth care expenditures per person increased by more than 44 percent. \nLASIK surgery is this new surgery that individuals have on their eyes. \nIf they have a certain condition, they can have LASIK and throw their \nglasses away. A controversial thing, and innovation brought it. It went \nthrough and FDA approved it. The cost was very high to begin with, and \nas more people have sought LASIK surgery, the price has come down and \ndown and down and down and down. I am sure Dr. Coburn will talk more \nabout it as we go through this debate.\n  Duke University set up a program to manage congestive heart failure. \nHalf of all of the congestive heart failure patients typically have a \n5-year life expectancy, and costs are a total of $22.5 billion for \ncongestive heart failure annually in the United States. Duke developed \na program that integrated the care to develop best practice models for \ncongestive heart failure patients. The approach resulted in better \npatient outcomes, increased patient compliance with their doctor's \nrecommendations and, most importantly, a 32-percent drop in the cost \nper patient of treating congestive heart failure. Innovation allows \nincredible things to happen but only when we have a marketplace that \nrewards innovation.\n  I said when I stood up I had an amendment that I didn't intend to \ncall up, and I am not going to call it up. That amendment is the Every \nAmerican Insured Health Act. I want to just briefly talk about it.\n  Hopefully, this accomplishes everything I have spent the last 20 \nminutes talking about. It provides the resources for every American not \non a government plan to access the coverage they need. Let me say that \nagain. It provides the resources for all the uninsured in America to \nnegotiate the coverage they need in the private marketplace.\n  No. 2, it eliminates cost shifting. It eliminates that bill we get \nthrough our premium costs or through the cost of a service delivered \nthat we can't figure out who used it, but somebody didn't pay because \nthey weren't insured and it got shifted to everybody else. We eliminate \nthat by providing the resources for every American to negotiate \ncoverage. We estimate that it may be $200 billion a year that we \neliminate in cost shifting.\n  Now, how do we accomplish it? Because one might say: I know how \nexpensive SCHIP expansion for 3.3 million children is going to be. Can \nwe afford what it is going to cost us to insure everybody who is \nuninsured in America? Well, here is what we do. We address the tax \ninequity. Through that we treat those who get insurance provided by an \nemployer the same way we do individuals. Then we turn around to every \nAmerican who is not on a government plan and we do this: We give them a \nrefundable, advanced, flat tax credit. For an individual, it is $2,160 \na year. If it is a family, it is $5,400 a year.\n  Now, if, in fact, you had tax consequences from this new equality in \ntreating individuals and employer plans the same, the likelihood is \nthat if your health benefit from your employer doesn't exceed $15,000 \nfrom the employer on a family plan, then $5,400 is more than enough to \ncover the tax consequences.\n  If, in fact, you are an individual who is uninsured and you get a \nrefundable tax credit on an annual basis of $2,160, then you can go out \nand negotiate in the private sector for health care coverage that on \naverage today is between $1,500 and $1,700 nationally for an individual \nplan and about $4,500 to $4,600 for a family plan. You could insure \nyourself as an individual or as a family, and you could do that all \nwithin the confines of the refundable tax credit we have allowed.\n  Now, people have questioned whether there is a little bit of a shift \nin wealth. Yes, there is. We are taking people who have rich health \ncare plans, more health care than they need, plans that are priced \nbecause there are no out-of-pocket costs--there are a lot of things \nthat we know we need to do from the standpoint of making sure Americans \nknow they have skin in the game every time they go to the doctor's \noffice for the facts of utilization--and we are shifting it down to \nwhere we give people refundable tax credits that are barely over the \nMedicaid qualifications, and we are going to give them a soup-to-nuts \nplan--$2,160 for an individual or $5,400 for a family annually, a \nrefundable tax credit that is only good for health care.\n  When they sign up with an insurer, the money will go directly from \nthe U.S. Government to the insurer. If money is left over, it would \nautomatically transfer over into a health savings account for that \nindividual to use for other health care benefits, whether it be for \ncopayments, deductibles, whatever the structure of the plan is, and \nthey are allowed to design a plan that meets their age, their income, \nand their health conditions.\n  We give States incentives to make sure that in every marketplace \nthere is an affordable plan. It is absolutely crucial that you begin to \nhave insurance reform at the same time you are creating a marketplace \nthat is driven by individuals.\n  Our goals are to give Americans the resources and the right to \npurchase health care in the private marketplace, to end the tax \ndiscrimination, to encourage individuals to take control, to eliminate \nthe current cost shift, so that every American's health care begins to \ncome down because of this new benefit, and to ensure the accessibility \nand affordability of high-quality health care.\n  By the way, this plan I have just described that did this for the \nfirst time--insured everybody who is uninsured, provided annually a \n$2,160 refundable tax credit for individuals and $5,400 for a family--I \nstill didn't tell you how much it costs. I am like the guy on the \ninfomercials who waits until the end to spring on you how great of a \nbargain it is.\n  Well, this is budget neutral. It doesn't cost the American taxpayer \none new dollar. That doesn't take into account that there may be $200 \nbillion worth of cost-shifting going on in the system. We get no \nscoring for the fact that we could potentially drive $200 billion of \ncosts out of the health care for everyone else in the system by making \nsure everybody is insured. We get absolutely no credit for being able \nto put\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\ntogether plans that promote prevention and wellness, that begin to \ndrive down utilization and make Americans healthier, that begin to \ncreate data for us so we know exactly what the right reimbursements are \nfor doctors, nurses, hospitals, and community health centers. We pull \nthat out of the sky today, and they complain. And they should because \nthere is no relation to that in reality.\n  This, by creating a real marketplace, real competition from the \ninsurer all the way through to the service delivered will begin to \nbuild the database of information we need to know what reimbursements \nthe marketplace says are fair to the people who provide it. Then they \ncan make a decision. I believe we will find that every doctor, nurse, \nhospital, and community health center will receive this in a warm way \nbecause now they believe that this is a system which will evaluate what \nthey deliver and what cost they are reimbursed for.\n  Mr. President, I am sure the chairman of the committee and the \nranking member would have preferred to have this solely focused on \nSCHIP tonight. I know that. I think it is also rational to understand \nthat when you are talking about expanding the rolls of Government \ninsurance coverage to 3.3 million kids, somebody ought to stand up and \nask: What about the other 45 million Americans? If, in fact, Members \nfind there is value to the reform for the entire system, then why would \nwe put the 3.3 million kids in a program that CBO already told us would \ncost $3,930 per child, which we can buy in the private marketplace for \n$1,130 worth of coverage today? Why don't we integrate them into the \nlast system, which is reform our health care system.\n  Let's bring equity to the tax side and provide every American who is \nuninsured with the resources they need to go out and negotiate their \ncoverage, whether they are individuals or families. Let's give the \nhealth care delivery system the confidence of knowing we are willing to \ncreate a market. This is not an unusual thing for us. We did it with \nPart D Medicare. The chairman of the committee was very instrumental in \nits passage. Today, 1 year after enactment of Part D Medicare, we \ncreated transparency and competition on what was one of the most price-\nsensitive areas: prescription drugs. What has the net result been? \nPremiums reduced 28 percent the first year, and drugs were reduced 33 \npercent. It was because we created competition and transparency. We \nmade people show their prices and made sure there were multiple plans \nthat people could choose from. The net result of that is exactly what \nwe are trying to mirror here, but do it in a way that treats health \ncare in its entirety. You cannot do that without prevention and \nwellness being the main pieces of it.\n  I thank the chairman for the fact that he listened. I appreciate \nthat. I plan to be on the floor probably several times this week. I \nwill try to do it when it doesn't interrupt the SCHIP debate. I think \nit is an important time to begin to educate our Members, to begin to \neducate America about the need for health care reform and how health \ncare reform can actually enhance the future of the very special \ndelivery system we have in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, many Senators are waiting very patiently \nthis evening. I see the Senator from Missouri, who has been extremely \npatient. We have done our best to protect Senators' places in line. \nMany Senators want to come to the floor and speak on this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be recognized in \nthis order after Senator McCaskill and Senator Gregg: Senators \nWhitehouse, Coburn, Brown, Corker, Durbin, Martinez, Klobuchar, Dole, \nand Tester.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I don't know that anybody could argue \nthat the Children's Health Insurance Program hasn't been a success. Of \ncourse it has been a success. Frankly, successes have not come easily \nin the area of health care availability in this country over the last \ndecade. So we have to protect it, we have to make sure it continues, \nand we need to make sure we expand it to as many children as possible.\n  I think this strong piece of bipartisanship we are debating today, in \nfact, does those things. The interesting thing is, I think back to a \ndebate in this Chamber that occurred in November of 2003. In November \nof 2003, there was a piece of legislation concerning prescription \ndrugs. Now, children's health insurance and prescription drugs are both \nnoble and good causes to the Senate--to try to lower the cost of \nprescription drugs, to try to provide more insurance for children. What \nare the differences between the two debates? It is really interesting \nto look, because that is when that ugly head of politics begins to rear \nand people begin to see that sometimes, unfortunately, in this building \nit is about politics instead of public policy. Both goals of public \npolicy, prescription drugs with lower costs and children's health \ninsurance--everybody has to be for those goals. But how you get there \nand what complaints you have on the way is where politics come in.\n  Medicare Part D was a $400 billion program. Interestingly enough, it \nwas passed in November of 2003 as we were approaching a Presidential \nelection and a cycle of election. Interestingly enough, the President \nwas running for reelection. Not a whisper of a veto threat was heard \neven though it was $400 billion that had no way to be paid for. There \nwas no cigarette tax in Medicare Part D. It was guaranteeing a profit \nto the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, it went so far as to make sure \nyou could not negotiate for lower prices--a bold thing, for a country \nwhere the free market is supposed to be something we relish. \nNegotiating for lower prices? That is pretty all-American. But, oh, no, \nwe made sure there was no negotiation for lower prices on the part of \nthe Government in Medicare Part D. There was no mechanism to pay for \nit.\n  Yet I hear Senators today speaking against this bill with righteous \nindignation, saying: Well, the tobacco tax in here is not going to be \nenough. The vast majority of the Republican party voted for Medicare \nPart D. I will note that the Senator who will follow me on the floor \nwas one of the brave souls who voted no, and I am willing to bet it was \nbecause he was trying to be responsible relating to the budget. Most of \nhis colleagues didn't agree with him, and certainly the President of \nthe United States didn't agree. Not only did he sign the bill, he \nsigned it with relish and he campaigned on it, even though the way the \nprogram is going to be implemented was not going to hit home for \nseniors for years in advance.\n  I think we can all be proud that there are some savings with Medicare \nPart D. We have to be honest that the Government is paying a price for \nit, just like we are going to pay a price for enhancing and protecting \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program in this country. Other than \nMedicare Part D, we have not lifted a pinky finger in the area of \nhealth care during this administration.\n  Most Americans are now scared. They are scared about getting care for \ntheir children, getting care for their parents, and they are scared \nabout whether they are going to be able to afford health care, knowing \nthat any minute their employer may drop their coverage. The expansion \nof this program has more to do with the unavailability of health care \nfrom an employer than it has to do with some effort on the part of the \nGovernment to insure every person.\n  This is a public-private effort that has been a success. It is a \nblock grant, not an entitlement. It allows the States flexibility. It \nis everything a Government program should be. It is getting to a very \nimportant need. There are so many reasons to be for this bill. I will \nnot take the time tonight to go into them all because my colleagues \nwill and they have today. I listened for a couple of hours when I was \nsitting in the chair. I am sure this will go on tomorrow with many \npeople talking about important things.\n  I want to mention one part of the bill that I think is very \nimportant, which has not been talked about--mental health parity. We \nhave spent a lot of time talking about our children being at risk for \ndrugs and alcohol. We have talked a lot about how we have to teach them \nthe dangers of drugs and alcohol. Truth be known, one of the biggest \nfailures in our health care system\n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\nin this country is the complete unavailability of mental health \nservices for children.\n  Right now, in America, if you have health insurance and you know \npeople and you are educated, it is difficult to find a mental health \nprofessional that specializes in children. If you are a poor working \nfamily and your child has gotten involved with drugs or alcohol and you \nwant to get them mental health assistance, a treatment program, forget \nabout it. It is literally almost impossible to access programs that can \nhelp adolescents and teens get off drugs and alcohol if they turn down \nthat path at a young age.\n  This will allow those programs to get the parity they need in the \nStates. Speaking from experience, in terms of watching the expensive \nprice tag on what happens to these young people if they get addicted to \ndrugs or alcohol at a young age, the costs to the Government are huge \nbecause of what it means down the line in terms of wasted productivity, \ncriminal conduct, the prison systems, and other health care costs down \nthe line.\n  There are very few kids who are addicted to drugs and alcohol who can \nget help when they are young, and a vast majority of them who do not \nend up charging us a heftier pricetag down the line, in terms of \nGovernment programs and assistance.\n  This is a very wise investment of the public dollar, to get not only \nthe physical health care but the mental health care to the children of \nthis country who desperately need it. We have talked about dental care \nand emergency rooms and broken arms, but I think it is time we realized \nwe are abandoning our children when it comes to important mental health \ncare services. This bill will go a long way toward fixing it.\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will not be \nsituationally worried about the budget. When this was a program that \nwas passed in 2003, $400 billion with no offsets, no way to pay for it, \nthey lined up to vote for it, and the President signed it gleefully. It \nwill be a bitter pill for America's children to swallow if, in a \nresponsible way, we move forward to protect this program and this \nPresident decides to veto it. But if he does, he should know there are \nmany of us here who will stand and fight with all the might we can \nmuster on behalf of the kids of this country who deserve a chance at \nhealth care, deserve a chance for peace of mind for their parents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I appreciate the acknowledgment of \nthe Senator from Missouri of my views on the Part D proposal. She is \ncorrect, I did not vote for that proposal because it was not paid for. \nI don't think one expensive program deserves another expensive program, \nespecially when the second expensive program is backed with very poor \npolicy.\n  What I wish to talk about tonight is the policy. The issue, of \ncourse, should be how we get more children insured and how we get fewer \npeople uninsured in this country. There are a variety of ways to do \nthat. I have had a number of proposals of my own in this arena. \nHowever, it is not a good idea to approach this issue of how we get \nmore children insured by suggesting that the best way to do it is to \ntake a lot of kids off private insurance and move them on to public \ninsurance or to, under the nomenclature of protecting children, which \nis, of course, very popular--and we have had lots of pictures on this \nfloor already of children who have gone through very serious health \nconcerns who need to have the support of the health community, of using \nchildren and pictures of children and anecdotal stories about children \nfor the purposes of using a Federal program which is entitled \nchildren--to cover adults, some adults who, in fact, do not even have \nchildren. There are a lot of serious policy problems with this \ninitiative.\n  The irony, of course, is this initiative is not about insuring more \nchildren, although that is a stated goal. The purpose of this \ninitiative is to essentially take another large step down the road \ntoward Federal control and delivery of health care in this country, \nuniversal health care, as it is popularly referred to. That is not me \nphrasing that. The chairman of the Finance Committee, who is always \nvery forthright, always very honest about what he is doing around here, \nsaid exactly that: SCHIP is a major step on the road to a universal, \none-payer, Federal health care system. There are a lot of folks on the \nother side of the aisle who especially believe that should be the \nproper way to insure people in this country or take care of health care \nneeds in this country, and I respect that viewpoint.\n  However, I do not think it accomplishes what the goal is, which is to \ndeliver high-quality health care to the most people in this country, to \nmake health care affordable to most people in this country, and to give \npeople in this country the opportunity to get good health care. What it \ndoes is what was described earlier in one of the starkest and most \neffective attacks on universal health care I have heard on this floor, \nwhen the Senator from North Dakota essentially explained the Indian \nhealth care program and what a disaster it is.\n  What is the Indian health care program? The Indian health care \nprogram is single-payer Federal health care. He was talking about kids \nnot being able to see dentists, kids not being able to get broken arms \nfixed, kids put in serious situations and adults in equally serious \nsituations and no resources, no capability to take care of these people \nwho are having serious health care problems. Interestingly enough, he \nused the word which is most often associated with those studies which \nhave looked at universal health care or federally mandated health care \nor single-payer health care. He used the word ``rationing.'' He said \nrationing was occurring on the Indian reservations. He is right. He is \nright because that is what happens when you go to a single-payer system \nand the Federal Government becomes the payer. That is what they have in \nEngland, they have rationing. If you have certain situations, if you \nhave a hip replacement, you are going to be rationed, depending on your \nage. If you have cancer and you are under a certain age, you are going \nto get hit with rationing. If you have to have some sort of invasive \nprocedure which is optional, you are going to get hit with rationing.\n  The same thing happens in Canada. Why do you think Canadians come to \nAmerica for health care? In New Hampshire, we see it fairly regularly, \nCanadians coming over the border to get their health care at Boston, at \none of the many extraordinary medical facilities in Boston or at \nDartmouth-Hitchcock, one of the best, most extraordinary facilities in \nNew England, in the country quite obviously. Why? Because there is \nquality there, because things are being done there that are not being \ndone in Canada, and you can get served. You don't have to wait in lines \n2, 3, 4, 5 years for some sort of elective surgery, or if you have to \nhave something done that is a major, complicated issue, you don't have \nto worry that the people doing it maybe do not have the expertise you \nneed because the Government hasn't paid for the science behind the \nnecessary research to produce that service.\n  This SCHIP fight is as much a debate about whether we are going to \nmove to a single-payer system with the Federal Government taking \ncomplete control over health care as it is about how we pick up \ncoverage of children in this country who don't have coverage.\n  Coverage for children in this country is affordable. We can do it \nwithout going to a single-payer system. We don't need to take 2.2 \nmillion kids off one system and put them on the SCHIP system. We don't \nneed to take, I believe it is 1.7 million kids off private insurance \nand put them on public insurance.\n\n  The total amount of children who are going to be covered by this $35 \nbillion in new program over the next 5 years--do you know how much? Mr. \nPresident, 4.5 million children. But of that number, 2.2 million \nalready have coverage. So actually there are only 2.3 million children \nyou are picking up, and it is costing you $35 billion to do that. That \nworks out to something akin to $3,200 per child.\n  You can go on the Internet today and buy an insurance policy for a \nchild for about $1,300. So in the classic way that the Federal \nGovernment works, we are going to spend twice as much of your tax \ndollars to pay for insurance for children, and we are going to take \npeople who are already covered and move them from having the private \nsector bear the cost of that coverage over to\n\n[[Page S10382]]\n\nthe public sector so the public sector bears the cost of that coverage. \nDoes that make sense? Is that common sense? Is that a good use of \nresources? Of course, it isn't.\n  The practical effect is also that under this proposal, the program is \nnot paid for. In the second 5 years, in order to avoid the pay-go \ndiscipline which is allegedly on the other side of the aisle, the Holy \nGrail that is supposed to be followed in every instance--of course, \nthey have waived it now nine times on domestic spending they like--they \ntake the cost of this program and project that in year 6 of this \nprogram, a program which will have been built up to $16 billion in \nspending annually will suddenly drop back to $3.5 billion in spending. \nNow that doesn't pass the smell test. That is the laugh test. That is \nabsurd on its face. No Federal program ever disappears around here, and \nyou don't take one that supposedly is benefiting children and cut it by \nalmost $12.35 billion. That is not going to happen, but that is the \nassumption that is made in this bill in order to avoid having to pay \nfor this bill.\n  So this big white area, which is all the area that isn't covered of \nthe projected costs--and this is actually a conservative number, by the \nway, this projected cost, that represents $40 billion, $40 billion that \nis unpaid for--is a cost we pass on to our children, by the way.\n  Ironically, we say we are going to insure our children by paying \ntwice as much as it costs to insure them and by taking a bunch of kids \noff private insurance and move them to the public sector, and then at \nthe same time we are going to create a $40 billion debt which our \nchildren will have to pay for. I am not sure our children are getting \nall that good a deal, to be very honest with you, in this exercise.\n  Plus, the ultimate goal of the exercise--I believe the ultimate goal \nhas been stated by the chairman of the committee--the ultimate goal is \nto move toward a universal, single-payer system, where the Federal \nGovernment pays for health care. Here is the goal: You have all these \nfolks on Medicare on one end, the elderly folks--that is me. I \nshouldn't call them too elderly--and then you have all these people on \nSCHIP, taken off private sector and being put in the public sector, \nsuch as this bill does, you have compressed the number of people \navailable in the private insurance market, you are going to crowd out \nthe private market. That is the game plan, crowd out the private market \nso you end up with a single-payer plan.\n  As I have already gone through, single-payer plans make very little \nsense from a standpoint of quality and rationing. I don't think this \ncountry will be very comfortable with a single-payer plan, any more \ncomfortable than, for example, the Indian population appears to be on \nthe Indian reservations, as was explained to us by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, who was describing a single-payer plan, otherwise known \nas Indian health care.\n  So within this proposal, not only does it have this $40 billion gap \nin funds in spending, which it doesn't pay for in order to avoid the \npay-go rule, not only does it take a bunch of kids who already have \nprivate insurance and move them to the public side, 1.7 million kids, \nand then end up paying twice as much to insure them as it is probably \ncosting the private sector and sticking themselves with that bill \nbecause they don't pay for the program in the outyears, not only does \nit do all that, which is terrible policy, but it compounds this by \ntaking a program which is supposed to insure children and using it to \ninsure adults.\n  Both the predecessor program, State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, and the present program as proposed under this legislation, \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, do not say anything in their title \nabout insuring adults. They are supposed to be insuring children. That \nis the idea. But some of our States, in a very creative exercise, have \ndecided to expand this program to insure adults. That makes some people \nin this body quite happy because it fulfills this exercise of moving \ntoward universal health care. You can use the SCHIP program or the CHIP \nprogram, which is supposed to be for children, to pick up adults, and \nthen we will even narrow further the population of people who would be \navailable for private sector insurance and, thus, move even more \naggressively toward public, single-payer insurance, public single-payer \nplans, universal health care, rationing, reduction in quality. It makes \nno sense that this should be allowed to continue.\n\n  Now, actually, the committee knows this. In fact, they sort of \ntacitly recognized it, because they put in place language which \nattempts to partially phase out this coverage of adults. They say over \n3 years these waivers will end that cover adults, but adults will be \ninsured, instead of at the rate of Medicaid, which is what the States \nhave a right to reimbursement for when they insure adults who qualify, \nthey will get some new blended rate that is higher than Medicaid but \nless than what you pay for children. So in a tacit way the committee \nhas sort of acknowledged that they shouldn't be insuring adults with a \nprogram called Children's Health Insurance.\n  The only adults who could possibly and appropriately--and I have no \nproblem with this--be covered under that would be pregnant women. \nObviously, there is a clear issue of insuring a child if a woman is \npregnant. She has a child. She is with child and, therefore, clearly \nthat coverage is reasonable. But adults are supposed to be covered, if \nthey qualify for Federal coverage, under Medicaid, not under the \nchildren's health insurance system.\n  So the amendment I am offering essentially completes the thought of \nthe committee on this point by saying: No, we are not going to \nreimburse States. This isn't about insuring so much as about what the \nreimbursement rate is to the State--what sort of windfall a State gets \nwhen they move adults on to the SCHIP program.\n  There are a lot of State Governors who have figured out, I can get \nmore money for my State, which I can use to help me balance my budget, \nif I put more adults under SCHIP because my reimbursement rate from the \nFederal Government is significantly higher. So that is why this \nhappens.\n  Well, it is not right. It is gaming the Federal system to do that. \nWaivers shouldn't be granted to allow that to happen, and this \nadministration bears many of the problems when it comes to that. They \ndo not come to this issue with clean hands, that is for sure, because \nthey have given a lot of these waivers. But the committee at least \nrecognized this was not good policy and has tried to mute it a little \nbit so that States, when they do game this, will only be able to game \nit for another 3 years and then reduce it to about half of what gaming \ngoes on in the outyears.\n  But there shouldn't be any of this. There is no reason to give States \na breathing spell here on this issue. There is no reason to encourage \nStates to put more adults into the system in the interim or to put more \nadults in the system in the future because you are reimbursing at a \nhigher rate than Medicaid reimburses at. No reason at all. There is no \ngood policy reason. The States have certainly had a good run of money \ncoming in to them that they didn't deserve, because the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program was not supposed to insure adults, it was \nsupposed to insure children. So we are not doing them a disservice and \nwe are not treating them unfairly by saying: All right, that policy \nends. The SCHIP program, the new CHIP program, will be for children, \nnot for adults.\n  So my amendment essentially does this. It says: Adults will not be \ncovered under this program at the SCHIP rate. They can still be covered \nunder the Medicaid rate but not under the SCHIP rate, which seems to be \na very reasonable approach to a program entitled children's health \ninsurance.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2587 to Amendment No. 2530\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the pending amendment be set aside and my amendment be \nreported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what an interesting debate this has been. \nIf you want to know how Congress is likely to react to the fact that we \nhave 47 million uninsured Americans and millions more with health \ninsurance that is almost worthless, if you want to know what Congress \nis likely to say about the plight of families who struggle each year \nwith premiums rising and coverage falling, you should listen to this \ndebate. Because my friends on the Republican side of the aisle--not all \nof them, but a number of them--want to argue for the proposition that \nwe ought to be careful we don't insure too many people in America.\n  It is an easy thing for a Member of the Senate to argue. We are some \nof the luckiest people in America. We are covered by the Federal \nEmployees\n\n[[Page S10384]]\n\nHealth Benefit Program. That may be the sweetest deal in terms of \nhealth insurance anyone can dream of. It covers 8 million Federal \nemployees, including Congressmen, Senators, and their families, and it \nallows us--if you can believe it, those watching this debate across \nAmerica--it allows us once each year to decide if we want to change \ncompanies. If we don't like the way we were treated last year, if a \nparticular company didn't cover something important to our family, we \ncan say: That is it, we are buying a new product. It is like shopping \nfor a car and we are in the driver's seat because we have options.\n  In my State of Illinois, my wife and I can choose from nine different \nhealth insurance plans. If we want to get more coverage, we can have \nmore taken out of my check; less coverage, a lower amount. Our choice. \nReal consumers. Boy, there aren't very many Americans who can say that, \nare there? How few Americans can stand up and say: If I don't like my \nhealth insurance company, I will buy another. But we can do it. The \nSenators coming to the floor today arguing against children's health \ninsurance being extended to too many people have that luxury. They are \npart of the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program.\n  Most of us here in the Senate bring our life experience to the floor. \nIn this bill, there are two life experiences I have been through that \ncome to mind. The first relates to the way we pay for children's health \ninsurance, and that is with the tobacco tax. Well, tobacco has been a \nbig issue in my congressional career. It was 20 years ago that I \ndecided to introduce a bill to ban smoking on airplanes. It was \nconsidered a radical idea, that we would have no smoking on airplanes. \nBack in those days, they split the plane up, smoking and nonsmoking, \nand argued if you sat in the nonsmoking section that you were \nprotected. Everybody knew better, but nobody questioned it. So I \nintroduced a bill to take smoking off airplanes. My interest in that \nwent beyond the fact that I was a frequent flyer, as most Members of \nCongress are. It even went beyond the fact that I had read the \nstatistics about secondhand smoke and the damage it had caused to so \nmany innocent people. It went to a personal life experience. My father \nsmoked two packs of Camels a day. He was an addicted smoker for as long \nas I knew him, and I didn't know him very long. When I was 14, he died. \nHe was 53 years old, and he died of lung cancer. I stood by his bed and \nwatched as he took his last breath on November 13, 1959, at noon. I \ndidn't swear then and there that I would get even with tobacco \ncompanies. But looking back, and as a young boy, I never got it out of \nmy mind that that product, that tobacco product, had taken his life and \ntaken him from me.\n  I remembered it whenever I would fight the tobacco companies, and I \nhave quite a few times. I would think about all the other young people, \nmen and women across America whose lives had been touched by tobacco \ndisease.\n  My dad started smoking when he was a kid--most people do. So how do \nwe stop kids from making that terrible choice in their lives? There is \na simple way--raise the cost of the product. The more expensive a pack \nof cigarettes is, the less likely a younger child will start smoking \nand the less likely they will be addicted. That is simple economics. We \nhave proven that over and over again.\n  We have these charts here that show U.S. cigarette prices versus \nconsumption. As the price goes up, the consumption goes down. It is \nthat basic. So we pay for this bill for children's health insurance \nacross America by imposing a higher tax on tobacco products and \ncigarettes. It is no surprise that my Senate colleagues from tobacco-\nproducing States don't like the idea at all. For years, they have come \nto the floor of the House and Senate and argued against tobacco taxes \nfor a variety of different reasons, but they can't argue against this \nreality. The higher the cost, the lower the consumption. Certainly \namong children it is even more dramatic.\n  So for many who have come to argue against our approach to expanding \nchildren's health insurance, saying it is not fiscally responsible, it \nis as responsible as you can ask for. We are going to pay for it, and \nwe pay for it with a tax on a product that claims over half a million \nAmerican lives each year. Tobacco is still the No. 1 preventable cause \nof death and disease in America. Sparing a child from addiction to \ntobacco is sparing them the 1-in-3 likelihood that they will die from \nthat addiction.\n\n  The second life experience that brings me to this issue goes back to \nmy time in law school here in Washington at Georgetown Law Center. My \nwife and I were married after my first year in law school, and a baby \ncame along rather quickly. Our daughter was born at the end of my \nsecond year, and I didn't have health insurance. I was a law student. \nWe were happy to have our little girl, but a little surprised and \nunprepared. So we had to save up the money to pay for her delivery. \nLuckily, in those days, it wasn't as expensive as today, but for a law \nstudent it was still a lot of money. My wife worked during the \npregnancy, I tried to save a few dollars, and we had enough money to \npay the obstetrician and pay the hospital for my daughter's delivery \nwhile I was still in law school. But something happened 30 days after \nthat which made a big difference. My daughter was diagnosed with a \nserious illness. Still, we had no health insurance. I found out what it \nwas like to be the parent of a child and to have no health insurance. \nIt was a humbling experience. I used to leave law school and drive over \nto Children's Hospital here in Washington, DC, pick up my wife and \nbaby, drive over there and sit in the clinic. The clinic was, I guess, \nthe place for those of us who didn't have health insurance, and we \nwould wait our turns. There were a lot of people in that clinic, and it \nmeant waiting a long time. I was glad to wait, because I wanted some \ndoctor, some competent physician, to come see my daughter.\n  Well, we usually ended up with a resident who took the history, which \nwe gave over and over and over again. But that is the price you pay \nwhen you don't have a regular doctor and a regular appointment. So the \nchart of my daughter's background grew and grew, and I sat there with \nmy wife time after time waiting for a doctor to examine my baby. It \nwasn't a reassuring feeling for a father, because you want to believe \nthat the doctor who is going to be there for your baby is the best. If \nyou don't have health insurance, you may be tossing the dice. I learned \nwhat it was like. It was a humbling experience. I have never forgotten \nit, and I never will.\n  We are talking about children across America now who have no health \ninsurance. Of the 47 million who are uninsured in America, about 9 \nmillion are children. We decided about 10 years ago to create a special \nprogram to provide uninsured kids with healthcare coverage. It worked. \nIt worked very well. Over 6 million kids across America today have \nhealth insurance because of this program, and it is a program that \npeople like because Governors and others can work to make it fit into \ntheir State, to fit their needs. There are Government guidelines, but \nthere is flexibility through waivers that are offered. So a lot of \nStates are trying different ways to bring more children in and cover \nmore uninsured people. I think that is a good thing. I hope that \nwhoever the next President of the United States may be--and we all have \nour favorites in this Chamber--whoever it may be, they will start their \nadministration by saying they are going to challenge America to \neliminate the uninsured over a specific period of time. And wouldn't \nthey start with the kids?\n  The bill that came out of the Finance Committee is a bipartisan bill. \nI want to salute not only Senator Baucus of Montana, the chairman, but \nSenator Grassley of Iowa, the ranking minority member, and others, \nSenator Hatch of Utah, Senator Rockefeller of West Virginia, and \nSenator Snowe of Maine, who have all made a real bipartisan effort. \nWhat we are trying to do is to take this bill and reauthorize this \nChildren's Health Insurance Program so that we cover even more \nchildren. In fact, we have the opportunity to add another 3.2 million \nto the 6.6 currently covered. That is almost 10 million kids who will \nhave health insurance, if we are successful. It will still leave almost \n6 million uninsured. That is still too many, as far as I am \nconcerned. But we are moving forward. We are dealing with political \nrealities and budget realities and doing the best we can under these \ncircumstances.\n\n[[Page S10385]]\n\n  But Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, is going to come to the \nfloor and suggest spending dramatically less money on this program. The \nnet result of it is that Senator McConnell and others are going to \nargue let's not increase the number of uninsured kids covered by this \nprogram. At the end of the day it is going to mean that just about 9 \nmillion kids in America will be uninsured instead of the 6 million that \nwill remain if we pass this proposal. Senator McConnell has made a \ncalculation that he is willing to leave millions of uninsured kids \nbehind.\n  He doesn't like the tobacco tax. Being from Kentucky, I am not \nsurprised. But for many of us it is a small price to pay, increasing \nthe cost of tobacco products so that kids have more health insurance. \nThe important thing about this debate is it is a precursor of a much \nbigger debate that is to come over whether America is going to get \nserious about the shortcomings when it comes to health insurance.\n  I know there are a lot of people with a lot of different theories. I \nsee my friend from Oklahoma, a medical doctor. He and I have talked \nabout this. He has a much different view about this issue than I do. I \nhope his approach, if it is ever tested, works. But I believe this \napproach will work because what we are doing is taking those who have \nbeen unfortunate enough not to have health insurance and giving them a \nchance for coverage.\n  We know the poorest kids in America are eligible for Medicaid, a \nprogram that we share with the States all across the Nation. We know \nthat the kids from wealthier families usually have health insurance \nthrough some worker in the household. But what about the kids caught in \nthe middle? What about the kids where the parents do go to work but \ndon't make enough money? What about the kids from families who, because \nof an existing medical condition or some other complication, can't \nafford health insurance, can't buy health insurance? That is what this \nprogram is all about.\n  There has been a lot of criticism of this program--I have heard it on \nthe Senate floor today repeatedly--that it just covers too many \nchildren. We really ought to cut back on the number of kids covered. \nThat really betrays an approach to this issue which I think we will \nhear more of. There are some people who, for a variety of reasons, \nphilosophical and economic, would leave a lot of kids and a lot of \nuninsured Americans behind and say: That's life.\n  I don't accept that. I don't think that should be life in America. We \nlive in a much better nation than that. Our values are stronger than \nthat. We exalt family in America. We say that is the strength of our \nNation. How can you exalt families and say that you want to make them \nstronger and not provide one of the basics in life--health insurance?\n  I know what it is like sitting in that waiting room, worrying about \nmy own daughter's care, with no health insurance. I try to think of \nmillions of other families who face that every single day. We were \nlucky. We got through it. My daughter is 39 years old now and has her \nown family. We were blessed in many ways.\n  But it was a tough experience I wouldn't wish on anybody. Those who \nvote against this proposal are wishing it on millions of Americans. In \nfact, they know millions of Americans will continue to have no health \ninsurance and they accept it.\n  There is a young teenager in Naperville, IL, I am honored to \nrepresent. His name is Michael, and he is 17 years old. When he was in \nthe fourth grade, he was friends with a young boy named Joey. He used \nto talk about Joey as his friend with the megawatt smile. They shared \nlunch together and kept their secrets safe for one another. But, \nunfortunately, Joey complained a lot about just not feeling right. He \nmissed a lot of school. He was tired, his knees hurt, he bruised \neasily.\n  It came as a shock one day when Michael was told that Joey had been \ndiagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, a devastating, life-\nthreatening disease. Then they learned another piece of alarming news: \nJoey's dad, who was a house painter, was self-employed and like \nmillions of other self-employed Americans, was uninsured.\n  In the 4 years that followed, Joey with leukemia, would come to \nschool when he could. He lost his hair with the treatment he received. \nHe was frail, and he wore his Cubs cap to cover his bald head. \nSometimes he only stayed for a couple of hours, but all the kids \nremember they were good hours. They were happy to see him.\n  Then, on January 8, 2003, the school counselor came in and told \nMichael and his class that Joey was not going to return. That is not an \nunusual story in America--but it should be.\n  What does this say about America, that 9 million children do not have \nthe most basic health protection in our country? We are so proud of so \nmany achievements that we have registered in the course of our history. \nWe are so proud of the opportunities in our country. But how would we \nexplain to future generations that we would just walk away from those \nkids and this opportunity to provide them with coverage? If Senator \nMcConnell's alternative prevails, we will walk away from 9 million \nuninsured children. If the committee proposal prevails, we at least \nwill take care of about 3.2 million of those kids. I wish we would take \ncare of more.\n  We also know that if kids don't receive basic health care, a lot of \nsimple things can become complicated; a lot of things that can be \ntreated successfully will be ignored and unfortunately become worse. As \nMichael puts it, how many Joeys could be saved if only affordable \nhealth insurance was available to all children?\n  What do Americans think about this general concept of helping States \ncover more uninsured children? In a country that is sharply divided \nalong political lines on so many issues, this is one that is \noverwhelmingly popular. Ninety-one percent of the American people get \nit. They think this is the right thing to do, to cover more children. \nEighty-four percent specifically support covering all uninsured \nchildren with the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is hard to \nbelieve that number exists, when you hear some of the speeches against \nthis program from the other side of the aisle. With this program we \nhave reduced the number of uninsured children in America by a third.\n\n  States have worked to design programs that work best for them. My \nState is one of them. Illinois now provides coverage to over 130,000 \nparents under CHIP, and because of the increased outreach and \nenrollment, 250,000 more parents than it did prior to receiving a \nwaiver from our Government to offer that coverage.\n  You say to yourself, if this is a children's program, why are you \ncovering parents? They found the vast majority of parents had no health \ninsurance or couldn't afford the health insurance they had, and by \noffering them insurance, it brought their children into coverage as \nwell. Some will say it is not what the program is about; it is the \nchildren's health insurance program. But for these people, they \nconsider it somehow a violation of trust that we would expand the \nprogram to bring in uninsured parents. To me, it is striving to reach a \nnational goal, where every American, regardless of their economic \nsituation, has health insurance. That is something I support and most \nAmericans support, and something this program tries to achieve.\n  We give the States such as New Jersey and Illinois and many others \nthe option to cover more parents. What is striking is, during the same \ntime period that the state covered these parents, Illinois has added \nmore than 360,00 children to Medicaid and CHIP coverage, so this \nprogram has worked. It has become an outreach program to let parents \nknow they have an option. They may qualify for Medicaid. They may \nqualify for the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is a 38-percent \nincrease in the number of kids covered by health insurance in my State. \nIs that working, a 38-percent increase? I think, frankly, the figures \nare obvious.\n  Just last week, Illinois State officials hosted delegations from \naround the country, briefing them on how our program works and maybe \nexchanging some ideas on how to make it better in their States and ours \nas well. Illinois was telling other states how to do it because \nIllinois has a successful model.\n  This is not a perfect piece of legislation. I wish it were larger. I \nwould spend more than $35 billion. I would raise the tobacco taxes \nhigher, if necessary. I would find other ways to offset the cost \nbecause I think we should be striving for full coverage of all \nuninsured children in America. What a\n\n[[Page S10386]]\n\ngreat day that would be. What a celebration it would be for us to be \nable to say, on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats have \nreached that goal.\n  This bill doesn't quite reach the goal. But let's celebrate what it \ndoes. It moves us forward. It preserves a program which would expire on \nSeptember 30, and it expands it. With these new funds and an accurate \nformula, combined with the incentive bonuses proposed, Illinois could \ncover as many as 123,400 children who are uninsured today over the next \n5 years. That is a dramatic expansion. It is one which I would be happy \nto vote for and will vote for.\n  The Finance Committee bill increases eligibility levels for children \ncovered under this Children's Health Insurance Program to 300 percent \nof Federal poverty. Some people on the floor have talked about 300 \npercent of Federal poverty level as a higher income. Do you know what \nit means to have a family of four and be at 300 percent of poverty? It \nmeans an income of $62,000 a year. That is a little over $1,000 a week. \nThat is maybe a little more than $5,000 a month. It is hard to imagine \npeople are living in the lap of luxury, after they pay their taxes and \ntheir basic expenses, paying for the higher price of gasoline and \nutility bills, paying for whatever it takes to have a safe and sound \nplace to live in.\n  I think most of us who are blessed with a lot more income should \nreflect on a family of four struggling with $62,000 a year. I don't \nthink there are many vacations or trips to the movies with that kind of \nincome. For the State of Illinois, this change in eligibility level \nwould bring in an additional $26.5 million to cover thousands of \nadditional kids, which is certainly a positive step forward.\n  I can tell you that Senator McConnell, who is offering a Republican \nalternative--as I mentioned earlier, is not offering an alternative \nembraced by all Republicans. Many support the bipartisan bill that came \nout of the committee and see it as strengthening a successful \nbipartisan program. Senator McConnell sees it as a slippery slope to \nuniversal coverage.\n  The Republican leader yesterday invoked all the right words when he \ndescribed his Republican alternative: low-income children, fiscally \nresponsible, providing a safety net. He criticized the bill from the \ncommittee as a ``dramatic departure from current SCHIP law.''\n  What he failed to mention is his alternative is the dramatic \ndeparture. It includes a bare reauthorization of the program and adds \nin small business health plans and health savings account reform. \nIncidentally, the health savings account is the refuge for all of my \nfriends on the Republican side of the aisle. When they can't think of \nanything to say about covering more people with health insurance, they \ncome in with these health savings accounts--an idea once waltzed out by \nSpeaker Gingrich that has gone around the track many times and has not \nshown the success that they promised.\n  Here it is again--no surprise. The Republican proposal by Senator \nMcConnell would likely cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose \ncoverage.\n  I am encouraged that the reauthorization bill before us has sparked a \nnational conversation, not only about the kids who are uninsured but \nothers as well. My counterparts on the other side of the aisle have not \nalways been open to that conversation, but that is not what is before \nus. The bill we are considering will reauthorize the Children's Health \nInsurance Program before it expires on September 30.\n  This is not the time or vehicle to try to add all kinds of health \ncare proposals, but that day should come. This is the time to take care \nof our nation's children and we will pay for it as we go. As I said \nearlier, this new tobacco tax is a smart thing from a health point of \nview. In a poll conducted by the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, two-\nthirds, 67 percent, of those interviewed favored such a tax increase. \nOnly 28 percent opposed it. Moreover nearly half, 49 percent, strongly \nfavored it. Only 20 percent strongly opposed it. It is the right thing \nto do. We know what tobacco does to the health of America. Discouraging \nits use is a move in the right direction.\n  This is an historic debate, one that is long overdue. We know health \ncare is the most important issue to Americans next to the war in Iraq, \nand very rarely if ever do we seriously address it. We know the \nbusiness community is begging us to move forward and expand health \ninsurance coverage in this country to help them find a way to move to \nuniversal coverage which will not be at the expense of competitiveness. \nWe know that working families, those in labor unions and those who are \nnot, all understand the cost of health insurance and its value to every \nfamily, and we know from our own personal experiences and the people we \nmeet in our States that this is long overdue. It is about time we \nopened up this discussion.\n  I am heartened by the work of the Finance Committee. The fact they \nbrought this bill to us with strong bipartisan support on the floor of \nthe Senate is an indication that there is some promise to this debate. \nI thank my colleagues who worked so hard on the committee to bring this \nbill forward. I hope we can build on it, cover more uninsured children, \nand move to the day that every single American, regardless of their \nincome, has basic health insurance coverage so that every American has \npeace of mind when it comes to their health and the health of their \nfamily, so that no American, whether a law student or someone who has a \nlow-income job, has to wait and pray that there will be good \nprofessional health care for their children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The junior Senator from Oklahoma \nis recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to spend a little bit of time \nfirst discussing health care in America. I have a little bit of \nexperience, having practiced for 24 years. The children the majority \nwhip talked about, I delivered 4,000 of them. I cared for well over a \nthird of those through their infancy and into childhood.\n  Let's be clear about what this debate is. There is no difference. I \nagree with Senator Durbin. I want every person in this country to have \nhealth insurance. Actually, every problem that Senator Durbin mentioned \ncould be solved by equalizing the tax treatment under the Tax Code so \nthat everybody is treated the same under the Tax Code in this country.\n  Let's talk about where we are in health care in America today, then \nlet's talk about what the possible solutions are.\n  What we have today is the best health care in the world. It is very \nexpensive, there is no question about it. Eighty percent of all of the \ninnovation in health care in the world comes out of our health care \nsystem. We have survival rates on prostate cancer, breast cancer, and \ncolon cancer that far exceed anywhere else in the world. Our treatments \nfor coronary artery disease are better than anywhere else in the world. \nIf you have a heart attack in this country, you are more likely to live \n5 years than anywhere else in the world. But we have a system that is \ndesigned to treat chronic disease instead of designed to prevent \ndisease.\n  I know that the President this evening is supportive of prevention in \nterms of how do we change the focus in this country. You see, what we \nhave coming to us is a storm. It is not going to be a storm that \naffects myself or the Senator from Ohio; it is going to affect our kids \nand our grandchildren. Here is what the storm is. If you are born \ntoday, born today, you are born owing $500,000 for the health care of \neverybody who was born before you under Medicare. Think of that. Listen \nto me--$500,000 is the cost we are laying on the next generation for \nthe health care system we have under Medicare. That is not talking \nabout Medicaid, that is not about SCHIP, that is about Medicare only. \nIf you are born today, that is what you are going to bear over and \nabove what our present tax rate is. That is called stealing opportunity \nfrom the next generation.\n  We also have a health care system under which 7 percent of the costs \nof health care comes about from tests that are ordered for you that you \ndo not need. There is no reason you need them, but the tests get \nordered because your doctor needs them or your hospital needs them. It \nis a full $170 billion a year we spend on tests that nobody needs \nexcept the doctors to protect themselves in the case of ``what if.'' \nAnd this body refuses to look at tort\n\n[[Page S10387]]\n\nchanges that will make us order tests based on what you need rather \nthan on the threat of a malpractice suit.\n  So we have liability costs, we have unfunded costs from Medicare, we \ndo not have prevention. We spend tens of billions of dollars a year on \ndisease prevention in this country, $7.1 billion at the NIH, $8.4 \nbillion at the CDC, and then billions more that we can't quantify \nacross many Federal agencies where you cannot measure that we did \nanything on prevention.\n  The average American does not know that at age 50, they should have a \ncolonoscopy; they do not know that at age 35, they should have a \nmammogram; they do not know that if they have a family history of \nbreast cancer, they should have that mammogram sooner; they do not know \nthat every month, they should be doing a self breast exam; they do not \nknow the symptoms of prostate disease in older men; they do not know \nwhat they need to know about prevention. We are totally inept in the \nprograms we have today to communicate that to America.\n  So that is where we find ourselves today--the best health care system \nin the world, with the most innovation, but also 50 percent more \nexpensive than anywhere else in the world.\n  Now, when you match up those two statistics I talked about, in terms \nof greater life expectancy, in terms of all of the cancers, in terms of \nheart disease, against the cost, what is the difference in all the \ncountries that have universal, single-payor, government-run, \nbureaucratic-controlled health care? They let you die. That is the \ndifference. If you need a knee replacement, like the Senator from North \nDakota talked about, you do not get it because there is no money. Let's \ntalk about some statistics. Average waiting time in Sweden: 25 months \nfor heart surgery. How many people do you think live 25 months? How \nabout an average of 10 months before the onset of chemotherapy for \nbreast cancer in England. The reason their costs are down is because \nthey are not caring for people at the end of life.\n  We can get all of that back if we emphasize prevention. Prevention. \nFor every dollar we spend on prevention in this country, we are going \nto get 100 back. Yet we do not have effective prevention programs. So \nwhat is this debate really about?\n  There is not anybody in this Chamber who does not want to see kids \nhave great access to health care, preventative or otherwise. There is \nnot anybody in this Chamber who wants anybody not to have available \nhealth care. What is the real debate? Well, there are actually three.\n  The first debate is: Do we want the Government that cannot get you a \npassport, that cannot control the border, that cannot take care of the \nproblems associated with a hurricane when we have a major emergency, do \nyou want them running your health care? A government that is failing so \nmany fronts because the bureaucracy is so big, the oversight is so poor \nfrom this body, the oversight is so poor, we do not do our jobs. We can \nfind lots of ways to spend new money, but we cannot spend the effort to \nfind out if money we are spending is working. The oversight is so poor \nthat we have ineffective programs all over the place.\n  There is a columnist by the name of P.J. O'Rourke. He said, if you \nthink health care is expensive now, wait until it is free. And there is \na lot of truth to that. When it becomes free, it is going to be \ntremendously expensive.\n  So the debate is not about whether we should cover children and \nwhether children ought to have great health care. They should. We have \nthe resources to do it. What the debate is about is whether we are \ngoing to put into the hands of an incompetent government in many other \nareas your health care. And this is the first step in moving it all in \nthat direction.\n  Now, the Senator from Illinois talked about the young child with \nacute lymphoblastic leukemia. We have moved to where we have about an \n80-percent cure rate with that right now. We did not do that through \nthe Government; we did that through the private sector. But he also \nnoted that he did get this care. He did get chemotherapy. He did get \nit. So the other point that needs to be made about--the system we have \nnow is shifting a quarter of a trillion dollars a year into a system \nbecause we are absorbing costs rather than giving individuals their \ncare based on freedom.\n\n  The second point is, if we do this expansion of SCHIP, are we getting \ngood value for what we are paying? There is a chart I want to put up \nthat shows--these are CBO numbers. The reference to the private care \ncomes from data about the individual health insurance market. The \n$1,532 comes from average of a $500 deductible added to the average \npremium for a private children's policy: $1,032. One in three will pay \na $1,500 deductible, two will pay no deductible. So for $1,532, you can \nbuy private coverage, but with this bill we are talking about spending \n$3,950 for government care for the same thing. That expense will be \ncharged to your children and your grandchildren. I think it is probably \nnot a great deal, not great value, for us to do it this way.\n  The other thing the Senator from Illinois recognized is that he \nwanted everybody to have insurance. All he has to do is cosponsor the \nBurr-Corker bill because that gives everybody in this country, if you \nare an individual, a $2,160 tax credit, refundable flat tax credit. If \nyou are a family, it gives a $5,400 refundable tax credit.\n  Now, what does that mean? If you are earning $61,950, a bureaucrat is \ngoing to decide what your health care is and who your doctor is going \nto be and whether or not you have care versus you deciding. It is about \nfreedom to choose.\n  So the Senator from Illinois can have every one of the desires he \nlisted and meet every one of the goals by us equalizing the benefit \nunder the Tax Code for all of us. That means it does not matter if you \nare rich or poor; you get the same treatment under the Tax Code. In \nother words, we are going to guarantee 100 percent universal access for \neverybody in this country, and it is not going to cost a penny.\n  The other thing this debate is about is, Do we really want to have a \ndebate in this country on health care? If we do, let's have a total \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, so this debate is about whether we get value, this \ndebate is about whether we really are going to fix health care, and \nfinally, this debate is about the dishonesty in this bill about how it \nis paid for. And what we are doing--you saw Senator Gregg with the \nchart out here. We are going to assume that in year 6, the cost of this \nis $3.5 billion, but the new program is 12. There has never been a \nprogram that is going to go down from that. So rather than violate \ntheir own rules, they cut it down and said it does not exist at the \nsame level for the second 5 years of this authorization. That is \nexactly what America has come to expect of us--being intellectually \ndishonest with them about the true costs of programs.\n  So, as Senator Gregg said, the debate really is about the starting of \nthe debate, about what we are going to do in health care. We have good \nhealth care. We have 43.6 million Americans who do not have it. This \nbill purports to put 3.3 million of them on SCHIP. The only problem \nwith that is 1.1 million of them have insurance now, so there is a \ndouble cost. So we got back to the $3,900, which is what the American \ntaxpayer, one way or the other, is going to pay for $1,532 worth of \ncare. How does that make sense? It makes sense only if you are moving \nin a direction to have the Government run it all.\n  So if you want the personal freedom to be able to choose what your \nhealth care should be and you want the Government to equalize the tax \nbasis under which we all receive care so that everybody gets the same \nbenefit--not the wealthy, one, and the poor, a different one; the \ndifference is $2,700 if you are well off and $102 if you are not--that \nis how the Tax Code discriminates against you now. What we do and what \nwe suggest is everybody gets the same treatment. And what happens is, \nunder this bill, CBO scores that it will add maybe 3.3 million kids. \nUnder the Burr-Corker, we add 24 million people in coverage over the \nfirst 10 years of that program, according to JCT.\n  So if this is about covering all of the children and about covering \nthose who do not have health care, we ought to be addressing it in a \ntotally different way. We ought to be saying we want a universal flat \ntax credit that is refundable to everyone in this country so they can \nall have access.\n\n[[Page S10388]]\n\n  Senator Wyden has proposed that on the other side with some minor \ndifferences in what we are suggesting through the Burr-Corker bill. But \nthe fact is, you cannot have it both ways. Which way is better? Do you \nwant the freedom to choose or do you want an organization that right \nnow has proven to be terribly incompetent?\n  Some statistics about the incompetence: the doctor shortage in this \ncountry 15 years from now is going to be 200,000 doctors. Why is that? \nWhy are the best and brightest not going into medicine today?\n  Why is that? It is the same reason that you see all the European \nsingle-payer systems moving toward what we have, as we try to move \ntoward them. We are going in exactly the opposite direction. The reason \nis, by the time you finish 12 years of college and graduate and \npostgraduate and post-postgraduate education, you can't earn enough \nunder Medicare or Medicaid to even repay your loans. So what is \nhappening is, our best and brightest, instead of going into medicine, \nare going into other areas where they can be remunerated for their \ninvestment in education. This drives us further that away.\n  What is the statistic behind it? Fifty percent of the doctors don't \nsee Medicare or Medicaid patients now. If you move to a new city and \nyou are on Medicare, good luck on finding a new Medicare doctor. Why? \nBecause the reimbursement is about 50 percent of what they can earn \nseeing somebody who is not on Medicare. So we will have a shrinking \nnumber of doctors, a government-run program that is going to control \ncost by saying, as the Senator from North Dakota said: Here is the \namount of money. Guess what. We are not paying for it. It is going to \nget rationed. That is exactly what is going to happen to us. \nConsequently, we are going to take the best health care system in the \nworld, with all its defects, and we are going to turn it on its ear. We \nare going to take the system that develops 80 percent of all new \ninnovations in health care and run it away.\n  Example: M.D. Anderson Clinic spends more on research in health care \nthan all of Canada. Think about that. One private outfit in this \ncountry spends more than the whole nation of Canada on health research. \nWhy? Because we have a system that rewards innovation. We are going to \nkill that system. We are going to destroy it. The question is not \nwhether children ought to be covered. Sure, they should. But so should \ntheir parents and everybody else but not in a way that destroys the \nsystem. The system will work if we create access for everyone. The \nsystem will work without raising a tax dollar to anybody. We will give \neveryone free choice to have what is best for them.\n  The numbers don't lie. If you doubt what I am saying about this being \na step toward national health care, here is what they say. Question: Is \nthis the first step toward a government-run, bureaucratic-controlled \nsingle-payer health care system? Senate Finance Committee: Absolutely \nnot.\n  Now let's hear what the chairman said:\n\n       We're the only country in the industrialized world that \n     does not have universal coverage. I think the Children's \n     Health Insurance Program is another step to move toward \n     universal coverage.\n\n  AKA government-run health care in this country. So the system that \ngives us great innovation, that creates 80 percent of the new drugs, \nnew techniques, new technologies, we are going to poke our finger in \nits eye because of what it has done.\n  We heard the Senator from Illinois say all the big businesses want to \nsolve this. They have made commitments to health care. They now want to \ndump on the American public rather than on their shareholders. General \nMotors, Ford, Chrysler, they want us to pay for it. They had an \nobligation for it. They took plenty of bonuses when the profits were \ngood. Now they want you as taxpayers to pay for it. That is why all the \nGovernors want the SCHIP program, because it is going to expand their \nability to solve their other budget problems. But what we are charged \nwith is doing what is best for the country in the long run. I will \npromise you, a government-run, bureaucratic-controlled health care \nsystem is not the best thing for this country. And that is what we will \nget. What we to have do is go back and use a little common sense and \nlook at what is happening.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, we have 117,000 kids on SCHIP. Oklahoma \nchose to make it a Medicaid expansion. The problem is, Medicaid doesn't \npay enough so kids can't get access in Oklahoma under the rates which \nthey pay. So have we given children access? We have a SCHIP program. \nCan they get care on a timely basis, can they get the same thing \nsomebody through a private insurance firm can get? No. Is that the kind \nof care we want? I want everybody to have the same access. I don't want \na Medicaid stamp on anybody's forehead. I want them to be treated \nequally under the Tax Code so they have exactly the same opportunity \nfor access to care that the richest or the best union member or the \nbest business offers. We can do that, but we can't do it by going in \nthis direction.\n  We heard from the majority whip that we don't like kids. I don't care \nhow much tobacco is taxed. The problem is their numbers are foolish, \nbecause we know as we raise the tax, the amount of volume goes down or \nit goes to the black market or it goes through Indian tribes who don't \npay the Federal excise tax even though they owe it.\n  So what we know is the way we are going to fund this isn't going to \nwork, but we are going to be on the hook anyhow. Except it is not us on \nthe hook. It is your kids. The very kids we are going to insure, we are \ngoing to come back and say: By the way, you have to pay for your \ninsurance through increased tax rates.\n  We should be very careful about what we are doing. I care dearly \nabout children. I have four grandchildren, 10 and under. I look at \nthem, and I see all the kids I have delivered through the last 20-some \nyears. I see all the kids I have cared for, diagnosed major diseases \non, treated broken bones, taken their appendix out. I look at all \nthose, and not once were they ever turned down. The vast majority of \nphysicians don't turn somebody down in need, but we are coming to a \nscreeching halt. No longer can we continue to cut the incentive to have \npeople going into the medical field. Take 200,000 doctors and see what \nwould happen if, in fact, we had them there in the future.\n\n  The biggest problem facing hospitals today, they can't find a nurse. \nWhy? Because the reimbursement rates are so low we can't incentivize \nenough people to go into nursing because they can't pay the costs to do \nit and the hours are terrible. You work four 12-hour shifts. You are \noff for 3 days, and you come back and work four 12-hour shifts. It is \nnot a great life. So the people in medicine today, the vast majority, \ncare deeply about kids, but they also care deeply about having some \nrest, having access to a normal life outside of that. My nurse added it \nup. During my 20 years, my average time in practicing medicine was over \n80 hours a week. That is not uncommon in this country. It is not \nuncommon for doctors to spend 80 hours a week taking care of folks. But \nwe are going to be short 200,000 because we are going to see less \ndedication because there is not the financial reward for people to \ninvest that much time and their assets to get the education they need.\n  Let's talk about who is going to get on the system and who is not. \nUnder the old system with this expansion, we are going to add 4.1 \nmillion kids. But we are going to take 2.1 million off private \ninsurance. So in Oklahoma, I don't know what the exact numbers will be, \nbut we are going to take kids off private insurance and then put them \non a Medicaid system they can't get access to. We will feel good. We \ngave them insurance. We give them coverage, but they don't have access. \nUnless you are getting seen, it is not access.\n  Also under the new system, the newly eligible, they will add 600,000 \nkids, but there is a 1-for-1 trade. We will take 600,000 off private \ninsurance. So tell me what we are doing? We are shrinking the pie so \nthat the cost for everybody in private insurance is going to go up. \nThat is what is going to happen. We are going to move it over to a \ngovernment-run system that doesn't reimburse at a rate to give you \naccess. Why would we do that? Why would we pay 2.5 times what it costs \nto get it in the private sector?\n  There are a lot of changes that need to happen in health care. We \nneed to complete transparency as far as price\n\n[[Page S10389]]\n\nand quality so you as a consumer can make a decision. I am for that. We \nneed true insurance market reform so that instead of big health \ninsurance companies taking 40 percent of the premium dollars you pay \nand keeping it through administration of profits, we actually put it \ninto health care.\n  We need a change in the insurance industry, where a bureaucrat \nsitting at a computer, either at Medicaid, Medicare or an insurance \nfirm, isn't denying your care because they have never put their hands \non you to say you need this or not.\n  What we are talking about is giving individuals the freedom to handle \ntheir own health care, the freedom to choose, the security to know that \nthrough this tax credit, everyone will have access in this country, no \nmatter who you are, no matter what you make. You are equal footing with \neverybody else.\n  When the majority whip comes out and says that is what he wants, my \nchallenge to him is, sign on to the Burr-Corker bill. That is exactly \nwhat it does. It gives equal access to everyone. Instead of an \nadditional 130,000 kids in Illinois, he will have all the kids covered. \nInstead of the adults who are not covered in Illinois, he will have \nthem all covered. He would not raise taxes on a soul. Will it shift \nsome? Sure.\n  The question is, are our kids worth it? That is the question that has \nbeen raised by the Finance Committee and Senator Durbin and those who \nhave spoken. I say they are. But if you go back to the numbers, which \nis $3,950, and you apply that and you take the 4.2 million children, we \ncould cover all of the uninsured children if we did it at the cost of \nthe private sector right now. If we said we will take the same amount \nof money we are going to spend under the SCHIP program and we will buy \nthem all a private policy, we can cover every kid who is not covered \ntoday because we spend 2.5 times more doing a government program than \nthe same thing you can do on your own in the private sector. Why \nwouldn't we do that?\n  We wouldn't do that because this is the first step in moving toward \nuniversal, government-run, bureaucratic-controlled health care.\n  One other point I wish to make. We have a Medicaid program today. We \nhave a SCHIP program today. There are 680,000 kids right now who are \nnot covered who are eligible for those programs. Tell me how effective \nwe are at covering those 680,000 kids. They are eligible, but we don't \nhave them? That is because of the failure of the Government bureaucracy \nto fully get a benefit out to those who are deserving of the benefit. \nSo what do we do? We are going to go in the opposite direction.\n  The other important point is, what SCHIP does is separate you from \nyour family. If you make $60,900 in this country--that is higher than \nthe average family income in 21 of our States--your child is going to \nbe eligible for SCHIP. So your child is going to go on SCHIP. They will \nhave a different insurance plan than you. They will have different \ndoctors. There is not going to be a family doctor who cares for the \nwhole family. The child will have one, and the parents will have a \ndifferent one. We will separate them and divide them. We are going to \ntotally separate them. Then guess what is going to happen. Parents are \nsaying: I could put my kid on SCHIP, and I will get a decline in my \npremium. But it would not decline because we would not have done any \ninsurance market reform. We will not have created a competitive market \nwhere they have to bid for your care. We will not have done what we \nneed to do to fix health care.\n\n  So I welcome this debate. This is a debate we ought to have in this \ncountry. Health care is important, and it is one of the things that is \nlimiting our competition. But the reason it is limiting competition is \nbecause we aren't investing in prevention and nearly $1 out of every $3 \nspent in health care does not go toward helping anybody get well. The \nreason it is that way is because we have the Government in the middle \nof the market. We are about to make that worse.\n  What we do know in this country is markets work. Individuals in this \ncountry figure out how to buy a car that is good for them. They figure \nout how to buy auto insurance. They figure out how to buy homeowners \ninsurance. But we assume if we give everybody a level playing field, \nthey are not capable. How arrogant of us. Markets work.\n  What we will see is this $250 billion--this quarter of a trillion \ndollars in transfer payments, cost shifting--go completely out. The \n$250 billion will drop everybody's insurance cost in this country by \n$1,000 per person. So not only will we insure everybody who is not \ninsured, we will lower their cost of insurance by $1,000, by \neliminating the cost shifting, and we are paying for that already. So \nwe will have great benefits if, in fact, we move to a true competitive \nmarket.\n  The last thing I will say is, if we do a tax credit--a flat tax \ncredit, a refundable tax credit--it keeps families together. It keeps \nmama and papa and brothers and sisters going to the same clinic, with \nthe same doctors, with constancy of care, knowledge of their history, \nknowledge that is important in terms of giving great care.\n  I look forward to this debate. I plan on being on the floor. I plan \non asking questions. The fact is, this is the issue this country is \ndealing with both in terms of how hard it is to get health care in this \ncountry and how expensive it is. There are two ways of solving it. One \nsays the Government is going to run it and the bureaucrats are going to \ncontrol it and we are going to control the costs by rationing the care. \nThe other way says we are going to let vibrant markets create \ntransparent information and competition that lowers the cost and \nincreases the quality for everybody. On the way, we are not going to be \ninefficient in the way we spend money, spending $3,950 for $1,500 worth \nof product. That is what we typically do up here. There is no reason we \nshould do that again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10389-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10389-S10401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        LEGISLATIVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2590 to amendment No. 2589.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment strike 3 and insert 1.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ncontinue consideration of H.R. 976.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the majority leader asked unanimous \nconsent to bring the ethics bill to the floor. He filled the tree, \nlimiting amendments. I wish to spend a minute talking about that.\n  I honestly believe we are never going to have the problems fixed in \nWashington until we have absolute and complete transparency on \nearmarks. Senator DeMint and I have both, numerous times, asked for \nunanimous consent that what we voted on 96 to 0 in the Senate be the \norder of the day when it comes to transparency on earmarks. That was \nrejected. We had a Democratic conference, and what we actually did--and \nI am not saying this partisanly at all; this is not a partisan issue--\nbut what we did is gutted the transparency portion of the earmark \nreform. If you think the problems are going to stop with the ethics \nbill that is going to be coming up, we have another thought coming.\n  What the leadership has done, the majority leader along with those in \nthe other body, they have cleaned the outside of the cup to what looks \nlike is a good deal for the American public, but when you look over the \nedge of the cup, what you see is filth, what you see is a lack of \nintegrity, what you see is a planned method to skirt transparency. The \nonly thing Americans should believe is the only way they are going to \nknow everything is on the up and up in this body is with 100 percent \ntransparency. Anything less than that will not get you the \naccountability, will not solve the ethical problems that are out there. \nWe need to be about that.\n  I am going to work hard to talk about that more. I think it is \nuncompromising what we are seeing done at this time to pull the wool \nover the eyes of the American people when it comes to earmarks. That is \nnot a partisan issue. I am against earmarks, especially if they are not \n100 percent transparent. But if you look at every ethical lapse that \nhas happened in this body, it always goes back to earmarks. When they \nare transparent, and fully transparent to where the American people can \nsee it, you are going to start getting good Government again. Until \nthen, you are not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am here today to talk about the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. I, first, do wish to say I am very pleased we are advancing an \nethics bill in the Senate. I am very pleased with the work the majority \nleader has done on this bill. As a freshman class, we came in with some \nenergy, and we came in with a commitment that we cannot do business as \nusual in Washington.\n  This ethics bill, as many outside groups have stated, is the most \nsweeping ethics reform we have seen since Watergate. It is about \nbanning gifts and free meals. It is about not allowing people to take \nadvantage of corporate jets. It is about bringing transparency to the \nearmark process.\n  I am very glad this advanced. I did not agree with a few of our \nMembers who tried to block this from going to conference committee. I \nam glad we found a way procedurally to bring this legislation to the \nSenate. I am very hopeful it will pass the Senate, as it passed the \nHouse today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10401-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10401-S10408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SMALL BUSINESS TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007--Continued\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about health \ncare. Today, 45 million Americans are living without access to \naffordable health care. In a nation of such tremendous wealth and \nopportunity, with such a strong belief in science and research and \nmedical advancement--we certainly have that in our State, the State of \nMinnesota--one wonders how so many of our fellow citizens can be \nburdened with the daily worry of what to do should a health disaster \nstrike themselves or a loved one.\n  Health insurance premiums have skyrocketed into orbits unreachable by \nan increasing number of middle-class families. We have seen this in our \nState, where we actually have a fairly high level of people covered. \nBut health care premiums for the middle class are so many times out of \nreach. We have seen nearly a 100-percent increase in the last few years \nin our State.\n  The foundations of employer-based health insurance are buckling under \nenormous cost pressures. The result is that ever more Americans are \nsqueezed by health care costs and face awful decisions about delaying \nor forgoing needed medical treatment and care.\n  I, in fact, woke up this morning trying to decide when my daughter \nwould get her braces because of the health insurance policy we got that \nmakes you wait 2 years to get that kind of care. Well, we are lucky to \nbe able to even have that insurance because so many kids in this \ncountry do not have it.\n  In fact, nearly 9 million of the uninsured in America are children. \nKids without access to health care are at an enormous disadvantage as \nthey grow up and start to make their life in this world. Children \nwithout health coverage are less likely to get basic preventive care, \nless likely to see a doctor regularly, and less likely to perform well \nin school. Children without health coverage are also more likely to \nshow up at the hospital sicker and more likely to develop costly \nchronic diseases.\n  Currently covering 6 million children, the Children's Health \nInsurance Program succeeded in improving their lives by giving them \naccess to the health care services they need. It is a successful \nprogram that deserves to reach even more children. This is important \nbecause, first of all, it is the decent thing to do for America's \nchildren who, through no fault of their own, are growing up in families \nthat cannot otherwise get affordable health insurance. But this is also \nimportant because it is something that is good for all of us.\n\n  That is because insuring our children is a smart investment. It is a \nsmart investment to make sure America's children get preventive medical \ncare. It is a smart investment to help America's children grow up as \nhealthy as they can be. It is a smart investment to have America's \nchildren in school focused on learning rather than distracted by a \nsickness or an injury that has gone untreated. It is a smart investment \nto have America's children get medical care through a sensible system \nof health insurance rather than having them end up in a hospital \nemergency room as their health care provider of last resort, increasing \nthe bill for the rest of us.\n  I have seen the direct impact at the local level. For 8 years, I was \nthe county attorney. As county attorney, my office represented the \nlargest safety net hospital in Minnesota. That is the Hennepin County \nMedical Center in Minneapolis. It is one of the Nation's premier public \nteaching and research hospitals. It has a nationally recognized level 1 \ntrauma center with the largest emergency room in our State.\n  The hospital serves patients regardless of their ability to pay. As a \nresult, in 2006, the Hennepin County Medical Center's level of \nuncompensated care added up to $38 million--almost double what it was \nin the year 2000. That is because the emergency room was these people's \ndoctor. People say: Well, they do not have insurance. They cannot get a \ndoctor. Well, they have a doctor. It is the emergency room. The \ntaxpayers are paying for it, and it is the most expensive place to get \nhealth care. It is the clinic of last resort for the uninsured, whether \nit is for minor illnesses or for more serious conditions that went \nuntreated or could have been prevented.\n  Both in the short run and over the long term, expanding health \ninsurance coverage offers a better deal for our Nation's health and for \nour continued prosperity. The people of my State\n\n[[Page S10402]]\n\nhave recognized this for a long time. Back in 1992, the leaders in my \nState voted to establish MinnesotaCare to provide children and their \nfamilies with a new opportunity to secure health coverage.\n  The initiative was created with bipartisan support in our State \nlegislature, and it was signed into law by Republican Governor Arne \nCarlson.\n  Within a decade--and thanks to the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram--MinnesotaCare had grown to cover more than 150,000 Minnesotans \nand helped to make my State No. 1 in the Nation for the percentage of \nresidents with health coverage.\n  But we are now losing the high ground we worked so hard to gain, as a \ngrowing number of Minnesotans, especially children, go without health \ncoverage. Uncompensated health care costs for Minnesota's urban and \nrural hospitals have jumped substantially in recent years. Much of this \nincrease in uncompensated care is due to a decline in health care \ncoverage in our State.\n  For example, between 2001 and 2004, the proportion of Minnesotans who \nhad health coverage through their employers declined from more than 68 \npercent to less than 63 percent. During the same period, the proportion \nof Minnesota children covered through their parents' employer also \ndeclined from roughly 77 percent to 69 percent.\n  Not surprisingly, the number of Minnesota children lacking health \ncoverage increased significantly. Today, an estimated 82,000 Minnesota \nchildren are without health coverage.\n  At the time when thousands of Minnesotans are losing coverage from \ntheir employers, or they are being priced out of the insurance market \nby ever-higher premiums, MinnesotaCare's funding has also been scaled \nback.\n  In Congress, we have the opportunity to do something about this--\nstarting with the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  Recently, the Senate Finance Committee approved bipartisan \nlegislation to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nAlthough I believe it could be even stronger, this compromise \nlegislation authorizes $35 billion over 5 years to expand the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program and extend quality health insurance \nto an additional 3.2 million children who currently lack coverage.\n  This legislation provides much needed funding for States to maintain \nand expand their programs and ensure that States that have suffered \nFederal funding shortfalls, including Minnesota, will now experience a \nstable level of Federal dollars.\n  As a State-Federal partnership, Children's Health Insurance Program \nhas granted States the ability to tailor their programs to meet the \nneeds of their residents. Some States increased eligibility levels for \nchildren. Other States allowed pregnant women to be covered under the \nprogram.\n  With MinnesotaCare, my State was an early leader in covering children \nfrom working families who had incomes above the Federal poverty level \nbut still could not afford health insurance. In 2001, Minnesota was \ngranted a waiver to extend the coverage to parents with incomes up to \ntwice the Federal poverty line.\n  I would like to make one point clear. In no way is Minnesota covering \nparents at the expense of children. When the Children's Health \nInsurance Program was established in 1997, Minnesota already had one of \nthe highest levels of covering children. So why did Minnesota include \nlow-income working parents? The reason is simple. Ample research shows \nthat when parents have coverage, children also get coverage, and they \nare more likely to actually receive medical care.\n  I have to point out the Bush administration agrees--or at least at \none time it did. Here is a quote from Health and Human Services \nSecretary Tommy Thompson in June of 2001, when his Department approved \nMinnesota's waiver. He said:\n\n       I am thrilled today to extend the promise of health care \n     insurance to parents. We know there is a greater likelihood \n     that kids will stay insured if their parents also have \n     coverage.\n\n  Agreeing with Secretary Thompson was Mark McClellan, the \nAdministrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \nTestifying in 2006 before the Finance Committee about the virtues of \nparent coverage, he said:\n\n       Extending coverage to parents and caregivers may also \n     increase the likelihood that their children remain enrolled \n     in SCHIP.\n\n  So as recently as last year, top officials in the Bush administration \nwere on record affirming the strong evidence of the role of parental \ncoverage in the health care and well-being of children. Now the \nPresident and his allies have backtracked and would prefer to take \ncoverage away from American families, including 34,000 parents in \nMinnesota alone.\n  I will tell my colleagues what seems odd to me. Both the President \nand the Vice President were recently in hospitals, and they were \ncovered. That is good. But why would they want to deny millions of kids \nin this country the same right? Why would they want to deny 34,000 \nparents in Minnesota the same right?\n  As Congressional Budget Office Director Peter Orszag stated during a \nFinance Committee markup of this bill:\n\n       When you remove parents from health coverage, you end up \n     removing kids too.\n\n  It doesn't make sense. Our goal must be to secure health care access \nfor more--not fewer--Americans.\n  The White House is living in the past instead of looking to the \nfuture. Leaders at the State level, including many Republican \nGovernors, have already moved well beyond the President's constricted \nposition and are committed to trying to expand health coverage to their \nresidents.\n  Minnesota's Republican Governor, Gov. Tim Pawlenty, currently the \nchair of the National Governors Association, recently signed a letter \nto congressional leadership asking them to reauthorize the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. I have this letter in front of me and I wish \nto quote from it:\n\n       The Nation's governors call on Congress and the \n     administration to reauthorize the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program prior to September 30, 2007.\n\n  They talk about how the authorization is critical for the safety net.\n  Then they go on to say:\n\n       While we have not taken a position on the actual overall \n     funding amount or the sources of revenue used as offsets, we \n     are encouraged by the Senate Finance Committee's efforts to \n     move a bipartisan reauthorization bill that provides \n     increased funding and reflects the general philosophy that \n     State flexibility and options and incentives for States are \n     preferable to mandates.\n\n  Not only did Gov. Tim Pawlenty sign this, I know the Governor of the \nPresiding Officer's home State of Ohio signed it. I also see that \nGovernor Schwarzenegger of California signed this. There are dozens and \ndozens of signatures of the Nation's Governors.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter \nfrom the National Governors Association, Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Chair.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC\n       Dear Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, Speaker Pelosi and \n     Representative Boehner: The nation's governors call on \n     Congress and the Administration to reauthorize the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) prior to \n     September 30, 2007. The authorization for this critical \n     safety net program will soon expire and urgent action is \n     needed to ensure its continued success for the next five \n     years. For many reasons, defaulting to a series of temporary \n     extensions of the program would be untenable for states and \n     the millions of children who rely upon the program.\n       While we have not taken a position on the actual overall \n     funding amount or the sources of revenue used as offsets, we \n     are encouraged by the Senate Finance Committee's efforts to \n     move a bipartisan reauthorization bill that provides \n     increased funding and reflects the general philosophy that \n     state flexibility and options and incentives for states are \n     preferable to mandates. Our recently enacted policy on SCHIP \n     and a series of letters we have sent since February outline \n     our positions on these issues in more detail.\n       We look forward to working with all of you to ensure that a \n     sensible bipartisan SCHIP reauthorization can be signed into \n     law in a timely and certain manner.\n           Sincerely,\n         Governor Tim Pawlenty; Governor James H.

Mr. President, here is one more indicator of broad-\nbased support for this insurance. A few days ago, a group of law \nenforcement leaders in my State came together to express their support \nfor expanding the Children's Health Insurance Program. They included \nMinneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan, my former colleague Dakota County \nAttorney Jim Backstrom, and Hennepin County Sheriff Rich Stanek, who \nalso happens to be a former Republican State legislator. They believe \nthat investing in health insurance for kids and their families is one \nof the best things we can do to fight crime and ensure safe, prosperous \ncommunities.\n  The time to act is now. In a few months, the Children's Health \nInsurance Program will expire. If that happens, our children will \nsuffer. The President should reconsider his threat to veto. My Senate \ncolleagues who say they are against this bipartisan compromise \nlegislation should reconsider their opposition.\n  I thank the Finance Committee for its efforts to bring this bill to \nthe floor and to expand this important and successful initiative. It is \nnot only good for American kids, it is good for our families and for \nour local communities, and it is good for all of us, because it \nimproves our Nation's health and prosperity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise this evening at this late hour to \nagain talk about the SCHIP bill before us, but even talk a little \nfurther about health care for all Americans. I don't think there is \nanybody in this body who believes that at some point we are not going \nto extend children's health care coverage. I think everybody in this \nbody realizes what we are doing right now is talking about how, in \nfact, that is going to be done. Even if the President were to veto this \nbill, I think all of us realize that again, in some form or fashion, we \nare going to come back together and we are going to make sure the \nchildren of America benefit from the SCHIP program that has been in \nplace now since 1997. I think as we look at the issues we are dealing \nwith on this SCHIP bill, as we look at the many issues we are dealing \nwith involving Medicaid and Medicare, I know of no other moment for us \nto more fully be able to debate the future of health care in our \ncountry in general.\n  I think all of us know, as the Senator from Minnesota said and many \nSenators before her have said, there are 45 million Americans today who \nat some point in time during the year did not have health insurance. In \nmy own State of Tennessee, we have 800,000 people in the State who do \nnot have health insurance. The toll is enormous. I think all of us can \ntell a story about a friend or a neighbor or somebody we have seen in \nour cities as we go back into the States who does not have health care \ncoverage and the insecurities they feel. We are having one of the most \ndynamic growths in markets in U.S. history, and yet so many people in \nAmerica feel insecure. I am convinced one of the main reasons is \nbecause so many people feel insecure about their health care coverage.\n  I know that throughout the campaign, in the 95 counties of our State \nthat I visited, I met so many Tennesseans who were concerned about the \nfinancial health of their family because they did not have health \ninsurance, and about whether their husbands who might have had seizures \nwould be able to get the proper care they might need. So I believe it \nis a moral obligation for us here in the Senate and for those in the \nCongress to deal with this issue in a much broader way even than as we \nare talking about during this SCHIP debate. I also believe as this \nPresidential race unfolds, almost every Presidential candidate will \nhave to face Americans and talk about how they plan to deal with the \nfact that Americans today do not have the health insurance coverage \nthey need.\n  That is why today I rise to join the Senator from North Carolina, \nSenator Burr, with Senate bill 1886, which is the Every American \nInsured Health Act. Americans want to control their own destiny. They \ndon't like the fact that an employer might decide what kind of coverage \nthey have, or if they have coverage at all. They don't like the fact \nthat some bureaucrat in Washington may decide that they have coverage \nor not. Americans like to know they have their destiny in their own \nhands. There is something about American psyches that is grounded in \nthat particular issue.\n  So what we propose through the Every American Insured Health Act is \nthat every individual in America--every individual in America--who is \nnot now covered by some existing governmental program would receive a \n$2,160 tax credit, and every family would receive $5,400. This is very \ndifferent than many proposals in the past where we talked about a tax \ndeduction. One of the things I think we all know we can talk about \nwhich are niceties--things that are decent--are health savings \naccounts. We can talk about other things that sort of nibble at the \nedges, if you will, as they relate to health care, but the only thing \nthat allows people to own their own health insurance is the money to \npay for it. So we, through what is called a refundable tax credit in \nthis bill, caused that to be the case.\n\n  Unlike the other bills that are being discussed today, and unlike so \nmany other health care acts we discussed, this actually is revenue \nneutral. This is one of those things that allows every American to be \ncovered with health insurance, yet does not pile on a deficit, if you \nwill, for the children of our future to have to deal with. It is \nabsolutely revenue neutral.\n  Let me tell my colleagues how it works. A lot of people, such as we \nhere in the Senate, receive our health insurance through our employer--\nthe Federal Government. A lot of people receive health insurance \nthrough the employer they work for back in our home States. Let me give \na little example. For an individual in Tennessee who might make $40,000 \nand receive a $5,000 health benefit, whereas now that is not taxable, \nin the future, if this bill were to be enacted, they would have to \nactually pay tax on that and their tax bill would be about $1,250. \nUnder the provisions of this act, what we would propose is that every \nindividual would receive $2,160, so they could pay their tax bill, and \nthen have money left over to deal with whatever other health issues \nthey might have.\n  The most important aspect of this, though, is it means that so many \nAmericans today--Tennesseans, Ohioans, Minnesotans--who don't have \nhealth insurance, through this proposal would actually have the money, \nthe money timed in a fashion to actually allow them to purchase health \ninsurance. This would mean that virtually everybody in America, through \nthis plan, would have the opportunity to own their own health insurance \nplan and they themselves would decide who the carrier would be. This \nwould do something that was discussed by Dr. Coburn from Oklahoma. It \nwould do away with what we call cost shifting.\n  Obviously, the 45 million citizens, as the Senator from Minnesota \nmentioned, get health care; they just happen to get it at the emergency \nroom. Who pays for that? Well, all of those\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\npeople who go out and buy private health plans or employers who buy \nthose, actually pay for that, because all of those costs are shifted to \nthe other plans. What the Every American Insured Health Act would do is \ndo away totally with cost shifting, because everybody in America would \nown their own plan and those plans would be paying for their health \ncoverage.\n  This obviously includes a few other attributes. It includes reforms \nfor States so that States can set up pools, so that individuals today \nwho don't have access to other pools of insurance at lesser expensive \nrates, it allows the States to set up pools so that individuals can buy \ntheir insurance through those pools. It also incentivizes States to set \nup high-risk pools. There are obviously many people, by the grace of \nGod, by the genes they are created from, who have health issues that \nsome of us don't have to deal with, so their health care costs are \nhigher, if you will, than other Americans. This would provide \nincentives for States to set up high-risk pools so that those people \ncould benefit from the opportunity of being grouped with others.\n  One other attribute and incentive of this is it causes States to \nactually set up a plan--a plan in their State--that has of the cost 6 \npercent of the median income of the population of that State, so that \nyou create a basic plan that certainly almost everyone--everyone in \ntheir State certainly, by virtue of the plan we are laying out, would \nobviously be able to afford. This obviously, as I mentioned, would \nreduce the cost to people around our country who are trying to do the \nright thing by their employees. It obviously gives people the \nopportunity--every American--to determine their own destiny as it \nrelates to health care.\n  I know this bill is not perfect; no bill is. I want to say in closing \nthat the reason I have joined Senator Burr and others to offer this \nbill is I do believe this country continues and continues and continues \nto have a debate about the fringes, if you will. We talk about \nchildren. We talk about other populations. We offer in many ways what I \nthink is empty rhetoric around the issue of health care. This is a \nsolution. It may not be a perfect solution. But I ask my colleagues to \nplease join the debate about health care in a way that ensures that \nevery American has access to health care.\n  We are very fortunate in this body. We have health care. All of us \nknow of people who truly are concerned about the next day and the next \nday and the next day, about how they are going to survive because a \nloved one in their family has health care issues that are not covered. \nSo I ask my colleagues, please, don't turn away from this plan. Join \nthe debate and let's make sure that this body puts forth an act, a \nbill, a solution, if you will, to make sure that every American--every \nAmerican--has the same benefit we here in the Senate have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Children's Health Insurance Program is \na success story. It was created in 1996 during my second term in the \nHouse of Representatives under a Republican-controlled Congress and \nsigned into law by President Clinton. It was exactly what voters sent \npeople to Washington to do. It was bipartisan, with a Democratic \nPresident working with a Republican Congress, with wide support within \nCongress from large numbers of both Democrats and Republicans.\n  Since then, the program has reduced the number of uninsured children \nin working families by one-third; 6.6 million children are covered \nnationally. More than 218,000 children are covered in my State of Ohio, \nfrom Galion to Gallipolis, from Mansfield to Middletown, from Xenia to \nZanesville. These children now get care in their doctors' offices but \nnot, as the President suggests, in the emergency rooms. Their care is \ndelivered when it is needed, not when it is too late. They go to their \nfamily physician with an ear infection, and they get an antibiotic that \nmay cost $50 or $75 or $100. The child gets sent home with his or her \nmother or father, and the child is cured instead of the ear ache \ngetting so bad for a child whose parent has no insurance, and the \nparent waiting and hoping it gets better. The child goes to the \nemergency room at the cost of several hundred dollars, and the child \nmay have a permanent hearing loss as a result, with what that does to \nthe child's future in school and to the child's future later in getting \na job.\n  These children under the CHIP program have good, reliable health \ncoverage. The Children's Health Insurance Program, in short, works. It \nworks for our Ohio children, our Ohio parents, and for Ohio \ncommunities. But it does not work as well as it could.\n  Today we have the opportunity to make the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram what it should be. Sadly, we all know millions of American \nchildren--far too many children in Dayton and Columbus and Toledo and \nCleveland and Akron and Canton and Youngstown and Cincinnati--remain \nwithout health insurance, even though the law states they are eligible \nfor it.\n  Eleven years ago, in 1996, Congress made a promise to America's \nchildren. Right now, today, this week, in the Senate and in the House, \nwe have the opportunity to live up to that promise. We can pass this \nbill to provide health insurance to 3.2 million more children, children \nwho have missed out on our promise--not their fault, ours--so far.\n  This is a bipartisan effort and bill, just like the original was a \ndecade ago. That is because this legislation is about children, not \npolitics. This bill is about helping children.\n  Let me tell a story about how the Children's Health Insurance Program \nhas helped one family in Ohio. Seth Novak is a 3-year-old boy who lives \nin Lebanon, OH, in Warren County, outside Cincinnati, the southwestern \npart of the State. This is a picture of Seth. His dad is self-employed. \nHe helps churches with their construction projects.\n  The family buys private health insurance for $444 a month that covers \nthe parents and Seth's two older siblings. But Seth has Down Syndrome \nand other health problems. In addition, in an attempt to get health \ninsurance for her son, Seth's mom checked with six different insurance \ncompanies. She was quoted rates from $1,200 to $1,800 per month for \nprivate insurance--just for Seth, not for Mr. and Mrs. Novak or the two \nolder children.\n  The Novaks are a hard-working family, but they simply cannot afford \n$14,400 a year for a policy covering only one of their children, not to \nmention their own insurance, another $444. They cannot afford a policy \nof $14,000 a year for one of their children, which would cover only \npart of the cost, frankly, for only some of the care Seth needs.\n  Just this week, the Novak family learned that Seth's eligibility for \nMedicaid/SCHIP has been denied effective August 31. That is why we have \nwork to do. Where will Seth go for medical care? What if something \nhappens?\n  There is hope for Seth, though. In Ohio, Governor Strickland and \nlegislative leadership--again, in Ohio, it is a bipartisan effort--by \nincreasing eligibility for the Children's Health Insurance Program to \nchildren up to 300 percent of the Federal poverty level. As Assistant \nMajority Leader Durbin pointed out about an hour and a half ago, these \nare not people living in the lap of luxury when you say 300 percent of \nthe poverty level. These are middle-class families with significant \nhealth problems, who simply cannot afford, on their middle-class \nsalaries and wages, their health insurance.\n  In January, the legislature and the Governor, understanding the \nplight that families like Seth's find themselves in, when the new \neligibility for the program goes into effect, the Novaks of Lebanon, \nOH, will be able to restore his health insurance and still pay their \nbills and take care of their family.\n\n  Ohio's leaders have taken care of Seth and thousands like him. They \nneed Congress and the President this week to do the same.\n  I have a picture of another Ohio family--a success story--who can \nattest to how the Children's Health Insurance Program helped them. This \nis Latonya Shoulders of Kent, OH, and her son Phillip Grant, Jr.\n  In 1996, Latonya was a pregnant, full-time student at Kent State \nUniversity, my wife's alma mater. She didn't have health insurance or \nthe resources to afford medical care. She enrolled in Ohio's Medicaid \nProgram about halfway through her pregnancy. Her son had Medicaid/SCHIP \ncoverage until he\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nwas 5 years old. That is when she finished her bachelor's degree and \ngot a job as a nurse with insurance benefits.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program was there for Phillip in the \nfirst years of his life. The program provided for him in several \nmedical emergencies. At 2 years old, he was bitten by another child at \ndaycare and developed acute cellulitis. He spent 2 days in the \nhospital. When he was about 4, he cut his arm and had a recurrence of \ncellulitis. This required two surgeries, both inpatient and outpatient \ntreatment.\n  As any parent knows, raising children means all too many visits to \nthe hospital. These hospital stays could have devastated this family's \nfinances and so much that went with it, right when Latonya was working \nso hard to get her nursing degree and to get ahead. Latonya is proud \nthat she no longer needs Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program \ncoverage for her son.\n  As I said, she is now a nurse and has health insurance. The program \nhelped Latonya when she and Phillip needed it. Today she is a \nproductive taxpaying citizen, and he is a healthy boy. The goal now is \nto let other families experience the same benefit.\n  President Bush came to Cleveland recently--about 25, 20 miles from my \nhome--and told an audience of Ohioans:\n\n       People have access to health care in America. After all, \n     you just go to an emergency room.\n\n  The President doesn't seem to realize that is exactly the problem. We \nall know emergency care is much more expensive than a scheduled visit \nto a doctor or a clinic. When people go to emergency rooms and \nhospitals, they end up with large costs which insurance companies bear \nand then raise their premiums, or the hospital eats the cost. It is a \nhuge burden on hospitals, especially hospitals in places such as rural \nAppalachia, in southeast Ohio, and places such as Zanesville and Morgan \nCounty and Athens and Gallia County and Lawrence County. It is a burden \non hospitals such as Metro in Cleveland, which serves our community so \nwell, or Akron General or the Summa or Lorain's community health \ncenter. These hard-working families cannot afford health insurance for \nchildren, much less if the child has a serious health issue.\n  I want to make sure children like Seth Novak and Phillip Grant \nreceive the care they need. This is a picture of Seth playing on a \nslide. I want him to be strong and healthy so he can continue playing \nand getting his exercise and enjoying his childhood, with health \ninsurance; or this picture of Phillip with his mother at her \ngraduation. I want him to grow up healthy so he can pursue a bachelor's \ndegree just like his mom did. I want every child in Ohio to thrive and \ndevelop to his or her full potential.\n  Ohio families should be able to take care of their bills without \nworrying about whether they will get their most basic health care needs \nmet. Every eligible child should be able to benefit from the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program--every eligible child in this country. That \nrequires the additional $35 billion that this bill authorizes. That is \nabout how many weeks in Iraq? We spend $2.5 billion a week in Iraq, and \nhere we are asking for $35 billion over 5 years. That requires that \nadditional $35 billion.\n  I want our President to see past relying on emergency rooms, thinking \nthat is the best option to provide the basic medical care that our low-\nincome families need, and instead, to provide it through an insurance \nprogram so a mother can take her child to a family practitioner and get \nthe kind of preventive care that my friend from Oklahoma, Senator \nCoburn, talked about. Even though he doesn't agree with this \nlegislation, he talked about getting the care that these children need \nthat only health insurance--not emergency room treatment--will get \nthem.\n  This bill is about children, not about politics. It needs to pass.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. BROWN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. I want to first applaud the \nFinance Committee for its bipartisan 17-to-4 vote to approve this bill. \nI thank Senators Baucus, Rockefeller, Grassley, and Hatch, Majority \nLeader Reid, and also the staff of the Finance Committee for all their \nhard work through the very difficult negotiations that made it possible \nto bring this critical measure so strongly to the floor.\n  I also recognize Rhode Island's role in this piece of legislation, \ngoing all the way back to the distinguished Senator John Chafee, one of \nthe early bipartisan sponsors of the bill. Now on the floor today, my \nsenior Senator, Jack Reed, has been one of the most powerful and \noutstanding advocates for this program in this institution. I am proud \nto join him in supporting this bill and in this fight.\n  I am proud also to represent a State with one of the lowest rates of \nuninsured adults and children in the Nation. There is a reason. Rhode \nIsland has worked over the past 15 years to achieve this success, \nbeginning with the RIteCare program in 1993. In 2001, the creation of \nthis Children's Health Insurance Program allowed Rhode Island to \nfurther reduce the number of uninsured children in the State. I am \nproud to have been part of Gov. Bruce Sundlun's team when he started \nthe original RIteCare program in 1993.\n  As health care costs skyrocket, and the number of people in this \ncountry who lack health insurance approaches the staggering number of \n50 million, we in Congress have an obligation to strengthen initiatives \nlike RIteCare that make health care more accessible.\n  For years, the Children's Health Insurance Program has given millions \nof uninsured American families access to health care for their kids. \nAnd pretty much everyone has thought this was a good thing. But now, \nsetting aside reason, and driven by ideology, President Bush has \nthreatened to lift his veto pen for only the fourth time in his \nPresidency to take that security and peace of mind away from these \nchildren and from their worried moms and dads, from families similar to \nthe ones the Senator from Ohio highlighted in his eloquent remarks a \nmoment ago.\n  The President claims the $35 billion improvement over 5 years is too \nexpensive. The President would prefer only the $5 billion he included \nin his budget. But that funding level would result in 1 million \nAmerican children losing their health insurance. We certainly cannot \nlook to President Bush for leadership.\n  How ironic, after all we have heard from this administration praising \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program and even taking credit \nfor expanding coverage, for encouraging State flexibility, and for \nspurring innovation at the State level.\n  Listen to what they used to say. In the administration's plan \noutlining the President's second term, their fact sheet boasted:\n\n       The year before President Bush took office, some 3.3 \n     million low-income children were enrolled in SCHIP. By 2003, \n     that number had risen to 5.8 million, a 75 percent increase. \n     Over that same period, by working cooperatively with State \n     Governors, the Department of Health and Human Services \n     increased the number of low-income adults on Medicaid by 6.8 \n     million.\n\n  That was then, this is now.\n  After that, the administration went on to lament the fact that \n``millions of children who are eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid coverage \nare not yet enrolled. Billions in Federal dollars available to the \nStates to insure these children remain unspent because these children \nhaven't been signed up.''\n  Then, at the 2004 Republican National Convention, President Bush \npromised this:\n\n       In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll \n     millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up \n     for the Government's health insurance programs. We will not \n     allow a lack of attention or information to stand between \n     these children and the health care they need.\n\n  But now the same Bush administration, the same President, is \naggressively planning to deny health insurance to poor children. How \ndoes this make any sense?\n  The President's rationale for this new parsimony was revealed before \nan audience in Cleveland on July 10. Here is the President's approach \nto health\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\ninsurance for America. You just pointed this out, Mr. President:\n\n       I mean, people have access to health care in America; after \n     all, you just go to an emergency room.\n\n  Well, that is a thoughtful approach. Once again, we cannot look to \nour President for any leadership on this issue.\n  The administration has also expressed its opposition to the cigarette \ntax that will fund the increases in children's health insurance, \ncalling it--get this--among the most regressive revenue-raising \nmeasures one could propose. That is from a letter from Secretary \nLeavitt to Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley.\n  The irony department is open late in the Bush administration. In \nevaluating their crocodile tears about regressive tax measures, \nconsider that this Nation will spend $233 billion in 2008 on the Bush \ntax cuts, 30 percent of which will go to the top 1 percent of income \nearners. From 2008 through 2011, the period we are talking about for \nchildren's health care, those tax cuts will cost Americans, in lost \nrevenue and interest on the debt, nearly $1 trillion, 22 percent of \nwhich will go to people who earn more than $1 million a year.\n  This chart illustrates just how the cost of tax cuts for the top 1 \npercent of Americans compares to the cost of expanding health care for \nchildren in this country. We are spending vastly more each year on tax \ncuts for the Nation's highest income earners than we are fighting for \nin children's health care.\n  Here it is, $2.1 billion for children's health care in 2008, $70 \nbillion for the richest 1 percent; $5 billion in fiscal year 2009 for \nchildren's health care, $72 billion for the richest 1 percent; and in \n2010, gosh, we go all the way to $7.9 billion for children's health \ncare with only $82 billion for the richest 1 percent.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in just this year \nalone--just this year alone--we are paying an extra $46 billion in \ninterest, not paying back the debt, just in interest, on the Bush tax \ncuts--$46 billion just in 1 year. And the whole thing we are arguing \nabout here is $35 billion over 5 years for children's health care. It \nis truly mind-boggling.\n  But it doesn't end there. The President has also threatened to veto \nthe bill based on its coverage of adults. This is a policy that the \nadministration has previously, explicitly, repeatedly approved. This is \na sudden ideological U-turn of stunning and deeply hypocritical \nproportions.\n  As recently as last summer at a Finance Committee hearing on \nchildren's health insurance, then CMS Administrator Mark McClellan said \nthe following:\n\n       Extending coverage to parents and caretaker relatives not \n     only serves to cover additional insured individuals, but it \n     may also increase the likelihood that they will take the \n     steps necessary to enroll their children. Extending coverage \n     to parents and caretakers may also increase the likelihood \n     that their children remain enrolled in SCHIP.\n\n  That was then, this is now.\n  This administration has approved waivers to cover parents in New \nMexico, Illinois, Oregon, New Jersey, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Fewer \nthan 2 months ago, on May 30 of this year, Leslie Norwalk, who was then \nActing Administrator of CMS, was ``pleased to inform'' Wisconsin that \nits extension request for what they call BadgerCare--it is equivalent \nto RIteCare in Rhode Island--had been approved through March 31, 2010. \nBadgerCare covers roughly 67,000 parents. Again, this waiver was \napproved by the Bush administration 8 weeks ago, and now he is \nthreatening a veto for care that covers adults.\n  Here is a copy of the letter that CMS Administrator Mark McClellan \nsent to my home State of Rhode Island on January 13, 2006. It reads:\n\n       We are pleased to inform you that your amendment to the \n     RIteCare section 1115 demonstration, as modified by the \n     Special Terms and Conditions accompanying this award letter, \n     has been approved.\n\n  It also notes:\n\n       Rhode Island's request to renew title XXI, section 1115, \n     demonstration project, dated July 15, 2005, with additional \n     information . . . has also been approved.\n\n  Finally, it notes:\n\n       Individuals who, at the time of initial application, are \n     custodial parents or relative caretakers of children who are \n     eligible under the title XIX State plan or the title XXI \n     State plan . . .\n\n  Are in the demonstration population and, of course, ``we look forward \nto continuing to work with you and your staff.'' Signed Mark B. \nMcClellan, M.D., Ph.D., the Administrator of CMS. This was January of \n2006. This is the Bush administration. This is them signing off on \nadults, custodial parents, or relative caretakers of children being in \nthe plan.\n  Yet now the President is shocked--shocked--that this program may \ncover some adults. Who didn't send him the memo?\n  At the end of May, I spoke on the Senate floor about some of the \nmajor problems facing health care in this country. I talked about the \nlack of investment in quality improvements, the lack of a national \ninformation technology infrastructure, and a reimbursement system that \npays doctors to perform procedures rather than to help patients get \nwell. I took these issues to the Senate floor because the structure of \nour system is unsound, its underlying mechanism is broken, its signals \nare misaligned.\n  But there are a few shining lights in the American health care \nsystem, and the Children's Health Insurance Program is among the \nbrightest. This program respects State flexibility, it encourages \nresponsiveness to local needs, it fertilizes structural creativity in \nthe health care arena, it safeguards the vulnerable, it unites \nfamilies, and it invests in the future of our Nation.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program means that children are more \nlikely to receive medical care for common conditions such as asthma or \near infections. It means that children have higher school attendance \nrates. It means that children have higher academic achievement. It \nmeans that children have more contact with medical professionals and \nreceive more preventive care. It means that children stay out of \nexpensive urgent care settings, such as the emergency room.\n  We choose now in this bill and in this debate between providing our \nNation's children with health insurance and not providing our Nation's \nchildren with health insurance. It is as simple as that. We choose now \nwhether every individual in this Nation, regardless of age, gender, \nrace, income, or health status deserves the stability and the safety \nthat health insurance provides. We choose for millions of American \nfamilies how much they have to worry, how much moms and dads have to \nworry about the health care of their children.\n  It is my duty as a representative of the people of Rhode Island, and \nit is our collective duty as representatives of a great Nation to stick \nup for the most vulnerable members of our society and for programs that \nprotect those who cannot protect themselves. We must certainly not give \nup in the face of an administration that willingly violates its own \nprinciples in order to create an issue on which the President can \ndeliver a veto as a desperate political stunt in the last bleak \nchapters of his collapsed Presidency--not at the cost of health care \nfor children. That would be truly pathetic.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nreauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. The \nreauthorization of this highly successful 10-year-old program would \nprovide an additional $35 billion over the next 5 years to make sure \nthat more of America's neediest children have access to one of their \nmost basic needs--health care.\n  In fact, 6.6 million of our most vulnerable children--that is an \nincrease of 3.2 million children--will be covered by this bill. I \napplaud the efforts of my senior Senator, Max Baucus, for leading the \ncharge to cover more children.\n  Reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program is the right \nthing to do. Because of Max Baucus and the good work of the Finance \nCommittee, almost 12,000 more children in Montana will have coverage \nthis year. Montanans know just how well this program works. As \npresident of the Montana Senate, I worked to increase the number of \nchildren eligible for the Children's Health Insurance Program and \npushed through full State funding of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram for Montana's children, expanding the enrollment from 10,900 to \n13,900\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\nchildren annually. As of this July, Montana's Children's Health \nInsurance Program is providing insurance for 14,304 children per month \nin the State of Montana.\n\n  It just makes sense. Only children who do not have private insurance \nare eligible. I am going to repeat that because I have heard contrary \nstuff on the floor. Only children who do not have private insurance are \neligible for this program. No one is double-dipping, no one who has \ninsurance can receive this coverage.\n  With this reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nwe as a country are investing in our most valuable resource--our \nchildren. If children have regular checkups and receive the preventive \ncare they need, they are sick less and in school more, and they grow up \nto be healthy, productive members of our society with less problems in \nmiddle age and healthier in their elderly years.\n  Mr. President, it is tough out there. Millions of children lack \nhealth insurance despite their parents' hard work and efforts to keep \ntheir heads above water. Many families cannot afford health insurance \ndespite the fact that they have jobs. When it comes time for parents to \npay the bills, health insurance comes after rent, food, clothing, \nutility bills, and gas for their car. Health insurance shouldn't be \ntreated as a luxury, and access to health care shouldn't be a fantasy.\n  We must be focused on improving the overall quality of health care \nfor low-income children. We know there are more children eligible for \nbenefits than are currently enrolled. In order to find and provide \ncoverage for those children, States should be able to use the \ninformation from food stamp programs, free and reduced lunches, and \nother initiatives in place for low-income families. Up to now, these \nprograms could not share information, so those with the greatest need \nwould have to apply for each program separately.\n  This Children's Health Insurance Program before us increases funding \nand outreach and enrollment efforts to find these uninsured kids. This \nis especially critical in rural States--rural States such as Montana. \nRural children are more likely to be poor and less likely to have \naccess to employer-based health plans even though most of their parents \nare employed. Nearly one-third of the kids in rural America rely upon \nCHIP and Medicare. The need is clear: Without children's health \ninsurance, they would be uninsured.\n  There have been a lot of stories shared today on the floor. I want to \nshare another one, of a fellow Montanan. Duran ``Junior'' Caferro from \nHelena, MT, is a boxer and has been fighting for 10 years. He is ranked \nin the 125-pound weight class and will compete in the Olympic trials \nnext month in Houston, TX. Duran is also an enrolled member of the \nNorthern Cheyenne tribe. His father, who works with at-risk youth, does \nnot have health insurance and can't afford coverage for himself or his \nson. Helena has an urban Indian health clinic but not an Indian Health \nService hospital, so Duran doesn't have access to emergency and \nhospital services with his IHS health benefits.\n  CHIP has allowed him to have a choice in where he receives medical \ncare, and he recognizes the value of this coverage. When asked about \nCHIP, he said the following:\n\n       It is important that I have Children's Health Insurance \n     Program because I don't have to be afraid to push myself when \n     I'm training or fighting. It gives me one less thing to worry \n     about.\n\n  If Duran wins this tournament in Houston this summer, he will be a \nmember of the U.S. Olympic boxing team. He will turn 19 soon and will \nage-out of CHIP. He expects to become uninsured because he and his dad \nare still struggling and can't afford to buy private health insurance.\n  Some may doubt the cost-effectiveness of this program, but this bill \nnot only helps low-income children, it also helps middle America. Why \nis that the case? Because the coverage made available to low-income \nkids lowers the number of emergency room visits of uninsured children. \nEmergency room doctors no longer serve as primary care physicians for \nthe uninsured, and that lowers the cost of health care for the rest of \nAmerica--the middle class--who currently cover the cost of the \nuninsured emergency room visits.\n  We all know that the middle class is feeling the pinch too. If we can \nlower health costs for them and provide health care to more of our \nkids, it is a win-win.\n  The way to ensure the continued strength of our country for future \ngenerations is to improve the future of our most valuable asset--our \nyoung people--and this bill which reauthorizes the Children's Health \nInsurance Program does just that.\n  Once again, I thank the senior Senator from Montana, Max Baucus, and \nthe Finance Committee for championing this bill. They did some \noutstanding work. Hopefully, we will continue that work on the floor \nhere tomorrow. We must pass this bill, and I urge my colleagues and the \nPresident to support it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to support the \nreauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program--an \nessential effort to ensure the health of our Nation's children.\n  For the past 10 years, the Children's Health Insurance Program has \nhelped provide health care for millions of children from working \nfamilies that do not qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private \ninsurance. These are the children of working families whose companies \ndo not offer health insurance to their employees.\n  As the cost of health insurance rises and an increasing number of \nemployers are unable or unwilling to provide health insurance to their \nemployees and their families, the number of families who do not have \nhealth insurance has continued to rise.\n  While the number of the uninsured continues to rise, the percentage \nof low-income children without health insurance has dropped more than \none-third since the creation of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  Currently the Children's Health Insurance Program provides coverage \nfor 6.6 million children nationwide. This reauthorization would provide \nhealth care coverage for an additional 3.2 million children who are \nuninsured today. In California, an estimated 250,000 children will be \nadded.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program has always enjoyed the \nbipartisan support of our Congress, our Governors, and our President--\nwhich is why I am shocked by the inadequacy of this administration's \nplan to insure the children of our Nation's working families.\n  The President is spending $10 billion each month in Iraq but has \nthreatened to veto a bill that will provide 10 million children with \naccess to health care. Under the President's proposal, he is willing to \nfund the Children's Health Insurance Program with an increase of $1 \nbillion a year--the cost of 3 days in Iraq.\n  Under the administration's proposal, we end up counting how many \nchildren will lose health insurance instead of how many we can enroll. \nIn the first year, the President's plan would eliminate health care \ninsurance for 200,000 children in California alone--and the number of \nuninsured children would continue to climb.\n  This shortfall in funding would result in 800,000 children who are \ncurrently enrolled to lose their coverage. I ask the President, what \ndoes he propose these children do when they are sick?\n  If we fail to renew this program or if the President vetoes this bill \nas he has threatened to do, it is the children who will pay the price.\n  There is not a man or woman in this Chamber who wouldn't do \neverything within their power to ensure the health of their own \nchildren--we should do no less for the children of our Nation.\n  The Members of this Congress have overwhelmingly expressed a \ncommitment to children's health. Earlier this year, we passed a budget \nresolution which set aside $50 billion for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, reaffirming our commitment to the continued success \nof this program.\n  We can still do more and we will, but this bill is a step forward in \nthe right direction.\n  I would like to thank Senators Baucus and Rockefeller, Senators \nGrassley and Hatch and the members of the Finance Committee who worked \nso tirelessly to bring this legislation forward in a bipartisan way, \nand keep the focus of this bill where it should be--on the children.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JOHN A. STROSNIDER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of John \nA. Strosnider, D.O., a respected Kentuckian who passed away on July 1, \n2007, of cancer. Dr. Strosnider was the founding dean of the Pikeville \nCollege School of Osteopathic Medicine and also served as president of \nthe American Osteopathic Association, AOA.\n  Dr. Strosnider accepted the challenge to create the Pikeville College \nSchool of Osteopathic Medicine in 1996. The school, located in eastern \nKentucky, opened in 1997 with 60 students and has since produced more \nthan 400 physicians. In keeping with the school's mission, many of them \nhave stayed in the region to practice medicine. In fact, according to \nPikeville College officials, 55 of the new physicians have opened \noffices within a 2-hour drive of the city.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Strosnider was honored by several \norganizations for his dedication to the profession. At the time of his \ndeath, he was serving as president of the AOA, and, in 2005, he was \nnamed Kentucky Osteopathic Medical Association Physician of the Year.\n  After being named AOA president, Dr. Strosnider said, ``I hope to \nraise students' awareness and remind osteopathic physicians of the \nhistory and philosophy of osteopathic medicine. The osteopathic medical \nprofession was built on a primary care philosophy, and we need to get \nback to those basics so that our patients in these areas have access to \nthe distinctive health care promised by osteopathic medicine.''\n  When Dr. Strosnider was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer earlier this \nyear, he gathered his students and faculty together to inform them of \nhis illness. He told the assembly he wanted to be open with them and \nremain optimistic. Shortly after his passing, Pikeville College \nPresident Hal Smith wrote a letter to colleagues and friends. In it, he \nwrote, ``John's vision and work will continue to impact the lives of \nthousands of individuals he never knew.''\n  I got to know Dr. Strosnider several years ago. Every year, he would \nbring a group of his students to Washington, DC, and I had the \nprivilege of meeting with him and his students on several occasions. I \nwas always impressed with how Dr. Strosnider encouraged the future \ndoctors to remain close to home and provide critical health care to the \nunderserved people of eastern Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, I ask you to join me in remembering this outstanding \nKentuckian. He is survived by his wife Jo Ann and three children, John \nAdam, Alisha, and Paul. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10408-3", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10408-S10409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the ongoing \ngenocide in Darfur. As my colleagues know, the United Nations Security \nCouncil is currently hammering out the final text of a new resolution \nrelated to the expanded United Nations African Union hybrid force to \nprotect civilians who have been victims of genocide in Darfur. This \nresolution represents the best hope for the international community to \nfinally come together to put an end to the violence in that country.\n  This new U.N. resolution reportedly calls for a large increase in \nmilitary and police personnel to be deployed to Darfur. It calls on \nmember states to make commitments to contribute troops to the hybrid \nforce, and for this bolstered hybrid force UNAMID to take command of \nthe region by the end of the year. Importantly, it also calls on the \nSudanese Government and all rebel groups to enter into peace \nnegotiations to reach a political settlement which will ultimately end \nthe conflict in Darfur.\n  If these reports are accurate, then we may be one step closer to \nending the violence in Darfur. But in order to actually stop the \nviolence, we must ensure that the hybrid force is large enough to \neffectively carry out its mission, and deployed quickly to stop the \nviolence immediately. These increased forces are desperately needed to \nreplace the currently under-funded and under- equipped paltry AU force \nof 7,000 soldiers presently in Darfur.\n  We simply cannot wait any longer to protect the hundreds of thousands \nof innocent civilians whose villages have been burned, who have been \ndriven into refugee camps, and who have been raped and murdered.\n  I welcome the calls of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French \nPresident Nicholas Sarkozy for the United Nations to quickly adopt this \nnew draft resolution, and I appreciate the leadership they have \ndemonstrated in personally committing to ensure that the peace process \nmoves forward, once the U.N. resolution has passed. Prime Minister \nBrown recently declared that ``this is one of the great humanitarian \ndisasters of our generation. It is incumbent on the whole world to \nact.'' I wholeheartedly agree and I urge President Bush to join with \nPrime Minister Brown and President Sarkozy in personally committing to \nending the conflict in Darfur.\n  Recent reports have also indicated that the text of the resolution \nrelating to implementing multilateral sanctions has been softened due \nto the objections of some African member states, as well as China.\n  While I strongly believe that robust targeted sanctions should be \nimplemented against members of rebel groups and the Sudanese \nGovernment, that we should curb the Sudanese Government's access to oil \nrevenues, increase penalties on private companies operating in Sudan, \nand allow for the divestment of funds in Sudan, the sad truth is that \nwhat is most needed now from the international community is a \nlegitimate U.N. mandate for a strengthened hybrid peacekeeping force.\n  But there is no reason why the United States can't move forward to \nimplement unilateral sanctions against Sudan, even if the international \ncommunity and the Bush administration refuse to do so. As chairman of \nthe Banking Committee I have asked the majority leader to expedite \nSenate consideration and passage of S.831, The Sudan Divestment \nAuthorization Act of 2007. The majority leader was prepared to do so, \nbut the minority objected. I have also asked that the majority leader \nto hold H.R. 180, the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007, \nat the desk and attempt to pass this bill prior to the August recess. I \nam also planning to ask the majority leader to expedite consideration \nof S. 1563, the Sudan Disclosure and Enforcement Act of 2007. These \nthree bills represent a good step towards applying targeted economic \npressure against the Sudanese Government.\n  The implementation of robust and targeted sanctions is long overdue. \nIn fact, the time to implement the sanctions was 4 years ago, and it \nshould have been among the first components of the administration's \nPlan A, instead of the last resort of its Plan B--a plan which it has \nstill failed to implement, despite Special Envoy Andrew Natsios's \nassurances over 7 months ago, back in January of 2007, that action was \nimminent.\n  Sudan's U.N. ambassador recently asserted that the text of the new \nU.N. Security Council resolution is ``hostile'' and full of \n``insinuations.'' He further declared that the language is ``ugly'' and \n``awful.'' Ugly and awful? Ugly and awful is the murder of 450,000 \npeople in Darfur and the displacement of 2.5 million civilians. Ugly \nand awful is the Sudanese President, Omar al-Bashir, after his recent \nvisit to Darfur, declaring ``that most of Darfur is now secure and \nenjoying real peace. People are living normal lives,'' he said. Ugly \nand awful is the United States and the international community waiting \none day longer to protect these innocent civilians.\n  The time for action is now. We must not allow the Sudanese Government \nto\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\nengage in anymore prevarication regarding its acceptance of a hybrid \npeacekeeping force. And we must ensure that this new U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution marks the beginning of the end of genocide in \nDarfur, by mandating the immediate deployment of a robust multinational \npeacekeeping force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10409-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DOGFIGHTING\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on July 26, I introduced critical \nlegislation to stem the rising tide of dogfighting in our country. \nDogfighting is one of society's most barbaric and inhumane activities. \nThe dogs are mistreated, starved and conditioned for aggression, and \nthen allowed to literally destroy one another in the ring. As we have \nread in the recent indictment of Atlanta Falcon's quarterback Michael \nVick on dogfighting charges, poor-performing dogs are tortured, maimed, \nand killed. This illegal and despicable activity has no place in a \ncivilized society.\n  However, dogfighting has expanded its hold in recent years. The \nHumane Society of the United States estimates that 40,000 people in the \nUnited States are involved in professional dogfighting, and fight \npurses reach as high as $100,000. As many as 100,000 additional people \nare involved in ``streetfighting,'' informal dogfighting that often \ninvolves young people in gangs.\n  This legislation would place a Federal ban on all aspects of \ndogfighting activity from owning to transporting to training dogs for \nthe purpose of fighting, to participating as a spectator at dogfighting \nventures. I hope this legislation will end the practice of dogfighting \nin our country, once and for all.\n  This Congress's authority to make the lucrative commercial aspects of \ndogfighting a crime cannot be doubted. Just 2 years ago, the Supreme \nCourt made clear in Gonzales v. Raich that Congress's authority under \nthe commerce clause extends to local activities that are an integral \ncomponent of interstate criminal activities.\n  This bill is well within that standard. As demonstrated in the Vick \nindictment and by the many law enforcement records, animal welfare \nreports, and economic studies that will be entered into the Record on \nthis bill the--dogfighting industry has become nationwide in scope, and \nCongress is well within its authority to address both the nationwide \nframework and localized branches that are a critical part of that \nextensive criminal venture. We are dealing with a criminal industry has \ndeveloped into a multifaceted, national and international commercial \nmarket that depends heavily upon illegal trafficking between States. \nDogfighting is an inherently commercial and economic activity that has \na substantial effect upon interstate commerce.\n  Dogfighting is an interconnected, nationwide, lucrative commercial \nindustry. In addition to high-stakes gambling, dogfighters exchange \ntens if not hundreds of millions of dollars annually on the purchase \nand sale of fighting dogs. Dog fighters also make top dollar by \nbreeding or selling ``stud'' privileges for fighting dogs, and can make \ntop dollar by breeding dogs that have proven themselves in the ring by \nkilling multiple other dogs.\n  This extensive commercial venture also requires trafficking in the \nspecialized equipment necessary to train and house fighting dogs. There \nare even underground transport services to courier these dogs from one \nmatch to the next--assuming they survive. Dog fighters also make a \nliving handling and training fighting dogs for well-funded sponsors--as \nwe saw in the Vick indictment.\n  It could not be clearer that the overwhelming majority of dog \nfights--if not every single dog fight--are truly economic endeavors \nthat involve some element of interstate commerce, such as animals, \nequipment, breeders, or spectators having traveled across State lines. \nMany dog fights are conducted for the purposes of illegal gambling, and \nsome gambling on the sidelines is almost always present at these \nfights. Dogfighting also burdens interstate commerce by increasing the \nrisk of injury or disease to both animals and humans, including dog \nbites, rabies, and heartworms.\n  What's more, small, localized dogfighting ventures, when viewed in \nthe aggregate, have a substantial impact upon interstate commerce. As \nthe allegations I mentioned earlier against Michael Vick and his \ncodefendants demonstrate, large amounts of money are at stake in \ndogfighting matches, and winners often take home all or some portion of \nentry fees paid by other participants. The individual dogs used in \nfighting can have a commercial value of between hundreds of dollars and \ntens of thousands of dollars per animal. All of the activities \nassociated with dogfighting, including gambling and other illegal \nactivities, equipment outlays, breeding expenses, and promotion costs \nare not only inherently commercial in nature but transcend State \nboundaries.\n  By way of example, there are dozens of Federal criminal prohibitions \non the local creation, possession, and sale of narcotics and narcotic-\nmaking equipment. Congress recognized that the illicit drug industry \nhad become nationwide in scope, and chose to exercise its \nconstitutional power to address the localized branches of that \nextensive criminal venture. Likewise, this bill responds to the \nproliferation of dog fighting into a nationwide criminal network of \nlocal ventures, which Congress is similarly authorized to address. Just \nlook at the Endangered Species Act, which broadly restricts the \nkilling, taking, or breeding of certain wild animals, in order to \neffectuate Congress's goal of preventing the extinction of imperiled \nspecies. The ESA has been upheld as a valid exercise of Congress's \nauthority by every federal appeals court to address the issue, and the \nSupreme Court has repeatedly declined to upset those judgments.\n  The effects of dogfighting on interstate commerce are neither \nindirect, remote, nor attenuated. Regulation of dogfighting is \nnecessary to prevent and eliminate burdens upon interstate commerce. In \naddition, the regulation of dogfighting is an essential part of a \nlarger regulatory scheme, the Animal Welfare Act, which mandates the \nhumane treatment of animals in our society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10409-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10409-S10411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PRESTICIDE REGISTRATION IMPROVEMENT RENEWAL ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me \ntoday in honoring the 100th anniversary of a wonderful organization in \nmy home State of California, the Marin Humane Society.\n  The Marin County Humane Society was founded on December 14, 1907, by \nEthel H. Tompkins and a group of concerned citizens who wanted to find \na solution to the plight of lost and abused animals. From its first \nanimal shelter in the San Rafael stables in 1912, the organization has \nexpanded its facilities to a four-building complex on a 7-acre campus. \nToday, the Marin Humane Society, which shortened its name in 1980, \nserves the community with 95 staff members and 800 volunteers.\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\n  Through the dedicated work of the Marin Humane Society, 8,000 animals \neach year find refuge, rehabilitation, and loving homes. This has \nincluded efforts to rescue animals lost and injured in disasters, such \nas the Oakland firestorm of 1991.\n  It is particularly noteworthy that in 2005, the organization brought \nover 2,500 Hurricane Katrina animal victims to bay area shelters and \nout of harm's way through its rescue effort, ``Orphans of the Storm.'' \nIn partnership with commercial airlines, these pet airlifts were a \nfirst for the Nation and protected the lives of thousands of animals. \nFunded solely from private benefactors and coordinated by the Marin \nHumane Society, nine flights of lost animals arrived in the bay area in \nthe 2 months following the disaster. Additional flights carried animals \nto southern California, Oregon, and Washington, where other animal \nshelters and rescue groups agreed to offer refuge.\n  The Marin Humane Society's admirable milestones continued in 2006, \nwhen it adopted its 250,000th animal to a loving home.\n  When in 1997 the Marin Humane Society staff felt they had made \nsignificant progress on controlling the pet overpopulation problem in \nMarin County, they decided to expand their services to neighboring \ncounties through their Pet Partnership program. Volunteers brought \nthousands of dogs and cats from congested shelters in other communities \nto Marin to give them a second chance.\n  I am so pleased to acknowledge the Marin Humane Society's long and \ndistinguished record of community service. Over the past century, the \norganization has educated children and adults on the importance of \nhumane treatment of animals; provided comprehensive veterinary care and \nrehabilitation for neglected and abused animals; provided pet adoption \nservices and dog training programs; and advocated for animal welfare \npolicy on the local, State and Federal level.\n  I commend the Marin Humane Society staff and volunteers for their \ncompassion and commitment to protecting and caring for our society's \nlost, neglected, and abused animals. They do a tremendous service to \nthe greater community and are deserving of the highest recognition for \ntheir large hearts and generous ways. Please join me in celebrating the \n100th Anniversary of the Marin Humane Society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10412-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR.

Ron DeHaven, Administrator of the Department of \nAgriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, APHIS, and to \ncongratulate him on his retirement from public service. Dr. DeHaven has \nserved the agency for 28 years during which he has contributed greatly \nto the agency's mission of promoting and protecting U.S. agriculture.\n  Dr. DeHaven began his APHIS career working in a field office for the \nveterinary services program in 1979. He later joined the agency's \nanimal care program, rising to the top position in 1996. From 2001 to \n2002 he served as the APHIS acting associate administrator, and in \n2002, became head of the agency's veterinary services program.\n  As the Nation's chief veterinarian, he played a leading role as the \nagency faced the first U.S. detection of bovine spongiform \nencephalopathy, BSE, in 2003. His handling of this situation--as well \nas other animal health emergencies--showcased his trademark \nstraightforward leadership style and calm demeanor. These challenges \nprepared him well for the role of APHIS Administrator, which he assumed \nin 2004.\n  As Administrator, he has skillfully guided his agency and \ncommunicated with the public, Congress, and USDA's many stakeholders. \nHe worked conscientiously to position APHIS to prevent and respond to \nsuch threats as highly pathogenic avian influenza, exotic Newcastle \ndisease, sudden oak death, Asian longhorned beetle and citrus diseases.\n  Dr. DeHaven's dedication, work ethic, and personal commitment to \nexcellence have served U.S. agriculture well and ensured a healthy and \nabundant food supply for U.S consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10412-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL J.

I commend him \nfor his impressive service to the people of Worcester for the past 30 \nyears, and I know he will be deeply missed by all those he helped and \nsupported.\n  Mike's impressive career extends well beyond his time at Worcester \nRegional Retirement System. He served two terms on the Worcester City \nCouncil before being elected Worcester County treasurer in 1978, and \nhis outstanding experience and knowledge of the issues made him a \nvaluable member of many charitable organizations in our city.\n  Mike also has served on the board of directors of the Worcester \nRegional Chamber of Commerce and the Massachusetts Biomedical \nInitiatives, and he had an invaluable role over the years in \nestablishing Worcester as a center for medical research.\n  All of us in our State owe Mike our gratitude for his skillful \nefforts on behalf of the less fortunate.

Mr. President, today, on behalf of the Greek Cypriot \npopulation of Rhode Island and Greek Cypriots around the world, I \nrecognize the 33rd anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.\n  At 5:30 a.m. 33 years ago today, heavily armed Turkish troops landed \non a narrow northern beachhead in Cyprus 5 days after Greek Cypriot \nnationalists ousted then-President Archbishop Makarios. The invasion \nand subsequent occupation was described by Turkey as a ``peace \noperation'' to protect the minority Turkish population living in Cyprus \nfrom being victimized in the aftermath of the coup.\n  However, during the next 2 months, over 200,000 Greek Cypriots fled \nsouth or were expelled by Turkish forces. The Turkish Cypriots took \nover 37 percent of the island and then called a ceasefire, leaving the \nGreek Cypriots, 82 percent of the population, with under two-thirds of \nCyprus. In 1983, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared \nitself a country. Currently, Turkey is the only nation that recognizes \nthis self-declaration of statehood.\n  Despite international efforts over the last 30 years to reunify the \nisland, Cyprus has remained divided with more than 40,000 Turkish \ntroops occupying its northern third. The United Nations Security \nCouncil and General Assembly have worked to determine an equally \nagreeable solution, but talks between the Greek Cypriot south and the \nTurkish Cypriot north consistently end in a stalemate.\n  A survey completed in February 2007 by the United Nations \nPeacekeeping Force in Cyprus found that a majority of both Greek and \nTurkish Cypriot communities view the United Nations' presence on the \nisland as a positive. Both see any withdrawal scenario involving the \nU.N. departing before restoration of normal conditions and a settlement \nbeing reached as a negative. We must applaud the continued efforts of \nthe United Nations and the focus of Cypriot leaders to reunite a \ndivided Cyprus and remain, ourselves, committed to ushering the \nsettlement process forward. Cypriot, Mediterranean, and United States \ninterests will benefit from a settlement that addresses all legitimate \nconcerns of both sides and promotes the stability of a hostile region.\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\n  Sirens wailed across the southern half of Cyprus today, in memory of \nthe day known as ``black anniversary'' among the Greek Cypriots. \nCypriot leaders, on both sides of the divide, must take forward steps \nto wash away the darkness of this day and replace it with peace and \ntolerance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10413-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING GENERAL WAYNE A. DOWNING\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, with a heavy heart, I \nrecognize an American patriot and public servant who passed away on \nJuly 17, 2007: GEN Wayne A. Downing, U.S. Army, Retired.\n  Born on May 10, 1940, in Peoria, IL, General Downing graduated from \nthe Spalding Institute in 1958 and was then appointed to the U.S. \nMilitary Academy. Following his graduation from West Point in 1962, \nGeneral Downing served two combat tours in Vietnam as a junior infantry \nofficer.\n  General Downing served his country for 34 years in a variety of \ncommand assignments in infantry, armored, special operations, and joint \nunits, culminating in his appointment as the commander-in-chief of the \nU.S. Special Operations Command. As a general officer, he commanded the \nspecial operations of all services during the 1989 invasion of Panama \nand commanded a joint special operations task force operating deep \nbehind the Iraqi lines during Operation Desert Storm.\n  General Downing's reputation was that of a smart, decisive, forceful, \nand caring leader, known in particular for his unwavering determination \nto accomplish any mission assigned and provide his soldiers the best \npossible support. His personal courage and leadership by example \ninspired fierce loyalty from all the soldiers who worked for him.\n  Following his retirement from the U.S. Army in 1996, General Downing \nhad repeatedly answered the call of public service. After the terrorist \nattack on the U.S. base at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, he was \nappointed by President Clinton to assess the attack and to make \nrecommendations on how to protect Americans and U.S. facilities \nworldwide from future attacks.\n  From 1999-2000, General Downing was a member of the congressionally \nmandated National Commission on Terrorism charged with examining the \nterrorist threat to the U.S., evaluating America's laws, policies, and \npractices for preventing and punishing terrorism directed at U.S. \ncitizens, and recommending corrective actions.\n  In the wake of 9/11, General Downing served for almost a year in the \nWhite House as national director and deputy national security advisor \nfor combating terrorism. As the President's principal adviser on \nmatters related to combating terrorism, he was responsible for \ncoordinating the military, diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement, \ninformation, and financial operations of our war on terror, and for \ndeveloping and executing a strategy that integrated all elements of \nnational power.\n  Following his assignment at the White House, General Downing returned \nto the U.S. Military Academy at West Point when he assumed the position \nof ``Distinguished Chair'' of the Combating Terrorism Center, CTC. \nUnder his leadership, the center sought to better understand foreign \nand domestic terrorism threats, to educate future leaders, and to \nprovide political analysis and advice to counter future terrorist \nactivities.\n  In addition to his duties at the CTC, General Downing was a visiting \nfaculty member at the University of Michigan Business School conducting \nseminars on leadership and transformation management and was military \nand terrorism analyst for NBC News.\n  General Downing's career has epitomized the phrase ``lifetime of \nservice to the Nation'' and exemplified ideals inherent in duty, honor, \nand country. He was a true warrior who always spoke the truth, insisted \non complete honesty from all he worked with, and was the epitome of \nhonorable behavior. As a combat leader, educator, global strategist, \nand national security expert, General Downing's contributions to our \nnational defense and security are immeasurable.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Kathryn, his daughters \nLaura and Elizabeth, and the entire Downing family in this time of \nsorrow. He will be missed dearly by his many friends, colleagues, and \nan extremely grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10413-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JULIE SITTASON\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Julie \nSittason, who has dedicated over 20 years of her life to caring for \nothers. On August 16, 2007, when Julie steps down as the executive \ndirector of Hospice of West Alabama, she will leave behind a legacy of \nservice to others.\n  Julie and I have been friends for many years. She graduated from my \nalma mater, the University of Alabama, with an undergraduate degree in \nsociology and a master's degree in counseling and guidance from the \nUniversity of Alabama. Soon after, Julie decided to pursue a rewarding \ncareer of serving and caring for others.\n  For 7 years, Julie worked as a counselor at the Alabama State \nDepartment of Industrial Relations, providing guidance to the blind, \nthe hearing impaired and recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren. Later, Julie returned to the University of Alabama to work as \nthe program administrator for the West Alabama Comprehensive Services \nprogram.\n  In 1986, Julie was named executive director of Hospice of West \nAlabama. When she was hired, the Agency only employed three full-time \nstaffers, operating on an annual budget of $86,000. Today, the budget \nhas grown to $5 million a year and Hospice of West Alabama has 70 \nemployees, serving 600 patients a year in Tuscaloosa, Greene, Hale, \nBibb and Pickens Counties.\n  Over the past two decades, Julie has overseen many changes at Hospice \nof West Alabama. It was under her direction in 1997 when the Agency \nbecame the first community-based hospice in the State of Alabama to be \nofficially recognized by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of \nHealthcare Organizations. In 2004, it was Julie's vision that led to \nthe construction of the $5 million facility that includes the State's \nfirst community-based inpatient hospice facility.\n  While many people think that the service Julie contributes each day \nthrough her work at Hospice of West Alabama is enough, she thinks \notherwise. As an avid volunteer, Julie continues to serve with \norganizations such as the March of Dimes, the MS Walkathon and Soup \nBowl. She has served as an adviser for Alpha Omicron Pi Sorority, is on \nthe administrative board for First United Methodist Church, and the \nboard of directors for United Cerebral Palsy, Castle Hill Clinic and \nthe Maude Whatley Clinic. Julie has also held several leadership \npositions in the Alabama Hospice Organization.\n  Julie is married to Chuck Sittason. She has two daughters, Katherine \nCramer, who served with distinction as my first Senate page in 1995, \nand Meredith Cramer.\n  As Julie embarks on another phase in her life, she will remain an \ninspiration to many and will be remembered for her dedication and many \ncontributions to Hospice of West Alabama.

A resolution adopted by the City Council of the \n     City of Miami Gardens, Florida, urging Congress to \n     appropriate the funds necessary to bring the Herbert Hoover \n     Dike into compliance with current levee protection safety \n     standards; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n       POM-174. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to \n     take such actions as are necessary to create a federal \n     catastrophe fund; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, the hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005 were \n     startling reminders of both the human and economic \n     devastation that hurricanes, flooding, and other natural \n     disasters can cause; and\n       Whereas, creation of a federal catastrophe fund is a \n     comprehensive, integrated approach to help better prepare and \n     protect the Nation from natural catastrophes, such as \n     hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, snowstorms, and \n     earthquakes; and\n       Whereas, the current system of response to catastrophes \n     leaves many people and businesses at risk of being unable to \n     replace what they lost, wastes tax dollars, raises insurance \n     premiums, and leads to shortages of insurance needed to \n     sustain our economy; and\n       Whereas, creation of a federal catastrophe fund would help \n     stabilize insurance markets following a catastrophe and help \n     steady insurance costs for consumers while making it possible \n     for private insurers to offer more insurance in catastrophe-\n     prone areas; and\n       Whereas, a portion of the premiums collected by insurance \n     companies could be deposited into such a fund which could be \n     administered by the United States Treasury and grow tax free; \n     and\n       Whereas, a portion of the interest earnings of the fund \n     could be dedicated to emergency responder efforts and public \n     education and mitigation programs; and\n       Whereas, the federal catastrophe fund would operate as a \n     ``backstop'' and could only be accessed when private insurers \n     and state catastrophe funds have paid losses in excess of a \n     defined threshold; and\n       Whereas, utilizing the capacity of the Federal Government \n     would help smooth out fluctuations consumers currently \n     experience in insurance prices and availability because of \n     exposure to large catastrophic losses and would provide \n     better protection at a lower price; and\n       Whereas, when there is a gap between the insurance \n     protection consumers buy and the damage caused by a major \n     catastrophe, taxpayers across the country pay much of the \n     difference, as congressional appropriations of billions of \n     dollars for after-the-fact disaster relief in the aftermath \n     of Hurricane Katrina demonstrated; and\n       Whereas, there are a number of legislative instruments \n     pending in the current One Hundred Tenth Congress which \n     address the need for a federal catastrophe fund, including \n     the Homeowners Protection Act of 2007 (H.R. 91) and the \n     Commission on Catastrophic Disaster Risk an Insurance Act of \n     2007 (H.R. 537 and S. 292). Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to create a federal catastrophe fund.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to \n     take such actions as are necessary to either extend the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act to include insurance coverage \n     for natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes or, \n     alternatively, to establish a tax incentive program for \n     insurance companies that provide insurance coverage for such \n     disasters; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 50\n\n       Whereas, as a result of the devastation caused by Hurricane \n     Katrina and Hurricane Rita to personal residential property, \n     commercial residential property, and commercial property, \n     Louisiana insureds, especially those located in the greater \n     New Orleans area, are at risk with regard to the availability \n     and affordability of personal residential property, \n     commercial residential property, and commercial property \n     insurance; and\n       Whereas, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita have created \n     a real threat to the public health, safety, and welfare of \n     the citizens of Louisiana, as well as to the rebuilding \n     efforts of Louisiana citizens in the post-Katrina and Rita \n     era; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana, as a state located on the coast of the \n     Gulf of Mexico, will continue to be at risk from the threat \n     of hurricanes, further jeopardizing the availability and \n     affordability of personal residential property, commercial \n     residential property, and commercial property insurance. \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to either extend the Terrorism Risk \n     Insurance Act (TRIA) to include insurance coverage for \n     natural disasters such as\n\n[[Page S10417]]\n\n     earthquakes and hurricanes or, alternatively, to establish a \n     tax incentive program for insurance companies that provide \n     insurance coverage for natural disasters such as earthquakes \n     and hurricanes.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to \n     take such actions as are necessary to revise the National \n     Flood Insurance Program to extend coverage for other natural \n     disasters; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 212\n\n       Whereas, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 \n     established the National Flood Insurance Program as a means \n     of mitigating flood damages by making flood insurance \n     available in communities that adopt and enforce measures to \n     reduce flood losses; and\n       Whereas, the National Flood Insurance Program is a federal \n     program that allows property owners to purchase insurance \n     protection against losses due to flooding; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana as well as other states have significant \n     vulnerability to natural disasters, and when coupled with the \n     lack of appropriate insurance coverage, this may result in a \n     catastrophic impact on the economic, human, and physical \n     environment of the United States; and\n       Whereas, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused unprecedented \n     property damage, loss of life, and the upheaval of societal \n     norms in the state of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the availability and affordability of property \n     insurance has become an issue of paramount importance in a \n     post-Katrina environment that has seen a significant drop in \n     property coverages offered in the private market, \n     unprecedented rate increases, and total risk avoidance in \n     hurricane-prone areas; and\n       Whereas, revising the National Flood Insurance Program to \n     extend multi-peril insurance coverage for damage resulting \n     from earthquakes, volcanos, tsunamis, and hurricanes would \n     reduce the economic consequences of future natural disasters; \n     and\n       Whereas, the accessibility of multi-peril insurance \n     coverage through a federally offered program may increase \n     participation in the National Flood Insurance Program, \n     thereby reducing rates due to the aggregate risk pooling of \n     natural disasters; and\n       Whereas, this goal may be accomplished by generating \n     sufficient premium income to provide insurance protection \n     against disasters and to reduce the government's expenditures \n     for future disaster relief; and\n       Whereas, the incorporation of a multi-peril mitigation \n     program within the National Flood Insurance Program would \n     afford consumers the protection of a residential insurance \n     program with multi-peril protection. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to allow the National Flood Insurance \n     Program to extend coverage for other natural disasters. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-177. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to \n     take such actions as are necessary to ensure that all all-\n     terrain vehicles sold in the United States meet mechanical \n     equipment standards of the Consumer, Product Safety \n     Commission and that safety information and training are being \n     provided to all purchasers of all-terrain vehicles; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 274\n\n       Whereas, the United States Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission (CPSC) is charged with protecting the public from \n     unreasonable risks of serious injury or death from more than \n     fifteen thousand types of consumer products under the \n     agency's jurisdiction, and the commission is committed to \n     protecting consumers and families from products that pose a \n     fire, electrical, chemical, or mechanical hazard or can \n     injure children; and\n       Whereas, despite success in general, injuries and deaths \n     resulting from the use of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), \n     particularly involving children, are on the rise; and\n       Whereas, a CPSC staff report from 2005 includes the \n     following ATV-related injury and death data:\n       In 2003, there were an estimated seven hundred forty deaths \n     associated with ATVs.\n       In 2001, the most recent year for which death data \n     collection is complete, twenty-six percent of the reported \n     deaths were of children under sixteen years old.\n       The estimated risk of death was 1.1 deaths per ten thousand \n     four-wheeled ATVs in use in 2003.\n       The estimated number of A TV-related emergency-room-treated \n     injuries for all ages in 2004 was one hundred thirty-six \n     thousand one hundred, an increase of ten thousand six hundred \n     from 2003. This increase was statistically significant.\n       Children under sixteen years of age accounted for forty-\n     four thousand seven hundred, or thirty-three percent, of the \n     total estimated number of injuries in 2004.\n       There were about one hundred eighty-eight emergency-room-\n     treated injuries per ten thousand four-wheeled ATVs in use in \n     2004; and\n       Whereas, currently ATVs are subject only to voluntary \n     standards and Letters of Undertaking entered into by the CPSC \n     and the major manufacturers; and\n       Whereas, there are gaps in the current, voluntary system of \n     regulating the industry; primary among them is the fact that \n     the regulations do not apply to ``new entrants'', that is, \n     those manufacturers who have not agreed to participate in the \n     standards; and\n       Whereas, despite a recommendation from its own staff that \n     equipment standards and safety measures should be applied to \n     all manufacturers and distributors, the CPSC has failed to \n     adopt final mandatory regulations applicable to ATVs; and\n       Whereas, in the interest of saving lives and preventing \n     injury, it is appropriate that Congress get involved in this \n     issue: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to do all of the following:\n       (1) Require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \n     promulgate a consumer product safety standard for all-terrain \n     vehicles. The standard shall be the same as the American \n     National Standard for Four Wheel All-Terrain Vehicles-\n     Equipment, Configuration, and Performance Requirements ANSI/\n     SVIA-1-2001 or its successor standard.\n       (2) Require each manufacturer or importer of an all-terrain \n     vehicle to which the ATV standard applies to submit an action \n     plan to the commission for its approval.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey urging Congress to reinstate its \n     offshore water quality testing program along the New Jersey \n     coastline; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 270\n\n       Whereas, The United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     has conducted a seasonal offshore monitoring program by \n     helicopter for the last 30 years along the New Jersey \n     coastline that searched for and tested the presence of \n     dissolved oxygen and enterococci (i.e., fecal) bacteria in \n     ocean waters; and\n       Whereas, The existence of certain levels of dissolved \n     oxygen and enterococci bacteria are precursors or indicators \n     of potential fish kills and harmful algal blooms or ``brown \n     tide''; and\n       Whereas, The United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     has announced that it is terminating this offshore water \n     testing program in favor of alternative methods of testing \n     for these environmental indicators; and\n       Whereas, A massive algal bloom appeared in Raritan and \n     Sandy Hook Bays in late May 2007, turning coastal ocean \n     waters brown from Sandy Hook to Manasquan, thereby \n     reemphasizing the need for the continuation of the federal \n     ocean water testing program; and\n       Whereas, The State, counties and municipalities affected by \n     the termination of the federal ocean water testing program do \n     not have the logistical or financial capability to continue \n     or replace this program in time for the 2007 summer shore \n     season; and\n       Whereas, New Jersey has a coastline of beautiful beaches \n     which is not only one of the State's greatest natural \n     resources but also is vital to the State's economy through \n     the billions of dollars generated from shore-related tourism; \n     and\n       Whereas, The United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     is continuing the use of its coastal monitoring helicopter to \n     conduct surveillance of floatable objects in the ocean off \n     the coast of New Jersey and therefore could reinstate the \n     ocean water testing program in an expeditious manner without \n     undue financial or logistical hardships; Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       (1) This House opposes the decision by the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency to terminate the offshore \n     ocean\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\n     water quality testing program along the coast of New Jersey \n     and urges that it be reinstated immediately.\n       (2) Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the Assembly and attested by the Clerk \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to the President and Vice-\n     President of the United States, the Administrator of the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Region II \n     Administrator of that agency, the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the majority and minority \n     leaders of the United States Senate and the United States \n     House of Representatives, each member of the Congress of the \n     United States elected from this State, and the Commissioner \n     of the New Jersey Department of Environmental protection.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-179. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to vote in favor of \n     H.R. 1229, the Non-Market Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2007; \n     to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 115\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 1229, the ``Non-Market Economy Trade Remedy \n     Act of 2007,'' will ensure that the United States \n     countervailing duty law applies to imports from non-market \n     economies; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of the countervailing duty law is to \n     offset any unfair competitive advantage that foreign \n     manufacturers or exporters have as a result of subsidies; and\n       Whereas, manufacturing is a vital part of the American \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, each American manufacturing job results in the \n     creation of approximately four additional jobs; and\n       Whereas, since 1997, Louisiana has lost over thirty-nine \n     thousand manufacturing jobs due to unfair trade practices; \n     and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's coastal area is home to some of the \n     Nation's premiere commercial fisheries, accounting for 30 \n     percent of the commercial fisheries production of the lower \n     48 States; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana seafood industry provides an annual \n     economic impact of approximately two billion eight hundred \n     million dollars and over thirty-one thousand jobs; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana seafood industry has lost over \n     eleven thousand jobs and millions of dollars due to illegally \n     subsidized seafood imports and dumping from foreign nations; \n     and\n       Whereas, industries that once were the pride of their \n     communities and employed generations of the same family have \n     been shut down resulting from jobs being shifted to foreign \n     nations where labor is cheap and environmental standards are \n     not enforced; and\n       Whereas, billions of dollars in wages and millions of jobs \n     are expected to move from the United States to low-cost \n     nations by 2015; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 1229, the ``Non-Market Economy Trade Remedy \n     Act of 2007,'' is being considered in Congress to correct the \n     longstanding inequity of trade law, and requires the \n     Department of Commerce to take action in countervailing duty \n     cases in support of American businesses: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to vote in favor of H.R. \n     1229, the ``Non-Market Economy Trade Remedy Act of 2007''; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-180. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Wisconsin urging Congress to create a system that ensures \n     that trade agreements are developed and implemented using a \n     democratic, inclusive mechanism that enshrines the principles \n     of federalism and state sovereignty; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 8\n\n       Whereas, democratic, accountable governance in the States, \n     generally, and the authority granted by the Wisconsin \n     constitution to the legislative branch, specifically, are \n     being undermined by international commercial and trade rules \n     enforced by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and \n     established by the North American Free Trade Agreement \n     (NAFTA) and are further threatened by similar provisions in \n     an array of pending trade agreements; and\n       Whereas, today's ``trade'' agreements have impacts that \n     extend significantly beyond the bounds of traditional trade \n     matters, such as tariffs and quotas, and instead grant \n     foreign investors and service providers certain rights and \n     privileges regarding acquisition of land and facilities and \n     regarding operations within a State's territory, subject \n     State laws to challenge as ``nontariff barriers to trade'' in \n     the binding dispute resolution bodies that accompany the \n     pacts, and place limits on the future policy options of State \n     legislatures; and\n       Whereas, NAFTA and other U.S. free trade agreements grant \n     foreign firms new rights and privileges for operating within \n     a State that exceed those rights and privileges granted to \n     U.S. businesses under State and Federal law; and\n       Whereas, NAFTA already has generated ``regulatory takings'' \n     cases against State and local land-use decisions, State \n     environmental and public health policies, adverse State court \n     rulings, and State and local contracts that would not have \n     been possible in U.S. courts; and\n       Whereas, when States are bound to comply with government \n     procurement provisions contained in trade agreements, common \n     economic development and environmental policies, such as buy-\n     local laws, prevailing wage laws, and policies to prevent \n     offshoring of State jobs, as well as recycled content laws, \n     could be subject to challenge as violating the obligations in \n     the trade agreements; and\n       Whereas, recent trade agreements curtail State regulatory \n     authority by placing constraints on future policy options; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WTO general agreement on trade in services \n     (GATS) could undermine State efforts to expand health care \n     coverage and rein in health care costs and places constraints \n     on State and local land-use planning and gambling policy; and\n       Whereas, new GATS negotiations could impose additional \n     constraints on State regulation of energy, higher education, \n     professional licensing, and other areas; and\n       Whereas, despite the indisputable fact that international \n     trade agreements have a far-reaching impact on State and \n     local laws, Federal Government trade negotiators have failed \n     to respect States' rights to prior informed consent before \n     binding States to conform State law and authority to trade \n     agreement requirements and have refused even to inform State \n     legislatures of key correspondence; and\n       Whereas, the current encroachment on State regulatory \n     authority by international commercial and trade agreements \n     has occurred in no small part because U.S. trade policy is \n     being formulated and implemented under the Fast Track Trade \n     Authority procedure; and\n       Whereas, Fast Track eliminates vital checks and balances \n     established in the U.S. Constitution by broadly delegating to \n     the executive branch Congress's exclusive constitutional \n     authority to set the terms of trade, such that the executive \n     branch is empowered to negotiate broad-ranging trade \n     agreements and to sign them prior to Congress voting on the \n     agreements; and\n       Whereas, the ability of the executive branch to sign trade \n     agreements prior to Congress's vote of approval means that \n     executive branch negotiators can ignore congressional \n     negotiating objectives or States' demands, and neither \n     Congress nor the States have any means to enforce any \n     decision regarding what provisions must be contained in every \n     U.S. trade agreement or what provisions may not be included \n     in any U.S. trade agreement; and\n       Whereas, Federal trade negotiators have ignored and \n     disrespected States' demands regarding whether States agree \n     to be bound to certain nontariff trade agreement provisions; \n     and\n       Whereas, Fast Track also circumvents normal congressional \n     review and amendment committee procedures, limits debate to \n     20 hours, and forbids any floor amendments to the \n     implementing legislation that is presented to Congress to \n     conform hundreds of U.S. laws to trade agreement obligations \n     and to incorporate the actual trade agreement itself into \n     U.S. Federal law that preempts State law; and\n       Whereas, Fast Track is not necessary for negotiating trade \n     agreements as demonstrated by the existence of scores of \n     trade agreements, including major pacts, implemented in the \n     past 30 years without use of Fast Track; and\n       Whereas, Fast Track, which was established in 1974 by \n     President Richard Nixon when trade agreements were limited to \n     traditional matters, such as tariffs and quotas, is now \n     woefully outdated and inappropriate given the diverse range \n     of nontrade issues now included in ``trade'' agreements that \n     broadly affect State and Federal nontrade regulatory \n     authority; and\n       Whereas, the current grant of Fast Track expires in June \n     2007: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Senate, That:\n       (1) The U.S. Congress be urged to create a replacement for \n     the outdated Fast Track system so that U.S. trade agreements \n     are developed and implemented using a more democratic, \n     inclusive mechanism that enshrines the principles of \n     federalism and State sovereignty.\n       (2) This new process for developing and implementing trade \n     agreements include an explicit mechanism for ensuring the \n     prior informed consent of State legislatures before States \n     are bound to the nontariff terms of any trade agreement that \n     affects State regulatory authority to ensure that the United \n     States trade representative respects the decisions made by \n     States.\n       (3) Copies of this resolution be sent to President George \n     W. Bush, Ambassador Susan Schwab, U.S. Trade Representative, \n     the President of the U.S. Senate, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and the Wisconsin Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-181.

Nationally, more than 1,400 \n     children die from abuse or neglect each year. Over half of \n     them were previously unknown to child protective services. In \n     Michigan during 2005, 147,628 families were investigated for \n     suspected child maltreatment. In those families investigated, \n     28,154 children were confirmed to be victims of child abuse \n     and neglect. Of all confirmed cases of abuse and neglect, \n     more than a third involved children three years old or \n     younger. Another 19,265 children were in out-of-home \n     placement as the result of child abuse and neglect and \n     delinquency; and\n       Whereas, children who survive abuse or neglect likely carry \n     the emotional scars for life, while studies also show that \n     being abused or neglected multiplies the risk that a child \n     will grow up to be violent. The best available research \n     indicates that, based on confirmed cases of child abuse and \n     neglect in just one year, of these children, there will be an \n     additional 35,000 adult violent criminals and more than 250 \n     murderers who would never have become violent criminals if \n     not for the abuse or neglect they endured as children. \n     Fortunately, evidence-based in-home parent coaching programs \n     can prevent child abuse and neglect and reduce later crime \n     and violence. In general, these programs provide voluntary \n     coaching to parents of children up to five years old in home \n     settings for some period of time; and\n       Whereas, a number of programs exist to help parents. The \n     Nurse Family Partnership randomly assigned interested at-risk \n     pregnant women to receive in-home visits by nurses starting \n     before the birth of the first child and continuing until the \n     child was two years old. The program cut abuse and neglect \n     among at-risk children in half according to research \n     published in a leading medical journal. In addition, children \n     of mothers who received this coaching had 59 percent fewer \n     arrests by age 15 than the children of mothers who were not \n     coached. Yet this program reaches only a tiny fraction of \n     eligible parents. Other major home-visiting programs include \n     Parents as Teachers, Healthy Families America, Early Head \n     Start, Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters, \n     and the Parent-Child Home Program. However, hundreds of \n     thousands of at-risk mothers across the country receive no \n     in-home parent coaching. The impacts of child abuse and \n     neglect cost Americans $94 billion a year. In 2005, the \n     direct cost of child abuse and neglect in Michigan was an \n     estimated $531,744,598. Prevention efforts such as Michigan's \n     0-3 Secondary Prevention Initiative, which reflects the use \n     of a variety of program models, saved an estimated \n     $41,268,095 in direct costs associated with child abuse and \n     neglect; and\n       Whereas, in the 109th Congress, Senator Bond and \n     Representatives Davis and Platts, together with many of their \n     colleagues, cosponsored the bipartisan Education Begins at \n     Home Act in the Senate and House (S. 503/H.R. 3628) to \n     provide grants to help states establish or expand voluntary \n     in-home parent-coaching programs for families with young \n     children. The Education Begins at Home Act would have \n     authorized $400 million over three years in grants from the \n     United States Department of Health and Human Services for \n     voluntary in-home parent-coaching programs. The Education \n     Begins at Home Act would also have authorized $100 million \n     over three years in grants for voluntary in-home parent-\n     coaching programs for English language learners and military \n     families. These programs would strengthen Early Head Start, \n     which includes center-based and in-home parent coaching \n     components. Each of the major home-visiting programs operates \n     in Michigan, and the Education Begins at Home Act would allow \n     program flexibility so that states would not be tied to one \n     particular model. These voluntary programs would help new \n     parents learn skills to promote healthy child development and \n     be better parents; Now: therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to reintroduce an expanded Education Begins \n     at Home Act. We encourage sponsors of the new bill to include \n     separate funding authorization levels for each of the next \n     five years, to target funding first toward jurisdictions with \n     the greatest need, and to ensure that funding priority be \n     given to evidence-based approaches that deliver effective \n     results in improving outcomes for children and families; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United Stales Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-186.

to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate COncurrent Resolution No. 134\n\n       Whereas, the health, safety, welfare, and economic recovery \n     of the residents and businesses of New Orleans East are \n     dependent upon the continued assistance and encouragement \n     from our federal partners; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of Louisiana created the New \n     Orleans Regional Business Park as a special municipal \n     district for the primary purpose of engaging industrial, \n     manufacturing, processing, assembling, distribution, and \n     wholesale businesses; and\n       Whereas, as of early May 2006, approximately forty \n     companies out of one hundred four pre-Katrina were back in \n     business and the future of the others is largely uncertain; \n     and\n       Whereas, New Orleans East has become the illegal burial \n     grounds for homes and businesses washed out by hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita; and\n       Whereas, illegal dumping makes it extremely hard to attract \n     businesses to New Orleans East and to the business park; and\n       Whereas, in the business park alone there are twenty-three \n     known illegal dumping sites and thirteen illegal automobile \n     dumping sites; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded \n     the business park $400,000 in grants to catalogue \n     contamination, but none of the federal funds will be used for \n     cleanup; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality \n     Enforcement Division, Surveillance Division and Criminal \n     Investigations Section of the Legal Affairs Division have \n     inspected over one hundred seventy-five sites and found \n     potential environmental violations on one hundred fifty of \n     these sites in the Almonaster/Gentilly area alone; and\n       Whereas, on one of these sites, sixty-five thousand cubic \n     yards of debris or approximately an eleven foot tall mound of \n     debris was found to have been illegally dumped on this one \n     site in New Orleans East; and\n       Whereas, the illegal piles of debris do not have protective \n     barriers to keep whatever poisons are in the piles contained \n     and from leaking out into the wetlands surrounding this area; \n     and\n       Whereas, numerous federal agencies have roles and \n     responsibilities in the health, safety, and economic \n     development after hurricanes Katrina and Rita which range \n     from debris removal, oversight of regulations, and recovery \n     funding; and\n       Whereas, the removal of all dump sites within the New \n     Orleans Regional Business Park will improve the health, \n     safety, and economic development: Now Therefore, be it \n     Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the \n     Congress of the United States to urge and request the \n     respective executive branch departments to take a proactive \n     role in assisting the communities of New Orleans East in \n     protecting their health and safety and in promoting economic \n     development: and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     request the Congress ofthe United States and the appropriate \n     federal agencies, in coordination with appropriate Louisiana \n     state agencies, to immediately take the following actions: \n     (a) cease funding any waste disposal activities within the \n     New Orleans Regional Business Park, except for the city of \n     New Orleans' landfill known as the Gentilly Landfill which is \n     legally permitted and should continue working with all state \n     and federal agencies; (b) develop and implement procedures \n     for expeditious environmental sampling, analysis, and \n     reporting; (c) resolve the blurring of debris management \n     responsibilities between the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency and Environmental Protection Agency, and state \n     environmental and public health agencies; (d) review and \n     enhance the Environmental Protection Agency's oversight role \n     of illegal and improper debris disposal; and (e) provide \n     guidance and mechanisms for the development of public/private \n     partnerships in restoring and redeveloping the New Orleans \n     Regional Business Park and the New Orleans East community; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-187.

and\n       Whereas, Federal discretionary funding is controlled by the \n     executive branch and the United States Congress through the \n     budget and appropriations process; and\n       Whereas, Direct funding provides the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs with a reliable, predictable, and consistent source \n     of funding to provide timely, efficient, and high-quality \n     health care for our veterans; and\n       Whereas, Currently almost 90 percent of federal health care \n     spending is direct rather than discretionary, and only the \n     funding for health care for active duty military, Native \n     Americans, and veterans is subject to the discretion of the \n     United States Congress; and\n       Whereas, Discretionary funding for health care lags behind \n     both medical inflation and the increased demand for services; \n     for example, the enrollment for veterans' health care \n     increased 134 percent between fiscal years 1996 and 2004 yet \n     funding increased only 34 percent during the same period when \n     adjusted to 1996 dollars; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Veterans Affairs is the largest \n     integrated health care system in the United States and has \n     four critical health care missions: to provide health care to \n     veterans, to educate and train health care personnel, to \n     conduct medical research, and to serve as a backup to the \n     United States Department of Defense and support communities \n     in times of crisis; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Veterans Affairs operates 157 \n     hospitals, with at least one in each of the contiguous \n     states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Veterans Affairs operates more \n     than 850 ambulatory care and community-based outpatient \n     clinics, 132 nursing homes, 42 residential rehabilitation \n     treatment programs, and 88 home care programs; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Veterans Affairs provides a wide \n     range of specialized services to meet the unique needs of \n     veterans, including spinal cord injury and dysfunction care \n     and rehabilitation, blind rehabilitation, traumatic brain \n     injury care, post-traumatic stress disorder treatment, \n     amputee care and prosthetics programs, mental health and \n     substance abuse programs, and long-term care programs; and\n       Whereas, The Department of Veterans Affairs health care \n     system is severely underfunded, and had funding for the \n     department's medical programs been allowed to grow \n     proportionately as the system sought to admit newly eligible \n     veterans following the eligibility reform legislation in \n     1996, the current veterans' health care budget would be \n     approximately $10 billion more; and\n       Whereas, In a spirit of bipartisan accommodation, members \n     of the United States Congress should collectively resolve the \n     problem of discretionary funding and jointly fashion an \n     acceptable formula for funding the medical programs of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the State of Texas, 80th \n     Legislature, hereby express its profound gratitude the for \n     sacrifices made by veterans, including those who suffer from \n     medical or mental health problems resulting from injuries \n     that occurred while serving in the United States Armed Forces \n     at home or abroad; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate hereby respectfully urge the \n     Congress of the United States to support legislation for \n     veterans' health care budget reform to allow assured funding; \n     and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate forward official \n     copies of this Resolution to the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs, to the President of the United States, to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of \n     the Senate of the United States Congress, and to all the \n     members of the Texas delegation to the Congress with the \n     request that this Resolution be officially entered in the \n     Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the \n     United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10422-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. INOUYE, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, with amendments:\n       S. 675.

A bill to provide for a rotating schedule for regional \nselection of delegates to a national Presidential nominating \nconvention, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I joined Senators Klobuchar and \nLieberman in introducing the Regional Presidential Primary and Caucus \nAct. Our legislation would establish a rotating schedule of regional \npresidential primaries and caucuses.\n  We introduced this legislation because we agree that the Presidential \nnomination system is broken. The American dream that ``any boy or girl \ncan grow up to be President'' has become a nightmare.\n  Crowded schedules and government restraints on contributions close \nprimaries to worthy competitors. States racing to schedule early \ncontests have made the nomination process too long and expensive. As a \nresult, media and money make decisions voters should make.\n\n[[Page S10426]]\n\n  The National Football League schedules 16 contests over 5 months to \ndetermine its champions. The Presidential nominating process uses the \nequivalent of two preseason contests in Iowa and New Hampshire to \nnarrow the field to two or three and sometimes pick the winner.\n  If professional football were Presidential politics, SportsCenter \nwould pick the Super Bowl teams after two preseason games.\n  The problem is not Iowa and New Hampshire. The problem is what comes \nafter Iowa and New Hampshire. At least 18 States will choose delegates \nin a 1-day traffic jam on February 5 next year.\n  The legislation we introduced today requires States to spread out the \nprimaries and caucuses into a series of regional contests over four \nmonths. Beginning in 2012, States could only schedule primaries and \ncaucuses during the first weeks of March, April, May, and June of \nPresidential years.\n  The traditional warm up contests in Iowa and New Hampshire would \nstill come first, but they would return to their proper role as ``off-\nBroadway'' opportunities for lesser known candidates to become well-\nenough known to compete on the 4-month-long big stage.\n  In addition, at the appropriate time I will offer an amendment to \nthis legislation that would allow Presidential candidates to raise up \nto $20 million in individual contribution amounts of up to $10,000, \nindexed for inflation. The current limit of $2,300 makes it too hard \nfor many worthy but unknown candidates to raise enough early money to \nbe taken seriously--leaving the field to the rich--who constitutionally \ncan spend their own funds--and famous.\n  Together, these two reforms--spreading out the primaries and allowing \na ``start-up'' fund for candidates--will increase the pool of good \ncandidates willing to run for the White House and give more Americans \nthe opportunity to hear their ideas and to cast a meaningful vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the following \ndocuments printed in the Congressional Record: a David Broder column, \n``No Way to Choose a President,'' that ran in the May 10, 2007 issue of \nThe Washington Post; Remarks that I delivered on the floor of the \nSenate on February 2, 2004 titled ``Two Super Bowls''; and a lecture I \ndelivered at the Heritage Foundation on May 23, 1996 titled ``Off With \nthe Limits: What I Learned About Money and Politics When I Ran for \nPresident.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, May 10, 2007]\n\n                      No Way To Choose a President\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       The true insanity of the altered presidential primary \n     schedule does not become apparent until you actually lay out \n     the proposed dates on a 2008 calendar.\n       The mad rush of states to advance their nominating contests \n     in hopes of gaining more influence has produced something so \n     contrary to the national interest that it cries out for \n     action.\n       The process is not over. Just last week, Florida jumped the \n     line by moving its primary up to Jan. 29, a week ahead of the \n     Feb. 5 date when--unbelievably--22 states may hold delegate \n     selection contests, either primaries or caucuses.\n       Florida's move crowds the traditional leadoff primary in \n     New Hampshire, which had been set for Jan. 22. And New \n     Hampshire is unhappy about the competition from two caucuses \n     planned even earlier in January, in Iowa and Nevada. So its \n     secretary of state, William M. Gardner, who has unilateral \n     authority to set the New Hampshire voting date, is \n     threatening to jump the rivals, even if it means voting \n     before New Year's Day.\n       This way lies madness.\n       Instead of there being a steady progression of contests, \n     challenging and whittling the field of contenders in the \n     wide-open races to select a successor to George W. Bush, it \n     is going to be a herky-jerky, feast-or-famine exercise that \n     looks more like Russian roulette than anything that tests who \n     can best fill the most powerful secular office on Earth.\n       As things stand, the earliest contests in Iowa, Nevada, New \n     Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida will be followed by \n     that indigestible glut of races on Feb. 5.\n       On that day, voters in the mega-states of California, \n     Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and \n     Texas will all be called upon to judge the fields of \n     contenders. And so will voters of 17 smaller states, ranging \n     from Alabama to Oregon and from Delaware to Utah.\n       Most of those voters will never have had an opportunity to \n     get even a glance at the candidates. All they will know is \n     what the ads tell them--and what the media can supply, when \n     reporters are exhausting themselves dashing after the race \n     from state to state.\n       Assuming everyone is not burned out, the survivors of this \n     ordeal will find things slowing to a crawl--and then \n     screeching to a halt.\n       Maryland and Virginia hold primaries on Feb. 12, and \n     Wisconsin a week later. Then there's a two-week gap, with \n     only the Hawaii and Idaho caucuses, until Massachusetts, \n     Minnesota, Ohio and Vermont vote on March 4.\n       At that point, presidential politics effectively stops for \n     more than two months. Between March 4 and the May 6 contests \n     in Indiana and North Carolina, the only scheduled events are \n     a primary in Mississippi and the Maine Republican caucuses.\n       This crazy calendar sets up one of two scenarios--both \n     scary. If one candidate in each party wraps up the nomination \n     by gaining momentum in the January contests and amassing \n     delegates on Feb. 5, we will be looking at the longest, most-\n     dragged-out general election ever. The conventions are late \n     in 2008; the Democrats' the last week in August, the \n     Republicans' the first week in September. The time from \n     February to Labor Day will be boring beyond belief.\n       But if nothing is decided by the night of Feb. 5, the \n     chance of a quirky result from the oddity of the political \n     geography of the remaining states will be greatly increased. \n     Democrats will have to compete in Indiana and North Carolina, \n     where they rarely win in November. Republicans will be judged \n     in Massachusetts and Vermont, where their party membership is \n     minuscule.\n       None of this helps the country get the best-qualified \n     candidates, and none of it helps either party put forward its \n     best candidate.\n       The situation screams for repair. In my view, the parties \n     would be well advised to make the necessary fixes themselves, \n     rather than wait for Congress to devise remedial legislation.\n       The mandate for the next pair of national party chairmen \n     should be to agree on a sensible national agenda for the \n     primaries--either a rotating regional system that gives all \n     states a turn at being early or a plan that allows a random \n     mix of states to vote, but only on dates fixed in advance by \n     the parties, and separated at intervals that allow voters to \n     consider seriously their choices.\n       It would be close to criminal to allow a repeat of this \n     coming year's folly in 2012.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Two Super Bowls\n\n       Mr. Alexander. Mr. President, I rise to propose that we \n     turn the Presidential nominating process over to the National \n     Football League, except for Super Bowl half-time shows. Then \n     maybe we can have a second Super Bowl, where anything is \n     possible and everyone can participate.\n       Take the example of our colleague Senator Kerry's team--I \n     am sure the Senator from Vermont will be quick to point out \n     it is the team of many Senators from New England--the New \n     England Patriots. Last night, they became the Super Bowl \n     champions.\n       On September 12, in the season's first game, the Buffalo \n     Bills trounced the Patriots 31 to 0. If this had been the \n     first-in-the-Nation Presidential nominating caucus, the \n     Patriots would have been toast. You know the pundits' rule: \n     Only three tickets out of Iowa. The Patriots certainly didn't \n     look like one of the three best professional football teams. \n     Then, the Washington Redskins defeated the Patriots, as \n     unlikely as it would have been for Dennis Kucinich to upend \n     Senator Kerry in New Hampshire. But in the National Football \n     League, upsets don't end the season. The Patriots played 14 \n     more games. They won them all. Yesterday, they beat the \n     Carolina Panthers in the Super Bowl for their 15th \n     consecutive win.\n       The National Football League schedules 20 weeks of contests \n     over 5 months to determine its champion. The Presidential \n     nominating process, on the other hand, uses the equivalent of \n     two preseason games in Iowa and New Hampshire to narrow the \n     field to two or three--and sometimes they effectively I pick \n     the winner.\n        The NFL wasn't always so wise. In the 1930s, league owners \n     rearranged schedules after the first few games so that teams \n     that were doing well could play one another. This was good \n     for the Chicago Bears, for example, but not for the league. \n     Fans in other cities quit going to the games--just as voters \n     in most States have quit voting in Presidential primaries.\n       Bears owner George Halas and others created today's \n     competitive system in which almost any one of 32 teams can \n     hope to make the playoffs. Green Bay can make it because the \n     league makes sure that even smalltown teams have enough \n     revenue. Prime-time television opportunities are rotated. \n     Each Monday, senior officials in the league's New York office \n     grade every call and no call to second-guess even the instant \n     replays.\n       Professional football has become America's game because it \n     symbolizes the most important aspect of the American \n     character: If you work hard and play by the rules, anything \n     is possible. As a result, 8 of 10 of the most watched network \n     television shows have been Super Bowls; 98 of the 100 best \n     watched cable television games have been NFL games.\n       Every September, the NFL fields 32 teams, almost all with a \n     shot at the playoffs. Every 4 years, the Presidential \n     nominating process does well to attract a half dozen credible \n     candidates for the biggest job in the world.\n\n[[Page S10427]]\n\n     All but half are effectively eliminated after two contests. \n     If professional football were Presidential politics, \n     Sportscenter would pick the Super Bowl teams after 3 or 4 \n     preseason games.\n       These two steps would fix the Presidential nominating \n     process:\n       No. 1, spread out the primaries. Twenty-eight primaries are \n     crammed into 5 weeks after New Hampshire. Congress should \n     assume the role of Paul Tagliabue. Create a window between \n     February and May during which primaries may be held every 2 \n     weeks. Iowa and New Hampshire could still come first, but \n     they would become off-Broadway warmups and not the whole \n     show.\n       The second step that would fix the process would be to \n     allow more money--to raise their first $10 million, let \n     candidates collect individual ``start-up contributions'' of \n     up to $10,000. Today's $2,000 limit makes it impossible for \n     most potential candidates to imagine how to raise, say, $40 \n     million. During 1995, when I was a candidate and the \n     individual limit on contributions was $1,000, I fattened 250 \n     fundraisers in that 1 year to collect $10 million. The \n     combination of the new $2,000 limit, the increased coverage \n     of new cable channels, and the growth of the Internet have \n     made it easier to raise money.\n       Still all but Senator Kerry was short of cash after New \n     Hampshire. Put it this way: The Packers would never make it \n     to the playoffs under the revenue rules of Presidential \n     primaries.\n       Mr. President, 45,000 Iowans voted for John Kerry in the \n     first caucus. About 83,000 New Hampshirites voted for him in \n     the first primary. More Americans actually attended last \n     night's Super Bowl game in Houston, TX, than voted in either \n     Iowa or New Hampshire. Ninety million others watched the \n     Super Bowl game on television.\n       Perhaps we should learn something from America's game about \n     how to pick a President. I thank the Chair.\n       Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n       The Presiding Officer (Mr. Smith). The clerk will call the \n     roll.\n       The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n       Mr. Alexander. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \n     the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n       The Presiding Officer. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [Heritage Lecture #568, May 23, 1996.]\n\nOff With the Limits: What I Learned About Money and Politics When I Ran \n                             for President\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       On March 3, one day after the disastrous--for me--South \n     Carolina primary and three days before I withdrew from the \n     presidential race, I attended Sunday services at the \n     Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta. The Rev. Frank \n     Harrington preached about how Joshua, after a great victory \n     at the Battle of Jericho, had been surprised and humiliated \n     in the battle of A'i--so humiliated that Joshua renamed A'i \n     the ``Valley of Calamity.'' He wanted his warriors always to \n     remember the lessons of what had happened there.\n       Walking out after the service, I asked Rev. Harrington, \n     ``Was the point that I should rename South Carolina the \n     'Valley of Calamity?'''\n       ``No,'' he said, ``the point is, you must learn lessons \n     from your defeat--and then pick yourself up and go on.''\n       The voters, in their wisdom, have given me a defeat, and \n     now several weeks to reflect upon its lessons. The Heritage \n     Foundation has invited me today to talk about one of those \n     lessons: the influence of money on the race for the \n     presidency. While my wounds are fresh, here is my view: The \n     so-called campaign reformers are selling the American people \n     a real bill of goods on this one. They are saying that limits \n     on what individuals can give to presidential campaigns and on \n     what candidates can spend will reduce the influence of money \n     and create a better democracy.\n       In fact, such limits do precisely the reverse. We now have \n     22 years of experience with them. Limits have increased the \n     influence of money and are dangerous to democracy. It is the \n     law of unintended consequences operating in all of its glory. \n     Instead of adding more limits, we should take the limits off \n     and rely on full disclosure to discourage corruption.\n       The limits on giving and spending for a presidential \n     campaign were well-intentioned, placed into federal law after \n     Watergate. Corporations can't give at all; political action \n     committees may give up to $5,000; and individuals may give up \n     to $1,000 during the primaries (the government pays for the \n     general election). In addition, there are limits on what a \n     candidate may spend in each state primary and a ceiling on \n     spending for the entire primary. The Federal Election \n     Commission enforces all of this.\n       The limits were designed to make things better for you, the \n     average voter, so let's look at what they have done. As a \n     result of these limits:\n       You are more likely to see a comet than meet a presidential \n     candidate, unless you have $1,000--or live in Iowa or New \n     Hampshire;\n       You have fewer choices of candidates;\n       The primary campaigns start before you care and end before \n     you have a chance to vote;\n       You are less likely to hear the candidates' messages;\n       Your nominee is more likely to be someone already holding \n     office, rather than an insurgent;\n       More of your choices are among candidates who are rich \n     enough to spend their own money; and\n       Washington, DC., has more to say about who the nominee is \n     and you have less. In short, the federal limits on giving and \n     spending during elections are turning presidential races into \n     playgrounds for the rich, the already famous, and the \n     Washington-based, and are helping to deprive most Americans \n     of the opportunity to cast a meaningful vote.\n       When we create a system for picking Presidents, I believe \n     our objectives should be these:\n       We should want the largest number of good candidates.\n       We should want a good opportunity to hear what they have to \n     say.\n       All of us, if possible, want the opportunity to cast a \n     meaningful vote. If this is also your set of objectives, then \n     here is my remedy: Off with the limits. Off with the limits \n     on individual contributions. Off with the spending limits. \n     Require maximum disclosure. Open up the system. Let the \n     candidates speak. Let us vote.\n       Three Disclaimers--Before you think it, let me say it:\n       First, I am not here to wallow in gloom. In fact, I come \n     away from the campaign more optimistic, not less. I would do \n     it again in a minute. I believe even more that there is very \n     little wrong with our country that more jobs, better schools, \n     and stronger families won't fix.\n       Second, I believe I can make these remarks in the spirit of \n     a gracious loser. That is made easier because our process \n     produced a nominee whom I respect, who is my friend, and who \n     I will be proud to call my President. Under any process, Bob \n     Dole was our party's most likely nominee this year. (I will \n     confess that my determination to be a gracious loser is \n     tested about once a week when I remember what another \n     defeated Tennessean, Davy Crockett, once said. Congressman \n     Crockett strode to the courthouse steps, faced the voters who \n     had just turned him out of office, and said what every \n     defeated candidate has always wanted to say to such \n     voters: ``I'm going to Texas and you can go to hell'')\n       Finally, I am not here to complain because Steve Forbes \n     spent $33 million of his own wealth on his presidential \n     campaign. I believe the First Amendment to our Constitution \n     gives Mr. Forbes the right to spend his money to advance his \n     views. The Rockefellers and Perots and Forbeses and du Ponts \n     all have made valuable contributions to our public life. I \n     hope they continue to do so. What I object to, as I will \n     discuss, is letting them spend all they want and then putting \n     limits on the rest of us. What I am arguing--that it is wrong \n     to put limits on giving and spending--runs smack in the face \n     of what we have been hearing ever since Watergate. So let me \n     take my points one by one. What I have to contribute is a \n     view from the inside. I will stick to my impressions and \n     stories from the road and let scholars here at Heritage and \n     elsewhere compile the statistics and perform the analysis.\n       Because of the limits, you're more likely to see a comet \n     than meet a presidential candidate, unless you have $1,000--\n     or live in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n       Of course, not everybody wants to meet a presidential \n     candidate. Walking across New Hampshire, I met a woman taking \n     a work break outside a shoe factory in Manchester. I stuck \n     out my hand and said, ``I'm Lamar Alexander. I'd like to be \n     your next President.'' She looked at me, and at my red and \n     black shirt, and said with disgust, ``That's all we need. \n     Another President!'' Congressman Mo Udall used to tell about \n     walking into a barber shop. ``I'm Mo Udall, running for \n     President,'' he said. ``Yeah, I know,'' the barber replied. \n     ``We were just laughing about that yesterday.''\n       But if you are one of those persons who would actually like \n     to meet and size up someone who might be your President, get \n     your wallet ready because the $1,000 limit on giving forces \n     candidates to spend most of their time with people who can \n     give $1,000. As with many federal laws, these limits have \n     done just exactly the opposite of what they were intended to \n     do. Limits have increased the influence of money on the \n     candidates.\n       For example, to raise $10 million in 1995 for the Alexander \n     for President campaign, I traveled to 250 fund-raising \n     events. Now, think about this. This is about one event per \n     campaign day. This took 70 percent of all my time. As a \n     result, I became unusually well acquainted with a great many \n     good Americans capable of giving $1,000 (who probably \n     represent a cross section of about one percent of all the \n     people in the country). Wouldn't I have been a better \n     candidate, and the country better off had I been elected, if \n     I had spent more time traveling around America and visiting \n     allies abroad? (I actually did this during 1994, driving \n     8,800 miles across America and spending two months overseas. \n     This was when I was not spending most of my time meeting nice \n     people who could give me $1,000.)\n       Because of the limits, you have fewer choices for \n     President.\n       This is because, in the real world, a $1,000 limit on gifts \n     makes fund-raising so difficult that it discourages most \n     candidates. I will now wave my own red flag: It is important \n     not to get carried away with this argument. The difficulty of \n     raising money is sometimes just an excuse. There are other \n     more compelling reasons not to run for President.\n\n[[Page S10428]]\n\n       For example, I recall in November of 1995, when Colin \n     Powell was on the cover of the news magazines and his \n     approval rating in the polls was, literally, higher than the \n     Pope's--and I was struggling to secure a paragraph in the \n     Keokuk, Iowa, daily--I was driving to the airport after a New \n     York fund-raiser with a former associate of General Powell's. \n     The unavoidable question arose, ``Will Colin run?'' The \n     former associate answered, ``I don't know. But I can tell you \n     two things about General Powell. One is, he makes rational \n     decisions. Two is, he doesn't like uncertainty.'' I knew from \n     that moment that, if that were true, there was no chance \n     whatsoever Colin would be a candidate. Running for President \n     is not a rational decision. It is instinctive. It is a \n     passion with a purpose. And it is most surely a symphony in \n     uncertainty. That is why I am so surprised that so many have \n     such a hard time taking Colin Powell at his word, that he \n     simply doesn't want to do it. Most people don't. They don't \n     want the job, or they are afraid they can't win, or more and \n     more they are unwilling to expose themselves and their \n     families to the scrutiny that comes with the candidacy.\n       Having said all of that, it is still true that the prospect \n     of trying to raise $20 million from contributions of $l,000 \n     or less makes the race much less attractive and often \n     impossible for many good candidates. In 1995, Bill Bennett \n     told me he didn't know how to raise that kind of money. Jack \n     Kemp said he knew how but didn't want to. Dan Quayle and Dick \n     Cheney discovered it would have been very hard even for a \n     former Vice President and a former Defense Secretary; they \n     both decided not to become candidates.\n       You might have wondered this year, where have all the \n     governors gone? I don't think I have ever met a governor who \n     didn't think he or she would make an excellent President. \n     Seventeen of our Presidents have been governors. There are \n     today 32 Republican governors. One might argue (and I will \n     confess that I tried out this argument a few hundred times \n     during 1995) that the natural presidential partner for our \n     strong Republican congressional leaders would have been the \n     best of our Republican governors.\n       But at the end of 1995, not one sitting Republican governor \n     was in the race. Carroll Campbell, Tommy Thompson, and Bill \n     Weld, perhaps others, had considered it and drawn back, \n     privately saying, ``I can't raise the money.'' Even the \n     governor of California, Pete Wilson, who by my calculation is \n     governor of 5 percent of all the money in the world, could \n     not raise enough money. So, for Republicans, 1995 turned out \n     to be the year of the ``money primary.''\n       This is how it worked. There were, in the end, only four of \n     us who could find a way to raise enough money to run for \n     President. We all had certain advantages. For example, a \n     contribution to Bob Dole was also a contribution to the \n     respected Senate majority leader. Phil Gramm had worked \n     relentlessly for six years as chairman of the Senate \n     Republican Campaign Committee to build a list of 83,000 names \n     and a $5 million campaign kitty, which he then transferred to \n     his presidential account--a perfectly legal loophole, but \n     one which was unavailable to the governors or others not \n     holding office. Pat Buchanan was able to depend on direct \n     mail for smaller contributions because it was his second \n     race, he had been on network television for 15 years, and \n     he took, shall we say, especially noisy positions.\n       The Alexander campaign had some advantages, too: \n     exceptional national leadership and strong support at home. \n     Six of the last seven Republican national finance chairs \n     chaired our fund-raising. We began with a $2 million dinner \n     in Nashville on March 6, 1995, and raised $5.2 million in 21 \n     events during the next six weeks. At the end of 1995, the \n     three zip codes in America which had contributed the most to \n     presidential campaigns were all in Nashville. By the time I \n     withdrew, we had raised nearly $13 million from 26,000 \n     contributors, 8,800 of whom had given $1,000. (We received \n     another $4 million from federal matching funds.)\n       But after the initial $5.2 million spurt, it became much \n     harder for us. I was traveling to 20 events per month to \n     raise $500,000. This created logistical adventures of Desert \n     Storm proportions. On one day, I flew from Nashville to \n     Colorado Springs to Denver for fundraisers and then on to \n     Phoenix to be ready for an early morning breakfast. To \n     collect $20,000 during the crucial week before the Iowa \n     caucus, I ``dropped by'' Knoxville, Tennessee, on the way \n     from New Hampshire to Iowa. To raise another $30,000, I flew \n     from Sioux City, Iowa, to San Juan, Puerto Rico, one Sunday \n     in December. By the last four days of the New Hampshire \n     primary, we were running on empty except for the money set \n     aside for debts, audit, and winding down.\n       Then, when I placed a strong third in the Iowa caucus on \n     February 12, the money dam broke. Beginning three days after \n     Iowa, five days before the New Hampshire primary, \n     contributions started rolling in to our Nashville \n     headquarters at the rate of $1,000,000 a day without events. \n     This continued for every day except Sunday, until I withdrew \n     on March 6. Our once-a-week telephone conference calls \n     sometimes included more than 200 volunteer fund-raisers. But \n     it came too late, for New Hampshire ads had to be purchased \n     the Friday before the primary on Tuesday. I failed (by 7,000 \n     votes) to overtake Senator Dole. The Republican nomination \n     was decided in the first primary.\n       Partly because of the limits, the campaign starts before \n     you care and ends before you have a chance to vote.\n       Not only did the campaign end early; it started \n     ridiculously early because, it seemed at the time, starting \n     early was the only way to raise the necessary amount of \n     money. In early 1995, Senator Gramm of Texas, flush with his \n     83,000 names and $5 million kitty, declared that it would \n     take $20 million to run for President, that he could raise it \n     and that he doubted many others could, and then sponsored a \n     $4 million kick-off dinner in Dallas and announced, ``Ready \n     cash is a candidate's best friend.''\n       None of the rest of us were about to be left behind. I held \n     my $2 million dinner in Nashville. Senator Dole jumped in, as \n     did others. Off we went, pounding the streets in 1995 trying \n     to raise money for a race in 1996. It was like trying to \n     stir up a conversation about football in the middle of the \n     NBA playoffs. For me, by mid-summer 1995, it was going \n     something like this interview:\n       From Washington, D.C., ``Inside Politics,'' Wolf Blitzer \n     (already bored with the long ``money primary''): ``Governor \n     Alexander, why do the polls show Senator Dole ahead of you 54 \n     to 4 in Iowa?''\n       From Vermont, in my red and black shirt, Me (already tired \n     of being asked the same question for the 50th time): ``Wolf, \n     that's the dumbest question I've ever heard. The reason \n     Senator Dole is ahead of me is that everyone knows him and \n     nobody knows me.''\n       Now, add to the cost of creating such a long campaign the \n     usual costs of fund-raising. A rule of thumb is that it costs \n     30 cents to raise a dollar. That meant that of the $10 \n     million we raised in 1995, about $3.5 million went for fund-\n     raising. Then there is the cost of complying with federal \n     regulations. Another $1 million of the $10 million we raised \n     during 1995 went for that. We set aside still another \n     $500,000 for the campaign audit, which usually takes years. I \n     think you can see where I am heading.\n       Add the costs of the long campaign to the usual costs of \n     fund-raising and complying with federal rules and, by the \n     time the 1995 money primary was over and the real primary in \n     1996 was here, the handful of us still standing (except for \n     Mr. Forbes) were running out of money. The Alexander campaign \n     spent $10 million during 1995, everything we raised, which \n     left us about $3 million in the bank (counting federal \n     matching funds) at the beginning of 1996. And, by comparison, \n     we were running a bare-bones effort. Senator Gramm had spent \n     $28 million when he dropped out just before the first primary \n     in midFebruary. Senator Dole had spent more than $30 million \n     by March 1 and, with 39 primaries yet to go, was coming \n     uncomfortably close to the federally imposed primary spending \n     ceiling. Steve Forbes spent $33 million before he dropped \n     out. I'm not sure whether my friend Pat has dropped out yet \n     or not!\n       The reason why the Republican nomination was decided in the \n     first primary is not only because limits on giving and \n     spending forced the campaigns to start early. It is also \n     because so many states moved their primaries to an earlier \n     date in an attempt to give their citizens the same privilege \n     Iowa and New Hampshire citizens have: the opportunity to cast \n     a meaningful vote to pick the first President of the new \n     century. This bunching of primaries created a wild roller \n     coaster ride through 38 states in the 25 days after New \n     Hampshire. Ironically, this made New Hampshire even more \n     important. Here was the law of unintended consequences \n     mischievously at work once again. The money primary became so \n     long and expensive that we all arrived financially exhausted \n     at the real starting line: New Hampshire, which turned out to \n     be the finish line as well. About the time the voters had \n     returned from the refrigerator to settle in and watch the \n     presidential campaign unfold and perhaps even to vote in it \n     the campaign had ended.\n       Because of the limits, you are less likely to hear the \n     candidates' message.\n       This is because limits on giving and spending prevent most \n     candidates from raising enough money to get across their \n     messages, especially if the candidate is relatively unknown \n     at the beginning. Let me offer an example. Yesterday's \n     Newsweek contains a column by Meg Greenfield which says this: \n     ``The doomed Presidential campaign of Lamar Alexander should \n     tell the Republicans something. It was the quintessential \n     antigovernment pitch--complete with an implicit--and often \n     explicit--denial and disavowal of Alexander's career as a \n     government guy. He bombed.''\n       Well, now, this is the stuff of a pretty good debate. Of \n     course, I disagree with Ms. Greenfield. I think my campaign \n     nearly succeeded because I understand that the next President \n     must lead us to expect less from Washington and ask more of \n     ourselves, including our local governmental institutions. Ms. \n     Greenfield's and President Clinton's solution is more from \n     Washington. So let the debate begin.\n       Ms. Greenfield has her page in Newsweek. She is also \n     editorial director for the Washington Post. President Clinton \n     has the best forum of all. Their ``more from Washington'' \n     side of the argument will get plenty of exposure. But what \n     about my ``more from us'' argument? I made my case in Iowa \n     during 80 visits and walked 100 miles across New Hampshire. I \n     found that in those small meetings I could be persuasive. I \n     also found that nothing much happened in the public opinion \n     polls until I was on television. ``Free TV''--the network \n     news--was not of much help (although some local stations were \n     very aggressive). To begin with, the national networks didn't \n     arrive until mid-January when the campaign was nearly over.\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\n       The Center for Media and Public Affairs watched all the \n     network newscasts in January and February, ten-and-one-half \n     hours of campaign coverage. The Center found that we nine \n     Republican candidates were allotted 79 minutes total. We were \n     allowed to present our views in seven-second sound bites. The \n     journalists covering us received five times as many minutes \n     of coverage on those same newscasts. What the journalists \n     said about us and our campaigns was more negative than what \n     we candidates said about each other. And more than half the \n     journalists' comments were about the horse race, not the \n     issues. The Freedom Forum, in a remarkable survey of the \n     journalists covering the presidential campaign, found that in \n     1992, 89 percent had voted for Bill Clinton. A candidate \n     cannot rely on ``Free TV'' to get his message across. That is \n     why, in our media-drenched society, where things are not \n     important unless they are on TV, a candidate must have money \n     for television to get a message across, and the limits on \n     giving and spending make it difficult for candidates to do \n     that.\n       This is not just one candidate's lament. Limits on giving \n     and spending are an affront to the First Amendment to the \n     U.S. Constitution. The whole idea of the framers of the Bill \n     of Rights was to keep the government from attempting to limit \n     political debate and criticism: ``Congress shall make no law \n     abridging the freedom of speech.'' In Buckley v. Valeo, the \n     Supreme Court acknowledged this and struck down most \n     congressional limits of this sort, but left standing the \n     current provisions because of its worry about ``corruption.'' \n     I believe the better antidote to corruption is disclosure. To \n     correct something bad, we have created something worse.\n       Because of limits, your nominee is more likely to be an \n     incumbent than an insurgent.\n       In the real world, insurgents not only need more money than \n     incumbents; they need it early. The New York Times reported \n     that two-thirds of voters in New Hampshire made their minds \n     up during the last week before the primary, after the Iowa \n     caucuses. Among those voters, I won with 31 percent. Among \n     the one-third who voted before Iowa, I received six percent. \n     More money, earlier, might have helped get my message across \n     to those early deciders.\n       Candidates for President who already hold public office \n     have government-paid staffs of policy advisers, PR people, \n     and political administrators. They have name recognition and \n     franking privileges. They have a fund-raising advantage \n     because of their positions of power. If they are in \n     Washington, they have a huge media advantage because that is \n     where the media are. So putting a limit on what all \n     candidates can raise and spend turns out to be a protection \n     policy for some candidates: the ones who already enjoy the \n     perquisites of public office.\n       This is not just true in federal races. My home state, \n     Tennessee, has just limited contributions to governors' races \n     to $500. This is an enormous advantage for our incumbent \n     Republican governor, Don Sundquist. And it virtually \n     guarantees that the only effective candidate against Governor \n     Sundquist when he runs for re-election will be someone who is \n     so rich that he can spend his or her own money--which brings \n     us to the most important point.\n       Because of the limits, more of your choices are likely to \n     be rich candidates willing to spend their own money.\n       This brings us to the major problem with limits on campaign \n     giving and spending: The limits apply to some candidates but \n     not to others. This is because the U.S. Supreme Court has \n     said that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n     prohibits Congress from preventing anyone from spending his \n     or her own money on our own campaigns. So the limits apply \n     only to people who aren't rich enough to spend money on their \n     own campaign.\n       This creates an absurd advantage for wealthy candidates and \n     a distorted contest for the voter. The first advantage is the \n     obvious: The wealthy candidate has more money to spend. For \n     example, Mr. Forbes spent $33 million of (mostly) his own \n     money; I spent, with matching funds, about $16 million of \n     other peoples' money.\n       There are two other less obvious advantages. The candidate \n     with his own money spends no time raising it. On the other \n     hand, the candidate raising it is careening from event to \n     event, repeating speeches, meeting nice people who can give \n     $1,000, wearing himself ragged, and using up 70 percent of \n     his time. By the time you reach the finals the week between \n     Iowa and New Hampshire, you are a candidate for a fitness \n     center, not the presidency.\n       Finally, there are the state-by-state spending limits, \n     which also help the rich. The federal government has decreed, \n     for example, that a campaign may not spend more than $1 \n     million in Iowa and $618,000 in New Hampshire during the \n     presidential primaries. Mr. Forbes, unaffected by these \n     limits, spent $5 million in Iowa on television. The Alexander \n     campaign spent $930,000. The AP reported that on the third \n     week before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Forbes bought 700 \n     ads on one Boston television station (which covers southern \n     New Hampshire). That week, Senator Dole bought 200 ads on \n     that station. The Alexander campaign: none. Mr. Forbes must \n     have spent $5 million in Arizona, by my estimates. Local \n     newspapers said it was more than any advertiser had ever \n     spent on local television to introduce a new product. (It \n     must be pointed out that having your own money doesn't \n     automatically mean you win. Mr. Perot is not President. Mr. \n     Forbes came in fourth in both Iowa and New Hampshire. I \n     recall my race for governor in 1978 against a candidate who \n     must have spent $8 million. I spent $2 million, enough to \n     win, although I could never have raised $2 million if there \n     had been limits of $500 or $1,000 per contribution.)\n       What kind of contest is this, having different rules for \n     different contestants? This is like watching the Magic play \n     the Bulls with one team wearing handcuffs. It is certainly \n     not the game the voters paid to see. Think of it this way: \n     Say the fifth grade teacher organizes a contest for class \n     president with water pistols as the weapon of choice; then \n     some kid arrives with a garden hose. Either take away the new \n     kid's garden hose (Bill Bradley suggests a constitutional \n     amendment to limit what individuals can spend on their own \n     campaigns) or give the rest of the fifth graders the freedom \n     to raise and spend enough money to buy their own garden \n     hoses. And if the New Hampshire primary is most of the ball \n     game in presidential primaries, why should state-by-state \n     spending limits keep candidates from defending themselves, \n     even if they use up all their money?\n       Because of the limits, Washington has more to say about who \n     the nominee is and you have less.\n       Talking about Washington these days has gotten to be a \n     sticky business. The rest of the country is tired of \n     Washington, and Washington is tired of hearing about \n     Washington. The rest of the country is becoming more \n     offensive about its feelings, and Washington is becoming more \n     defensive. ``Cut their pay and send them home'' still makes \n     sense in Sioux City, but they call it nonsense here. One of \n     Washington's most senior journalists told me sadly last year \n     that ``This town has grown too big for its britches.'' I have \n     been coming and going from Washington off and on for 30 years \n     and I believe that is true as well; but to come from outside \n     Washington and say it, and to really believe it, is asking \n     for trouble.\n       I believe our President must lead us to expect less from \n     Washington and to ask more of ourselves. That is a message \n     less frequently heard in Washington and more difficult to \n     launch from outside Washington. For one thing, this is a \n     media-drenched society, and the message-launchers--the \n     media--are increasingly concentrated here. That will be more \n     true in 2000 and 2004 than it was in 1996. The party fund-\n     raising apparatus is here. The party leadership is here. The \n     think tanks, if you will excuse me, are here. To \n     receive maximum attention to my speech today, I am here. \n     There are all sorts of good people here in Washington, but \n     we of necessity, when we are here, talk mostly with each \n     other.\n\n\n                         Reforming the Process\n\n       Limits on giving and spending make it less likely that a \n     candidate based outside Washington can succeed. Such \n     candidates, by their experience and skills, may be able to \n     help make Washington more like the rest of America, rather \n     than the rest of America more like Washington. I believe \n     Washington will always be a better place if it is constantly \n     refreshed by the strength of the country outside Washington. \n     The way we pick Presidents today makes that more difficult. \n     Limits are not all that is wrong.\n       The process should be deregulated. We should sunset the \n     existing regulations and start over. Fewer rules and full \n     disclosure should be the byword.\n       Spread out the primaries. Let Iowa and New Hampshire go \n     first, in February or March, and then arrange all the other \n     primaries on the second Tuesday of the next three months. \n     This would give winners a chance to capitalize on success, \n     voters a chance to digest new faces, and candidates a chance \n     to actually meet voters.\n       The candidates should be given the opportunity to speak on \n     television more often for themselves. My even mentioning this \n     runs the same risks Dennis Rodman would take if he suggested \n     some rule changes to a convention of NBA officials. So let me \n     begin with some praise. Some print reporters sat through New \n     Hampshire Lincoln Day dinners in the early stages of the \n     money primary, in 1994 and 1995. C-SPAN and CNN labored \n     valiantly and early. In January and February of 1996, the New \n     York Times began printing some long excerpts of the \n     candidates' speeches, and the networks began showing unedited \n     stump speeches. But most of the coverage came late, or was \n     about the horse race, or about candidates who were never \n     going to run. Seventy-nine minutes of network exposure in \n     seven-second sound bites for nine Republican candidates is \n     pathetically little.\n       There are dangers to early voting. In a growing number of \n     states, voters may vote a month or two before the election \n     day. According to the Edison exit poll of 1996 New Hampshire \n     primary voters, 40 percent of the voters made their minds up \n     during the last three days before the primary. Those who cast \n     their votes a month earlier were voting in quite a different \n     race.\n\n\n                        Other Options For Reform\n\n       The first option is suggested by Senator Bill Bradley, \n     whose sporting background must make him especially allergic \n     to contests with one rule for some participants and another \n     rule for others. Senator Bradley would try to create a level \n     playing field by putting limits on everyone, in effect making \n     Mr. Forbes live by the same rules I do.\n       This takes care of Mr. Forbes and me. But the AFL-CIO will \n     still be able to run $35 million worth of TV ads attacking \n     particular Republican candidates. The National Association of \n     Wholesaler-Distributors will still\n\n[[Page S10430]]\n\n     be able to run ads slamming President Clinton's product \n     liability veto. The National Restaurant Association will \n     advertise that President Clinton is wrong about the \n     minimum wage. The National Education Association will say \n     I am wrong about school choice. The national political \n     parties will raise tens of millions in ``soft money.'' The \n     President is the one person in America who is able to \n     advocate the best interests of the country as a whole. Why \n     should we limit the speech only of those who seek to speak \n     for the country as a whole?\n       Senator Bradley should leave the First Amendment alone. The \n     First Amendment is correct. It stands in the way of \n     preventing ill-advised efforts by the government to limit a \n     candidate's right to speak. And if there cannot be limits on \n     most of us, why should there be limits on any of us?\n       A second option is public financing which we now have with \n     the presidential general elections. But such taxpayer-funded \n     campaigns still leave Mr. Perot and the AFL-CIO and other \n     committees free to spend millions creating an unlevel playing \n     field. Also, public financing leaves the media with more \n     horsepower than the candidates themselves have. And I cannot \n     fathom how public financing would work in a primary \n     situation. Would the government have funded everyone who \n     showed up at the Republican debates this season? If so, such \n     funding would have produced countless more candidates. I am \n     opposed to public financing. It is incestuous. It is an \n     unnecessary use of taxpayers' money. It invites government \n     regulations. It creates an unlevel playing field by favoring \n     incumbents.\n       Finally, there are various proposals to require the media \n     to give away TV time. (Such proposals would never work in a \n     primary for the same reasons public financing could not work: \n     How would you choose to whom to give it?) The lack of an \n     opportunity for voters to consider the messages of \n     candidates--especially insurgent candidates--is at the heart \n     of the problem with our presidential process. But I am afraid \n     these well-meaning proposals will drown in their own \n     complexity and the law of unintended consequences will \n     somehow rear its head again. Isn't the best solution for the \n     media simply to cover the races and present the serious \n     candidates on network news and in the newspapers more often \n     on appropriate occasions, speaking for themselves?\n\n\n                      Find the Good and Praise It\n\n       I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that I came away \n     from the campaign with a good feeling, not a bad feeling. My \n     friend Alex Haley used to say, ``Find the good and praise \n     it,'' and I can easily do that about this process, even with \n     its flaws. During the last year, I walked across New \n     Hampshire, meeting several hundred people a day, spent 80 \n     days in Iowa in maybe 200 meetings that ranged from 20 to 300 \n     people, and had at least 50 meetings in Florida with the \n     delegates to the Presidency III straw poll. During most of \n     these meetings I was little known and unencumbered by the \n     news media, so there was no disruption to the flow of the \n     session.\n       I remember wishing time after time that anybody who had any \n     sense of cynicism about our presidential selection process \n     could be with me, like a fly on the wall, because they could \n     not be cynical after hearing and seeing and feeling what I \n     saw. The groups with whom I met always listened carefully. \n     Most often, they wanted to talk about our jobs, our schools \n     and our neighborhoods, and our families. In meeting after \n     meeting, I came away certain that this is a nation hungry for \n     a vision contest, not one willing to tolerate a trivial \n     presidential election. I believe there is a great market in \n     the American electorate for a full-fledged discussion about \n     what kind of country we can have in the year 2000 and beyond.\n       As the song says, it is a long, long time from May 'til \n     September when the presidential race really begins. One way \n     to help fill this time usefully would be to review the way we \n     pick Presidents and make certain that next time, in the new \n     century, we have a process that attracts the largest number \n     of good candidates, that gives them an opportunity to say and \n     us to hear their messages, and gives as many of us as \n     possible a chance to cast a meaningful vote.\n       One lesson I learned when I ran for President is that step \n     one toward those objectives would be these four words: Off \n     with the limits.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to state my support for the \nlegislation Senators Klobuchar, Alexander, and I are introducing today \nto create a regional Presidential primary system effective in 2012.\n  The goal of this legislation is to transform what has become a tired, \narbitrary, and exclusive presidential primary system that simply does \nnot give enough voters the opportunity to weigh the ideas of candidates \nand choose the one they think would best represent their future.\n  Given the significance of choosing the most powerful officeholder in \nthe world, our Presidential selection process must be a fair and \ndeliberate one that tests the strength of the ideas and character of \nall the candidates and exposes them to the maximum number of voters.\n  Instead, what we have now is a confusing process that, with each \npassing Presidential election season, becomes more and more compressed, \nforcing States to move their primaries up earlier in the calendar year \nin order to give their citizens a chance to participate, and granting \ndisproportionate influence to the early States.\n  Where 50 States once scattered their primaries throughout the first \nhalf of the election year--from January through June--this year, we \nhave a system in which 39 caucuses or primaries will be held in January \nand February alone, up from 19 in 2004, with enough delegates at stake \npotentially to decide the nominee. Almost half the States of the Union \nwill be excluded from that process.\n  There is another insidious effect of this increasingly condensed \nschedule: The more compressed the primary schedule is the more reliant \ncandidates become on large campaign donations and the people who give \nthem. The fundraising primary this year has already eliminated \ncandidates who simply could not raise sufficient funds quickly enough \nto be competitive in the first 2 months of the Presidential year.\n  This is no way for the world's greatest democracy to choose its \nPresident.\n  Our legislation offers a commonsense alternative that would transform \nthe primary season into what it should be: a contest between candidates \nwho take their cases to the broadest possible slice of the electorate.\n  I was honored to cosponsor proposals to bring reason to the \nPresidential primary system twice in the past--in 1996 and 1999--with \nformer Senator Slade Gorton. What we are introducing today is very \nsimilar in that it calls for a regional, rotating primary system that \ndivides the 50 States into four regions that would take turns holding \nprimaries in the months of March, April, May, and June of the \nPresidential election year.\n  Specifically, the bill would asign all States to one of four \nregions--corresponding roughly to the Northeast, South, Midwest, and \nWestern regions of the country. A lottery would determine which region \ngoes first, and the regions would rotate in subsequent election years. \nEach State within a region must hold its primary or caucus during the \nperiod assigned to that region.\n  New Hampshire and Iowa would be permitted to continue holding the \nfirst primary and caucus, respectively, before any of the regional \nprimaries would take place. I personally would have preferred to omit \nthis provision in the bill. If we are going to change to a regional \nsystem, there should be no exceptions, and I am concerned that these \ntwo States will continue to have a disproportionate impact on the \noutcome of the nominating process. But Iowa and New Hampshire hold \niconic status in the Presidential primary system and so they remain the \nfirst caucus and primary States in this bill.\n  The new system would take effect for the 2012 Presidential election.\n  By creating a series of regional primaries, we will make it more \nlikely that all areas of the country have input into the nominee \nselection process, and that the candidates and their treasuries will \nnot be stretched so thin by primaries all over the country on the same \nday. By spreading out the primaries over a 4-month period, we would \nprovide the electorate with a better opportunity to evaluate the \ncandidates over time. And with our bill, we hope that voters--not just \nfinancial contributors--will have the lion's share of influence over \nwho the parties' nominees will be.\n  The guiding principle of our democracy is that every citizen has the \nopportunity to choose his or her leaders.

Res. 285\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions and therefore has \n     replaced the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella \n     term describing the range of effects that can occur in an \n     individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of cognitive disability in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas, although the economic costs of fetal alcohol \n     spectrum disorders are difficult to estimate, the cost of \n     fetal alcohol syndrome alone in the United States was \n     $5,400,000,000 in 2003 and it is estimated that each \n     individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost taxpayers of \n     the United States between $1,500,000 and $3,000,000 in his or \n     her lifetime;\n       Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if . . . a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2007, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--\n       (i) to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal \n     exposure to alcohol;\n       (ii) to increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) to ensure healthier communities across the United \n     States; and\n       (B) to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2007, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10431-2", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 286--RECOGNIZING THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF FIREFIGHTERS \n   TO CONTAIN NUMEROUS WILDFIRES THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kyl, \nMr. Barrasso, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Craig, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nStevens, Mr. Tester, and Mr. Reid) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (V) if such error rate exceeds 3 percent for any fiscal \n     year in which the State participates in the demonstration \n     program, a reduction in the amount otherwise payable to the \n     State under section 1903(a) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     Secretary 1396b(a)) for quarters for that fiscal year, equal \n     to the total amount of erroneous excess payments determined \n     for the fiscal year only with respect to the children \n     included in the sample for the fiscal year that are in excess \n     of a 3 percent error rate with respect to such children.\n\n       (ii) No punitive action based on error rate.--The Secretary \n     shall not apply the error rate derived from the sample under \n     clause (i) to the entire population of children enrolled in \n     the State Medicaid plan or the State CHIP plan through \n     reliance on a finding made by an Express Lane agency, or to \n     the population of children enrolled in such plans on the \n     basis of the State's regular procedures for determining \n     eligibility, or penalize the State on the basis of such error \n     rate in any manner other than the reduction of payments \n     provided for under clause (i)(V).\n       (iii) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed as relieving a State that participates in the \n     demonstration program established under this section from \n     being subject to a penalty under section 1903(u) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b(u)) for payments made \n     under the State Medicaid plan with respect to ineligible \n     individuals and families that are determined to exceed the \n     error rate permitted under that section (as determined \n     without regard to the error rate determined under clause \n     (i)(II)).\n       (2) State options for application.--A State selected to \n     participate in the demonstration program may elect to apply \n     any of the following:\n       (A) Satisfaction of chip screen and enroll requirements.--\n     If the State relies on a finding of an Express Lane agency \n     for purposes of determining eligibility under the State CHIP \n     plan, the State may meet the screen and enroll requirements \n     imposed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 2102(b)(3) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397bb(b) (3)) by using \n     any of the following:\n       (i) Establishing a threshold percentage of the poverty line \n     that is 30 percentage points (or such other higher number of \n     percentage points) as the State determines reflects the \n     income methodologies of the program administered by the \n     Express Lane Agency and the State Medicaid plan.\n       (ii) Providing that a child satisfies all income \n     requirements for eligibility under the State Medicaid plan.\n\n[[Page S10444]]\n\n       (iii) Providing that a child has a family income that \n     exceeds the Medicaid applicable income level.\n       (B) Presumptive eligibility.--The State may provide for \n     presumptive eligibility under the State CHIP plan for a child \n     who, based on an eligibility determination of an income \n     finding from an Express Lane agency, would qualify for child \n     health assistance under the State CHIP plan. During the \n     period of presumptive eligibility, the State may determine \n     the child's eligibility for child health assistance under the \n     State CHIP plan based on telephone contact with family \n     members, access to data available in electronic or paper \n     format, or other means that minimize to the maximum extent \n     feasible the burden on the family.\n       (C) Automatic enrollment.--\n       (i) In general.--The State may initiate and determine \n     eligibility for medical assistance under the State Medicaid \n     plan or for child health assistance under the State CHIP plan \n     without a program application from, or on behalf of, the \n     child based on data obtained from sources other than the \n     child (or the child's family), but a child can only be \n     automatically enrolled in the State Medicaid plan or the \n     State CHIP plan if the child or the family affirmatively \n     consents to being enrolled through affirmation and signature \n     on an Express Lane agency application.\n       (ii) Information requirement.--A State that elects the \n     option under clause (i) shall have procedures in place to \n     inform the child or the child's family of the services that \n     will be covered under the State Medicaid plan or the State \n     CHIP plan (as applicable), appropriate methods for using such \n     services, premium or other cost sharing charges (if any) that \n     apply, medical support obligations created by the enrollment \n     (if applicable), and the actions the child or the child's \n     family must take to maintain enrollment and renew coverage.\n       (iii) Option to waive signatures.--The State may waive any \n     signature requirements for enrollment for a child who \n     consents to, or on whose behalf consent is provided for, \n     enrollment in the State Medicaid plan or the State CHIP plan.\n       (3) Signature requirements.--In the case of a State \n     selected to participate in the demonstration program--\n       (A) no signature under penalty of perjury shall be required \n     on an application form for medical assistance under the State \n     Medicaid plan or child health assistance under the State CHIP \n     plan to attest to any element of the application for which \n     eligibility is based on information received from an Express \n     Lane agency or a source other than an applicant; and\n       (B) any signature requirement for determination of an \n     application for medical assistance under the State Medicaid \n     plan or child health assistance under the State CHIP plan may \n     be satisfied through an electronic signature.\n       (4) Rules of construction.--Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to--\n       (A) relieve a State of the obligation under section \n     1902(a)(5) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(5)) \n     to determine eligibility for medical assistance under the \n     State Medicaid plan; or\n       (B) prohibit any State options otherwise permitted under \n     Federal law (without regard to this paragraph or the \n     demonstration program established under this section) that \n     are intended to increase the enrollment of eligible children \n     for medical assistance under the State Medicaid plan or child \n     health assistance under the State CHIP plan, including \n     options related to outreach, enrollment, applications, or the \n     determination or redetermination of eligibility.\n       (c) Limited Waiver of Other Applicable Requirements.--\n       (1) Social security act.--The Secretary shall waive only \n     such requirements of the Social Security Act as the Secretary \n     determines are necessary to carry out the demonstration \n     program established under this section.\n       (2) Authorization for participating states to receive \n     certain data directly relevant to determining eligibility and \n     correct amount of assistance.--For provisions relating to the \n     authority of States participating in the demonstration \n     program to receive certain data directly, see section 204(c).\n       (d) Evaluation and Report.--\n       (1) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall conduct, by grant, \n     contract, or interagency agreement, a comprehensive, \n     independent evaluation of the demonstration program \n     established under this section.

Res. 285\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions and therefore has \n     replaced the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella \n     term describing the range of effects that can occur in an \n     individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n\n[[Page S10526]]\n\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of cognitive disability in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas, although the economic costs of fetal alcohol \n     spectrum disorders are difficult to estimate, the cost of \n     fetal alcohol syndrome alone in the United States was \n     $5,400,000,000 in 2003 and it is estimated that each \n     individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost taxpayers of \n     the United States between $1,500,000 and $3,000,000 in his or \n     her lifetime;\n       Whereas, in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if . . . a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2007, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States--\n       (A) to observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies--\n       (i) to promote awareness of the effects of prenatal \n     exposure to alcohol;\n       (ii) to increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) to minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) to ensure healthier communities across the United \n     States; and\n       (B) to observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2007, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10526-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10526-S10527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE HEROIC EFFORTS OF FIREFIGHTERS\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 286, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 286) recognizing the heroic efforts \n     of firefighters to contain numerous wildfires throughout the \n     Western United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor of the thousands of \nfirefighters who, in recent weeks, have literally put themselves in the \nline of fire to protect our communities and rural economies from \ncountless wildfires throughout the western United States.\n  For the second year in a row, western States have been plagued by \ncontinuous wildfires that far exceed those of average years. While July \nand August are typically considered the peak months for western \nwildfires, this year's fire season has been exacerbated by continued \ndrought, record-high temperatures, widespread dry lightning storms, and \nhigh winds. As of July 23, more than 55,000 wildfires had been reported \nthis year, burning over 4 million acres. That represents an increase of \nmore than 8,000 fires and 1 million acres over the 10-year average.\n  My home State of Utah alone has reported nearly 700 separate \nwildfires that have burned nearly 700,000 acres. This includes the fire \nat the Milford Flats Complex, which burned more than 360,000 acres, \neasily making it Utah's largest wildfire on record and one of the \nlargest of this year's fire season. Idaho is the only State that has \nbeen hit harder than Utah this fire season, reporting more than 700 \nfires that have burned more than 800,000 acres.\n  Utah and Idaho have not been alone in this recent spike of wildfire \nactivity. The Milford Flats fire was ignited during a 3-day period that \nlasted from July 6th through July 8th, at time period in which more \nthan 1,200 wildfires were ignited in the West as dry lighting storms \nswept across California, Nevada, Utah, and Southern Idaho. Despite \nthese drastic conditions, Federal, State and local fire crews have been \nrelentless in their efforts to control these wildfires, literally \nputting themselves between these infernos and our homes, our, \ncommunities, and our resources.\n  I also want to express my heartfelt sympathies towards the hundreds \nof communities and thousands of families affected by this year's fires. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with them as they begin the difficult task \nof cleaning up and returning their lives to normal.\n  At any given time, as many as 15,000 fire personnel are assigned to \nlarge, uncontained wildfires throughout the West. This year, and every \nyear, these brave men and women overcome extremely volatile weather \nconditions and terrain to contain nearly 98 percent of all wildfires \nduring their initial attack. That is why I am introducing a Senate \nResolution recognizing the heroic efforts of firefighters to contain \nthese dangerous fires in the West. Senators Bennett, Ensign, Wyden, \nDomenici, Kyl, Barasso, Salazar, Craig, and Cantwell have joined me in \ncosponsoring this resolution. Clearly, this Senate Resolution already \nhas strong bipartisan support, and I urge my remaining colleagues to \nlend their support.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 286) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Luke Concanen as its \n     first Bishop, and the Diocese was elevated to an Archdiocese \n     in 1850;\n       Whereas, on March 15, 1875, His Eminence John Cardinal \n     McCloskey, the second Archbishop of the Archdiocese of New \n     York, became the first Cardinal Archbishop of the Roman \n     Catholic Church in the United States;\n       Whereas the Archdiocese of New York has welcomed Papal \n     visits from Pope Paul VI, on October 5, 1965, and Pope John \n     Paul II, on October 7, 1979 and October 5, 1995;\n       Whereas, on September 14, 1975, Elizabeth Ann Seton, a \n     member of the Archdiocese of New York and founder of the \n     modern Catholic education parochial school system, became the \n     first person born in the United States to be named a saint;\n       Whereas Elizabeth Ann Seton is described on the front doors \n     of St. Patrick's Cathedral as a ``Daughter of New York'' and \n     several schools are named after her, including Seton Hall \n     University in South Orange, New Jersey;\n       Whereas the Archdiocese of New York is currently under the \n     spiritual guidance of His Eminence Edward M.

Res. 278\n\n       Whereas the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, \n     signed at Paris November 19, 1990 (``the CFE Treaty''), was \n     agreed upon and signed by 22 States Parties in order to \n     establish predictability, transparency, and stability in the \n     balance of conventional military forces and equipment in an \n     area of Europe stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural \n     Mountains;\n       Whereas there are now 30 States Parties to the CFE Treaty, \n     including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, \n     Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Georgia, Germany, \n     Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, \n     Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, the \n     Russian Federation, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, the \n     United Kingdom, and the United States;\n       Whereas the CFE Treaty is recognized as one of the most \n     successful arms control treaties of the modern era and has \n     served as a cornerstone of European security as the continent \n     emerged from the shadows of the Cold War;\n       Whereas the CFE Treaty facilitated the destruction or \n     conversion of over 52,000 battle tanks, armored combat \n     vehicles, artillery pieces, combat aircraft, and attack \n     helicopters;\n       Whereas the CFE Treaty continues to enable an unprecedented \n     level of transparency into military equipment holdings and \n     troop deployments in Europe, including over 4,000 on-site \n     inspections of military units and installations implemented \n     since the entry into force of the Treaty;\n       Whereas, on November 19, 1999, at the Organization for \n     Security and Co-operation in Europe Summit in Istanbul, \n     Turkey, the parties to the CFE Treaty signed an Adaptation \n     Agreement to reflect the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the \n     expansion of membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (``NATO''), and other changes in the European \n     geopolitical environment;\n       Whereas, at the time of the signing of the Adaptation \n     Agreement, the Russian Federation made a series of pledges, \n     known as the Istanbul Commitments, to withdraw its remaining \n     military forces and equipment from the territory of Georgia \n     and Moldova or otherwise negotiate consensual agreements on \n     their continued presence;\n       Whereas while the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     taken initial steps towards fulfilling the Istanbul \n     Commitments, it continues to maintain troops and associated \n     equipment in both Georgia and Moldova without the express \n     sovereign consent of the governments of either of those \n     countries, and the United States and other parties to the CFE \n     Treaty have therefore refrained from taking steps to ratify \n     the Adaptation Agreement;\n       Whereas, on April 26, 2007, President of the Russian \n     Federation, Vladimir Putin, in a speech to the Federation \n     Council of the Russian Federation, announced his intention to \n     initiate an unspecified ``moratorium'' on Russian compliance \n     with the CFE Treaty, citing the refusal of NATO Members to \n     ratify the Adaptation Agreement, concerns over the proposed \n     United States missile defense deployment in Poland and the \n     Czech Republic, and new basing arrangements between the \n     United States Government and the Governments of Bulgaria and \n     Romania as unacceptable encroachments on the security of the \n     Russian Federation;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation \n     subsequently requested, as is its right under the CFE Treaty, \n     an Extraordinary Conference to discuss its outstanding \n     concerns, which was held from June 12 to June 15, 2007, in \n     Vienna, Austria;\n       Whereas, on July 14, 2007, President Putin issued a formal \n     decree announcing the intention of the Russian Federation to \n     suspend compliance with the CFE Treaty after providing 150 \n     days advance notice to the other CFE Treaty signatories;\n       Whereas President Putin justified his decision on \n     ``extraordinary circumstances'' that ``affect the security of \n     the Russian Federation and require immediate measures'';\n       Whereas the CFE Treaty provides a formal mechanism for \n     withdrawal of a State Party from the Treaty following 150 \n     days of notice, but does not contain any provision for \n     suspension; and\n\n[[Page S10529]]\n\n       Whereas the Department of State, in responding to the \n     announcement by the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     suspend compliance with the CFE Treaty, declared, ``The \n     United States is disappointed by the Russian announcement of \n     its intention to suspend implementation of the Conventional \n     Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty. The United States \n     remains committed to CFE's full implementation. We also \n     remain committed to the ratification and entry into force of \n     the Adapted CFE Treaty. We look forward to continuing to \n     engage with Russia and the other States Parties to the Treaty \n     to create the conditions necessary for ratification by all 30 \n     CFE States.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that the decision of the \n     Government of the Russian Federation to suspend \n     implementation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in \n     Europe, signed at Paris November 19, 1990 (``the CFE \n     Treaty''), is a regrettable step that will unnecessarily \n     heighten tensions in Europe;\n       (2) the Senate recognizes the enduring value of the CFE \n     Treaty as a cornerstone of European security and affirms its \n     support for the basic principles of transparency, \n     accountability, host country consent for the stationing of \n     foreign military forces, and the rule of law embodied in the \n     CFE Treaty and the 1999 Adaptation Agreement thereto;\n       (3) the Senate strongly urges the Government of the Russian \n     Federation to reconsider its suspension of CFE implementation \n     and engage with the other parties to the CFE Treaty to \n     resolve outstanding problems and establish an agreed approach \n     leading to the eventual implementation of the Adaption \n     Agreement to the CFE Treaty;\n       (4) the Senate calls on the Russian Federation to fulfill \n     its Istanbul Commitments of 1999 and move speedily to \n     withdraw all remaining forces and military equipment from \n     Georgia and Moldova;\n       (5) the Senate encourages all parties to the CFE Treaty to \n     engage the Russian Federation in seeking innovative and \n     constructive mechanisms to fully implement the Istanbul \n     Commitments, consistent with the principles and objectives of \n     the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     and making full use of OSCE mechanisms;\n       (6) the Senate calls on all States Parties to ensure that \n     the resolution of the current disputes surrounding the CFE \n     Treaty be considered a priority at the highest political \n     levels, recognizing that the CFE Treaty is important both as \n     an arms control treaty and as an essential building block for \n     stable relations between the Russian Federation and \n     neighboring countries in Europe; and\n       (7) the Senate encourages officials of the Government of \n     the Russian Federation to refrain from belligerent statements \n     that only further polarize relations and jeopardize security \n     in Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/07/31/senate-section/article/S10529-1", "month": "07", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MILITARY ORDER OF THE PURPLE HEART\n\n  Mr. TESTER.
