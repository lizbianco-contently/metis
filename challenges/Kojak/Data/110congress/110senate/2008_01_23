Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning \nbusiness until 12:30 today, at which time we will break for the \nDemocratic caucus. As was indicated yesterday, the Republicans are \nhaving a retreat at the Library of Congress today. When we come back at \n2:15, the Senate will resume consideration of the Indian health bill. \nThere were some amendments offered yesterday, some debated yesterday. \nWe could not arrange a vote yesterday. I do not expect any votes on \nthis bill this afternoon. I have been in close touch with Senator \nDorgan. He is trying to work this out so we can complete this \nlegislation quickly. If there are any amendments that Democratic \nSenators have, I hope they would come and offer them today. That way we \ncan prioritize how we are going to move through this bill.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated yesterday, we are going to, this \nevening, start on the FISA legislation to complete that. We are going \nto finish that legislation this week. That means we are going to have \nall day tomorrow and all day Friday and, hopefully, not all day \nSaturday. But we need to finish this legislation. It is critically \nimportant. It is not fair to jam the House. Since we have been refused \nan extension by the Republicans, we need to finish this legislation \nnow, send it to the House, have a conference, and see what we can come \nback with as quickly as possible.\n  As I indicated, it is not fair to do as we did last August and send \nsomething to the House: Take it or leave it. We are not going to do \nthat. That is why I am not going to wait until next week to go to this \nlegislation. We have to complete it now. There are strong feelings on \nboth sides of this issue. As I have indicated on a number of occasions, \nI do not support the immunity provisions that are in the Intelligence \nbill, but it appears that a majority of the Senate does. That being the \ncase, those people who want to amend the Intelligence bill with that \ninformation and that legislation we have from the Judiciary Committee \nwill offer that. I hope they will do it as quickly as possible.\n  There are a number of other issues other than immunity. I have spoken \nto Senator Feinstein. She says she has something dealing with immunity \nshe wants to offer. She wants to offer something with exclusivity.\n  There are a number of other things we need to do. As I have \nindicated, I would hope that if somebody does not like an amendment, \nthey would move to table that amendment and not try to talk it to death \nbecause that being the case, we are going to have to let them talk \nduring the evening. We are not going to have a gentlemen's agreement \non: OK, so you don't want this to go forward; we are not going to let \nit go forward. We are going to complete this legislation as quickly as \nwe can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S157-7", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S157-S158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 4040\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Labeling Cloned Food\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know the Indian health bill is very \nimportant. Senator Dorgan will be coming to the floor to lead the \nadvocacy of its passage, which I support.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor because I want to share some very \ndisturbing news with you and all of my colleagues. Last week, the FDA \ngave the green light for cloned foods to enter our food supply.\n  The FDA announced food from cloned animals, or their progeny, is safe \nfor human consumption. Despite pleas from thousands of Americans, and \nthis Senator, to wait until there was more science, the FDA went ahead \nanyway.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear. I am not opposed to cloning that \nfollows strict scientific and ethical protocols. This Senator has \nalways been on the side of science for the advancement of mankind. This \nSenator has always been on the side of the consumer and the consumers' \nright to know, right to be heard, and their right to be represented.\n  So today I come to the floor for a vigorous call to action that my \nlegislation to label cloned food be passed as quickly as possible. This \nis a consumer alert today and a call for action.\n  My bill requires the Government to label any food that comes from a \ncloned animal or its progeny. Mr. President, my bill requires that the \nFDA and the Department of Agriculture put a label on this cloned food. \nThe FDA handles milk products. We say FDA should work on this issue. \nThe Department of Agriculture regulates meat products. That, too, \nshould be labeled.\n  My labeling bill would insist that cloned food be labeled at the \nwholesale level, the retail level, the restaurant level, the school \nlunch level, and the Meals on Wheels level.\n  My bill allows the American public to make an informed decision. \nPeople have a right to know what they are eating. This is necessary \nbecause the FDA and the Department of Agriculture have refused to put a \nlabel on cloned food. My legislation allows for consumer choice and \nalso, at the same time, it would allow for monitoring of food as it \ncomes into the food supply for postsurveillance to see if there are any \nnegative consequences.\n  Americans find cloned food disturbing, and some even repulsive. Close \nto 80 percent of Americans have said they would not drink cloned milk. \nThere is a ``yuck'' factor to this technology. Right now, under FDA and \nUSDA provisions, there would be no way to tell if food comes from a \ncloned animal or its progeny. I want the public to be informed, so that \nis why my labeling bill is for their benefit.\n  The FDA has been most troubling to me. They made their decision \ndespite two congressional directives--one in the omnibus bill and one \nin the farm bill. The omnibus bill, which the President signed on \nDecember 26, strongly encouraged FDA to hold off on a cloning decision \nbefore additional studies were done. On December 14, the Senate \noverwhelmingly passed the farm bill that would require the National \nAcademy to peer-review FDA's decision.\n  Now, this was limited to 1 year. So I wasn't talking about a 20-year \nlongitudinal study. I do want more science.\n  Second, I am concerned if we discover a problem with cloned food \nafter it is in our food supply, and it is not labeled, we will not have \nany way of monitoring this. It is labeling that allows us to monitor.\n  The FDA has been very weak in postmarketing surveillance of drugs. \nWhy would they be stronger on cloned food? Who will worry about the \nethics? And where is the urgency? We are not facing a global shortage \nof beef and a global shortage of milk.\n  I know FDA's decision on the risk assessment is over 900 pages long. \nMr. President, I have been skeptical of long reports. I have found that \nthe longer the report, usually the more shallow the information.\n  My concerns are grave. I am for more science, and I have asked for it \nresponsibly through the legislative process. I am going to continue to \nadvocate for more studies on this issue. In the meantime, I want to \nprotect the consumer and also allow scientists to monitor this new \ntechnology.\n  If America doesn't keep track of this from the beginning with \nlabeling, our entire food supply could be contaminated. I am not \nopposed to cloning. I\n\n[[Page S159]]\n\nam on the side of science, but let's label and monitor it.\n  The National Academy of Sciences suggested that we monitor this new \ntechnology because it is very new. They urged the Federal Government to \nuse diligent postmarket surveillance mechanisms. That requires \nlabeling.\n  Mr. President, last week, the EU decided that cloned foods were safe, \nbut they also put up a big yellow flashing light. They referred it to \ntheir science and ethics and new technologies committee. They said \nthere is no ethical justification to use cloned food. The EU called for \nmore scientific study on cloned food, and they also said it should be \nlabeled.\n  Denmark and Norway have already banned cloned food from their food \nsupply. I am worried that they will start banning our exports if they \nare not labeled. My State depends on the export of food, whether it is \nseafood, chicken, or other products. We want to be able to export our \nfood.\n  Mr. President, we are going down a track that I want to be sure is \nnot irrevocable or irretrievable. The way to ensure safety in our food \nsupply and consumer choice and the ability for science to continue is \nmonitoring and labeling.\n  I stand here on behalf of the consumer to say, please, let's pass \nthis labeling bill. It is needed, it is responsible, and it will be \neffective. I think it will save us a lot of ``yuck'' in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   U.S.S. ``Pueblo''--40th Anniversary\n\n   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise now, 40 years since the North \nKorean government unlawfully captured the lightly armed U.S.S. Pueblo \nwhile it was on a routine surveillance mission in international waters. \nThe U.S.S Pueblo was the first ship of the U.S. Navy to be hijacked on \nthe high seas by a foreign military force in more than 150 years, and \nis currently the only commissioned U.S. naval vessel that is in the \npossession of a foreign nation. Forty years ago today, 83 crew members \nwere kidnapped and 1 sailor was killed in the assault. Following the \ncapture, our men were held in deplorable, inhumane conditions for more \nthan 11 months before being released. While we were grateful to see the \nreturn of our brave sailors, 40 years later we are still waiting for \nthe return of the U.S.S. Pueblo.\n   The U.S.S. Pueblo remains a commissioned naval ship and property of \nthe U.S. Navy. Currently, the North Korean government flaunts the \nPueblo as a war trophy and a tourist attraction in Pyongyang, North \nKorea's capital. We must not continue to remain silent about North \nKorea's continued violation of international law by possessing our \nship, the U.S. Navy's ship. Each day tourists visit and tour the U.S.S. \nPueblo, similar to the way visitors see retired naval ships in New York \nand San Diego. Americans in particular are encouraged to be \nphotographed by the U.S.S. Pueblo. As recently as April 2007, it was \nreported that President Kim Jong Il stated that the Pueblo should be \nused for ``anti-American education.'' North Korea's capture of the \nU.S.S. Pueblo is in blatant violation of international law and the \nfurther exploitation of the Pueblo is tasteless and disingenuous. I \nbelieve 40 years of relative silence on this issue is far too long, and \nit is important that the Senate take action and denounce the current \nsituation.\n  The U.S.S. Pueblo bears the name of the town of Pueblo, CO, a city \nwith a proud military tradition and is the only city to be home of four \nliving Medal of Honor recipients simultaneously. In fact, in 1993 \nCongress deemed Pueblo the ``Home of Heroes'' for this unique \ndistinction. Many in our State and all over the country want to see the \nvessel returned to its proper home. To this end, I am reintroducing a \nresolution seeking the return of the U.S.S. Pueblo to the U.S. Navy. \nThis bill is cosponsored by my good friend and proud veteran, Senator \nDaniel Inouye, and I encourage all of our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support this legislation and see to it that the U.S.S. \nPueblo is returned to the U.S. Navy.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan editorial that appeared in the Pueblo Chieftain today regarding the \nanniversary.\n   As that editorial says, ``Mr. President, bring back the U.S.S. \nPueblo.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Pueblo Chieftain, Jan. 23, 2008]\n\n                                 Infamy\n\n       Today marks the 40th anniversary of what for Puebloans is a \n     day that shall live in infamy. On Jan. 23, 1968, naval and \n     air forces of North Korea attacked and took hostage the USS \n     Pueblo and its crew.\n       The Pueblo was a Navy intelligence ship operating in \n     international waters. Despite that, the Stalinist regime in \n     Pyongyang decided on a bold course of action and sent patrol \n     boats and MiG fighters to harass the lightly armed U.S. \n     vessel.\n       This was during the height of the Vietnam War, and the \n     North Koreans correctly figured that American military brass \n     weren't focused on the American spy ship's mission. They were \n     right.\n       Armed only with one .50-caliber machine gun, the Pueblo \n     crew tried to fend off the advancing Communist forces, to no \n     avail. One crewman was killed while comrades tried to destroy \n     as much equipment and paperwork as possible.\n       But the die was cast. The North Koreans boarded the Pueblo \n     and took the rest of the crew hostage.\n       For the next 11 months, the crew was subjected to cruel and \n     inhumane treatment at the hands of their captors. But the \n     American spirit was not to be tamed.\n       During propaganda photo sessions, the Yanks dutifully \n     smiled for the Koreans' cameras--and flashed ``the bird,'' \n     that one-finger salute that Americans know too well but was \n     above the heads of the Communists.\n       But that did not last. When the Reds figured out what that \n     sign of defiance meant, the men of the Pueblo were subjected \n     to more severe beatings.\n       The man who took the worst of the pummeling was Cmdr. Lloyd \n     Bucher, the Pueblo's skipper. After each torture session, \n     he'd crawl back to his cell--and surreptitiously give his \n     comrades the high sign.\n       He, and his men, were not to be beaten.\n       It was exactly 11 months after the seizure when the North \n     Koreans freed their American captives. They were allowed to \n     walk one by one across the Demilitarized Zone separating \n     North and South Korea.\n       While the Pueblo crew was free, their ship was and still is \n     not. It is being held as a trophy of war in a river near \n     Pyongyang--a tourist attraction and propaganda piece for the \n     regime.\n       North Koreans have been forced at times to eat grass, so \n     poorly is their economy run by central planners. But they \n     have ``bread and circuses'' in the form of the American \n     intelligence ship which bears this city's name.\n       Many attempts have been made to persuade the North Koreans \n     to give the ship back to its rightful owners. When he was \n     governor of California, Ronald Reagan urged Washington to \n     bomb North Korea in order to force the ship's release.\n       Over the years since, numerous diplomatic moves have been \n     tried. Recently, at the behest of Colorado's U.S. Sen. Wayne \n     Allard, a Korean battle flag on display at the U.S. Naval \n     Academy was returned to the Hermit Kingdom as a sign of this \n     nation's goodwill.\n       That and all other overtures have thus far been fruitless. \n     But this incident of four decades ago remains an ugly scar on \n     the history of this nation, one which cannot be allowed to \n     continue to fester.\n       We realize that with the War on Terrorism in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan and elsewhere across the globe, there are other \n     pressing international security issues. But if this nation \n     were to show the world its resolve by getting the USS Pueblo \n     back, by whatever means, we would show those who think they \n     can bring us to our knees that we are not to be cowed.\n       Mr. President, bring back the USS Pueblo.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, when I am completed talking about the \neconomy, we will return to the Indian affairs business and debate the \nbill on the floor. If there are those who wish to offer amendments, I \ncertainly hope we can bring them to the floor and debate them and vote \non them.\n  As I mentioned, I would like to talk for a moment about the economy. \nThere is the 24/7 news hour all across this country talking about what \nis happening: What on Earth is going on in this country's economy? What \nis happening in the stock market, which is moving up and down like a \nyo-yo--not so much up anymore but down substantially in recent weeks \nand months.\n  So what is happening? There are many pieces of evidence to suggest \nthis economy is in very big trouble, including a substantial reduction \nin the stock market, an increase in unemployment, and a dramatic drop \nin housing starts. As a result of all of that,\n\n[[Page S160]]\n\nthere has been frenzied activity, both at the White House and in the \nCongress, to talk about something called a stimulus package. We need to \ndo a fiscal stimulus package.\n  In fact, the President announced a stimulus package of $145 billion \nto $150 billion. That is a stimulus package of about 1 percent of our \ngross domestic product in this country.\n  Yesterday, the Federal Reserve Board took action in monetary policy \nto cut a key interest rate by 75 basis points. That was a significant \nand aggressive move by the Federal Reserve Board. This Congress and \nthis President will want to make some aggressive moves with a stimulus \npackage that are complementary to what has been done in monetary \npolicy.\n  I make this point that is very important: If that is what we do, and \nall that we do, we fundamentally misunderstand what is wrong. I think \nmost of the American people understand what is wrong. Certainly, most \nof the people around the world who look at this country understand we \nhave gone off the track. If we don't fix our trade policy and fiscal \npolicy, and if we don't fix things that need regulating that have \nlargely been outside of the view of regulators, we are going to \ncontinue to be in very big trouble. Let me go through just a couple of \nthese items.\n\n  We have the largest trade deficit in human history. Every single day, \n7 days a week, we import $2 billion more than we export. That means \nevery single day we add another $2 billion to the indebtedness of this \ncountry. That is over $700 billion a year. We are hemorrhaging in red \nink. We have to fix it. Warren Buffett, a remarkably successful \ninvestor in this country, said it quite clearly: This is unsustainable, \nthis cannot continue.\n  The fact is, the President and the Congress act as if nothing is \nwrong. We have the most unbelievably inept trade policy in the history \nof humankind--$2 billion a day we import more than we export. That \nmeans we are putting dollars that we pay for those goods in the hands \nof foreigners, and they are coming back to buy part of America. We are \nliterally selling part of this country. But the fact is, you cannot \nhemorrhage in red ink like that for any great length of time without \nhaving significant consequences. It is what undermines your currency. \nIt undermines confidence in your economy.\n  You add to that $700 billion-plus a year trade deficit a fiscal \npolicy that is reckless and ill-considered. It is as if we think people \ncannot see. It is like a drunk who thinks they are invisible. The fact \nis, we have an unbelievable fiscal policy deficit. They say: Well, it \nis $200 billion, $300 billion. Nonsense. Take a look at what we have to \nborrow for fiscal policy every year. The reason they show the lower \ndeficit is because they are misusing the Social Security revenues. Take \na look at the real deficit. It is likely to be over half a trillion \ndollars this year. You add that to the trade deficit and then ask \nyourself, if you were looking from the outside into this country, do \nyou think this is off track, the fundamentals are out of line? Do you \nthink they have to be fixed? The answer is yes. We have very serious \nabiding problems. You add to that an unbelievably inept fiscal policy \nhemorrhaging in red ink and is way off track.\n  By the way, it is not just the normal budgetary Presidential requests \nand congressional actions on spending and taxing. The President, in the \nlast year, sent to the Congress, in addition to outside-the-budget \nsystem, he said: I want you to appropriate money for me, $196 billion--\nthat, by the way, is $16 billion a month, $4 billion a week--and I \ndon't want any of it paid for; I want it added to the debt because I \nwant it for Iraq, Afghanistan, and other activities with respect to the \nwar. That takes us to over two-thirds of a trillion dollars this \nPresident has asked for, none of it paid for. We will send our soldiers \nto war, but we will not do anything that requires any effort on our \npart to begin to pay for it. We will send soldiers to war and say: Come \nback and you pay for it later.\n  In addition to a fiscal policy that just does not work, we are now \nengaged in a war in which we borrow the money. Even as we borrow the \nmoney for the war, we have a President who says: I want more permanent \ntax cuts, mostly for the wealthy. It is not a secret. Everyone sees \nwhat is going on--everyone, apparently, except those in the White House \nand those in the Congress.\n  We have to fix the fundamentals, and if we do not, there isn't any \namount of fiscal policy stimulus or any amount of activity by the \nFederal Reserve Board that is going to set this straight. It just is \nnot.\n  You add to that inept trade policy and the hemorrhaging of red ink on \nfiscal policy that is reckless and out of control these issues: \nregulators who really do not care. They come to the body of regulatory \nresponsibility bragging that they don't like government. What happens? \nWe have what is called a subprime lending crisis. What does that mean? \nWhat it means is no one was watching and no one cared very much, and \nwhat we had was an orgy of greed with respect to an industry that is \nessential to this country--that is, providing loans so people can buy \nhomes.\n  We had a bunch of highfliers decide: What we really want to do is to \nsell you a loan, and we want to put you in a new home. To do that, we \nwill give you rates that you will not even believe. We will give you a \nhome loan at a 2-percent interest rate--2 percent. We will quote the \npayment. That looks good, a 2-percent interest rate. What they don't \ntell you is the interest rate is going to reset in 3 years, it is going \nto reset way up, and then you will not be able to make the payments, or \nthey do not tell you there also is an escrow you have to pay every \nmonth on top of that.\n  Here is what was going on. This was an advertisement on television:\n\n       Do you have bad credit? Do you have trouble getting a loan? \n     You've been missing payments on your home loan? Filed for \n     bankruptcy? Doesn't matter. Come to us. We've got financing \n     available for you.\n\n  We have all heard these ads and probably scratched our heads and \nwondered: How on Earth can this happen? The fact is, it can.\n  I will give an example. The biggest mortgage lender is Countrywide, \nwhich now is being purchased by Bank of America, apparently. The CEO of \nCountrywide, Mr. Mozilo, made off now with hundreds of millions of \ndollars. They had brokers cold-calling people saying: We want to put \nyou in a subprime loan. Then they sold these subprime loans. They \npackaged these subprime loans with other good loans. They were enticing \npeople into these loans at teaser interest rates that were going to \nreset in ways people could not afford to pay. Then they decided, just \nas in the old days when the discussion was about meat-packing plants \nand they put sausage and sawdust together--when you make sausage, you \nneed a filler. So they put sawdust in sausage. These companies that \nwere hawking these loans decided to put good loans with bad loans, \nsubprime with other loans, and then mix them all up like a big-old \nsausage, and they would slice them up, securitize them, and sell them.\n\n  Who wanted to buy them? The rating agencies were sitting there dead \nfrom the neck up: This looks OK. We don't understand it, but it looks \ngood to us. Hedge funds were saying: I like these new pieces of \nfinancial sausage because they are sliced up in a way that has a big \nyield. Why a big yield? Because they had prepayment penalties for the \nloans, loans that would reset to much higher interest rates that people \ncouldn't make. This new piece of financial sausage shows a very high \nyield. So the hedge funds, liking high yields and liking big money, are \nbuying all these securitized loans, and then all of a sudden, it goes \nbelly up. And we wonder why. It is because people were advertising on \ntelevision: You have bad credit? Have you filed for bankruptcy? Come to \nus; we want to give you a loan. Then they package this up in an \nirresponsible way.\n  One might ask the question: How could that all have happened? Weren't \nthere some regulators around? No, no. The regulators were first \nignoring them and then actually giving them a boost. Alan Greenspan now \nstands around scratching his head thinking: What on Earth happened? It \nhappened on your watch, my friend. The Federal Reserve Board did \nnothing. In fact, part of this housing bubble that occurred was part of \nthe air that comes from these unbelievable subprime loans that boosted \nthat bubble. Again, Warren Buffett said: Every bubble will burst. And \nthis one did. It shouldn't\n\n[[Page S161]]\n\nhave surprised us. But regulators sat by and said: That doesn't matter.\n  Did anybody care about those brokers placing a $1 million jumbo \nsubprime loan, making a $30,000 commission on that loan? Did anybody \nsay: Wait a second, what you are doing is misleading the folks who are \ngoing to borrow the money; you can't do that. Did anybody say to the \nrating agencies: You can't be rating as top-grade securities this \nsausage with sawdust, these financial instruments that have stuck \ntogether bad loans with good loans; you can't do that. Did anybody say \nto the hedge funds: You are buying a pig in a poke here; you are buying \nsomething you think is high yield, but you know better than that. What \nhappened was all of this went out over the transom, and nobody even \nknows where it is or how much it is. Now they can't untangle it to find \nout where all these subprime loans exist. Nobody knows.\n  The next time somebody talks about regulation, understand, sometimes \nregulation is very important. The danger to this economy, as a result \nof the subprime scandal, is very significant. It is having consequences \nall across this country. You add this subprime scandal and its \nconsequences to a fiscal policy that is reckless, to a trade policy \nthat is inept, and then add this final factor: We have a circumstance \nwhere a gambler goes into a casino in Las Vegas and, in most cases, the \nsum total of what they will lose is the money they have carried into \nthe casino--that is the risk of loss.\n  Here is the other fact about what is happening in our economy that \nnobody wants to talk about. We have hedge funds--yes, they are called \nhedge funds, mostly unregulated--to the tune of about $1.2 trillion. \nSome would say that is not so much, $1.2 trillion. There is $9 trillion \nof mutual funds. There is something like $40 trillion of the total \naggregate value of stocks and bonds. So $1.2 trillion in hedge funds, \nthat is not so much, except one-half of all the trading on the New York \nStock Exchange is done by those hedge funds. And those hedge funds have \ncreated, among other things, derivatives. There was something like a \nnotional value of $26 trillion in credit default swaps at the end of \n2006.\n  It sounds very much like a foreign language when I say it, but the \nproduct everyone is worried about at the moment is something called \ncredit default swaps, trillions of dollars of credit default \nderivatives--fancy financial instruments, much fancier than sausage \nwith sawdust but in many ways the same thing. The interesting thing \nabout these hedge funds is the dramatic amounts of borrowing, so they \nare not going to lose just what they go into the casino with in their \npocket money. They are so heavily leveraged and so deep in credit \ndefault swaps that this could have significant consequences for our \neconomy.\n  I and others have spoken on this floor for several years about the \nneed for regulation of hedge funds. I have spoken on this floor many \ntimes about the issue of derivatives and the total aggregate notional \nvalue of derivatives and its potential consequence to the economy in a \ndownturn.\n  A friend told me there is a saying on Wall Street that you will never \nknow who is swimming naked until the tide goes out, and then it might \nnot be very attractive. When the tide goes out with respect to this \neconomy's difficulties and we evaluate who in the hedge funds, in the \ninvestment banks, who in all of these enterprises is left who cannot \npay the bills because they were so unbelievably leveraged in financial \ninterests most Americans have never heard of, credit default swaps, \nwhat are the consequences to our country's economy?\n  If this does not sober up our Government on trade policy and fiscal \npolicy and regulatory requirements with respect to hedge funds and \nderivatives, then nothing will. If this does not alert all of us that \nwe are no longer operating behind a screen somehow--the world sees what \nis happening when there is a subprime loan scandal, the world \nunderstands it, and its consequences are felt all across this country \nand all across the globe.\n  I understand we are going to do something called a stimulus package. \nWe have a roughly $13 trillion-plus economy. We are going to do a \nstimulus package probably of $140 billion, $150 billion--1 percent of \nour economy. I understand the Federal Reserve has taken substantial \naction, 75 basis points yesterday. That is a big deal for the Fed, and \nI understand why. It is to try to calm the nerves and say this country \nstands behind its economy, and we should. I believe in this country's \neconomy. This engine of opportunity and engine of growth is unusual in \nthe world. On this planet, we circle the Sun, and there are about 6.4 \nbillion neighbors, half who live on less than $2 a day and half who \nhave never made a telephone call, and we have the opportunity to live \nin this country. This is a wonderful place. We have built something \nunusual on this planet, but we have run into difficulty. No one seems \nto want to admit it, and we have to fix the fundamentals. Yes, we can \ndo stimulative packages, but if we don't fix the fundamentals, we will \nnot solve the problems for the future, we will not expand opportunity \nfor the future.\n  There is so much to say and so much to be concerned about, but there \nis so much hope for the future if--if--we understand that a stimulus \npackage is not our only responsibility. We have to fix trade and fiscal \npolicy, and regulatory responsibility. We need to begin regulating \nhedge funds and be concerned about the notional value of derivatives. \nIf we do not start doing that, we are not going to fix this issue, and \nwe are not going to have a better future.\n  I feel very strongly, if we do what is right, that we can provide \nsubstantial opportunity for this country, but the right things will \ninclude much more than a stimulus package.\n  Mr. President, I would like, in concluding my portion of morning \nbusiness, I would like to talk about the underlying bill on the floor \nof the Senate, that is the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  I spoke yesterday at some length, but I wish to again talk a little \nbit about why we are here and what all this means because I think it is \nso important. Some might say: Well, why is there an Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act? Why not a Norwegian or a Lutheran Health Care \nImprovement Act?\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act is designed that way, with \nthat name, for a very specific reason. This country, for a long period \nof time, told American Indians: Look, we are going to take your land, \nwe are going to force you to a reservation someplace, and we will write \na treaty for you. Our treaty is going to tell you we are going to take \ncare of your health care. We are going to meet our obligation. We have \na trust responsibility for you.\n  So we will take your land, we will move you off to reservations, but, \ntrust us, we are going to provide for your health care because that is \nour trust responsibility. Chief Joseph from the Nez Perce Tribe said:\n\n       Good words do not last unless they amount to something. \n     Words do not pay for dead people. Good words cannot give me \n     back my children. Good words will not give my people good \n     health and stop them from dying.\n\n  He was concerned long ago about the inability of this country to keep \nits word on these trust responsibilities. We are here today because, \nfinally, back in the early 1970s, President Nixon, President Ford, and \nevery President succeeding them understood we have a trust \nresponsibility for Indian health care. That is a fact.\n  In 1970, President Nixon noted we had 30 licensed Native American \nphysicians in all our country. Thirty. And we created back then a self-\ndetermination policy. In 1976, President Ford signed into law the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act. That is what we discuss today on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I spoke yesterday, and I wish to again briefly about the challenge. I \nhave held a lot of listening sessions on Indian reservations, and, \nfrankly, the challenges we face are daunting.\n  Indian reservations see unbelievable health challenges. On a good \nmany reservations, you will find one-half of the adult population who \nare suffering from diabetes. On the northern Great Plains, the rate of \ndeath from suicide among teenagers on Indian reservations is not double \nor triple, not 5 times the national average, but 10 times the national \naverage of teen suicide.\n  I have held hearings about that. I have sat down with Indian \nteenagers on an Indian reservation, no other adults present, to say: \nWhat is going on in\n\n[[Page S162]]\n\nyour lives? What is happening? What is causing those clusters of \nsuicides? There are so many problems of diabetes and suicide and so \nmany other issues on reservations, dealing with health care. Part of it \nis because this system is so dramatically underfunded.\n  I wish to mention Ardel Hale Baker. Ardel Hale Baker is a woman on an \nIndian reservation who allowed me to use her photograph. Ardel Hale \nBaker was having a heart attack, diagnosed as a heart attack at a \nclinic. She didn't want them to call an ambulance. The nearest hospital \nwas an hour and a half, hour and three-quarters away. She was lucky she \ngot to the clinic when it was opened because the clinic, I believe, is \nopen from 9 o'clock until 5 o'clock or 4 o'clock, with an hour closed \nfor lunch hour. It is not open on weekends, but that is the health care \non that reservation.\n  But she went there when the clinic was open. She was diagnosed as \nhaving a heart attack. She did not want them to call an ambulance \nbecause she knew that if the ambulance was not paid for by the Indian \nHealth Service, she did not have any money and it would ruin her \ncredit, because they would come after her.\n  So they said: No matter what you want, you are getting an ambulance. \nThey put her in an ambulance, drove her about an hour and three-\nquarters to the nearest hospital. As they unloaded this woman from the \nambulance gurney to a hospital gurney to pull her into the emergency \nroom, they discovered a piece of paper attached to her thigh with a \npiece of tape.\n  I want to show you the paper that was attached to the thigh of Ardel \nHale Baker as she was being wheeled into a hospital with a diagnosis of \na heart attack. This is from the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices. It is a letter attached to this woman's leg with masking \ntape. It says on the letter that: You should understand that you have \nreceived outpatient medical services from your doctor at so and so. And \nthis letter is to inform you that your priority one care cannot be paid \nfor at this time, due to funding issues.\n  What they were saying is, as they wheeled this Indian woman into the \nemergency room, they were saying to the hospital: Understand this. That \nwhatever care you give her is not going to be paid for, because we are \nout of contract health care funds.\n  On that reservation, everyone knows the refrain: Do not get sick \nafter June because they are out of contract health care funds. What \ndoes this do? Well, if they treat this woman, then they have a bill \nthat they go after this woman on. She does not have the ability to pay \nit. So it ruins her credit rating quickly, just like that. I cannot \ntell you the number of adults I have run into on these reservations who \nhave had their credit ratings ruined because contract health care would \nnot pay for health care.\n  They did not have the money. They were treated anyway, but then it \nruined their credit rating. This is an example of what is happening \nover and over. It is happening today, on Wednesday.\n  Yesterday, I spoke about a beautiful young woman named Ta'shon Rain \nLittlelight. I was on the Crow Reservation in Montana. And Ta'shon Rain \nLittlelight's grandmother stood up at a meeting on health care. And \nthis little 5-year-old girl, with the bright eyes and the beautiful \ntraditional dress, loved to dance at age 5. And she apparently was a \ngood dancer.\n  Ta'shon Rain Littlelight is dead. She lived the last 3 months of her \nlife in unmedicated pain. This little girl was taken again and again \nand again and again to the Indian health clinic. And she was treated \nfor depression. Depression.\n  At one of the visits, her grandparents said: Well, she has a bulbous \ncondition on her toes and her fingers which suggests maybe she is not \ngetting oxygen or something else is wrong, can you check? Treated her \nfor depression.\n  One day she was airlifted to Billings, MT, to the hospital. In \narriving at the hospital in Billings, MT, she was very quickly then \nairlifted to the Children's Hospital in Denver, CO, and diagnosed with \nterminal cancer.\n  Now Ta'shon Rain Littlelight was a 5-year-old child. She would not \nhave known the challenges of this issue of Indian health care. When \ndiagnosed with a terminal illness, she told her mother what she wanted \nto do was to go see Cinderella's castle. And the Make-A-Wish Foundation \nfolks made that happen.\n  A few weeks later, she was in Orlando, FL. The night before she was \nto see Cinderella's castle, in the hotel room, in her mother's arms, \nshe died.\n  And Ta'shon Rain Littlelight told her mother that night before she \ndied: Mommy, I will try to get better. Mommy, I am sorry I am sick.\n  This little girl lived in unmedicated pain with an undiagnosed \nillness for many months. Would that have happened in our families? \nWould it?\n  A woman goes to a doctor on an Indian reservation, with so much pain \nin her leg because her knee is bone-on-bone, unbelievable pain. And she \nis told: Wrap it in cabbage leaves for 4 days and it will be fine.\n  The doctor who subsequently treated her off the reservation said it \nwas unbelievable. This is the woman who had a knee condition with such \nunbelievable pain that any of us or our families would immediately have \nwanted to have a new knee, a replacement. But she was told to wrap it \nin cabbage leaves for 4 days and it will be okay.\n  Now, if I sound angry about what is going on, I am. Because this \ncountry has a responsibility to do better. We have a responsibility for \nhealth care for two special groups of people. One, Federal prisoners \nwhom we send, incarcerated, to Federal prisons because they have \ncommitted crimes. When they are in a Federal prison, it is our \nresponsibility for their health care, and we provide it.\n  We also have a responsibility because we promised and made a solemn \ntrust oath to provide health care for American Indians. We even signed \nthat into treaty after treaty. Now, all these years later, I find we \nare spending twice as much per person to provide health care for \nincarcerated Federal prisoners as we are to provide health care for \nAmerican Indians.\n  That is why Ta'shon Rain Littlelight loses her life or at least does \nnot have the kind of care and diagnosis we would expect for ourselves \nor our families or other Americans. That is why we have to fix it.\n  So having said all that I--I am sorry to go through it again--but I \nfeel so strongly that this Congress has to take responsibility. Having \nsaid all that, there is much we can do. We have put together a piece of \nlegislation that is 10 years too late. Ten years this Congress has \ndelayed in reauthorizing this bill.\n  Finally, we are on the floor of the Senate to reauthorize this bill. \nThis legislation is not perfect. It is a step forward, a step in the \nright direction. One of my colleagues will come and say: I demand \nreform. Well, he cannot demand it more than I demand it. But if you \ncannot get the first step done, how are you going to talk about reform \n10 years after this should have been done?\n  I am looking for amendments that can be brought to the floor that can \nstrengthen this. I am for those amendments. As soon as this passes, our \ncommittee is going to immediately begin a much broader reform of Indian \nhealth care.\n  But first and foremost, we have to move forward. We expand cancer \ndiagnosis and treatments, we expand the opportunities for dialysis, we \nexpand the opportunity for diabetes programs, we expand the \nopportunities to recruit doctors and nurses on Indian reservations. We \ndo a lot of things in this bill that advance the interests of Indian \nhealth care.\n  It is not all I would like to do, but it is a significant step \nforward, that will improve the lives of people who today are not \ngetting what was expected and what was promised by this country. This \ncountry has a responsibility to meet this, and I am determined, \nsomehow, someway, we are going to meet it.\n  It appears, toward the end of this afternoon, the majority leader has \nindicated we have to go to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nbecause we have a February 1 deadline on that. We likely will not get \nthis bill done by the end of this afternoon. We will then turn to FISA \nand work on FISA, I believe, perhaps today, tomorrow, perhaps Friday \nand Saturday, according to the majority leader.\n  But when the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is completed, the \nmajority leader told our caucus a bit ago, then we will pull this back \non the floor and finish this piece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S163]]\n\n  So I ask my colleagues to come to the floor with amendments. Let us \ndebate amendments, talk through amendments, improve this bill, if we \ncan. But most importantly, let us get to the end, get it passed and \nhave a conference with the House and, finally, after 10 long years, \nsend this to the President for signature.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are attempting, with the two \ncloakrooms, to notify offices of Senators that we would like very much \nto find a way to get a list of the amendments that are intended to be \noffered.\n  So if there are Senators who have amendments to this bill they intend \nto offer, we hope they would notify their cloakrooms so we can put a \nlist together. We would like to make some progress. I do know the \nRepublicans have an issues conference this afternoon, or perhaps all \nday. But I know they are now at an issues conference, I believe at a \nlocation on Capitol Hill. So I expect this bill will be carried over.\n  But if we can have some amendments offered this afternoon, still we \ncan debate these amendments, I would like to ask Senate offices if they \nhave amendments, notify the cloakrooms so we can put them on a list and \nhave some notion of what we need to do in order to get this bill \ncompleted.\n  My understanding is the Senator from Vermont wishes to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for \nwhat will be a relatively short while as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Foreign Intelligence Surveillance\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota is absolutely \nright. Having managed a number of bills, I know that sometimes it is \nhard to get people with amendments to come forth. I hope they do. Once \nthis bill is finished, we will go to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act or, as we know it here, FISA. It is intended to \nprotect both our national security and also the privacy and civil \nliberties of all Americans. We are considering amendments to that \nimportant act that will provide new flexibility to our intelligence \ncommunity. We all support surveillance authority. With terrorists \nplotting against us and talking about it, we want to be able to use all \nthe various electronic and other means to find out what they are \nsaying. Unlike some in the administration who say we are dealing with \nan antiquated law, we have updated this act many times, probably 30 or \nmore times since its historic passage after intelligence abuses of \nearlier decades.\n  I came here 34 years ago. I well remember that this Nation was still \nreeling from the excesses of the COINTELPRO when people were being \nspied on by their Government simply because they disagreed with what \nthe Government was doing; in this case, the war in Vietnam. We enacted \nFISA so we could do the legitimate thing of actually spying on people \nwho wanted to do harm to the United States at the time of the Cold War, \nwhen we had adversaries all over the world. We also wanted to make sure \nthat Americans who were minding their own business, not doing anything \nillegal, wouldn't be spied upon.\n  We rushed the so-called Protect America Act through the Senate just \nbefore the August recess and with it were a number of excesses. They \ncame about because the administration broke agreements it had reached \nwith congressional leaders. The bill was hurriedly passed under intense \npartisan pressure from the administration. In fact, the pressure was so \nstrong, they made it very clear why they were willing to break \nagreements with those Republicans and Democrats who had been working \ntogether to try to craft a bill that would protect America's interests \nbut also protect the privacy of individual Americans.\n  So we passed a bill that provides sweeping new powers to the \nGovernment to engage in surveillance, without a warrant, of \ninternational calls to and from the United States involving Americans, \nand it provided no meaningful protection for the privacy and civil \nliberties of the Americans who were on those calls. It could be an \nAmerican calling a member of their family studying overseas. It could \nbe a business person who, as they travel around to various companies \nthey represent, ends up having their telephone calls intercepted.\n  But before that flawed bill passed--the one that came about because \nof the broken agreements by the administration--Senator Rockefeller and \nI and several others in the House and Senate worked hard, in good faith \nwith the administration, to craft legislation that solved an identified \nproblem but, as I said, protected America's privacy and liberties.\n  Just before the August recess the administration decided instead to \nram through its version of the Protect America Act with excessive \ngrants of Government authority and without any accountability or checks \nand balances. They did this after 6 years of breaking the law through \nsecret warrantless wiretapping programs. It was one of the most \negregious things I have seen in my 34 years in the Senate. First they \nviolate the law, and then instead of being held accountable, they ram \nthrough a law designed to allow them to continue those actions. Some of \nus saw it for what it was and voted against it. Both Senators from \nVermont voted against it. We are from a State that borders a foreign \ncountry. We are concerned about our security, but we are also concerned \nabout our liberties and our privacy.\n  We did manage to include 6-month sunset in the Protect America Act so \nwe would have a chance to revisit this matter and do it right. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee, as well as \nour House counterparts, have spent the past month considering changes. \nIn the Senate Judiciary Committee we held open hearings. We had more \nbriefings than I can even count and meetings with the administration, \nwith people in the intelligence service, with people at the CIA, NSA, \nand others. We considered legislative language in a number of open \nbusiness meetings where Senators from across the political spectrum \ncould be heard. Then we reported a good bill to the Senate before \nThanksgiving.\n  The bill we are now considering will permit the Government, while \ntargeting overseas, to review more Americans' communications with less \ncourt supervision than ever before. I support surveillance of those who \nmight do us harm, but we also have to protect Americans' liberties. \nAttorney General Mukasey said at his nomination hearing that \n``protecting civil liberties, and people's confidence that those \nliberties are protected, is a part of protecting national security.'' \nLet me repeat what the new Attorney General said:\n\n       Protecting civil liberties, and people's confidence that \n     those liberties are protected, is a part of protecting \n     national security.\n\n  I agree with him. That is what the Judiciary Committee bill does. I \ncommend the House of Representatives for passing a bill, the RESTORE \nAct, that takes a balanced approach to these issues and allows the \nintelligence community great flexibility to conduct surveillance of \noverseas targets but also provides oversight and protection for \nAmericans' civil liberties. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nhas also worked hard. I know Chairman Rockefeller was as disappointed \nas I at the administration's partisan maneuvering just before the \nAugust recess. After being here through six administrations, it has \nalways been my experience, with Republican or Democratic \nadministrations at certain points, when you are negotiating a key piece \nof legislation with the administration, you have to rely on them to \nkeep their word and be honest with you, as they have to rely on you to \nkeep your word and be honest with them. Through six administrations, 34 \nyears, I can never remember a time where an administration was less \ntruthful or flatly broke their word in the way this one did.\n\n  I commended the efforts of Senator Rockefeller and those working with \nhim. I do so again now. I believe both he and I want surveillance but \nwe want\n\n[[Page S164]]\n\nsurveillance with oversight and accountability within the law. I also \nwant to praise our joint members. In the Judiciary Committee we have, \nby practice, a certain number of members who serve on both Judiciary \nand Intelligence for obvious reasons. The ranking member of Judiciary \nand I, of course, have access to a great deal of intelligence whenever \nwe have requested it, but that is on an ongoing basis.\n  Senators Feinstein, Feingold, and Whitehouse contributed so much to \nthe work of the Judiciary Committee. They worked with me to author many \nof the additional protections we adopted and reported. They had worked \non the bill in the Intelligence Committee and then worked with us. \nThese Senators and others on the Judiciary Committee worked hard to \ncraft amendments that will preserve the basic structure and authority \nproposed in the bill reported by the Select Committee on Intelligence, \nbut then they added those crucial protections for Americans, the part \nthe Judiciary Committee, because of our oversight of courts, worries \nabout.\n  I believe we need to do more than the bill initially reported by the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence does to protect the rights of \nAmericans. I know the chairman of that committee joins with me to \nsupport many of the Judiciary Committee's improvements.\n  Let me cite briefly what they are. The Judiciary bill, for example, \nmakes clear that the Government cannot claim authority to operate \noutside the law outside of FISA--by alluding to other legislative \nmeasures never intended to provide that authority.\n  I will give you an example of what happened. The House and the Senate \npassed an authorization for the use of military force. We did this \nright after September 11. It was authorization to go in and capture \nOsama bin Laden--the man who engineered 9/11, is still loose, and \ntaunts us periodically. But what happened? The administration was so \nhellbent on getting into Iraq that when they had Osama bin Laden \ncornered, they withdrew their forces and let him get away so they could \ninvade Iraq--a country that had absolutely nothing to do with 9/11. Now \nthey say that authorization allowed them to wiretap Americans without a \nwarrant. I have heard some strange, convoluted, cockamamie arguments \nbefore in my life. This one takes the cake.\n  I introduced a resolution on this in the last Congress when we first \nheard this canard. We authorized going after Osama bin Laden, but the \nSenate did not authorize--explicitly or implicitly--the warrantless \nwiretapping of Americans. By their logic, they could also say we \nauthorized the warrantless search of the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer's home or my home. This body did no such thing, but the \nadministration still is clinging to their phony legal argument.\n  The Judiciary bill would prevent that dangerous contention with \nstrong language that reaffirms that the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act is the exclusive means for conducting electronic \nsurveillance for foreign intelligence purposes.\n  The Judiciary Committee's amendment would also provide a more \nmeaningful role for the FISA court to oversee this new surveillance \nauthority. The FISA court is a critical independent check on Government \nexcess in the sensitive area of electronic surveillance. The \nadministration claims that of course the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance court can look at what they are doing, they just don't \nwant the court to be able to do anything about it. No. The Judiciary \nCommittee says the court should be able to look at what they are doing \nand should be able to stop them if they are breaking the law. In this \nNation we fought a revolution over 200 years ago to have that right.\n\n  With the authority of a majority of the Judiciary Committee members, \nI am going to offer a revised version of the Committee's amendment that \nmakes some changes to address technical issues and also to address some \nof the claims the administration has made about our substitute.\n  For example, in response to concerns raised by the administration in \nits Statement of Administration Policy, we have revised the exclusivity \nprovision to ensure that we are not overextending the scope of FISA. We \nhave also revised the provision concerning stay of decisions of the \nFISA Court pending appeal, the provision clarifying that the bill does \nnot permit bulk collection of communications into or out of the United \nStates, and a few other provisions.\n  I believe these revisions make the Judiciary Committee's product even \nstronger, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Now, in the bill we have a title I, a title II. Title II in the \nIntelligence bill talks about retroactive immunity. We do not address \nthat in the Judiciary Committee's bill, but I do strongly oppose the \nbill reported by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in that \narea. Their bill would grant blanket retroactive immunity to \ntelecommunications carriers for their warrantless surveillance \nactivities from 2001 through earlier this year. This surveillance was \ncontrary to FISA and violated the privacy rights of Americans.\n  The administration violated FISA for more than 5 years. They got \ncaught. If they had not gotten caught, they probably would still be \ndoing it. But when the public found out about the President's illegal \nsurveillance of Americans, the administration and the telephone \ncompanies were sued by citizens who believe their privacy and their \nrights were violated.\n  Now the administration is trying to get this Congress to terminate \nthose lawsuits. It is not that they are worried about the telephone \ncompanies. They are not as concerned about the telephone companies as \nthey are about insulating themselves from accountability.\n  This is an administration that does not want us to ask them anything, \nand they do not want to tell us anything. Interesting policy. If you do \nask them, they are not going to tell you. If they do tell you, it \nappears oftentimes they do not tell you the truth.\n  Now, the rule of law is fundamental to our system. It has helped us \nmaintain the greatest democracy we have ever seen in our lifetimes. But \nin conducting warrantless surveillance, the administration showed \nflagrant disrespect for the rule of law. It is like the King of France, \nwho once said: ``L'Etat, c'est moi.'' ``The state is me.'' They are \nsaying: What we want to do is what we will do. And if we want to do it, \nthe law is irrelevant.\n  I cannot accept that.\n  The administration relied on legal opinions that were prepared in \nsecret and shown only to a tiny group of like-minded officials who made \nsure they got the advice they wanted--advice that, when it saw the \nlight of day, people said: How could anybody possibly write a legal \nmemorandum like that?\n  Jack Goldsmith, who came in briefly to head the Justice Department's \nOffice of Legal Counsel, described the program as a ``legal mess.'' He \nis a conservative Republican. He looked at this and said: It is a legal \nmess. Now, the administration does not want a court to get a chance to \nlook at this legal mess. Retroactive immunity would assure that they \nget their wish and that nobody could ask how and why they broke the \nlaw.\n  Frankly, I do not believe anybody is above the law. I do not believe \na President is, I do not believe a Senator is, I do not believe anybody \nis.\n  I do not believe that Congress can or should seek to take rights and \nlegal claims from those already harmed. I support the efforts of \nSenators Specter and Whitehouse to use the legal concept of \nsubstitution to place the Government in the shoes of the private \ndefendants who acted at its behest and to let it assume full \nresponsibility for the illegal conduct.\n  Although my preference, of course, is to allow the lawsuits to go \nforward as they are, I believe the substitution alternative is \neffective. It is far preferable to retroactive immunity, and it allows \nthis country to find out what happened.\n  Keep in mind why we have FISA. Congress passed that law only after we \ndiscovered the abuses of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. Through the COINTEL \nProgram, Hoover spied on Americans who objected and spoke out against \nthe war in Vietnam--which pretty well involved 100 percent of the \nVermont delegation in Congress.\n  It is like the Department of Defense today that is going around \nvideotaping Quakers protesting the war. Quakers\n\n[[Page S165]]\n\nalways protest the war. But this administration seems to think, if you \ndisagree with them, somehow you are an enemy of the country and they \ncan justify spying on you. That is why we put these laws in place. Is \nmemory so short around here? Is memory so short or are we so frightened \nby 9/11 that we are willing to throw away everything this country \nfought for and everything that has made this country survive as long as \nit has?\n  We were told this building was targeted by terrorists. I proudly come \ninto this building every day to go to work. It is the highlight of my \nlife, other than my wife and my family. But I come in here because I \nbelieve 100 Members of the Senate can be the conscience of the Nation. \nWe can protect Americans' rights, we can protect those things that our \nforefathers fought a revolution for, that we fought a civil war to \nprotect, that we fought two World Wars to protect. Now we are going to \nthrow it away because of a group of terrorists? This is ``Alice in \nWonderland.''\n  So as we debate these issues, let's keep in mind the reason we have \nFISA in the first place. As I said, back in the 1970s we learned the \npainful lesson that powerful surveillance tools, without adequate \noversight or the checks and balances of judicial review, lead to abuses \nof the rights of the American people.\n  So I hope this debate will provide us with an opportunity to show the \nAmerican people what we stand for. We can show them that we will do all \nwe can to secure their future, but at the same time protect their \ncherished rights and freedoms. Those are the rights and freedoms that \nprotected past generations and allowed us to have a future. If we do \nnot protect them, what will our children and grandchildren have?\n  It is incumbent upon us to stand up for this country. When you stand \nup for this country, it does not mean jingoism, it does not mean \nsloganeering. It means protecting what is best for this country. If we \ndo that, the terrorists will not win. The United States of America \nwins. The people who rely on us around the world will win. Our example \nwill be one they will want to follow.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The FISA Bill\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I know that both chairmen, Senator \nLeahy of Judiciary and Senator Rockefeller of Intelligence, are coming \nto the floor to speak on the FISA bill. I wish to take this \nopportunity, as a member of both those committees, to speak about two \namendments I will offer when the time is appropriate. This is in \nmorning business and, therefore, I cannot offer them at this time.\n  The first amendment will deal with a new question, and that question \nis: court review of telecom immunity. Let me explain what that means. \nFirst, this amendment is submitted on behalf of Senators Bill Nelson, \nCardin, and myself. Senator Nelson is on the Intelligence Committee. \nSenator Cardin is on the Judiciary Committee. I have also worked with \nSenator Whitehouse on this, though I believe he is going in a slightly \ndifferent direction.\n  As Members know, the bill before us provides full retroactive \nimmunity for electronic service providers--that is the legal language--\nthat are alleged to have provided assistance as part of the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program. The amendment I am offering creates a judicial \nreview by putting forth the issue of whether immunity should be granted \nbefore the FISA Court. There would be no immunity for any individual, \nprivate or public official--that is in the underlying bill--or any \nother company other than electronic service providers.\n  So the immunity provision in the Intelligence bill only relates to \nthose providers of electronic surveillance--no one else and no other \ncompany. I hear talk this would apply to Blackwater. It does not. This \nis strictly for electronic surveillance.\n  The FISA Court has the most experience with FISA practice and \nsurveillance law. It has an unblemished record for protecting national \nsecurity secrets. It has 11 judges. They sit 24/7. It has an appellate \nbranch, and it is knowledgeable and skilled in intelligence matters.\n  Under the amendment, there would be a narrowly tailored three-part \nreview. First, the FISA Court would determine whether a \ntelecommunications company provided the assistance alleged in the cases \nagainst them. If not, those cases are dismissed.\n  Second, if assistance was provided, the court would determine whether \nthe letter sent by the Government to the telecommunications company met \nthe requirements of 18 USC 2511. That is part of the FISA law. If they \ndid, the companies would be shielded from lawsuits.\n  Let me tell you quickly what that law says. That law, in \n2511(2)(a)(ii)(A) and (ii)(B), allows for a certification in writing by \na person specified in section 2518(7) of this title--which means the \nAttorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, \nor by the principal prosecuting attorney of any State or subdivision \nthereof acting pursuant to a statute of that State who reasonably \ndetermines that a series of conditions are met: that an emergency \nsituation exists, immediate danger of death or physical injury to any \nperson, conspiratorial activity threatening the national security \ninterest or conspiratorial activities characteristic of organized \ncrime.\n  All those provisions, in one way or another, did exist. So a \ncertification in writing under section 2511 must be by one of the \npeople I enumerated, or by the Attorney General of the United States, \nand say that no warrant or court order is required by law, that all \nstatutory requirements have been met, and that the specified assistance \nis required. Then there are some provisions setting forth the period of \ntime during which the provision of the information, facilities, \ntechnical assistance is authorized, et cetera. That is the law.\n  So the question is: Were the certifications provided adequate under \nthis law that I have read? If they were, the companies would be \nshielded from lawsuits.\n  The third part is the hardest. In any case where the defendant \ncompany did provide assistance but did not have a certification that \ncomplied with the sections I have read in 2511, the FISA Court would \nassess whether the company acted in good faith, as is the standard \nunder common law. The FISA Court would determine whether the company \nhad an objectively reasonable belief that compliance with the \nGovernment's written request or directives for assistance were lawful.\n  In the underlying bill, all the cases against the phone companies \nwill be dismissed as long as the Attorney General can tell the court \nthat the Federal Government assured the companies that the assistance \nit was seeking was legally permitted. That is the way it works in the \nunderlying bill. Under this formulation, there is no court review of \nwhether the assistance was, in fact, legal and adequate under the law \nor whether the companies had an objectively reasonable belief they were \nlegal. This is a major shortcoming of any legislative or executive \ngrant of immunity.\n  I thought this when I voted for the immunity provision in \nIntelligence. I had hoped it would be revised in the Judiciary \nCommittee. I hadn't come upon this solution until I discussed it at \nlength with Senator Whitehouse and also with several professors of law \nand also with a Member of the House of Representatives. Then I thought, \nI wonder if this is a way to handle the immunity question that is fair \nand objective and handled by a court that is trained and deals with \nthese matters on a continuing basis. I believe it is.\n  There are many Senators who believe the immunity provision should be \ntaken out wholesale and that the current court case should continue. \nThat is why I have introduced this amendment with Senators Nelson and \nCardin, which puts before the Senate a court review option. This \namendment would allow phone companies to receive the immunity they are \nseeking, but only if the independent review by\n\n[[Page S166]]\n\nthe FISA Court determines whether the assistance that was provided is \nlawful on its face or the companies had a good-faith, objectively \nreasonable belief that it was in fact lawful.\n  The arguments run hot and heavy on both sides of the immunity \nquestion. They may well prevent the successful passage of a bill by \nboth Houses. Here is some history, though.\n  Shortly after September 11, 2001, the Government reached out to \ntelecommunications companies to request their assistance in what has \nbecome known as the terrorist surveillance program. Within 5 weeks of \n9/11, letters were sent from senior Government officials to these \ncompanies that put a governmental directive by the executive branch, \nand these letters were sent every 30 to 45 days to the telecoms, from \nOctober of 2001 to January of 2007, when the program was, in fact, put \nunder FISA Court orders.\n  Only a very small number of people in these companies had the \nsecurity clearances to be allowed to read and evaluate these letters or \ndirectives. And then even they could only discuss the legal \nramifications internally. They could not go out and get other opinions \nand vet it. That is a fact.\n  We also know that at the time the requests and directives were made, \nthere was an ongoing acute national threat. The administration was \nwarning that more attacks might be imminent, and we now know there was \na plot to launch a second wave of attacks against the west coast. In \nsuch an environment, I believe, and I think most of us believe, the \nprivate sector should help the Government when it is legal to do so. In \nfact, we should want the private sector to do all it can to help \nprotect our Nation.\n  In addition, there has been a longstanding principle in common law \nthat if the Government asks a private party for help and makes such \nassurances the help is legal, the person or company should be allowed \nto provide assistance without fear of being held liable.\n  One would think this should especially be true in the case of \nprotecting our Nation's security.\n  However, this is not a situation that had not been contemplated or \nprepared for. Congress passed FISA and included language in that \nstatute to address such situations regarding how and when the Federal \nGovernment may seek assistance from private companies when conducting \nelectronic surveillance, where there is no court warrant. Those are the \nsections I have read to you. In fact, the law is very clear on this and \nunder what circumstances a telecommunications company may provide such \ninformation and services to the Government, again, as I have indicated.\n  Assistance can always be provided when there is a court warrant. In \nthis case, unfortunately, the administration did not even attempt to \nget a FISA Court warrant. It essentially dismissed FISA out of hand as \na remedy. That is most unfortunate. The question comes, should the \ntelecoms be blamed for that? I think that is something we need to \ngrapple with.\n  The administration could have gone to the FISA Court. It chose under \nits article II power or its misinterpretation of the AUMF that it would \nnot do that. Is that the responsibility of the telecoms?\n  As I have said, under United States Code, title 18, section 2511, the \nsections I have read, assistance may be provided without warrant if the \nGovernment provides a certification in writing that ``no warrant or \ncourt order is required by law, that all statutory requirements have \nbeen met, and that the specified assistance is required.'' That is the \nlaw.\n  With that said, I have read the letters that were sent to the telecom \ncompanies every 30 to 45 days for several years requesting assistance \nand providing legal assurances. No one can say now with legal certainty \nthat the certification requirements of section 2511 were or were not \nmet. I believe this is a question that should be addressed by a Federal \ncourt, and I further believe that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt is the court to do it.\n  The administration has had its own view that article II of the \nConstitution provided the President with the authority to conduct \ninternational electronic surveillance outside the law, as long as it \ncomplied with the Fourth Amendment. To what extent the phone companies \nrelied on this legal theory I do not know, nor does anyone else at this \ntime, I believe.\n  But the companies have a reasonable argument. They relied on written \nassurances in which the Attorney General, the top law enforcement \nofficer of the country, said their assistance was lawful. They were not \nable to do due diligence because of security limitations. We have no \nway of knowing the full content of their deliberations regarding \narticle II authority of the President, despite testimony they have \ngiven to us on the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.\n  In addition, these companies face serious, potentially \nextraordinarily costly, litigation and are unable at the present time \nto defend themselves in court or in public because of the Government's \nuse of the state secrets defense. This places the companies in a \nfundamentally unfair place. Individuals and groups have made \nallegations to which the companies cannot answer, nor can they respond \nto what they believe are misstatements of fact and untruths.\n  I asked the companies, when somebody opposed to their position came \nto testify before a committee of the other body: Why don't you testify \nand respond? They said: Because our hands are tied; we cannot.\n  So today we are in a situation that creates a difficult and \nconsequential problem for Congress to address. The way Senator Nelson \nof Florida and Senator Cardin and I see this is that the question of \nwhether telecommunications companies should receive immunity hinges on \nwhether the letters the Government sent to these companies meet the \nrequirements of 18 U.S.C. 2511. If not, did the companies have a good-\nfaith reason to believe there was a lawful reason to comply? In other \nwords, we should not grant immunity if companies were willingly and \nknowingly violating the law.\n  I believe the best solution is to allow an independent court, skilled \nin intelligence matters, to review the applicable law and determine \nwhether the requirements of the law or the common law principle were, \nin fact, met. If they were, the companies would receive immunity. If \nnot, they would not.\n  I wish to briefly speak on the second amendment which I will broach \nat the appropriate time, and that is the question of exclusivity. This \namendment is cosponsored by both chairmen, Senators Rockefeller and \nLeahy, Senators Nelson, Whitehouse, Wyden, Hagel, Menendez, and Snowe. \nI will describe it briefly.\n  We add language to reinforce the existing FISA exclusivity language \nin Title 18 by making that language part of the FISA bill which is \ncodified in Title 50. The second provision answers the so-called AUMF, \nthe authorization to use military force, resolution loophole. The \nadministration has argued that the authorization of military force \nagainst al-Qaida and the Taliban implicitly authorized warrantless \nelectronic surveillance. My amendment states that only an express \nstatutory authorization for electronic surveillance in future \nlegislation shall constitute an additional authority outside of FISA. \nThis makes clear that only specific future law that provides an \nexception to FISA can supersede FISA.\n  Third, the amendment makes a similar change to the penalty section of \nFISA. Currently, FISA says it is a criminal penalty to conduct \nelectronic surveillance except as authorized by statute. This amendment \nreplaces the general language with a prohibition on any electronic \nsurveillance except as authorized by FISA by the corresponding parts of \ntitle 18 that govern domestic criminal wiretapping or any future \nexpress statutory authorization for surveillance.\n  And finally, the amendment requires more clarity in a certification \nthat the Government provides to a telecom company when it requests \nassistance for surveillance and there is no court order.\n  Remember, on the question of immunity, we have existing law. The law \nI read earlier is vague and it is subject to interpretation. The \nquestion is whether we do the interpretation or whether a proper \nauthority does the interpretation which, of course, is a court of law, \nnamely, in this case, the FISA Court.\n  Currently, certifications must say under 18 U.S.C. 2511 that all \nstatutory\n\n[[Page S167]]\n\nrequirements for assistance must be met. The telecom official receiving \nthat certification is not given any specifics on what those statutory \nrequirements are, so the company cannot conduct its own legal review.\n\n  This amendment would require that if the assistance is based on \nstatutory authorization, the certification must specify what provision \nin law provides that authority and that the conditions of that \nprovision have been met.\n  I believe our amendment will strengthen the exclusivity of FISA, and \nI believe it is absolutely critical. Without this, we leave the door \nopen for future violations of FISA.\n  When FISA was first enacted in 1978, there was a big debate between \nthe Congress and the executive branch over whether the President was \nbound by law. We have had a repeat of that debate over the past 2 years \nsince learning of the existence of the terrorist surveillance program. \nBut the end result of the debate in the 1970s was clear. FISA was \nestablished as the exclusive means by which the Government may conduct \nelectronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, period. FISA \nwas meant to be exclusive, and section 2511(f) of title 18 of the \nUnited States Code states that it is, in fact, the exclusive authority \nfor domestic criminal wiretapping and that ``the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act of 1978 shall be the exclusive means by which \nelectronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of such act, and the \ninterception of domestic wire, oral, and electronic communications may \nbe conducted for foreign intelligence purposes.''\n  The legislative history is clear--ignored, but clear. In stating that \n``FISA would prohibit the President, notwithstanding any inherent \npowers, from violating the terms of that legislation,'' the 1978 report \nlanguage was a clear statement of the intent of the Congress at that \ntime, just as this amendment is now.\n  Congress also wrote in 1978 that in terms of authority for conducting \nsurveillance, ``FISA does not simply leave Presidential powers where it \nfinds them. To the contrary. The bill substitutes a clear legislative \nauthorization pursuant to statutory, not constitutional, standards.''\n  President Carter signed the 1978 bill. His signing statement said \nthis:\n\n       This bill requires for the first time a prior judicial \n     warrant for all\n\n  In italics--\n\n     all electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence or \n     counterintelligence purposes in the United States in which \n     communications of U.S. persons might be intercepted.\n\n  So it is crystal clear on its face that FISA was the only legal \nauthority under which the President could proceed when he authorized \nthe ``Terrorist Surveillance Program'' after September 11. He chose not \nto. And this is where the issue becomes joined, I believe, one day \nbefore the highest Court of the land: whether the President's Article \nII power essentially still supersedes these clear statements of \nlegislative intent and clear drafting of law over many decades.\n  To make matters worse, the administration claimed and still does \nclaim that the resolution to authorize the use of force against al-\nQaida and the Taliban provided authority to institute the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program. It does not.\n  I do not know one Member of Congress who believes they voted for the \nTSP when they voted to authorize the use of force. It was never \ncontemplated, and I was present at many of those discussions, in \nprivate and in public. It was never considered.\n  In fact, FISA allows for 15 days of warrantless surveillance \nfollowing a declaration of war. So Congress in 1978 had spoken on the \nissue of wartime authorities, and it did not leave open the possibility \nof open-ended warrantless surveillance.\n  Then the Department of Justice came to the Congress in September of \n2001 with the PATRIOT Act. The legislation included numerous changes \nneeded to FISA to wage this new war, but the administration did not \nrequest changes that would allow the TSP, the Terrorist Surveillance \nProgram, to function lawfully. Nor did the administration express the \nlimitations on FISA surveillance that the TSP was created to overcome.\n  In effect, we have a claim from this administration, which has never \nbeen recanted, that the President has the authority to conduct \nsurveillance outside of FISA. We are spending enormous time and effort \nto rewrite FISA, but there is no guarantee that the President will not \nagain authorize some new surveillance program outside the law. That is \nwhy those of us who put this amendment together have taken so much time \nto write strong exclusivity language right into this law.\n  When I have asked the Director of National Intelligence about this, \nhe has said that with the new FISA authorities in this bill, the \nintelligence community wouldn't need to go outside of FISA. I would \nlike to find comfort in this response, but I don't, and that is why I \nam offering this exclusivity amendment.\n  The President does not have the right to collect the content of \nAmericans' communications without obeying the governing law, and that \nlaw is FISA.\n  I recognize the administration disagrees with me on this point. The \nWhite House believes the President's Article II authority allows him to \nconduct intelligence surveillance regardless of what Congress \nlegislates. I disagree.\n  However, we are not going to resolve that question. As I said, \nultimately it is for the Supreme Court to decide. But here now we must \nmake the strongest case that the only authority for electronic \nsurveillance is FISA, and we must again be as clear as possible exactly \nwhen FISA authorizes such surveillance.\n  That is our function under article I of the Constitution.\n  Let me say, however, despite the fundamental differences of views \nover separation of powers, this amendment has been carefully negotiated \nwith officials at the Department of Justice, the Office of the Director \nof National Intelligence, and the National Security Agency. The \nexecutive branch has not raised operational problems or concerns with \nthis language.\n  This exclusivity amendment will not affect ongoing or planned \nsurveillance operations. Of course, I should also say clearly that the \nexecutive branch does not support the language. They do not want FISA \nto be the exclusive authority. But, legislatively, that has been the \nintention of this Congress since 1978.\n  I have tried to perform my due diligence on this whole terrorist \nsurveillance program and the FISA issue since the news of the \nwarrantless surveillance broke in December of 2005. I have become \nconvinced that without strong exclusivity language such as provided in \nthis amendment, another Congress in the future will be faced with \nexactly the same thing we are now.\n  I will repeat what I said in December: I cannot support a bill that \ndoes not clearly reestablish the primacy of FISA. We took the first \nstep with very modest language in the Intelligence Committee. The \nJudiciary Committee passed very strong language, but unfortunately it \nhas not been added to the bill before us. Both committee chairmen have \ncosponsored this amendment, as well as the others I have listed. The \nDepartment of Justice and the intelligence community have thoroughly \nreviewed the amendment. There is no operational impact. I hope we end \nthe question once and for all whether the President can go around the \nlaw.\n  At the appropriate time, I will move this amendment, and I hope it \nwill be accepted by this body, as well as the court review of the \nimmunity amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this afternoon the Republicans have held \nan issues conference; in fact, I believe for most of the day. As a \nresult, they have not been here today to engage in discussion on the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act. I just finished speaking with \nSenator Murkowski, vice chairman of the committee. We talked about the \nbill. She has played a significant role as vice chairman in bringing\n\n[[Page S168]]\n\nthis Indian health care improvement bill to the floor. We both would \nlike those who have amendments to provide notice to us of their \namendments.\n  Our cloakrooms have asked for a list of amendments so that we may \nprocess them. It appears, based on what the majority leader indicated, \nthat we will at some point today, perhaps in the next hour or two, turn \nto the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The reason for that is, \nthere is a deadline of February 1 by which that Act has to be renewed. \nIt expires and we have to take action to renew it. It will be \ncontroversial and cause quite a debate. So what the majority leader has \nindicated is that he will turn to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, and we will be on that tonight, tomorrow, perhaps Friday and \nSaturday--who knows?--and that following completion of that, he will \nbring the Indian health care improvement bill back to the floor.\n  My appreciation to the majority leader, he is trying to balance some \ndifficult things. He, for the first time in 10 years, decided we should \ndo what we should have done in the last 10 years, and that is \nreauthorize Indian health care.\n  We have a scandal in Indian health care with full scale rationing. \nOnly 40 percent of health care needs are being met. We have people \ndying today on reservations because health care that we take for \ngranted for our families, many of us, is not being made available on \nIndian reservations. I thank Senator Reid for allowing us to come to \nthe floor and putting this in the schedule. When it is pulled from the \nfloor to go to FISA, it will be brought back next week or when FISA is \ncompleted. I appreciate that.\n  I notice my colleague from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, is here. \nSenator Johnson and I share the Standing Rock Sioux Indian reservation \nthat straddles our boundary of North and South Dakota. It is a large \nreservation. Both of us have been there many times. South Dakota has a \nnumber of other Indian reservations. Senator Johnson, as a member of \nthe committee, has done superb work with us to put this legislation \ntogether. I appreciate his help and his attention to what is an urgent \npriority for American Indians, to get the health care this country long \nago promised. We wrote it in treaties. We have a trust responsibility. \nThat responsibility is affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. Yet we have had broken promises and broken treaties. At long \nlast we must affirm our responsibility to say to Native Americans: It \nis our responsibility. We assumed that responsibility to provide decent \nand good health care, health care we can be proud of for Native \nAmericans. That is what this discussion is about.\n  Because I have seen my colleague from South Dakota come into the \nChamber, I did want to say a special thanks to him. I know my \ncolleague, Senator Murkowski, and other Republicans and Democrats on \nthe committee worked hard. We all worked together--it was bipartisan--\nin getting this bill to the floor. Senator Johnson, over a long period \nof time, has worked to make this day happen. Let me thank him for his \ngreat work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I am here to speak in favor of the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act. To the nine treaty tribes in my \nState, and hundreds of others around the country, this bill is truly a \nmatter of life and death. It is a sad fact that the six counties in \nAmerica with the lowest life expectancy are tribal counties in South \nDakota.\n  Poor health care affects not only life expectancy but also the \nquality of life for American Indians; it is also preventable. My office \ngets hundreds of calls from constituents needing help with even the \nmost basic needs that ought to be met by the Indian Health Service.\n  For example, Butch Artichoker from the Rosebud Sioux Tribe told my \noffice he did not want to have a cancer test because he would not be \nable to get contract health treatment from IHS if the test was \npositive. His situation is not unique.\n  Another man from Pine Ridge contacted my office after receiving the \nresults of a cancer test that showed his PSA levels were ten times \nabove normal. He could not get a referral for a treatment MRI because, \naccording to IHS, his cancer was not a priority one--threat to life or \nlimb.\n  I am a cancer survivor myself thanks to early screening and \ndetection, which are paramount for effective treatment. This is also \ntrue for mental health problems and many other treatable disorders. \nPassing this bill will not fix every health problem facing Indian \nCountry, but it is a major step that we need to take.\n  I returned from my own health challenges with a better appreciation \nof what individuals and families go through when they face the hardship \nof catastrophic health issues.\n  Providing better health care through IHS will serve not just American \nIndians but protect the overall public health network for my State and \nthe rest of the country.\n  IHS is a vital part of the patchwork of providers that serve our \nState and when one of these providers improves, the entire system \nbenefits. This is not just a tribal issue or an Indian bill, but a \nmoral issue for individuals and families as well as the integrity of my \nState and our country.\n  I thank Senator Dorgan for his leadership and persistence. I ask that \nmy colleagues quickly pass this bill, as these improvements to Indian \nhealth care are long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I rise in strong support of S. 1200, \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 2007, which will reauthorize, \nimprove, and expand necessary health care services and programs for the \nNative American population. I thank Chairman Dorgan and Ranking Member \nMurkowski of the committee for their leadership on this legislation. I \nalso thank my colleagues on the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus and \nRanking Member Grassley, for their leadership and contribution. The \nwork we have done in the last year and the debate we will have this \nweek is a debate that is long overdue.\n  It has been 16 years since Congress conducted a comprehensive review \nof the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, 16 years since we addressed \nthe persistent health disparities in Native American communities across \nthe Nation.\n  This bill is vital to millions of Native Americans across the \ncountry, including the 52,000 Native Americans who reside in my State \nof Colorado.\n  Colorado is home to two sovereign American Indian nations: the Ute \nMountain Ute Tribe and the Southern Ute Tribe. They are located in the \nsouthwestern part of Colorado. But as we must remember--and my \ncolleagues have alluded to this in this week's debate--the majority of \nNative Americans across this country, including in Colorado, do not \nlive on the reservations. In Colorado, members of 35 different tribal \nnations live in the urban, suburban, and rural communities of my State, \nfrom Durango to Denver.\n  It is hard for us in this Chamber and in America to overstate the \ncontributions of Native Americans to our economy, our society, our \nculture, and our history.\n  In my State, the Utes are the oldest known continuous residents of \nColorado. The earliest Ute tribes traveled along the eastern slope of \nthe Rocky Mountains before settling in Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico. \nIn western Colorado, they hunted, gathered, and worked the lands, often \nmoving with the seasons to better climates to better their \npossibilities of livelihood. The Spanish arrived in the Southwest--in \nColorado and New Mexico--in the late 1500s--in the 1630s and 1640s--and \nin the beginning, they became the trading partners for the Utes, \nexchanging tools for meats and fur.\n  What followed that chapter is a set of very sad chapters in Colorado \nand the United States. It was a set of sad chapters characterized by \nviolence, retaliation, and tragedy, much of it at the hands of the \nFederal Government.\n  Over the next few decades, under pressure from the Federal \nGovernment,\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\nthe Utes would enter into agreements to establish reservations, but \nthis included giving up very large sections of their land. While a \nsmall part of that land was ultimately returned to the Utes in the two \nreservations that were set up in Colorado and the one that was set up \nin Utah, the modern-day reservations are the result of various \nGovernment actions, encroachment by settlers, and mining interests that \nultimately limited the two tribes in Colorado to a small percentage of \nthe reservations that were originally contemplated for the Ute Indians \nbefore the existing reservations were established.\n  The issues confronting Native American communities today are \ninextricably tied to this history. The Federal Government's \nresponsibility to Native American communities is likewise tied to this \nvery difficult and painful history.\n  But this week, under the leadership of Chairman Dorgan, we hope to \nwrite another chapter into this history. We hope to take another step \ntoward making good on the Federal Government's promise to improve \nhealth care for Native Americans.\n  The health care statistics for Native American communities do not \nlie, and they are troubling. They should be troubling to all of us here \nin America. The infant mortality rate is 150 percent greater for Native \nAmericans than that of Caucasian infants. Native Americans are 2.6 \ntimes more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. Life expectancy for \nNative Americans is 6 years less than the rest of the U.S. population. \nSuicide rates--suicide rates--for Native Americans are 250 percent \nhigher than the national average.\n  The health care disparities we see throughout the country are also \nevident in my State of Colorado. In 2006--that was not too long ago--\n5.5 percent of Native Americans died from diabetes, more than twice the \nrate of the general population. In the same year, 3.9 percent of Native \nAmericans died from chronic liver disease, compared with 1.6 percent \nfor the general population.\n  For many Native Americans, access to health care is the biggest \nchallenge they face as human beings. I have heard countless stories of \nindividuals, Native Americans in my State, who are sick or are in pain \nand have to drive hundreds of miles to receive any kind of treatment. \nWhen they get there, after having driven sometimes 9 hours, they will \nfind that the clinic cannot provide them the treatment they seek. Those \nservices, they learn, are in hospitals located hundreds of miles away.\n  Access problems affect not only Native Americans on reservations that \nspan hundreds of miles but Native Americans living in urban areas as \nwell.\n  For the 25,000 Native Americans living in Denver, CO, today, there is \nonly 1 health care facility that is available to meet their health care \nneeds. That is the Denver Indian Health and Family Services facility. \nThis facility is funded by the Indian Health Service program through \nfunding allocated through title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct, which provides funding for urban health centers for Native \nAmericans.\n  The Denver Indian Health and Family Services began providing health \ncare onsite to Native Americans living in the Denver metro area in \n1978. The majority of its patients are single parents, making an \naverage of $621 per month--$621 per month. That is a total of \napproximately $7,400 a year. That is not a lot of money for any family. \nWhen a patient needs specialized treatment, however, they often have to \ntravel 6, 7, 8, 9 hours to places such as Rapid City, SD, or \nAlbuquerque, NM. This is a long trip for anyone, particularly if they \nare sick or injured.\n\n  The U.S. Government has a longstanding and solemn responsibility to \nthe Native American population of our country. That responsibility is \nset forth and recognized in treaties, statutes, U.S. Supreme Court \ncases, agreements, and in our U.S. Constitution. It is a trust \nresponsibility that flows from Native Americans' relinquishment of over \n500 million acres of land to the United States of America. Native \nAmericans see the reauthorization of this health care bill as part of \nthe U.S. Government living up to its end of the bargain with tribal \ngovernments. And they are right.\n  The disparities in health care between Native Americans and the \ngeneral population is a real problem, and it is one Congress has a \nresponsibility to address. I am proud of the bill we are considering \ntoday because it takes major steps toward reducing the health care \ndisparities that persist in Native American communities.\n  Although appropriations for IHS have traditionally fallen far short \nof the actual health care needed in Indian Country, the focus on \npreventive care in current reauthorization legislation will make more \nefficient use of the Indian Health Service's limited resources.\n  Difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified health \nprofessionals have long been recognized as a significant factor \nimpairing Native Americans' access to health care services. The \nprograms authorized in this bill will help recruit Native Americans \ninto the health care profession. Additionally, this bill provides for \nhealth education in schools, mammography and other screenings for \ncancer, and helps cover the cost of patient travel to receive health \ncare services. Additionally, this legislation removes barriers and \nincreases participation and access to Medicare and Medicaid Program \nbenefits.\n  Title V of this legislation would also fund programs in urban centers \nto ensure that health services are accessible and available to Native \nAmericans living in cities across the country, such as Denver, CO. Key \nprograms include immunization, behavioral health, alcohol and substance \nabuse programs, and diabetes prevention, treatment, and control.\n  In addition to reauthorizing and expanding existing programs, this \nlegislation will ensure that Native Americans are able to take full \nadvantage of new technologies and new Federal programs that have \nemerged since the last reauthorization, including Medicare Part D and \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program. Indian health programs \nshould work hand-in-glove with these new programs and new resources.\n  Native Americans in the United States of America deserve access to a \n21st-century health care system.\n  I again thank my colleagues, Senator Dorgan, the chairman of the \ncommittee, and Senator Murkowski, for their bipartisan leadership on \nthis very important legislation and for their tireless leadership for \nNative American communities across the country.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this bill. We need to get this bill \nto the President's desk as soon as possible.\n  In conclusion, as we look at the United States of America, we see an \nAmerica that is an America that has a covenant about being an America \nin progress. We see it in a number of different ways--in the ways which \nwe have treated women and other racial or ethnic minorities. But there \nis a sad and painful story to this America in progress that is \nparticularly poignant when you look at how we, as the United States of \nAmerica, have treated the Native American communities of our Nation. So \nthis is an issue in my mind that is a fundamental issue of civil \nrights. It is a fundamental issue we must resolve in order to be able \nto uphold this covenant of America that makes us an America in \nprogress.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Colorado, who \nis a strong voice for fairness and justice and for health care on \nIndian reservations. I appreciate very much his work and his relentless \ndetermination to help us get this done. I know he comes from a State \nthat has a good number of Indian tribes and that he has toured those \nareas and is very concerned about this issue.\n  Madam President, I want to, in just a couple minutes, show once again \na photograph of a man I showed yesterday during this discussion. His \nname is Lyle Frechette. Lyle Frechette, shown in this photograph, was a \nmember of the Menominee Tribe of Indians in Wisconsin. He came of age \nduring a time when there was what was called the ``termination and \nrelocation era of Indians.''\n  This picture of Lyle Frechette is a picture of a high school graduate \nwho was newly entering the Marine Corps to proudly serve his country. I \nshowed that photograph yesterday to describe\n\n[[Page S170]]\n\nthat there is no group of Americans that has served their country in \nthe military in larger numbers per capita than Native Americans--than \nAmerican Indians and Native Alaskans. There is just no group that has \nenlisted in higher numbers to support their country in our military. \nThis is a photograph of one of them. His experience, following his \nservice in the Marines, was the experience of so many Indians.\n  During the termination and relocation period, many of them were given \none-way bus tickets and told: You need to mainstream; you need to go to \na city someplace. They found they had limited opportunities in the \ncities. They lost their health care capability. It was a time that we \nare now not proud of in terms of public policy because it was the wrong \nthing to have done, particularly when we had promised a trust \nresponsibility, providing health care for Native Americans.\n\n\n                Spending Practices At Veterans Charities\n\n  Madam President, I wanted to show that photograph again because I \nwanted to say something else that is not on the topic of this bill but \nsomething I read last Friday which has bothered me ever since I read \nit. It deals with those such as Lyle Frechette and others who joined \nthe military and became soldiers for our country.\n  The Washington Post, last Friday, contained a story about a hearing \nthat was held the day before in the U.S. House of Representatives. It \nwas a hearing about spending practices at veterans charities.\n  There is an organization that has evaluated various charities that \nhave been established to provide assistance for veterans. That \norganization, the American Institute of Philanthropy--which is the \nleading watchdog group--said there are about 19 military-oriented \ncharities that manage their resources very poorly.\n  But let me describe what made my blood boil Friday morning when I \nread it. I was not aware of it. But Help Hospitalized Veterans--a tax-\nexempt organization--Help Hospitalized Veterans--an organization that \nis presumably going to collect funds from around the country to help \nhospitalized veterans-- it spent, according to the report, hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in donations that were to help wounded soldiers on \npersonal expenses instead for those who were running the organization. \nInstead of helping wounded soldiers as the title says--Help \nHospitalized Veterans--those who were running the charity were bathing \nthemselves in cash: a $135,000 loan to the fellow who runs the \norganization for a divorce settlement with his former wife; a $17,000 \ncountry club membership; a $1 million loan to Mr. Viguerie, the direct \nmail guru, for a startup initiative at his firm.\n\n  The second charity, the Coalition to Support America's Heroes--also a \ncharity designed presumably to help America's veterans--was \nfundraising, getting tax-exempt donations or tax-deductible donations, \nand they used a four-star general, retired Four-Star GEN Tommy Franks, \nto sign letters of solicitation asking for funds, and paid him $100,000 \nfor that. Now, I think Tommy Franks ought to explain to the Congress \nand ought to explain to veterans why a retired four-star general is \nbeing paid $100,000 to sign letters to solicit money to help veterans. \nI think GEN Tommy Franks has a lot of questions to answer, including a \nnumber of questions dating back about 4 years, from me and others. But \nI was very surprised that a charity is paying $100,000 to a retired \nfour-star general for allowing his name to be used to solicit funds \nfrom individuals across the country to help veterans.\n  The Help Hospitalized Veterans raised more than $168 million from \n2004 to 2006. They raised $168 million from 2004 to 2006, and they \nspent one-quarter of it on veterans. Let me say that again. They raised \n$168 million of tax-deductible contributions to an organization called \nthe Coalition--excuse me, this is Help Hospitalized Veterans--raised \n$168 million, and one-quarter of it went to help veterans; the rest \nwent elsewhere. That is unbelievable, just unbelievable. In this \nCongress--I hope the committee in the House that held these hearings \nwill continue, and I am now evaluating whether we can begin a series of \nsimilar hearings. I think that is equivalent to theft, and I hope very \nmuch that we will continue to apply heat to those who would use \nveterans' names in this manner. An organization that solicits $168 \nmillion and uses only one-fourth of it in support of veterans when \ntheir title is Coalition to Support America's Heroes--or I guess Help \nHospitalized Veterans, one of the two--one-fourth of the money is used \nto go to veterans, the rest of it is going for country club memberships \nand loans for divorce settlements. That is unbelievable to me. I hope \nvery much that both the House and the Senate will continue to \naggressively investigate these organizations, and I hope perhaps if we \nhave some hearings, we might ask retired GEN Tommy Franks to come and \nexplain to us why it is appropriate for him to accept $100,000 that \ncomes from tax-deductible donations in order to sign a letter \nsoliciting money that is presumed to be in support of veterans when, in \nfact, three-quarters of the money went elsewhere.\n  My colleague from Alaska has come to the floor, and I want to again \nsay it has been a pleasure to work with her. She is vice chairman of \nthe Indian Affairs Committee and has done a remarkable job. She, \nperhaps more than anyone in the 48 States and the mainland, has very \nunique issues in the State of Alaska, because the Native Alaskan \nvillages are remote and the health care issues that relate to them are \ndifferent, difficult, and unusual, and she has represented that \nsituation aggressively and relentlessly as we have tried to put \nlegislation together to address it. I thank her for the work she has \ndone, and I look forward to working with her. We will not apparently \nfinish this bill today, but we will get the bill back on the floor \nfollowing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and when we do--\nthe two of us have talked--we very much are intent on finishing this in \n1 day and getting to conference, getting the bill to the President, and \ngetting it signed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee \nfor his great cooperation on this very important issue. I know we had \nall hoped--certainly my constituents had hoped, and I think my \ncolleagues as well, as so many around the country who have been waiting \nyears--literally waiting a decade--for reauthorization of this Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act. We are pleased that we are on the floor. \nWe would like to see this moved through the process as quickly as \npossible. We understand the issues we have in front of us and what we \nhave to do in order to get this through, but I appreciate the great \nleadership of the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee and of so \nmany who have worked to advance this legislation.\n  I thank Chairman Dorgan for reminding all of us of the great \ncontributions we have had from so many of our American Indians, Alaska \nNatives, when it comes to serving our country. I think if you look at \nthe demographics and look at it on a per-capita basis, we see higher \nnumbers, certainly in Alaska, of our Alaska Natives serving in the \nmilitary than any other populations in the State, serving admirably \nover the years, whether they be the Eskimo Scouts or whether they be \nthe group serving from the National Guard which recently returned from \nKuwait.\n  I had an opportunity a couple of months ago to meet those Alaskans \nwho were returning. I met up with them in Camp Shelby and had an \nopportunity to talk to the men who were returning from Kuwait after \nwell over a year. They had been in the desert. Most of these soldiers \ncame from villages from around the State. There were some 80 villages--\ncommunities--that were represented amongst this particular unit. Many \nof them, when they returned back home to Alaska after coming from the \ndesert and going home to the snow, would be returning to very small \ntowns and very small villages that are not connected by any form of a \nroad system. During the winter months, you have connection because the \nrivers are now frozen and you can take a snow machine to get from one \nsmall village to another and hopefully out to a larger hub community. \nBut the reality is so many of these fine men who have served our \ncountry are going back to areas where health care options are very \nlimited.\n\n  Yesterday I had an opportunity to show my colleagues a couple of \npictures. There is one of the health clinic\n\n[[Page S171]]\n\nin Atka. We also had a picture of the health clinic in Arctic Village. \nAs you look at the pictures, you can see the health clinics are small \nand they are clearly broken down. They are older facilities. They are \nvery limited in terms of what they can provide. But this is what we \nhave out in these villages. These soldiers who are returning need to go \nto the VA for services. They don't have a VA out in Chevak. They don't \nhave a VA facility out there in Atka. They have the Atka Village Health \nClinic. This is a two-story clinic, so it is by all standards perhaps \nbetter than some of the others in some of our villages. But what we \nhave seen in a State like Alaska where access to care is so very \nlimited, is the IHS facility essentially ends up being the entity that \nwill provide for that level of care for that serviceman, for that \nveteran, because to get from Atka to Anchorage, to the Anchorage Native \nMedical Center, is costly. Sometimes the VA picks up the travel, \nsometimes not. It depends on your income eligibility. If there isn't \nany--if the Government is not there to pick up your costs, not only do \nyou have the cost of air travel, which can be upwards of $1,000 for \nyour roundtrip fare, but you have your expenses while you are in the \ncity--in town.\n  So we look at what is provided to so many in our small clinics around \nthe State. Now, is it right that the clinic should have to pick up or \nbasically carry the water or carry the bag for the VA? Not necessarily, \nno. But is this where we can provide for a level of care that is in the \nvillage for the individual, with their family, and ultimately reducing \nso many of the travel costs that are there? Absolutely. So I say this \nto my colleagues, so people can understand that oftentimes what we are \ndealing with in terms of access when you are in a State where it is so \nrural, where you don't have roads, or the cost to travel is \nprohibitive, we have to be more creative in how we provide for the \nlevel of care. In Alaska, we think we are being more creative with \nthat. But with the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act, it allows and facilitates greater sharing, greater \ncooperation, ultimately greater collaboration, that leads to greater \ncost savings.\n  I want to take a couple moments this evening--it has been mentioned \nby our colleague from Colorado, and certainly the chairman mentioned \nthe provision we have in the substitute amendment regarding violence \nagainst Indian and Alaska Native women. I mentioned in my comments \nyesterday that we have seen some successes in Indian health, even with \nthe very stark health statistics that have been repeated by so many on \nthis floor. There is one area, though, where I do not believe we have \nmade any progress, and one I am very pleased we are addressing in this \nbill, and that matter is the terrible violence that faces native women \nand children.\n  Back in September of 2007, the Committee on Indian Affairs held an \noversight hearing on the prevalence of violence against Indian women. \nWe had several witnesses, very compelling witnesses, at that hearing, \none of whom was from Alaska, a woman by the name of Tammy Young, and \nshe represented the Alaska Native Women's Coalition Against Domestic \nViolence and Sexual Assault. She testified about the intensity of such \nprevalence and the need for remedies to properly address the problem.\n  In my State, we have one major city. Anchorage holds about almost \nhalf the population of this State. The Alaska Native people make up 8 \npercent of the total population of Anchorage. But the percentage of \nAlaska Native victims in Anchorage alone was 24 percent. You can see \nthe disparity in these numbers. Alaska has one of the highest per-\ncapita rates of physical and sexual abuse in the Nation.\n  In Alaska, an Alaska Native woman has a likelihood of rape that is \nfour times higher than a nonnative woman in the State. Our statistics \nare horrendous. They are deeply troubling. But we know it is not only \nin Alaska that there is this danger of violence that faces our Native \nwomen. Statistics show that Native women around the country are two to \nthree times more likely to be raped than women from other populations \nin the United States. As I say, in Alaska it is four times higher. But \neven if this fact were not as disturbing as it is, it gets even worse \nbecause so many of these women who have had this violence upon them \nalso face the prospect that the rapist may not be brought to justice.\n  This is for a variety of reasons. At the hearing we had a witness \nindicate that the health services within the Native communities simply \nlacked the proper infrastructure, the proper resources, to even conduct \nthe forensic exams and therefore assist in the prosecution of the \nperpetrators. It is as simple as not having rape kits available in the \nIHS facilities in that village or that community on that reservation, \nsimply not having the forensic equipment, not having it there. Why \ndon't you have it there? It is a funding issue apparently. But you have \na situation where you have a woman who has been violated. She comes \nseeking help, and she can't even have a proper exam so they can collect \nthe evidence so she may then go on and try to prosecute the \nperpetrator.\n  In addition, it is the training. We simply do not have enough who are \ntrained in the proper collection of the evidence. Back in 2005, we in \nCongress passed aggressive programs and services for the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA. The \nwitnesses who were there at the hearing back in September advocated \nthat we build on the foundation of VAWA. That is what this legislation \ndoes. It provides for just that. It includes programs to address \ndomestic and sexual violence that are critical to shoring up this \nhealth infrastructure, that are necessary to support a successful \nprosecution, whether it is providing for rape kits at the Indian \nclinics and hospitals or the training for the health professionals to \nbecome the sexual assault examiners. Pretty basic stuff. But if you \ndon't have it there, if you cannot collect the evidence, if you don't \nhave the trained medical professionals to help facilitate that, these \nvictims will be victimized again by simply knowing that the system has \nlet them down.\n  In addition, the legislation will also require the Secretary of HHS \nto establish protocols and procedures for health services to victims of \nviolence, as well as to coordinate with the Attorney General in \nidentifying areas for improvement within the health system to support \nthese prosecutions. I believe this aspect of the legislation is \nextremely important for so many. Again, our statistics in this area are \ndevastating, unacceptable. There is more we can do about it, and this \nis one small step.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about one aspect of the Indian health \ncare reauthorization. I don't believe many of my colleagues have spoken \nto the underlying policy of self-determination and self-governance, but \nthat is such an integral part of this reauthorization. The Federal \npolicy of self-determination was conceived by President Nixon in the \nearly 1970s, and it has been nurtured or improved upon by almost every \nadministration since then. The legislation, S. 1200, embraces these \npolicies in a very profound manner.\n  Indian self-determination represents one of our Nation's first \nenlightened Federal Indian policies. It has been by far the most \nsuccessful policy in improving the lives of American Indians and Alaska \nNative people. This policy has been embodied in Federal legislation for \nover 30 years in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance \nAct.\n  S. 1200 facilitates the important interplay between the Indian health \ncare delivery system within the Department of Health and Human Services \nand the policy of Indian self-determination and self-governance. \nBeginning in the 1990s, there were a growing number of Indian tribes \nand Alaska Natives who have taken over the IHS programs. They have made \nthem more efficient and responsive and, I would say, more relevant to \nthe local needs.\n  In Alaska, I think we can point to what has happened in the area of \nself-governance as a good example, a positive example of how the Native \npeople have embraced this policy of self-determination and self-\ngovernance.\n  In April 2003, the Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on an \nearlier version of this bill. We had a gentleman there from Seldovia \nVillage, President Don Kashevaroff. He testified about how Alaska \nNatives began compacting IHS programs in 1997 and how, within 6 years, \nthey had compacted virtually all of the IHS programs within the State \nof Alaska.\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\n  Now, within my State, the Indian health care system is almost \nentirely a Native-driven system. Senator Stevens, my colleague, spoke \nto this in his comments on the Senate floor yesterday. When you take \ninto account that in Alaska there are about 230 separate Native \nvillages, you manage the numbers there, and despite this large number \nof separate sovereign governments spread out across a State with \nenormous distances from each other, spread out from the State's \nmetropolitan area, they were able to create a highly efficient and \nintegrated health care delivery system.\n  I showed you the pictures earlier of the clinics in Arctic Village. \nBehind me in the photo is the Alaska Native Medical Center, located in \nAnchorage. Quite different. Yet what we have there in Anchorage at the \nANMC is a model for others to view. In Alaska, we have 180 small \ncommunity health centers, about 180 of what you saw with the Arctic \nVillage clinic, and they provide primary care. We have 25 subregional \nmidlevel care centers. There are four multiphysician health centers, \nsix regional hospitals, and one tertiary care facility. The Alaska \nNative Medical Center in this picture is that one tertiary care \nfacility. So in the entire State, the Alaska Native Medical Center is \nthe one that provides that tertiary care.\n  This system was made possible through the Indian Self-Determination \nAct. This health care system is tailored to meet the very unique needs \nof the Native people. I don't believe it would have been possible \nwithin the administrative structure of the Indian Health Service \nitself.\n  Now, I don't want to spend all my time just talking about the \nsituation in Alaska because the success story that you see there is by \nno means limited to my State. Self-governance is being embraced in \nseveral other areas of the country as well: in the Pacific Northwest, \nthe Southwest, in Oklahoma, and in other parts of the country. I think \nit is important to note that many tribes and tribal organizations have \nsupplemented their IHS programs with their own resources where \npossible. The Indian Health Service has documented the fact that \nFederal Indian health programs are only meeting approximately 60 \npercent of the need. You have heard that time and time again as we have \ndiscussed this. Only about 60 percent of that need is met.\n\n  The hearings on Indian health held by the committee and information \nfrom a 2005 GAO report demonstrated that this underfunding has led to \nrationing health care within the Indian community. Of course, the \nunfortunate result of this underfunding is exactly as you have heard \nmany of my colleagues say. It results in many American Indians either \nforegoing any kind of treatment or delaying receiving medical care, \nwhich in turn, then, leads to disease progression. But ultimately it \nleads to higher costs, greater costs to the system.\n  I want to point out that several tribes have stepped up with their \nown resources to enter joint ventures with the Federal Government or to \neven supplement the Federal dollars in an effort to bridge that 60 \npercent gap we keep talking about between the Federal funding and the \nlevel of need. I want to show a few of the examples.\n  In the Cherokee Nation in Northeast Oklahoma, we have a self-\ngovernance tribe with one of the largest service populations in the \ncountry. The Cherokees have just constructed a new clinic in Muskogee, \nOK, using their own tribal dollars. This facility serves Indian people \nin northeastern Oklahoma, including members of the Osage, Muskogee \nCreek, Choctaw, and numerous other tribes.\n  We also have the Muckleshoot Tribe in Auburn, WA, which built this \nfacility in 2005 at a cost of nearly $20 million using its own tribal \ndollars. The Muckleshoot facility is located near the I-5 corridor in \nWashington and also provides very tailored care for its patients. As \nyou can see from the picture, they try to cater to some of the younger \npatients as well.\n  Another Oklahoma tribe in southeastern Oklahoma is the Choctaw \nNation, which used their own tribal dollars to construct a 54,000-\nsquare-foot facility at a cost of $13.5 million. In this facility the \naverage monthly patient encounter over the past 12 months has been over \n3,800 patients.\n  Out in Oregon, located in Chiloquin, we have the Klamath Tribe Health \nCenter built in 2004, paid for through a unique partnership between the \nKlamath Indian Tribe and the IHS, as a health center that primarily \nserves the Klamath Tribe. It serves a tribal population of 2,890 \nindividuals and cost $3.6 million to construct.\n  The last one I want to share with you comes out of Bylas, AZ, and the \nSan Carlos Apache Tribe has constructed this two-building complex on \nits reservation, which is about 130 miles east of Phoenix. As the main \nsource of primary care for Indians there, this clinic provides dental, \nbehavioral health, optometry, laboratory, pharmacy, health education, \nand preventive care, among other services.\n  I use these examples to demonstrate some of the many cases where \ntribal ingenuity and resourcefulness have changed the Indian health \ncare system for the better. I think this is illustrative of what can \nhappen when the tribes are given the flexibility to plan, to develop, \nand to determine the future for their own people. We promote that \ningenuity in this bill through the amendment to the Indian Self-\nDetermination Act, which will make it possible to bring private sector \nmoney into Indian communities to supplement--again, I repeat \n``supplement,'' not supplant--the Federal resources that are \nappropriated by Congress.\n  S. 1200 establishes the Native American Health and Wellness \nFoundation, the primary purpose of which will be to support the mission \nof the Indian Health Service by supplementing the Federal resources \nwith private funds and, hopefully, bringing the level of funding for \nIndian health care closer to that level of need.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks this afternoon by repeating \nthat within the Indian health system, you have great disparity. You \nhave seen some of the pictures of beautiful facilities and some \npictures of facilities that are in desperate need of help. We have \nheard stories that just break your heart of people who were denied \nservices, of people whose illness was only compounded because of \nfailures within the system.\n  But we have also heard some statistics that give us cause for hope \nthat we are making headway within the system in terms of some of the \nchronic diseases and how we might approach them. Through the Indian \nhealth care reauthorization, we focus on those areas that will allow us \nto do better, whether it is in the area of behavioral health, \nadditional screenings, those programs that focus on prevention, those \nprograms that focus on wellness, so that we can, A, lower our cost of \nhealth care but, B, to really allow American Indians and Alaska Natives \nto have a quality of health care that is at least on par with what you \nwould get if you went to a non-IHS facility.\n  We have not advanced legislation that would update the Indian Health \nCare Act since 1992. As I have said, all one needs to do is think back \nto what we were doing in 1992 in terms of health care. Think how far we \nhave come with the technology. Think how far we have come with the \ntechniques that are utilized. Let's not leave the Indian health care \nsystem 10, 20 years ago. Let's allow them to come into a level of \nservice that we care to enjoy.\n  I mentioned one way we in Alaska are able to deal with the issue of \naccess. In a large State with a small population who are not connected \nby roads, we have to rely on telehealth. Telemedicine has allowed us to \nprovide for a level of care, whether it is checking out an infant's ear \nto make sure how bad that ear infection is or whether it is literally \nvideoconferencing with a suicidal teenager and counseling to make sure \nhe is not going to do something precipitous, that he knows he has \nsomebody who is there for him. Our technology allows us to do that, but \nour legislation needs to be put in place to allow us to take full \nadvantage of the changes in these intervening years.\n  Again, I stand with my colleague, the chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, and urge our colleagues, if they have amendments, if there \nare still issues outstanding, let's work through those, let's get the \namendments, but let's work through any remaining issues. We owe it to \nall our constituents around the country to provide for a better level \nof care.\n  With this legislation, it is one small step forward.\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \njoin with the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from North Dakota to \nurge our colleagues to support this legislation that is going to make a \ncritical difference to thousands of American Indians in Washington \nState and across our country.\n  I join in the words of my colleague, the Senator from Alaska. She \nmentioned several of the tribes in Washington State. This has an \nimportant impact on them. I agree with her and thank her for the \ntremendous work on this issue, helping us bring it to the floor and \nhopefully to passage so we can make a difference.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act. It does reauthorize and update the health care \nservices our Government provides to American Indians and Alaska \nNatives. This bill will allow our Indian health clinics and our \nhospitals to modernize their services and enable them to provide better \npreventive care. These services are vitally important in Indian \nCountry, where our tribal members suffer from high rates of diabetes \nand other chronic illnesses. Our Government has a legal responsibility \nto provide health care for American Indians, but we have a moral \nresponsibility to ensure we provide the best care possible.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act has not been reauthorized \nsince 1992, and in the years since it expired in 2001, what Congress \nhas done is simply appropriate money for health care programs without \nexamining this act to see how we can improve it. This bill we are now \nconsidering takes important steps toward ensuring we are providing the \nbest and the most cost-effective care. It is long time past to pass it.\n  The health disparity between American Indians and the general \npopulation is great. The numbers show why this bill deserves our \nattention now. The infant mortality rate among Indians is 150 percent \ngreater than for Caucasians. Indians, in fact, are 2.6 times more \nlikely to be diagnosed with diabetes. Indians suffer from greater rates \nof post-traumatic stress disorder, and the suicide rate among Indians \nis more than twice the national average. In fact, life expectancy for \nAmerican Indians is nearly 6 years less than the rest of the U.S. \npopulation.\n  An example from my home State of Washington helps to illustrate the \nimpact these numbers have on Indian communities.\n  Three years ago, in a 6-month period, the Skokomish Tribe, which has \na reservation near Hood Canal, lost 9 of its 1,000 members. Among them \nwere two children, two young adults, and five elders. One of those \nelders was Bruce Miller. He was a Vietnam veteran and a nationally \nknown artist and spiritual leader. Bruce helped restore ceremonies that \nwere once banned by the U.S. Government. His work to prevent drug abuse \nand rebuild tribal customs will be sorely missed. Bruce was only 60 \nyears old when he passed away.\n  Many of the Skokomish Tribe members died of conditions that are all \ntoo common on our Indian reservations--drug overdose, heart disease, \ncancer, diabetes. These conditions we know are preventable, and many in \nIndian Country have been working very hard to reverse the numbers I \nmentioned. But their work has been hindered because Indian health \nservices are badly in need of updating.\n  The most important thing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act does \nis help to modernize those services. In the last 16 years, as the \nSenator from Alaska said, we have revolutionized the way we approach \nchronic illnesses such as diabetes. Doctors' offices and health clinics \naround the country now emphasize the importance of eating right, \nstaying healthy. We have changed where we provide services. Instead of \ntreating elderly and chronically ill patients in the hospital, more and \nmore people get care at home or in a community clinic. And now, of \ncourse, it is standard practice to coordinate mental health and \nsubstance abuse and domestic violence prevention services. But while we \nhave done all that, health care for Indians has gone badly out of date. \nWe are still providing services today as if it was 1992.\n  The bill we are considering today will help bring health care for \nIndians into the 21st century and enable their clinics to do more than \ntreat symptoms and instead focus on prevention and mental health.\n  It is particularly important to ensure Indian health clinics can \nprovide up-to-date care because for many of our tribal members, those \nclinics are the only source of health care available. For tribal \nmembers in rural Washington State and across the West, visiting a \ndoctor off the reservation often means driving for hours to get to the \nnearest big city. In some of our remote areas, some tribal members \nnever see a doctor off the reservation. They are born in Indian \nhospitals, they see that doctor for their entire life, and they die in \nthe same hospital.\n  This bill also funds urban Indian health clinics. In recent years, \nPresident Bush and some of my colleagues have questioned the need to \nprovide health services to Indians who live in and around major cities. \nIn fact, disappointingly, the President's budget routinely eliminates \nfunding for the 34 urban Indian health centers that exist in this \ncountry, and every year Congress restores the funding because those \ncenters serve thousands of Indians, many of whom are uninsured and \nwould not get care elsewhere. The doctors and the nurses who staff \nthose urban clinics specialize in the conditions many Indians face. \nEven more importantly, they are sensitive to the cultural needs of \ntheir patients. That makes the difference all too often when a patient \nis deciding whether to seek care or to do preventive treatment and it \nincreases the chance that an Indian will continue to get the treatment \nthey need, as I said, for preventive or even mental health care.\n  I am disappointed Republican objections have limited how far the \nimportant improvements for urban Indians in this bill can go, but this \nbill, as now written, does ensure those important health centers stay \nopen. My State has two of them. I have to tell you, I have heard \nfirsthand from a number of our tribal members how important and \ncritical they are.\n  Both our urban and our rural Indian health clinics also give tribes \nmore decisionmaking power over health programs so they can determine \nhow best to serve their people. In Washington State, we have the \nNisqually Health Clinic that is located near Olympia. It offers a \ncommunity health representative program that trains the tribal members \nabout how to provide basic preventive care and education to help their \nelders and members who suffer from diabetes or substance abuse.\n  We need to give programs such as those a boost so they can grow and \nthey can succeed so other tribes can try similar programs. \nReauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act will help us to do \nthat.\n  Finally, this bill also makes important improvements to the medical \nbenefits provided to tribal veterans. Tribal veterans, as many of my \ncolleagues know, have served throughout this Nation's history with \ngreat honor and valor. In fact, American Indians have served in higher \nnumbers than any other ethnic minority in this Nation. But despite that \nextraordinary commitment to this Nation, veterans services for American \nIndians oftentimes falls short of what is available for non-Indians.\n  Fortunately, this bill we are considering changes current law to \nallow the Secretary to enter into or expand arrangements to share \nmedical facilities and services with the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. That provision requires consultation with the affected Indian \ntribes before entering into those agreements, and it requires \nreimbursement to the IHS, tribes or tribal organizations.\n  I wish to repeat something I said earlier because it is important. \nProviding health care to Indians is part of our Government's trust \nresponsibility. It dates back to the 18th and 19th centuries. Congress \nenacted the Indian Health Care Improvement Act in 1976 to better carry \nout that duty. In President Ford's signing statement, he said:\n\n       Indian people still lag behind the American people as a \n     whole in achieving and maintaining good health. I am signing \n     this bill because of my own conviction that our first \n     Americans should not be last in opportunity.\n\n  Thirty-two years later, we still have a long way to go toward \nachieving that\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\ngoal, but we can take some important steps by reauthorizing this bill \nnow.\n\n\n                   Housing and Emergency Preparedness\n\n  While I have the floor this afternoon, I wish to change gears and \ntalk about two other issues I heard a lot about at home--housing and \nemergency preparedness--because I am hearing now disturbing rumors that \nthe President's upcoming budget proposal is going to recommend cuts in \nthose two areas.\n  First, I wish to emphasize how important it is we continue to provide \nFederal support for police, fire, and emergency responders in all our \ncommunities. This past month, I held several roundtables with our first \nresponders in Washington State to hear what they need to protect their \ncommunities, and at every stop, they told me they have already been \nsqueezed by budget cuts and that they have spent the last several years \ntrying to do more with a lot less. They said they are very worried \nabout what it will do if their budgets are cut again.\n  Emergency responders in our small and rural communities are \nespecially concerned because they depend on Federal grants to keep \ntheir communities safe. Let me give one example of the impact these \ngrants have had in my State that I think illustrates why Federal \nsupport is so important.\n  A month ago, storms causing major flooding and wind damage slammed \ninto western Washington. Thousands of our homes on the coast and in the \ninland counties were flooded and damaged severely. Grays Harbor County, \nwhich sits along the Pacific coast, was one of the hardest hit. But \nGrays Harbor emergency officials told me they were ready because they \nhad recently done exercises to practice emergency response training.\n  When those horrendous storms hit, first responders in Grays Harbor \nCounty relied on vital equipment, basic radio and other safety gear. \nWithout that training, without that equipment, more people in Grays \nHarbor would have been hurt in that storm. Grays Harbor had both of \nthose thanks to Federal homeland security grants.\n  From the flooding in Washington State to Hurricane Katrina, to \nCalifornia wildfires, we have had too many opportunities now to witness \nthe need for effective predisaster planning and response support. Real \nsecurity in our communities does not come cheap.\n  Now, I have already written to President Bush to warn him against \ncutting money for port security, transit security, and emergency \nmanagement grants. I am prepared to fight for these grants. Supporting \nand protecting Americans here at home has to be a priority for all of \nus.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  When I was home, I also heard from citizens and lenders, housing \ncounselors, people involved in the housing issues in Washington State \nwho are very concerned about the potential cuts to housing grants they \nare hearing about.\n  Washington State is fortunate that the economy is still relatively \nstrong compared to the rest of the Nation. But we are seeing signs of \ntrouble. In fact, I heard from a housing official who worked in Kitsap \nCounty, one of our more rural counties. She has seen a dramatic \nincrease in the number of people who are now seeking housing \ncounseling. She told me that last fiscal year, their two full-time \nhousing counselors helped homeowners with 50 defaults. They saw that \nmany people in this first quarter alone. In fact, in the 2 days she was \nwith me and others talking about housing, she said she went back home \nand there were seven more calls on her answering machine about \nforeclosures.\n  The Federal Government has to do everything possible to address this \nwave of foreclosures. One way we can do that is investing in housing \ncounseling. It is vital for troubled mortgage holders to get help early \nso they can avoid foreclosure and keep their homes.\n  At a time when we are trying to work to help repair the economy and \nensure people can pay their bills, we cannot afford any cuts in our \nbudget for that safety net for our homeowners.\n  We also have to ensure that low-income Americans who are not \nhomeowners also get help. That means we have to continue to support \nprograms such as Section 8, homeless assistance, and CDBG, which will \nhelp keep our communities strong through this and help make sure our \nlow-income residents have a home and can avoid homelessness.\n  Next month, when we get the President's budget sent to us, you can \ncount on me, I will be scrutinizing every word of it, and I will be \nback on this floor, if necessary, to fight funding cuts to those \nprograms that are so important to keeping our communities strong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                     Honoring Pennsylvania's Troops\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue which \nis on the minds of millions of Americans, but you would not know about \nit from listening to the news.\n  Most of the news has been focused, appropriately so I think, on the \neconomy and the challenges we face. We are all going to be focusing on \nthat issue and we are going to be talking a lot about it and taking \naction on it.\n  But at the same time, the war in Iraq remains an urgent issue for our \ncountry but especially for the families who are living through this, \nthe small percentage of American families who have someone serving in \nIraq, a loved one, a relative, and also, of course, the troops \nthemselves who are serving.\n  So Iraq, the war in Iraq, remains an urgent issue, an issue that \ndeserves our attention and our continued focus. Today I do not want to \ntalk about the policy. We are going to have months and months to talk \nabout it. I have strong feelings about it, but today I rise for a very \nsimple but I think important reason and that is to salute the troops \nfrom the State of Pennsylvania who have recently died in the war.\n  In July, I came to the floor to talk about the then 169 Pennsylvania \nnatives, in some cases residents, who had died in Iraq. Today, \nunfortunately, I have to add nine more since July. We all know a lot of \nthe lyrics of the great singer and songwriter, Bruce Springsteen. I \nquoted them last summer when I talked about the lyrics from his song \n``Missing,'' where he talked about, in the context of 9/11, those who \nhad perished and the effect on a family.\n  His lyrics say, in part, he talks about waiting for that person to \ncome home, the person who would have lost their life at the tragedy of \n9/11. He says: Your house is waiting. Then he repeats it. He says: Your \nhouse is waiting for you to walk in, but you are missing.\n  He says: You are missing when I turn out the lights, you are missing \nwhen I close my eyes, you are missing when I see the sunrise.\n  And he goes on from there. I think that song and those lyrics have an \nawful lot of meaning for those who have lost a loved one in Iraq. Even \nif they did not, the time spent away in Iraq for a loved one is \ndifficult enough but especially for a family with a member of their \nfamily who died in Iraq. They are missing, and for a lot of those \nfamilies, will be missing for the rest of that family's life.\n  It is important to remember and remind ourselves these troops \nvolunteered for service. They were not drafted. They knew their task \nwould be difficult. They knew they would be in danger but they made \nthat commitment.\n  In the end, they made the ultimate sacrifice. To those families \nacross Pennsylvania, in communities such as Altoona and Falls Creek and \nState College and Wexford and on and on and on, the war in Iraq is not \nsome obscure abstract policy being debated in Washington. For them, the \nwar is something very real.\n  As I said before, these fighting men and women in Iraq were born into \nfamilies, not divisions and brigades. These families and these \ncommunities have lost sons and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers \nand sisters, classmates, friends, all those relationships and all those \nfamilies and communities.\n  We know this war has gone on longer than World War II. We know the \nnumbers, more than 3,900 dead. In Pennsylvania, it is at 178. \nNationally, the wounded number is about 28,000. In many cases, those \nwho have been wounded are grievously, irreparably, permanently wounded.\n\n  We will not forget their sacrifice. But let me read the names of the \nrecently lost from Pennsylvania, the nine members we have to add to our \nlist. I will read their names and their hometowns.\n  First, Michael A. Hook from Altoona, Pennsylvania; Zachary Clouser, \nfrom\n\n[[Page S175]]\n\nDover; Michael J. Tully, Falls Creek; David A. Wieger, from North \nHuntingdon; Adam J. Chitjian, from the city of Philadelphia; also from \nthe city of Philadelphia, Camy Florexil; from Pittsburgh, Ryan D. \nMaseth; David A. Cooper, Jr., from State College, PA; Eric M. Foster, \nWexford, PA.\n  So after reading these nine names, we have now read, between July and \nthis date, all those from the State of Pennsylvania who have died in \nIraq since the beginning of the war.\n  I know we are short on time today, and we could read biographical \nsketches of all those 178 soldiers. But let me read a couple of notes \nabout a few of them before I conclude.\n  By way of example, one of the names is Adam J. Chitjian from \nPhiladelphia. There is a section called Somerton in the city of \nPhiladelphia. He was on his second tour of duty in Iraq, 39 years old. \nHe joined the Army and his brother was quoted as saying: He wanted to \nact rather than just talk. That is why he joined the Army.\n  He leaves behind a father and sister. When he visited Texas, after \nbeing in Pennsylvania and serving our country all those years, when \nAdam was in Texas, he met Shirley, who would later become his wife. So \nfor that family, we are thinking of Adam and his family. He died on \nOctober 24, 2007.\n  Then we go backward in time to 2003 in November, Nicholas A. Tomko \nfrom Pittsburgh, and a couple highlights about his life. He was 24 \nyears old, from just outside Pittsburgh. The town is called New \nKensington. His father's name is Jack Tomko. He is quoted, in part, as \nsaying about his son that: He was a great kid, brave as hell. And he \ngoes on from there talking about his son.\n  Now this is a young man who left behind a fiance. And he was working \nas an armored car driver near Pittsburgh. He joined the Reserves 3 \nyears ago hoping to get a head start in a career in law enforcement.\n  I wish we could say Nicholas A. Tomko would have that opportunity to \nserve in law enforcement, but this war took him from us.\n  His fiance said, and I am quoting in part here: I am going to make \nsure people know about his service--that he went over there to fight \nfor his country and that he went over to serve. So we remember him.\n  Two more before I conclude. SSG Jeremy R. Horton from Erie, PA, died \non May 21, 2004. His tour was extended. He was a 24-year-old \nPennsylvanian. His tour was extended. He joined the Army right out of \nhigh school, hoping to get money for college. This is what his uncle \nsaid about him: He certainly loved his family, and he loved his \ncountry, and he loved the military. It was what he wanted to do. We \nneed more like him.\n  No one could have said it better than that. We do need more people \nlike him, like Jeremy. He is survived by his wife Christie, whom he \nmarried shortly after joining the Army.\n  I will do one more because I know we are short on time. SSG Ryan S. \nOstrom, from Liberty, PA. He was at one point in his life a baseball \ncoach. One of his players quoted the story about his life: He was a \ngood leader and a good person to look up to. And he had that special \nsmile we used to see in the locker room.\n  That is what they said about him as a coach. This man, Mr. Ostrom, \nwas 25 years old when he died. Here is what another member of the \nmilitary said, SSG Craig Stevens said about Ryan: He was a soldier you \ncould give a task to and know it would get done. You could just look at \nhim and know he was a leader.\n  Ryan would have started his senior year at Mansfield University this \nfall, meaning then the fall of 2005. He is survived by his father Scott \nand his mother Donna.\n  I will add one more. We have a minute. Our last biographical sketch \nis LCpl Nicholas B. Morrison, from Carlisle, PA. He died August 13, \n2004. He was 23 years old.\n  He joined the Marine Corps 16 months ago and planned to become a \nstate trooper in the State of Pennsylvania. He was a 2000 graduate of \nBig Spring High School, where he was a linebacker on the football team.\n  I hope we can all remember his family as well today.\n  Here is what one of his friends said: He was the glue. When he would \ncome home, we would all make an effort to go out. He would make us \nlaugh about stories from when we were growing up.\n  And on and on and on, stories such as that from so many families and \nso many communities across our Commonwealth and indeed our country.\n  I conclude with this thought: There are a lot of great lines in \n``America the Beautiful.'' We could spend a lot of time talking about \neach one of them. One of those lines, when we talk about ``America the \nBeautiful,'' says: ``Oh beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond \nthe years.''\n  That is what a lot of these soldiers did. They not only volunteered \nfor service knowing they could lose their lives, knowing they had to \nmake a full commitment of their life and their time and their family's \ntime, but they had dreams, dreams of serving their country and \nhopefully dreams to go beyond that.\n  But they were patriots and they had dreams and it is those dreams we \nremember and celebrate today. It is those dreams that go well beyond \nthe years we see before us.\n  So we remember these troops today and as always we ask God's \nblessings on their lives, those who gave, as Abraham Lincoln said, the \nlast full measure of devotion to their country.\n  We remember them today and their families. May God bless them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that newspaper accounts about \nthese soldiers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Pfc.

I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Let me say to Senator Casey before he leaves \nthe floor, the kind of speech he has made is the kind of speech none of \nus wants to make. It happens with each of us in each of our States. As \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania was speaking, it caused me to reflect \nback that one of the more painful duties as an active-duty U.S. Army \ncaptain in the late 1960s was that of going and informing the family \nmembers, next of kin, about the loss of their loved one. That was \nduring Vietnam. That was usually the occasion for the notification of \nnext of kin. How difficult a task it is personally to do it because you \nrealize how difficult it is for the family to receive that news. I \nthank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his obviously heartfelt \ncomments about the Pennsylvania citizens who have fallen in combat and \nfor his words and expression of appreciation for the patriotism of \nthese young men and women.\n\n\n                         Coral Reef Ecosystems\n\n  I rise today to speak about another subject, the fact that two of the \ncommittees on which I sit have recently reported out important \nlegislation to protect delicate coral reefs off the coast of our \ncountry. It is called the Coral Reef Conservation Amendments Act and \nthe Tropical Forest Conservation Act.\n  Mr. President, 84 percent of all of the coral reef ecosystems in the \ncountry happen to be off the coast of Florida. It is important that we \nprotect them because--and a lot of people don't realize this--they \nprotect us. Coral reefs are fragile, slow-going, slow-growing, and \nlong-lived ecosystems. Corals themselves are easily damaged and they \nare vulnerable to severe weather, ship damage, pollution, \nnutrification, and changes in temperature. Even with all of those \nenvironmental and physical challenges, coral reef ecosystems provide \ninvaluable services to us. They protect our shorelines. They enhance \nour economies because of all of the wonderful exploration in dive \nshops. They shelter fisheries, and they are a very valuable ecosystem \nfor a variety of marine life.\n  Beyond the current ecosystem services and known capacities, coral \nreefs also hold the promise for new discoveries, new and beneficial \ndrugs coming from the coral reefs, improved understanding of disease \nand, even now, understanding of new species. As we reauthorize in this \nlegislation the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, we are going to take \nan important and significant new step to preserving and restoring \nglobal natural resources and marine systems. This reauthorization will \ncontinue our efforts to preserve the world's forests, the coral reefs, \nand now the coastal marine ecosystems. This act will create an \ninvaluable debt for nature exchange that benefits both the global \neconomy and the global environment.\n  We have an aquarium in Tampa, FL that is offering its expertise in \ncoral conservation and coral health certification in these \ninternational efforts that are ongoing. Developing countries are now \nparticipating in this debt relief initiative, and it will greatly \nbenefit from the research that is going on at the Florida aquarium.\n  The legislation that is coming forth is a reauthorization that \nstrengthens the authority of the Secretary of Commerce. It gives the \nSecretary the ability to address threats to coral reef ecosystems in \nU.S. waters. It expands NOAA's authority to respond to stranded and \ngrounded vessels that threaten the coral reefs. The bill also allows \nfor NOAA to negotiate agreements with coral reef research institutes \nsuch as the Institute at Nova Southeastern University in my State in \nthe city of Fort Lauderdale. This bill also provides\n\n[[Page S177]]\n\nmechanisms for the Government to recoup costs and damages from the \nresponsible parties and then apply those funds to coral restoration \nefforts in damaged areas.\n  We have another potential devastation of coral reefs. Many of these \nreefs are right off the Florida Keys. It is an area of endangered, \ncritical concern. There are these beautiful coral reefs that do all of \nthese protections I talked about for the delicate keys: protection from \nstorms, housing the fisheries, a place for research and development \nwith regard to disease, and so forth. But let me tell you about a new \ndestructive potential for the coral reefs. Remember, 84 percent of the \nNation's coral reefs are in Florida. Since there is no treaty between \nCuba and the United States with regard to the operation of the waters \nbetween the two, there have been exchanges between the Government of \nthe United States and Cuba, through the facilities of the Swiss \nEmbassy, an exchange of letters that has been going on for 20 years, \ndesignating a line halfway between Key West and Cuba, which is only 90 \nmiles, or a line 45 miles off the coast of Cuba, which happens to be 45 \nmiles off of Key West, as a line at which the jurisdiction of the \nwaters in each respective part is the jurisdiction of that country.\n\n  Here is the problem. Cuba, combined with foreign oil companies, now \nincluding PDVSA, the oil company of Venezuela, is starting to explore \nfor oil out in the waters off of Cuba. There has been some exploration \nalready near the shore. But unless that agreement is modified, the \nVenezuelan oil company could be drilling for oil 45 miles off of Key \nWest. Right off of Key West is the gulf stream. The gulf stream comes \nup through the west side of Cuba and the Yucatan peninsula, goes into \nthe Gulf of Mexico, turns eastward and southward and comes down below \nKey West, between Key West and Cuba, and then follows the keys \nnorthward, hugs the coast of Florida only a couple of miles off the \ncoast, all the way up to the middle of Florida at Fort Pierce, and then \nturns and leaves the coast of Florida going across the Atlantic and \ngoes all the way over to northern Europe. If we don't call back this \nletter that most recently the Bush White House has sent to Cuba to \nratify the agreement, which is done every 2 years, it gives perfect \nlicense for the Castro government to go in and drill. If there is an \noil spill that is caught up in that gulf stream, you can see the \npotential for destruction of the delicate coral reefs all lining the \nFlorida Keys and then right up the east coast of the State of Florida.\n  I have written to the President today asking him to recall the \nletter. The letter has been delivered by the State Department to the \nSwiss Embassy, but it has not been responded to by the Government of \nCuba. It is not too late to withdraw that letter from the United States \nGovernment setting that boundary, and instead a new letter should be \nsent, perhaps with regard to what this initially started a couple of \ndecades ago, on the fishing rights of each country, but one that would \nexempt out the rights of Cuba to drill in such a dangerous area. At \nleast this ought to be an issue that is negotiated to keep the oil \ndrilling away from the gulf stream which could damage these very coral \nreefs which I have been talking about in this act, this legislative act \nwhich has come out of the committee on which the Presiding Officer and \nI serve. It is not too late, if the Bush administration will do this. \nThis happened 2 years ago and the Bush administration ignored the \ncalls. But in the last 2 years, it has become much more apparent that \noil companies sometimes that may not be safe in their drilling \npractices are in fact going to drill. The United States needs to have a \nsay in those drilling operations not being out there close to the gulf \nstream which is only 30 or 40 miles off of the city of Key West which \nis at the lower end of the Florida Keys.\n  I come here happily to embrace this legislation protecting coral \nreefs, but I come here with an urgent message asking the White House to \nprotect our coral reefs by withdrawing this letter sent to the Castro \ngovernment of Cuba.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there has been a lot of progress made on \nthis Indian health bill that is now before the Senate. A number of \namendments have been filed. The staff are negotiating further \nprovisions and discussing a list of amendments for consideration when \nwe return to the bill.\n  I extend my appreciation to Senator Dorgan and Senator Murkowski, the \nchairman and ranking member, for their leadership on the floor.\n  Many compromises have been made to accommodate my Republican \ncolleagues--on Federal Torts Claims Act coverage of traditional health \ncare practitioners, on urban Indian programs, and on the need for an \nAssistant Secretary of Indian Health. We even accommodated our \ncolleagues when we learned of their midweek retreat, which has \ninterrupted debate time on this important bill.\n  The caucuses are discussing some final issues, and I will be \ndeveloping a list of amendments that we should consider relating to \nthis legislation. I hope these conversations continue so we find a way \nto complete the bill in a timely and efficient manner.\n  As an original cosponsor of the Indian health bill, I am committed to \nseeing an Indian health bill signed into law and will continue to work \nwith Senator Dorgan, Senator Murkowski, and my Republican counterpart \nto complete this legislation as soon as possible.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased to support the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007. This bill is long \noverdue, and I hope that we in the Senate can ensure this bill's quick \npassage.\n  There are significant unmet needs in Indian Country throughout this \nNation, and addressing the unmet health care needs ranks as one of the \nmost significant issues that we must address. The Federal Government \nhas a well-established trust responsibility with regard to American \nIndian affairs, and this trust responsibility extends to providing good \nhealth care to communities throughout Indian Country.\n  I am impressed with the bipartisan work that Senator Dorgan and the \nSenate Indian Affairs Committee have put into moving this bill forward, \nand I commend the committee for its dedication to significant \nconsultation with Indian Country in drafting and negotiating this bill. \nBecause of the strong consultation with individual tribes and \ncollective organizations like the National Tribal Steering Committee \nand the National Indian Health Board, the Senate Indian Affairs \nCommittee has put together a comprehensive reform bill that will help \nimprove the health care services available to American Indians around \nthe country.\n  This bill has the support of tribal governments throughout the \nNation, including the 11 federally recognized tribes in my State of \nWisconsin. I have heard from a number of constituents in Wisconsin \nabout the need to pass this important piece of legislation and the \nimprovements that the legislation will make to various Indian Health \nService programs including clinical programs, on the various \nreservations throughout the State and the urban Indian program in the \ncity of Milwaukee.\n  Health care is consistently the No. 1 issue that I hear about all \nover my home State of Wisconsin. When I hold my annual townhall \nmeetings across the State, many people come to tell me about problems \nwith our overall health care system, and data shows us that these \nproblems are often most acutely felt in Indian Country. Lack of access \nto good health care is a problem that disproportionately affects \nAmerican Indians throughout the United States. According to the Indian \nHealth Service, American Indians and Alaska Natives are 200 percent \nmore likely to die from diabetes, more than 500 percent more likely to \ndie from alcoholism, and approximately 500 percent more likely to die \nfrom tuberculosis.\n  I was disappointed to hear one of my colleagues say yesterday on the \nfloor that American lives do not depend on whether we pass the Indian \nhealth care bill by the end of the month. The staggering health \nstatistics I cited earlier show just how imperative it is that we\n\n[[Page S178]]\n\npass this legislation, which is long overdue. These statistics also \nhelp illustrate the vast amount of work that needs to be done to \nimprove the quality of health care in American Indian communities. This \npiece of legislation takes an important first step toward addressing \nthese health care disparities through the many reforms it makes to \nIndian health care programs. Contrary to what my colleague asserted \nyesterday, American lives do depend on this legislation. Modernizing \nIndian Health Services programs through this legislation will help to \naddress the diabetes and suicide crises that exist on reservations--\njust two examples of the many health care issues that impact the daily \nlives of American Indians across the country.\n  Reauthorization of this bill will help encourage health care \nproviders to practice at facilities in Indian Country and encourage \nAmerican Indians to enter the health care profession and serve their \ncommunities. Recruiting talented and dedicated professionals to serve \nin IHS facilities, whether urban or rural, is a key challenge facing \nmany tribal communities in Wisconsin and around the country. I hope \nthese provisions will help bring additional dedicated doctors, nurses, \nand other health care professionals to our tribal populations.\n  This bill also reauthorizes programs that assist urban Indian \norganizations with providing health care to American Indians living in \nurban centers around the country. The Urban Indian Health Program \nrepresents a tiny fraction of the Indian Health Services budget, but \nthe small amount of resources given to the urban programs provide \ncritical health services to those Indians living in urban areas. \nContrary to what some people may think, the majority of American \nIndians now live in urban areas around the country, including two urban \nareas in my State--Milwaukee and Green Bay. Throughout our Nation's \nhistory, some American Indians came to urban centers voluntarily, but \nmany were forcibly sent to urban areas as a result of wrongheaded \nFederal Indian policy in the 1950s and 1960s and have since stayed in \nurban areas and planted roots in these communities.\n  As a result of this movement to urban centers, Congress created the \nurban Indian program in the late 1970s to address the growing urban \nIndian population around the country. The Federal Government's \nresponsibility to American Indians does not end simply because some \nAmerican Indians left their ancestral lands and moved to urban \nlocations--particularly when some of them had little choice in the \nmatter.\n  While this legislation takes important steps toward improving urban \nIndian health care programs, we need to do much more to support these \nurban programs, including fighting for increased appropriations. I have \nbeen disappointed that the President has proposed zeroing out the urban \nIndian program in past budgets, and I fear that this year's upcoming \nbudget will be no different. As in years past, I will join with my \ncolleagues in efforts to restore funding for urban Indian programs to \nthe Federal budget, and I hope this year we can also provide a much \nneeded boost in funding for the urban Indian programs.\n  While this bill is a good first step towards reforming and improving \naccess to health care in Indian Country, I also look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to examine better ways to address the disparities \nthat exist in the funding allocated to various IHS regions, including \nthe Bemidji region, which covers Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, \nIndiana, and Illinois. According to the latest available data compiled \nby the Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Epidemiology Center, the Bemidji Indian \nHealth service area has lower funding rates than other Indian Health \nService areas around the country. Even though the Bemidji region's \nfunding rates are lower than other areas, the region has higher rates \nof heart disease and cancer than other regions and has the second worst \ndiabetes rate in the IHS system. Not only do we need to provide more \nfunding for all IHS regions, we also need to better address disparities \nthat exist within the system, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the coming months to address those disparities.\n  This bill is a solid first step toward improving access to health \ncare in Indian Country. Unfortunately, the Senate was not able to \nfinish work on this important bill before we had to move to debate \nanother matter. I understand the majority leader has made a commitment \nto return to the Indian health care bill after we finish that other \ndebate, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the \nAmerican Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007 in the \nnear future. We need to move forward on this critical bill, and I urge \nall my colleagues, whether Republican or Democrat, to work together \nquickly to ensure its swift passage.\n  Indian Country has made many compromises in order to move this bill \nforward, and passage of this bill is long overdue. This bill takes \nimportant steps toward addressing some of the health care needs facing \nAmerican Indian communities around the country, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to build on this legislation in the coming \nmonths and years. I also hope that we can continue to work together in \na bipartisan way to pass the reauthorization of the Native American \nHousing and Self-Determination Act, work on legislation to address the \neducation needs of American Indian youth, and address other legislative \nareas in order to help ensure stronger futures for American Indians \nthroughout the country.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise in support of renewing and \nreinvigorating the Indian healthcare programs. For too long, we have \nneglected our duty to review this program and ensure that it continues \nto efficiently deliver high quality health care. As a part of that \neffort, last Congress Senator McCain, Senator Dorgan, Senator \nMurkowski, and I introduced comprehensive legislation to do just that. \nI am pleased that a great portion of the bill we are discussing today \nincludes provisions from that bill, S. 4122.\n  In crafting that legislation last Congress, we kept in mind the 80-20 \nrule. Eighty percent of the time we were going to agree on a topic. It \nis only 20 percent that we are going to disagree. Therefore, to gain \nbroad support, we focused on the 80 percent to ensure that it was \nstrong, bipartisan legislation.\n  However, there are a few ways in which the bill before us deviates \nfrom the language in S. 4122. Sometimes, those changes are improvements \nas we all review the language again. Unfortunately, some issues still \nremain.\n  Those issues include Federal liability coverage for traditional \nhealthcare practices. If we don't correct this, the Federal Government \ncould be telling Americans how to practice their own religious beliefs. \nIn addition, we need to more fully understand the appropriate role for \nproviding services to urban Indians. I do think there is middle ground, \nor a third way--as I like to call it--to be found. In addition, there \nmust be an appropriate offset to the legislation. Given the pay-go \nrules in both Chambers, in addition to our own Senate procedural \nhurdles, it is necessary and fiscally appropriate to have a responsible \noffset.\n  I have also heard from my colleagues that there are at least two \noutstanding issues within the Finance Committee's title of this \nlegislation. I hope those can also be discussed and resolved. \nSpecifically, the concerns center around the elimination of Medicaid \ncopays and removal of particular citizenship requirements.\n  As the optimist and the Senator advocating for the ``third way,'' I \nam hopeful that we all can continue discussing these issues and come to \nan agreement as to how we move forward. Individuals depending on the \nIndian Health Services for their health care deserve no less.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, the Senate is in the midst of an important \ndebate to extend and improve health care to our Nation's federally \nrecognized Indian tribes. I support the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct and I commend all those, including the distinguished chairman, \nSenator Dorgan, for their work on it.\n  As we work to extend health care to more Native Americans, some of \nour oldest and most historically significant Indian tribes will be left \noutside the process, ineligible to participate in either the health \ncare services or other programs authorized by the Federal Government.\n  I bring to your attention my strong support of a bill passed last \nyear by the\n\n[[Page S179]]\n\nU.S. House of Representatives, which would grant Federal recognition to \nsix Native American tribes from the Commonwealth of Virginia. That bill \nis the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal \nRecognition Act, H.R. 1294.\n  Once the Senate passes that bill and the President signs it into law, \nthese six federally recognized tribes would become eligible for the \nbenefits conferred under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which \nthe Senate currently is debating. I hope that the Senate will pass the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act this week. Just as importantly, I \nhope that during this session of Congress, the Senate will pass the \nThomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act, \nthereby bestowing Federal benefits to these six tribes that have waited \nover 15 years for recognition.\n  The six tribes affected by the Federal Recognition Act are (1) the \nChickahominy Tribe; (2) the Chickahominy Indian Tribe--Eastern \nDivision; (3) the Upper Mattaponi Tribe; (4) the Rappahannock Tribe, \nInc.; (5) the Monacan Indian Nation; and (6) the Nansemond Indian \nTribe.\n  All six tribes included in the Federal Recognition Act have attempted \nto gain formal recognition through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA. A \nlack of resources, coupled with unclear agency guidelines, have \ncontributed to a backlog that currently exists at the BIA. Some \napplications for recognition can take up to 20 years.\n  Virginia's history and policies create barriers for Virginia's Native \nAmerican Tribes to meet the BIA criteria for Federal recognition. Many \nWestern tribes experienced Government neglect during the 20th century, \nbut Virginia's story is different. Virginia's tribes were specifically \ntargeted by unique policies.\n  Virginia was the first State to pass antimiscegenation laws in 1691, \nwhich were not eliminated until 1967.\n  Virginia's Bureau of Vital Statistics went so far as changing race \nrecords on many birth, death and marriage certificates. The elimination \nof racial identity records had a harmful impact on Virginia's tribes in \nthe late 1990s, when they began seeking Federal recognition.\n  Moreover, many Virginia counties suffered tremendous loss of their \nearly records during the intense military activity that occurred during \nthe Civil War.\n  After meeting with leaders of Virginia's Indian tribes and months of \nthorough investigation of the facts, I concluded that legislative \naction is needed for recognition of Virginia's tribes. Congressional \nhearings and reports over the last several Congresses demonstrate the \nancestry and status of these tribes. I have come to the conclusion that \nthis recognition is justified based on principles of dignity and \nfairness. I have spent several months examining this issue in great \ndetail, including the rich history and culture of Virginia's tribes. My \nstaff and I asked a number of tough questions, and great care and \ndeliberation were put into arriving at this conclusion.\n  Last year, we celebrated the 400th anniversary of Jamestown America's \nfirst colony. After 400 years since the founding of Jamestown, these \nsix tribes deserve to join our Nation's other 562 federally recognized \ntribes.\n  As I mentioned, the House overwhelming passed the Thomasina E. Jordan \nIndian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act, with bipartisan \nsupport. Virginia Governor Tim Kaine and the Virginia legislature \nsupport Federal recognition for these tribes. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in the Senate, especially those on the Indian \nAffairs Committee, to push for passage of the Thomasina E. Jordan \nIndian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act.\n  At a time when we are debating how to effectively promote Indian \nhealth care, it is important that we grant these six Virginia tribes \nthe access to these essential Federal health programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S179-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S179-S194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, we have conferred with our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. Senator Bond is aware of this new \namendment. He has not had time to study the amendment. He has been busy \nall day, as have all my Republican colleagues at their retreat. But he \nwill have time to work on this tonight. His staff is working on it. We \nhope tomorrow to have a couple hours of debate, and then it is my \nunderstanding there could be and likely will be a motion to table this \namendment.\n  I want to make sure Senators have adequate time to debate this \namendment tomorrow. This is, if not the key amendment, one of the key \namendments to this legislation, and we want to make sure everyone has \nadequate time. We are going to come in early in the morning and start \nthis matter as quickly as we can. So I am not going to ask consent \ntonight as to how much time will be spent on it, but this will be the \nmatter we take up tomorrow.\n  I have spoken to Senator Whitehouse, who is a member not only of the \nJudiciary Committee but also the Intelligence Committee. He has a very \nimportant amendment he wishes to offer. It is a bipartisan amendment he \nhas worked on for a significant period of time, and we look forward to \nthis amendment.\n  Hopefully, we can work our way through some of these contentious \namendments tomorrow. It is something we need to do, and we are going to \nwork as hard as we can. There are strong feelings on each side. \nEveryone has worked in good faith. I especially appreciate the \ncooperation of Senator Leahy and Senator Rockefeller. They have not \nagreed on everything, but they have agreed on a lot, and they have \nworked in a very professional manner in working our way to the point \nwhere we now are.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there will be no more votes tonight. We \nhave a number of Senators who wish to speak. We understand Senator Bond \nwill be here, Senator Rockefeller will be here, Senator Dodd will be \nhere. That is good. They are going to be\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\nspeaking about the legislation that is now before this body.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to speak in favor of \nthe Leahy substitute amendment to the FISA legislation. I start by \nthanking Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond, Senator Leahy and \nSenator Specter for their extraordinary work on this most difficult \nsubject. This is not an easy subject. We are dealing with a technology \nthat has changed and the need of our country to get information through \nour intelligence community, which is important for our national \nsecurity, and protecting the constitutional and civil rights of the \npeople of our Nation.\n  The Leahy substitute is a bill that was carefully worked and drafted \nwithin the Judiciary Committee. The Intelligence Committee came up with \ntheir legislation. We passed it rather quickly before the recess. The \nJudiciary Committee spent a lot of time looking at the substance of how \nwe could make sure we got the language right, to make sure the \nintelligence community has the information they need, and that we do \nprotect the rights of the people of our own country. The Leahy \nsubstitute does that, with the right balance.\n  I start by saying that I have been to NSA on many occasions. It is \nlocated in the State of Maryland. The dedicated men and women who work \nthere work very hard to protect the interests of our Nation. They do it \nwith a great deal of dedication and sensitivity to the type of \ninformation they obtain and how important it is to our country, but it \nmust be done in the right way. The need for the FISA legislation is so \nwe can continue to get information from non-Americans that is important \nfor our national security. Much of this information is obtained from \nwhat we call foreign to foreign, where we have communications between \nan American and a non-American in a country outside of the United \nStates, but because of technology it falls within the definition of the \nFISA statute. We need to clarify that in a way that will allow the \nintelligence community to get that information foreign to foreign, \ninformation that is important for the security of our country. The \nLeahy substitute recognizes the change in technology and the need for \nthis information but does it in a way that protects the constitutional \nrights of the citizens of our own country and the civil rights of \nAmericans.\n  Where an American is a target, that person should have certain \nrights. The Leahy substitute protects Americans who are targets of \nintelligence gathering when they are outside of the United States. When \nthey are inside the United States, there has never been a question that \nyou need to get certain warrants and certain information. Well, this \nlegislation also makes it clear that where an American is a target \noutside of the United States, that individual will have proper \nprotection. But the legislation goes further and says that in the \ncourse of obtaining information, you may get incidental information \nabout an American who was not the target of the investigation, but the \nAmerican comes up in the communication that has been gathered. We have \ncertain minimization rules to protect the rights of Americans who are \nincidental to the information being gathered by the intelligence \ncommunity. The Leahy substitute protects Americans through \nstrengthening the minimization rules.\n  The Leahy substitute protects the process by involving the courts. \nThe FISA courts are involved in making sure that the right procedures \nare used in gathering information so that Americans are protected.\n  The Leahy substitute contains a provision offered by Senator \nFeinstein to make it clear that the gathering of information under the \nFISA statute is the exclusive way in which the intelligence community \ncan get information of foreign-to-foreign communications or \ncommunications that involve telecommunications centers located in the \nUnited States, but that the FISA statute is the exclusive way to \nproceed so there will not be confusion in the future as to whether \nthere are extraordinary authorities you can use warrantless types of \nintercepts without having congressional approval. It is the right \nbalance, as I have indicated before, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Judiciary Committee's substitute offered by Senator Leahy.\n  It even goes further than that. The Leahy substitute does not contain \nthe retroactive immunity. The Intelligence Committee bill contains \nretroactive immunity for telecommunications companies. Now, my major \nproblem with that is it will take away the appropriate jurisdiction of \nour courts to act as a check and balance on potential abuses of our \nrights of privacy. I must tell my colleagues--and I said this in the \nJudiciary Committee and I have said it on the floor--that \ntelecommunications companies operating in good faith are entitled to \nhelp, entitled to relief. They have serious problems in defending their \nrights because of the confidential nature of the information they are \ndealing with, but there are ways to deal with that without compromising \nthe independence of the judicial branch of Government, without \ncompromising in the future the ability of our courts to make sure we \nprotect the rights of our citizens.\n  If we adopt the Leahy substitute, there are going to be other \namendments that will be offered that will deal in a responsible way \nwith the concerns of the telecommunications companies. Senator Specter \nhas an amendment that says: Look, if the telecommunications companies \nare operating in good faith, if they are innocent in all this where \nthey can't defend themselves, then let's let the Government be \nsubstituted for the telecommunications company. That protects their \ninterests, without compromising the ability of our courts to make sure \nthat all of our rights have been protected. I think that is a better \ncourse than what the Intelligence Committee did. There will be an \namendment offered by Senator Feinstein which I am a cosponsor of that \nsays, look, we should at least have the courts--the courts--make a \njudgment as to whether the telecommunications companies operated in \ngood faith under law. That decision shouldn't be made by the executive \nbranch that asked them for the information. That makes common sense to \nme and offers us at least some protection to make sure we are moving \nwith court supervision. So the Leahy substitute offers us the advantage \nof eliminating the retroactive immunity which is extremely \ncontroversial, and allows us to consider that in its own right, which I \nam certain we will have a chance to do by the amendments that have been \nnoted.\n  In addition, the Leahy substitute contains an amendment I offered in \nthe Judiciary Committee that changes the sunset provisions, the \ntermination of these provisions, from a 6-year sunset to a 4-year \nsunset. Why is that important? First, it is interesting to point out \nthat the members of the Intelligence Committee and the members of the \nJudiciary Committee, in fact all of the Members of this body, have said \nwe have gotten a lot of cooperation from the intelligence community, \nfrom the administration in carrying out our responsibility as the \nlegislative branch of Government to oversee what the executive branch \nis doing in this area. There has been tremendous cooperation. Why? \nBecause they know we have to pass a statute to continue this authority. \nWe have gotten access to information that at least initially the \nadministration indicated we would not have access to. Well, we got \naccess to it--some of us did. I am sorry more were not offered the \nopportunity to take a look at the confidential communications--the \nclassified communications. That type of cooperation is helpful when you \nhave the requirement that Congress has to act.\n\n  Four years is preferable to six because it will mean the next \nadministration that will take office in January of next year will have \nto deal with this issue. If we continue a 6-year sunset, there will be \nno need for the next two Congresses and the administration ever to have \nto deal with this authority and to take a look at it to see whether it \nis operating properly, to see whether technology changes have caused it \nto need to change the way the law is\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\ndrafted. But a 4-year sunset will mean we will have plenty of time for \nthe agency with predictability to establish its practices for gathering \nintelligence information about foreign subjects, but we will also have \nan opportunity to review during the next administration whether these \nprovisions need to be modified, whether there is a different way, a \nmore effective way that we can get this information protecting the \nrights of the people of this Nation.\n  For all of those reasons, I urge this body to approve the substitute \nthat is being offered by Senator Leahy. It is the product of the \nJudiciary Committee. I believe it is a better way for us to collect the \ninformation. It gives us the chance to take a look at the immunity \nissue fresh and to make sure we don't compromise in the future the \nproper roles of our courts in protecting the privacy of the citizens of \nour own country. It provides for a much stronger oversight by the \nlegislative branch of Government, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthat amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom Maryland and his insight. The economic house in our country is not \nin order. The United States may be entering its first recession since \n2001--since the beginning of the Bush Presidency. It is pretty clear in \nmy State of Ohio, from places I visited in January, from Kenton to \nCelina to Cincinnati to Lancaster, to places all over my State, that \npeople are suffering. Food banks are at their most perilous time in at \nleast 20 years.\n  In Logan, OH, a small community halfway between Columbus and the \ncenter of the State and the Ohio River and the town of Athens, halfway \nbetween Hocking County and Logan, OH, is the United Methodist Food \nPantry. At 3:30 in the morning on a cold December day just about a \nmonth ago, people began to line up to go to this food bank, and by 8 \no'clock, when the doors opened, cars were all the way up and down the \nroad. This is a small county. By 1 o'clock in the afternoon, 2,000 \npeople--7 percent of the people in this rural Appalachian county, \nHocking County, Logan, OH--had come to this food bank; 2,000 people, 7 \npercent of the people who live in this county, many having driven 20 or \n30 minutes to get there.\n  Middle-class families in Ohio and throughout our Nation face higher \ncosts for energy and health care and education, amidst stagnant wages \nand falling home prices. In Lebanon, OH, in Warren County, the United \nWay director told me 90 percent of people going to food banks to pick \nup food are employed.\n  The mayor of Denver told a group of us today--Senator Stabenow and \nothers--that 40 percent of homeless people in greater Denver are \nemployed, they have jobs, but not making enough because of foreclosures \nor cost of food or transportation, simply not making--making low wages, \nnot making enough to make a go of it.\n  Our Nation is bleeding jobs. The middle class is shrinking. People \nare hurting. When it comes to responding to these realities, we have \nseveral choices. We can try to buy time, as many of the Republican \ncandidates for President are saying, and leave it at that. The economy \nis cyclical; it will get better; let's ride it out. No government \ninvolvement at all. That is one option.\n  The second option is we can enact a short-term economic stimulus \npackage where we put money in the pockets of middle-class taxpayers, \nwhether they are paying income tax or Social Security tax, put money in \nthe pockets of middle-class taxpayers, extend unemployment \ncompensation, offer aid for food stamps and food banks, and also offer \naid to LIHEAP for seniors who are particularly victimized by this \nrecession.\n  The third option is we can learn from our mistakes. We certainly need \nto do the short-term economic stimulus package. That is very important, \nbut that is not enough. We can learn from our mistakes. We can confront \nthe underlying causes of our Nation's economic stability. I want to \nfocus on one of those causes. It is a refusal to acknowledge that U.S. \ntrade policies must evolve as the global marketplace does.\n  When I first ran for Congress in 1992--the same year as the Presiding \nOfficer was elected from her State of Washington--our trade deficit was \n$38 billion. Our trade deficit figures for 2007 are estimated at nearly \n$800 billion, and that is before we count the December numbers. So we \nknow our trade deficit went from $38 billion to, a decade and a half \nlater, nearly $800 billion.\n  President George Herbert Walker Bush has said that $1 billion in \ntrade deficit or surplus translates into 13,000 jobs. So if you sell a \nbillion dollars more out of the country than you import, that is a net \nincrease of 13,000 jobs. If you export $1 billion less than you export, \nthen that is costing 13,000 jobs. Do the math. We went from a $38 \nbillion trade deficit to an $800 billion trade deficit.\n  The fact is, these job-killing trade agreements are hemorrhaging jobs \nout of our country and our manufacturing communities, from small towns \nsuch as Tippin, OH, to cities as large as Cleveland, OH, from places \nlike Chillicothe, to places like Columbus. The U.S. trade deficit with \nChina, which has continued to spiral upward, hit $238 billion through \nNovember of 2007. In 1992, the year I ran for Congress, our trade \ndeficit with China was slightly over $10 billion. It hit over $238 \nbillion, and that is just through November 2007. As President Bush the \nfirst said, $1 billion in trade deficit costs 13,000 jobs. Do the math.\n  Just with China alone, this is the highest annual imbalance ever \nrecorded with a single country, with any bilateral relationship in \nworld history. The trade deficit we have with China now accounts for 33 \npercent of the U.S. total trade deficit in goods.\n  Since 1982, our Nation has accumulated trade deficits of $4.3 \ntrillion. That is money that must be eventually repaid. When you look \nat $4.3 trillion, think of the first President Bush's formula: a \nbillion-dollar trade deficit costs 13,000 jobs.\n  Today, Americans are losing jobs for reasons, frankly, that have \nnothing to do with this recession. They have much to do with our \ncountry's narrow, myopic, tunnel-vision trade policies. When we craft \ntrade deals that favor gains for multinational corporations over \nevenhanded competition for both trading partners, why should we be \nsurprised when U.S. companies are crippled or they move out of the \ncountry? In Tippin, OH, where I visited a week and a half ago, workers \nare losing their pensions, health care, or the company has come in and \nraided these communities and put people out of work, so there are less \ndollars for schools, less dollars for police protection, for fire \nprotection, and fewer dollars for the local hardware store, fewer \ndollars for the local restaurants, all of that.\n  That is why we need to enforce trade rules meant to prevent \nanticompetitive practices by countries such as China. We should not be \nsurprised when our manufacturing sector--which is not only crucial to \nour economy but to national security--falters because of these \nanticompetitive practices. It is not in our Nation's best interest to \nrely on other nations for our defense infrastructure, our \ntransportation infrastructure, our industrial infrastructure.\n  The tragedy is, we in this country do the best research and \ndevelopment in the world. We do the research and development and so \noften companies take that research and development and make the \nproducts in other countries. Then we continue to do research and \ndevelopment, and they continue to take the production of these items \nand goods and this research and these high-tech products out of our \ncountry. The research and development certainly creates jobs, good, \nhigh-paying jobs, many in the State of the Presiding Officer and many \nin mine.\n  The fact is, we cannot continue to run an economy when we do the \nresearch and development in this country and then we farm out the \nproduction of those goods that are developed to other countries, to \nexploit low-wage labor, to exploit weak environmental laws, to exploit \nworker safety laws, to exploit the consumer products safety net. Look \nat the toxic toys coming from China and the contaminated toothpaste and \ndog food, and the unsafe tires coming from countries that don't have a \nconsumer products safety net and the food safety net we have.\n\n[[Page S194]]\n\n  We clearly need a stronger manufacturing sector such as we have had \nin our history. That sector cannot effectively compete against \ncompanies subsidized by the Chinese Government, companies that pay \nslave wages, that too often churn out dangerous toys that end up in our \nchildren's bedrooms, and toxic, contaminated food that ends up too \noften in our families breakfast rooms.\n  On a level, competitive playing field, U.S. companies thrive. When \nthe cards are stacked against them, they struggle, of course.\n  In 2007, prior to the onset of the 2008 recession, 217,000 \nmanufacturing jobs across the country were lost. That was last year \nbefore this recession seems to have deepened. Madam President, 217,000 \njobs were lost in the manufacturing sector last year in places such as \nYoungstown, Warren, Ravenna, and Lima, all over my State.\n  The United States now has fewer manufacturing jobs--get this--the \nUnited States, now with 300 million people, has fewer manufacturing \njobs today than it did in 1950 when we had about 150 million people in \nour country. Manufacturing jobs bring wealth to our communities. A job \nthat pays $15 an hour in Marion, OH, and pays $14 an hour in \nSpringfield, OH, brings wealth into the community that spends out into \nother jobs and prosperity for other people in the community.\n  We have lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs since President \nBush took office in 2001. Many of these jobs have been eliminated \nbecause of imports from China or direct offshoring to countries such as \nChina.\n  Last week, NewPage, a paper manufacturing company based in \nMiamisburg, OH, near Dayton, announced it was shutting down plants in \nWisconsin, Maine, and Chillicothe, OH. Heavily government-subsidized \nChinese paper producers account for nearly 50 percent of the world \nmarket.\n  One country, because of subsidies and low wages, unenforced \nenvironmental rules, and pretty much nonexistent protection for \nworkers, accounts for 50 percent of the world market. That is not free \ntrade, that is a racket.\n  China has done little to address the fundamental misalignment of its \ncurrency, a practice that continues to take jobs and wealth from our \ncountry, and they don't share it with their workers. If they didn't \nhave an oppressive, authoritarian government, it would be a different \nstory. They are taking wealth out of our country, and it means higher \nprofits for outsourcing companies, more money for the Chinese Communist \nParty, for the People's Liberation Army, but not much for Chinese \nworkers.\n\n  When we allow China to manipulate currency, trade isn't free, it is \nfixed. When we allow China to import dangerous products into our \ncountry, we should not be surprised when Americans balk.\n  It took generations for our Nation to build a solid product safety \nsystem. If we don't demand safe imports from China and our other \ntrading partner nations, our investment in U.S. product safety becomes \nan exercise in futility. Think how it happens. U.S. companies shut down \nan American toy manufacturer, for instance, and those U.S. companies, \nafter shutting down the manufacturing in the United States, move to \nChina. China is a country with low wages, unenforced environmental and \nworker safety standards. The U.S. company goes to China because of weak \nenvironmental and worker safety standards and low wages. Because they \ndon't enforce those rules, you know what is going to happen. Products \nmade in those countries will be made in bad conditions, and there is \nlikely to be toxic or dangerous toys, and more likely to be \ncontaminated food.\n  The U.S. companies in China then push their Chinese subcontractors to \ncut costs because they want more profit. So they are pushing the \nChinese subcontractors to cut costs, and then those products that are \nimported into the United States are even more dangerous. Then the \nConsumer Products Safety Commission in this country--because of \nPresident Bush's decisions, we have weakened the regulatory system, so \nthose products come in and there are not enough inspectors. The laws \nare weakened, so the dangerous toys and contaminated food too often \nends up in our family rooms, bedrooms, and our kitchens.\n  Some free-trade proponents say workers and consumers should get over \nit, get used to it; it is globalization and there is nothing you can do \nabout it. That is wrong.\n  Continuing this course will not only cost the middle class more jobs, \nit will cost our economy its global leadership. It will foist so much \ndebt on our children and their children that basic economic security, \nbasic retirement security may be reserved for the fortunate few. \nCertainly not the middle class. And as for the poor, just let them eat \ncake.\n  The people in Ohio, in all corners, are swimming upstream against \ndeteriorating economic forces. One important reason for that is that \nFederal policymakers continue to cling to the fantasy that markets run \nthemselves and police themselves, and as long as the rich are getting \nricher, wealth will trickle down, jobs will be created, and everybody \nis better off.\n  It is time to take the blinders off. To secure our economy for the \nfuture, we need to write trade rules that crack down on anticompetitive \ngaming. In our country, still the most powerful in the world, with the \nmost vigorous economy, we need to write trade rules that crack down on \nanticompetitive gaming of the system. That is what they have done. We \nneed trade rules that prevent dangerous products from entering our \ncountry. We need trade rules that acknowledge that destroying the \nenvironment in any country, whether it is China or the United States, \nis a threat to every country.\n  We need to take responsibility for the consequences of our inaction \nwhen it comes to trade policy. We need to take responsibility for the \nconsequences of mistakes we have made in writing trade policy. We need \nto change course, and we need to do it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. CASEY assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S194-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S194-S195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING ROBERT ``SARGENT'' SHRIVER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Robert ``Sargent'' \nShriver, a role model, hero, and icon. An activist, attorney, and \npolitician, Sargent Shriver has always led by example, driven by the \ndesire to serve those less fortunate.\n  Sargent Shriver's political career began in 1960, when he worked for \nhis brother-in-law, Democratic Presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. \nPassionate about civil rights, Shriver was instrumental in connecting \nthen-Senator Kennedy with Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. And when the \nnewly elected President established the Peace Corps in 1961, Shriver \nbecame the new agency's first director. This organization, which \npromotes peace and international friendship, embodies Shriver's belief \nin public service by young people to help the poor and the uneducated \nabroad and at home. In less than 6 years, Shriver developed volunteer \nactivities in more than 55 countries with more than 14,500 volunteers.\n  In 1962, Sargent Shriver's wife Eunice Kennedy Shriver began ``Camp \nShriver,'' a day camp for young people with physical and intellectual \ndisabilities. ``Camp Shriver'' grew into the Special Olympics, of which \nSargent Shriver later became president and chairman of the board. \nSpecial Olympics was built on Eunice and Sargent Shriver's shared \ndedication to expanding opportunities for disabled persons, and today \nbrings athletic competition to 2.5 people in 165 countries.\n  Shriver was presented with the Franklin D. Roosevelt Freedom from \nWant Award in 1993, a prestigious award that acknowledges a lifetime \ncommitment to securing the basic needs of others. On August 8, 1994, \nPresident Bill Clinton recognized Sargent Shriver's lifetime in public \nservice with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' \nhighest civilian honor.\n  Additionally, Sargent Shriver served as U.S. Ambassador to France and \nhas directed several organizations including, Head Start, Job Corps, \nCommunity Action, Upward Bound, Foster Grandparents, and the National \nCenter on Poverty. Today, Shriver lives in Maryland with his wife.\n  To tell Shriver's life story to the next generation, Emmy award-\nwinning writer, producer and director Bruce Orenstein created a film \nentitled ``American Idealist: The Story of Sargent Shriver.'' The \nprogram, which\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\naired on the Public Broadcasting Service this past Monday, January 21, \n2008, focuses on Shriver's visionary devotion to activism. By \nhighlighting his role in the civil rights movement and the war on \npoverty, this powerful film will help spread Sargent Shriver's message \nof patriotic service.\n  In closing, I extend my most sincere gratitude to Robert Sargent \nShriver. As a result of this film, his legacy will continue to inspire \nfuture generations of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S195-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING CONGRESSMAN TOM LANTOS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of America's \nmost respected and distinguished lawmakers: chairman of the House \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs, Tom Lantos of California.\n  The story of Congressman Lantos is unique in American history, and \none that serves as an inspiration to each of us. Born in Budapest, \nHungary, on February 1, 1928, this young man displayed the type of \nintellectual precociousness characteristic of our great statesmen of \nthe past. It was during his youth in Central Europe that Congressman \nLantos experienced great joys but also endured a most terrible tragedy.\n  By the time he was 16 years old, the Nazis had occupied his native \nHungary, and as a result of being born into a Jewish family, \nCongressman Lantos was soon taken to a forced labor camp. Through \nunimaginable perseverance and resolve, he survived long enough to \nescape and then complete the 22-mile trek to a safe house run by \nSwedish humanitarian Raoul Wallenberg. Sadly, like so many other Jewish \nfamilies torn apart by the Holocaust, Congressman Lantos lost his \nfamily in the ordeal.\n  A bright moment during these darkest of times in human history was \nthe reunification of two childhood sweethearts. Tom and his lovely wife \nAnnette first met as children growing up in Budapest, and they have now \nentered their 58th year of devoted marriage to one another.\n  Two years after the last shots of World War II were fired, \nCongressman Lantos won a scholarship to study in the United States. \nArriving in America with nothing more than a piece Hungarian salami, he \nbegan his studies at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he \nreceived a B.A. and M.A. in economics. This young academic then moved \nto San Francisco in 1950, where he began graduate studies at the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley, eventually receiving his Ph.D. in \neconomics.\n  Following three decades as a college professor in economics, Tom was \nelected to Congress in 1980 from the State of California. Ever since, \nCongressman Lantos has enjoyed as fine a career in public service as \nany lawmaker of his generation. Perhaps his greatest single \ncontribution to our cherished branch of government was his founding, \nalong with Congressman John Edward Porter of Illinois, of the \nCongressional Human Rights Caucus in 1983. In the intervening quarter-\ncentury, the caucus has brought much-needed attention to the most \npressing human rights crises around the world. In 1987, the caucus \nbecame the first official U.S. entity to welcome recent Congressional \nGold Medal recipient, his Holiness the Dalai Lama, to the United \nStates.\n  Considering Congressman Lantos' wealth of intellect and wisdom in the \nfield of foreign policy, the United States has been privileged to have \nhim serve as chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for the \npast 12 months, where he previously served as ranking member. From \ndemanding tougher sanctions on the Iranian government to standing up \nfor democracy and human rights in Burma, his chairmanship has been \nnothing short of masterful in these most difficult of times. I can \nstand up here today, with the full confidence of my colleagues in the \nSenate, and say that American foreign policy has been greatly enriched \nby the contributions of Congressman Lantos throughout his tenure in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I met Tom before I came to Washington in 1982. He is terrific in so \nmany ways and he is devoted to his wife, children, and grandchildren. \nHis No. 1 priority is his two beautiful daughters, 17 fantastic \ngrandchildren, and two wonderful great-grandchildren. He loves them and \nloves to talk about them.\n  I served with Chairman Lantos during my years as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives and consider him a friend, as well as a \nleader. I shared the sadness of my fellow Senators and House Members, \nwhen Chairman Lantos announced that he will leave the House at the end \nof this year. On behalf of all my friends in the Senate, I wish you and \nyour family all the best as you continue your public service in other \nways following this congressional session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S195-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF BILL GAINER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Bill Gainer \nfor his many professional contributions to my home State and to wish \nhim well as he begins a new chapter in his life. I have known Bill and \nhis wife Gerry for over 20 years. Bill is a proud son of the southside \nof Chicago. He was born in Roseland to Dorothy Quinn and William \nGainer, a second generation Chicago police officer. He and his six \nbrothers and sisters went to St. Wilabroad grammar school and Bill \ngraduated from St. Ignatius in 1958--at 16 years of age. Bill found his \ncalling and started with Illinois Bell in 1960. The next year he joined \nthe Army where he ran phone lines through southern Texas in the 261st \nSignal Construction Corps.\n  Starting at the top--of a telephone pole as a lineman--Bill has \nworked his way through every operation of Illinois Bell--construction/\noperations, installation/repair, marketing, network coordination-\nplanning, and business relations. He ended up at the crossroads in a \njob that combined his depth of knowledge and love for the phone company \nwith his devotion to Chicago and the labor and civic organizations that \nmake it the greatest city in the world.\n  Leveraging his place in the business community with his Irish \nheritage, Bill became an active member in the city of Chicago and Cook \nCounty Irish Trade Missions. Mayor Richard M. Daley appointed Bill as \nthe chairman of the Chicago Sister Cities International Program--Galway \nCommittee in October of 2001. He has hosted mayors, Members of the \nIrish Parliament and business leaders to promote trade and business \ndevelopment between Chicago and Ireland. Bill is also the chairman of \nthe Business Development Committee for the Cook County Irish Trade \nMission to County Down and County Cork. The ever-expanding success of \nthe South Side Irish Parade owes much to Bill. He is the Parade's \nemeritus chair.\n  Bill also has been active in many civic and nonprofit organizations. \nClosest to his heart are his involvement on the advisory board for \nMisericordia Heart of Mercy and the executive board of the Mercy Home \nfor Boys and Girls. Bill was awarded the Misericordia Heart of Mercy \nAward in 2001 for his dedication and devotion to the Misericordia Home \nwhere his sister Rosemary lived many happy years. He is also the past \npresident of the Illinois Veterans Leadership Program, an executive \nboard member of the Irish Fellowship Club, the Chicagoland Chamber of \nCommerce, the Convention and Tourism Bureau, as well as the Irish \nAmerican Alliance. As a result of his deep respect for law enforcement \nand the fact that there has been a Gainer serving continuously on the \nChicago Police Department for over 100 years, Bill is an active member \nand strong supporter of the Hundred Club of Cook County.\n  Bill is the first to admit that behind all these wonderful \naccomplishments is his great wife Gerry, a registered nurse and his six \nchildren, Bill, Bridget, Nora, Maureen, Mary, and Shelia and four \ngrandchildren. Since they met at Duffy's Tavern in 1964, Bill and Gerry \nhave not only been a great team, but also a lot of fun and a wonderful \nexample of marriage and family. I congratulate him and his family and \nwish them the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S195-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S195-S196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on January 21, the Nation recognized the \nbirthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It is important that \nwe honor this day and that we do not let the significance of Dr. King \nfade from our memories, as individuals and as a nation.\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\n  I am pleased that citizens in my State of Arizona have found ways to \nhonor Dr. King and ensure that the lessons of his legacy continue to \nresound among future generations. This past weekend the Senate \nChaplain, Dr. Black, joined me in Phoenix for a number of events \nrelating the King commemoration. Dr. Black preached two sermons and \nlater delivered the keynote address at the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \nYouth Scholarship service, a candlelight ceremony at Pilgrim Rest \nBaptist Church.\n  It is very fitting that these events took place in churches. Dr. \nKing, after all, was a minister, and his speeches and writings invoked \nbiblical themes and were delivered with the zeal of a fiery evangelist. \nMoreover, by recognizing Dr. King in a place of worship, we are \nreminded of the important role that religion plays in the public \nsquare.\n  Indeed, the events like those I attended in Phoenix highlight the \nimportance that religious institutions play in civic life, and I \nbelieve they embody an important past of Dr. King's legacy.\n  Alexis de Tocqueville observed long ago that ``Freedom sees religion \nas the companion of its struggles and triumphs, the cradle of its \ninfancy, and the divine source of its rights. Religion is considered as \nthe guardian of mores, and mores are regarded as the guarantee of the \nlaws and pledge for the maintenance of freedom itself.''\n  Religion is an essential underpinning to a well-ordered society and a \nfunctioning democratic republic. The Founders of our country understood \nthat, and Dr. King did too.\n  In his famous ``I have a dream'' speech, Dr. King invoked the words \nof the Declaration of Independence. On August 28, 1963, he told the \nthrongs who had gathered on The Mall, ``I have a dream that one day \nthis Nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \n`We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created \nequal.'''\n  King believed, as the Founders wrote in the Declaration, that we are \ncreated equal and endowed with the right to life and liberty by our \nCreator. King's speech could have very well been delivered to a \ncongregation at a church instead of before thousands at the Lincoln \nMemorial.\n  In his message at the King celebration in Phoenix, Dr. Black urged \nthe congregation to remember some will seek to destroy the dream and \ndreamer, but God will frustrate their plans.\n  These words echo what King said at the Lincoln Memorial almost 40 \nyears ago, ``With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray \ntogether, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for \nfreedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.''\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that we as Americans understand the \nbond between religion and freedom, and I was pleased to attend the King \ncelebration services this past weekend that testified to this bond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S196-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S196-S197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                          Major Andrew Olmsted\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on January 3, 2008, MAJ Andrew Olmsted of \nNorthborough, MA, was killed in Iraq. He was the first American \nservicemember to die in Iraq this year. During his service there, he \nwrote a number of essays about his service that he posted on the \nInternet. His final essay, written in anticipation of his possible \ndeath, is an eloquent farewell that I believe will be of interest to \nall of us in Congress, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Final Post\n\n                           (January 4, 2008)\n\n       ``I am leaving this message for you because it appears I \n     must leave sooner than I intended. I would have preferred to \n     say this in person, but since I cannot, let me say it here.''\n\n     --G'Kar, Babylon 5.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       ``Only the dead have seen the end of war.''\n\n     --Plato.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       This is an entry I would have preferred not to have \n     published, but there are limits to what we can control in \n     life, and apparently I have passed one of those limits. And \n     so, like G'Kar, I must say here what I would much prefer to \n     say in person. I want to thank Hilzoy for putting it up for \n     me. It's not easy asking anyone to do something for you in \n     the event of your death, and it is a testament to her quality \n     that she didn't hesitate to accept the charge. As with many \n     bloggers, I have a disgustingly large ego, and so I just \n     couldn't bear the thought of not being able to have the last \n     word if the need arose. Perhaps I take that further than \n     most, I don't know. I hope so. It's frightening to think \n     there are many people as neurotic as I am in the world. In \n     any case, since I won't get another chance to say what I \n     think, I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity. Such \n     as it is.\n       ``When some people die, it's time to be sad. But when other \n     people die, like really evil people, or the Irish, it's time \n     to celebrate.''\n\n     --Jimmy Bender, ``Greg the Bunny.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n       ``And maybe now it's your turn to die kicking some ass.''\n\n     --Freedom Isn't Free, Team America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       What I don't want this to be is a chance for me, or anyone \n     else, to be maudlin. I'm dead. That sucks, at least for me \n     and my family and friends. But all the tears in the world \n     aren't going to bring me back, so I would prefer that people \n     remember the good things about me rather than mourning my \n     loss. (If it turns out a specific number of tears will, in \n     fact, bring me back to life, then by all means, break out the \n     onions.) I had a pretty good life, as I noted above. Sure, \n     all things being equal I would have preferred to have more \n     time, but I have no business complaining with all the good \n     fortune I've enjoyed in my life. So if you're up for that, \n     put on a little 80s music (preferably vintage 1980-1984), \n     grab a Coke and have a drink with me. If you have it, throw \n     `Freedom Isn't Free' from the Team America soundtrack in; if \n     you can't laugh at that song, I think you need to lighten up \n     a little. I'm dead, but if you're reading this, you're not, \n     so take a moment to enjoy that happy fact.\n       ``Our thoughts form the universe. They always matter.''\n\n     --Citizen G'Kar, Babylon 5.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Believe it or not, one of the things I will miss most is \n     not being able to blog any longer. The ability to put my \n     thoughts on (virtual) paper and put them where people can \n     read and respond to them has been marvelous, even if most \n     people who have read my writings haven't agreed with them. If \n     there is any hope for the long term success of democracy, it \n     will be if people agree to listen to and try to understand \n     their political opponents rather than simply seeking to crush \n     them. While the blogosphere has its share of partisans, there \n     are some awfully smart people making excellent arguments out \n     there as well, and I know I have learned quite a bit since I \n     began blogging. I flatter myself I may have made a good \n     argument or two as well; if I didn't, please don't tell me. \n     It has been a great five-plus years. I got to meet a lot of \n     people who are way smarter than me, including such luminaries \n     as Virginia Postrel and her husband Stephen (speaking \n     strictly from an `improving the species' perspective, it's \n     tragic those two don't have kids, because they're both scary \n     smart.), the estimable Hilzoy and Sebastian of Obsidian \n     Wings, Jeff Goldstein and Stephen Green, the men who \n     consistently frustrated me with their mix of wit and wisdom I \n     could never match, and I've no doubt left out a number of \n     people to whom I apologize. Bottom line: if I got the chance \n     to meet you through blogging, I enjoyed it. I'm only sorry I \n     couldn't meet more of you. In particular I'd like to thank \n     Jim Henley, who while we've never met has been a true \n     comrade, whose words have taught me and whose support has \n     been of great personal value to me. I would very much have \n     enjoyed meeting Jim.\n       Blogging put me in touch with an inordinate number of smart \n     people, an exhilarating if humbling experience. When I was \n     young, I was smart, but the older I got, the more I realized \n     just how dumb I was in comparison to truly smart people. But, \n     to my credit, I think, I was at least smart enough to pay \n     attention to the people with real brains and even \n     occasionally learn something from them. It has been joy and a \n     pleasure having the opportunity to do this.\n       ``It's not fair.''\n       ``No. It's not.

But if \n     there is an afterlife, I'm telling anyone who asks that I \n     went down surrounded by hundreds of insurgents defending a \n     village composed solely of innocent women and children. It'll \n     be our little secret, ok?\n       I do ask (not that I'm in a position to enforce this) that \n     no one try to use my death to further their political \n     purposes. I went to Iraq and did what I did for my reasons, \n     not yours. My life isn't a chit to be used to bludgeon people \n     to silence on either side. If you think the U.S. should stay \n     in Iraq, don't drag me into it by claiming that somehow\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\n     my death demands us staying in Iraq. If you think the U.S. \n     ought to get out tomorrow, don't cite my name as an example \n     of someone's life who was wasted by our mission in Iraq. I \n     have my own opinions about what we should do about Iraq, but \n     since I'm not around to expound on them I'd prefer others not \n     try and use me as some kind of moral capital to support a \n     position I probably didn't support. Further, this is tough \n     enough on my family without their having to see my picture \n     being used in some rally or my name being cited for some \n     political purpose. You can fight political battles without \n     hurting my family, and I'd prefer that you did so.\n       On a similar note, while you're free to think whatever you \n     like about my life and death, if you think I wasted my life, \n     I'll tell you you're wrong.

While I am not a Libertarian, I \n     certainly hold strongly individualistic beliefs. Yet I have \n     spent my life in a profession that is not generally known for \n     rugged individualism. Worse, I volunteered to return to \n     active duty knowing that the choice would almost certainly \n     lead me to Iraq. The simple explanation might be that I was \n     simply stupid, and certainly I make no bones about having \n     done some dumb things in my life, but I don't think this can \n     be chalked up to stupidity. Maybe I was inconsistent in my \n     beliefs; there are few people who adhere religiously to the \n     doctrines of their chosen philosophy, whatever that may be. \n     But I don't think that was the case in this instance either.\n       As passionate as I am about personal freedom, I don't buy \n     the claims of anarchists that humanity would be just fine \n     without any government at all. There are too many people in \n     the world who believe that they know best how people should \n     live their lives, and many of them are more than willing to \n     use force to impose those beliefs on others. A world without \n     government simply wouldn't last very long; as soon as it was \n     established, strongmen would immediately spring up to \n     establish their fiefdoms. So there is a need for government \n     to protect the people's rights. And one of the fundamental \n     tools to do that is an army that can prevent outside agencies \n     from imposing their rules on a society. A lot of people will \n     protest that argument by noting that the people we are \n     fighting in Iraq are unlikely to threaten the rights of the \n     average American. That's certainly true; while our enemies \n     would certainly like to wreak great levels of havoc on our \n     society, the fact is they're not likely to succeed. But that \n     doesn't mean there isn't still a need for an army (setting \n     aside debates regarding whether ours is the right size at the \n     moment). Americans are fortunate that we don't have to worry \n     too much about people coming to try and overthrow us, but \n     part of the reason we don't have to worry about that is \n     because we have an army that is stopping anyone who would \n     try.\n       Soldiers cannot have the option of opting out of missions \n     because they don't agree with them: that violates the social \n     contract. The duly-elected American government decided to go \n     to war in Iraq. (Even if you maintain President Bush was not \n     properly elected, Congress voted for war as well.) As a \n     soldier, I have a duty to obey the orders of the President of \n     the United States as long as they are Constitutional. I can \n     no more opt out of missions I disagree with than I can ignore \n     laws I think are improper. I do not consider it a violation \n     of my individual rights to have gone to Iraq on orders \n     because I raised my right hand and volunteered to join the \n     army. Whether or not this mission was a good one, my \n     participation in it was an affirmation of something I \n     consider quite necessary to society. So if nothing else, I \n     gave my life for a pretty important principle; I can (if \n     you'll pardon the pun) live with that.\n       ``It's all so brief, isn't it?

Not very much, but then, few of us \n     are destined to make more than a tiny dent in history's Green \n     Monster. I would be lying if I didn't admit I would have \n     liked to have done more, but it's a bit too late for that \n     now, eh? The bottom line, for me, is that I think I can look \n     back at my life and at least see a few areas where I may have \n     made a tiny difference, and massive ego aside, that's \n     probably not too bad.\n       ``The flame also reminds us that life is precious.

Granted, this site will eventually vanish, \n     being ephemeral in a very real sense of the word, but at \n     least for a time it can serve as a tiny record of my \n     contributions to the world. But on a larger scale, for those \n     who knew me well enough to be saddened by my death, \n     especially for those who haven't known anyone else lost to \n     this war, perhaps my death can serve as a small reminder of \n     the costs of war. Regardless of the merits of this war, or of \n     any war, I think that many of us in America have forgotten \n     that war means death and suffering in wholesale lots. A \n     decision that for most of us in America was academic, whether \n     or not to go to war in Iraq, had very real consequences for \n     hundreds of thousands of people. Yet I was as guilty as \n     anyone of minimizing those very real consequences in lieu of \n     a cold discussion of theoretical merits of war and peace. Now \n     I'm facing some very real consequences of that decision; who \n     says life doesn't have a sense of humor?\n       But for those who knew me and feel this pain, I think it's \n     a good thing to realize that this pain has been felt by \n     thousands and thousands (probably millions, actually) of \n     other people all over the world. That is part of the cost of \n     war, any war, no matter how justified. If everyone who feels \n     this pain keeps that in mind the next time we have to decide \n     whether or not war is a good idea, perhaps it will help us to \n     make a more informed decision. Because it is pretty clear \n     that the average American would not have supported the Iraq \n     War had they known the costs going in. I am far too cynical \n     to believe that any future debate over war will be any less \n     vitriolic or emotional, but perhaps a few more people will \n     realize just what those costs can be the next time.\n       This may be a contradiction of my above call to keep \n     politics out of my death, but I hope not. Sometimes going to \n     war is the right idea. I think we've drawn that line too far \n     in the direction of war rather than peace, but I'm a soldier \n     and I know that sometimes you have to fight if you're to hold \n     onto what you hold dear. But in making that decision, I \n     believe we understate the costs of war; when we make the \n     decision to fight, we make the decision to kill, and that \n     means lives and families destroyed. Mine now falls into that \n     category; the next time the question of war or peace comes \n     up, if you knew me at least you can understand a bit more \n     just what it is you're deciding to do, and whether or not \n     those costs are worth it.\n       ``This is true love.

She put up with all \n     of my faults, and they are myriad, she endured separations \n     again and again . . . I cannot imagine being more fortunate \n     in love than I have been with Amanda. Now she has to go on \n     without me, and while a cynic might observe she's better off, \n     I know that this is a terrible burden I have placed on her, \n     and I would give almost anything if she would not have to \n     bear it. It seems that is not an option. I cannot imagine \n     anything more painful than that, and if there is an \n     afterlife, this is a pain I'll bear forever.\n       I wasn't the greatest husband. I could have done so much \n     more, a realization that, as it so often does, comes too late \n     to matter.

Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Specter and I \nintroduced the State Secrets Protection Act. I have been working on \nthis bill with Senator Specter for several months, and I thank him for \nhis commitment and leadership on this very important issue. I hope that \nour collaboration on this legislation will demonstrate that even the \nmost sensitive problems can be addressed through bipartisan cooperation \nif we keep the interests of the Nation front-and-center and roll up our \nsleeves to do the work of seeking a realistic and workable solution. \nThe State Secrets Protection Act is an essential response to a pressing \nneed.\n  For years, there has been growing concern about the state secrets \nprivilege. It is a common law privilege that lets the Government \nprotect sensitive national security information from being disclosed as \nevidence in litigation. The problem is that sometimes plaintiffs may \nneed that information to show that their rights were violated. If the \nprivilege is not applied carefully, the Government can use it as a tool \nfor cover up by withholding evidence that is not actually sensitive. \nThe state secrets privilege is important, but there is a risk it will \nbe overused and abused.\n  The privilege was first recognized by the Supreme Court in 1953, and \nit has been asserted since then by every administration, Republican and \nDemocratic. Under the Bush administration, however, use of the state \nsecrets privilege has dramatically increased and the harmful \nconsequences of its irregular application by courts have become \npainfully clear.\n  Injured plaintiffs have been denied justice, courts have failed to \naddress fundamental questions of constitutional rights and separation \nof powers, and confusion pervades this area of law. The Senate debate \non reforming the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has become far \nmore difficult than it ought to be because many believe that if courts \nhear lawsuits against telecommunications companies, the courts will be \nunable to deal fairly and effectively with the Government's invocation \nof the privilege.\n  Studies show that the Bush administration has raised the privilege in \nover 25 percent more cases per year than previous administrations and \nhas sought dismissal in over 90 percent more cases. As one scholar \nrecently noted, this administration has used the privilege to ``seek \nblanket dismissal of every case challenging the constitutionality of \nspecific, ongoing government programs'' related to its war on \nterrorism, and as a result, the privilege is impairing the ability of \nCongress and the judiciary to perform their constitutional duty to \ncheck executive power.\n  Another leading scholar recently found that ``in practical terms, the \nstate secrets privilege never fails.'' Like other commentators, he \nconcluded that ``the state secrets privilege is the most powerful \nsecrecy privilege available to the president,'' and ``the people of the \nUnited States have suffered needlessly because the law is now a servant \nto executive claims of national security.''\n  In 1980, Congress enacted the Classified Information Procedures Act--\nknown as CIPA--to provide Federal courts with clear statutory guidance \non handling secret evidence in criminal cases. For almost 30 years, \ncourts have effectively applied that law to make criminal trials fairer \nand safer. During that period, Congress has also regulated judicial \nreview of national security materials under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act and the Freedom of Information Act. Because of these \nlaws, Federal judges regularly review and handle highly classified \nevidence in many types of cases.\n  Yet, in civil cases, litigants have been left behind. Congress has \nfailed to provide clear rules or standards for determining whether \nevidence is protected by the state secrets privilege. We have failed to \ndevelop procedures that will protect injured parties and also prevent \nthe disclosure of sensitive information. Because use of the state \nsecrets privilege has escalated in recent years, there is an increasing \nneed for the judiciary and the executive to have clear, fair, and safe \nrules.\n  Many have recognized the need for congressional guidance on this \nissue. The American Bar Association recently issued a report ``urg[ing] \nCongress to enact legislation governing Federal\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\ncivil cases implicating the state secrets privilege.'' The bipartisan \nConstitution Project found that ``legislative action [on the privilege] \nis essential to restore and strengthen the basic rights and liberties \nprovided by our constitutional system of government.'' Leading \nconstitutional scholars sent a letter to Congress emphasizing that \nthere ``is a need for new rules designed to protect the system of \nchecks and balances, individual rights, national security, fairness in \nthe courtroom, and the adversary process.''\n  The State Secrets Protection Act we are introducing responds to this \nneed by creating a civil version of CIPA. The act provides guidance to \nthe Federal courts in handling assertions of the privilege in civil \ncases, and it restores checks and balances to this crucial area of law \nby placing constraints on the application of state secrets doctrine. \nThe act will strengthen our national security by requiring judges to \nprotect all state secrets from disclosure, and it will strengthen the \nrule of law by preventing misuse of the privilege and enabling more \nlitigants to achieve justice in court.\n  Recognizing that state secrets must be protected, the Act enables the \nexecutive branch to avoid publicly revealing evidence if doing so might \ndisclose a state secret. If a court finds that an item of evidence \ncontains a state secret, or cannot be effectively separated from other \nevidence that contains a state secret, then the evidence is privileged \nand may not be released for any reason. Secure judicial proceedings and \nother safeguards that have proven effective under CIPA and the Freedom \nof Information Act will ensure that the litigation does not reveal \nsensitive information.\n  At the same time, the State Secrets Protection Act will prevent the \nexecutive branch from using the privilege to deny parties their day in \ncourt or shield illegal activity that is not actually sensitive. A \nrecently declassified report shows that the executive branch abused the \nstate secrets privilege in the very Supreme Court case, United States \nv. Reynolds (1953), that serves as the basis for the privilege today. \nIn Reynolds, an accident report was kept out of court due to the \ngovernment's claim that it would disclose state secrets. The court \nnever even looked at the report. Now that the report has been made \npublic, we've learned that in fact it contained no state secrets \nwhatever but it did contain embarrassing information revealing \ngovernment negligence.\n  In recent years, Federal courts have applied the Reynolds precedent \nto dismiss numerous cases--on issues ranging from torture, to \nextraordinary rendition, to warrantless wiretapping--without ever \nreviewing the evidence. Some courts have even upheld the executive's \nclaims of state secrets when the purported secrets were publicly \navailable, as in the case of El-Masri v. Tenet. In that case, there was \nextensive evidence in the public record that the plaintiff was \nkidnapped and tortured by the CIA on the basis of mistaken identity, \nbut the court simply accepted at face value the Government's claim that \nlitigation would require disclosure of state secrets. The court \ndismissed Mr. El-Masri's case without even evaluating the evidence or \nconsidering whether the case could be litigated on other evidence.\n  When Federal courts accept the executive branch's state secrets \nclaims as absolute, our system of checks and balances breaks down. By \nrefusing to consider key pieces of evidence, or by dismissing lawsuits \noutright without considering any evidence at all, courts give the \nexecutive branch the ability to violate American laws and \nconstitutional rights without any accountability or oversight, and \ninnocent victims are left unable to obtain justice. The kind of abuse \nthat occurred in Reynolds will no longer be possible under the State \nSecrets Protection Act.\n  The act requires courts to examine the evidence for which the \nprivilege is claimed, in order to determine whether the executive \nbranch has validly invoked the privilege. The court must look at the \nactual evidence, not just Government affidavits about the evidence, and \nmake its own assessment of whether information is covered by the \nprivilege. Only after a court has considered the evidence and found \nthat it provides a valid legal defense can it dismiss a claim on state \nsecrets grounds.\n  The act also gives parties an opportunity to make a preliminary case \nwith their own evidence, and it allows courts to develop solutions to \nlet lawsuits proceed, such as by directing the Government to produce \nunclassified substitutes for secret evidence. Many of these powers are \nalready available to courts, but they often go unused. In addition, the \nact draws on CIPA to include provisions for congressional reporting \nthat will ensure an additional layer of oversight.\n  I am pleased that the senior Senator from Pennsylvania and I have \nbeen able to work together to produce this bill. We expect to have a \nhearing soon on the state secrets privilege in the Judiciary Committee \nunder the leadership of Chairman Leahy, who is a cosponsor of the bill \nand a strong supporter of state secrets reform. I look forward to a \nfull airing of the issues and the important feedback that will come \nfrom the committee's thoughtful consideration of the legislation.\n  In particular, as the bill moves forward, we intend to continue to \nexplore the possibilities for providing relief to plaintiffs who have a \nwinning case but cannot get a trial because every piece of evidence \nthey need is privileged. This is an extremely difficult subject, which \nCongress should address if we can find a fair way to do so that will \nalso protect legitimate secrets. We will also explore other measures to \nmake the bill stronger, such as providing expedited security clearance \nreviews for attorneys.\n  Under the State Secrets Protection Act, the Nation will be able to \npreserve its commitment to individual rights and the rule of law, \nwithout compromising its national defense or foreign policy. Congress \nhas clear constitutional authority to regulate the rules of procedure \nand evidence for the Federal courts, and it is long past time for us to \nexercise this authority on such an important issue. I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to pass this needed legislation as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to discuss the State Secrets \nProtection Act of 2008. Senator Kennedy and I are introducing this \nbipartisan bill in order to harmonize the law applicable in cases \ninvolving the executive branch's invocation of the privilege. This bill \nis timely for several reasons. First, the use of the privilege appears \nto be on the rise in the post-September 11, 2001, era, which has \ngenerated new public attention and concern about its legitimacy. \nSecond, there is some disparity among the district and appellate court \nopinions analyzing the privilege, particularly as to the question of \nwhether courts must independently review the allegedly privileged \nevidence. Finally, a codified test for evaluating state secrets that \nrequires courts to review the evidence in camera--a Latin phrase \nmeaning ``in the judge's private chambers''--will help to reassure the \npublic that the claims are neither spurious nor intended to cover up \nalleged Government misconduct. With greater checks and balances and \ngreater accountability, there is a commensurate increase in public \nconfidence in our institutions of Government.\n  In view of its increasing use, inconsistent application, and public \ncriticism, we think the time is ripe to pass legislation codifying \nstandards on the state secrets privilege. Our bill builds upon \nproposals by the American Bar Association and legal scholars who have \ncalled upon Congress to legislate in this area.\n  Mr. President, I begin my remarks by discussing some of the \nhistorical and more recent applications of the state secrets doctrine--\nwhich have run the gamut from cases involving military aviation \ntechnology to CIA sources and methods, to extraordinary rendition and \nthe terrorist surveillance program, or TSP.\n  In the 1876 case Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105, 1876, the \nSupreme Court acknowledged a privilege that barred claims between the \nGovernment and its covert agents ``in all secret employments of the \ngovernment in time of war, or upon matters affecting our foreign \nrelations, where a disclosure of the service might compromise or \nembarrass our government in its public duties, or endanger the person \nor injure the character of the agent.'' The Totten case involved a \npurported Civil War spy who sought to sue President\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\nLincoln to enforce an alleged espionage agreement. In 2005, the Court \nreaffirmed the holding in Totten that ``lawsuits premised on alleged \nespionage agreements are altogether forbidden.'' Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. \n1, 2005.\n  Notwithstanding Totten, the modern state secrets privilege was first \nrecognized by the Supreme Court in the 1953 case of United States v. \nReynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 1953. Reynolds involved the Government's \nassertion of the military secrets privilege for an accident report \ndiscussing the crash of a B-29 bomber, which killed three civilian \nengineers along with six military personnel. In Reynolds, the Supreme \nCourt set out several rules pertinent to the assertion and \nconsideration of the state secrets privilege. For example, the Court \nsaid the privilege belongs to the Government. It can be neither claimed \nnor waived by a third party. The Court also held that the privilege \nmust be asserted ``in a formal claim of privilege lodged by the head of \nthe department which has control over the matter, after actual \nconsideration by that officer.'' Further, ``the showing of necessity \nwhich is made will determine how far the court should probe in \nsatisfying itself that the occasion for invoking the privilege is \nappropriate.'' Significantly, however, the Supreme Court held that the \nmaterial in question need not necessarily be disclosed to the reviewing \njudge. On this point, the Reynolds Court said:\n\n       Judicial control over the evidence in a case cannot be \n     abdicated to the caprice of executive officers. Yet we will \n     not go so far as to say that the court may automatically \n     require a complete disclosure to the judge before the claim \n     of privilege will be accepted in any case. It may be possible \n     to satisfy the court, from all the circumstances of the case, \n     that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the \n     evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest \n     of national security, should not be divulged. When this is \n     the case, the occasion for the privilege is appropriate, and \n     the court should not jeopardize the security which the \n     privilege is meant to protect by insisting upon an \n     examination of the evidence, even by the judge alone, in \n     chambers.\n\n  Unfortunately, this limitation on judicial review ultimately led to \nfurther litigation and public skepticism when the accident report from \nthe Reynolds case was later declassified--a result the State Secrets \nProtection Act seeks to avoid in future cases.\n  In 2003, after the documents at issue in Reynolds were declassified, \none of the original plaintiffs and heirs of the others brought suit \nalleging that the Government had committed a ``fraud upon the court.'' \nI cite Herring v. United States, 424 F.3d 384 (3d Cir. 2005), cert. \ndenied by Herring v. United States, 547 U.S. 1123, May 1, 2006. They \nclaimed the Government had asserted the military secrets privilege for \ndocuments that did not reveal anything sensitive simply to conceal the \nGovernment's own negligence. Nevertheless, both the district court and \nthe Third Circuit declined to reopen the case after finding that the \nplaintiffs could not meet the high burden for proving a claim of fraud \non the court. The Third Circuit wrote:\n\n       We further conclude that a determination of fraud on the \n     court may be justified only by ``the most egregious \n     misconduct directed to the court itself,'' and that it ``must \n     be supported by clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence.'' \n     The claim of privilege by the United States Air Force in this \n     case can reasonably be interpreted to include within its \n     scope information about the workings of the B-29, and \n     therefore does not meet the demanding standard for fraud upon \n     the court.\n\n  I cite Herring, 386-387. This ruling, however, did not end public \ndebate on the matter. As recently as last October, the New York Times \neditorialized: ``[T]he Reynolds case itself is an object lesson in why \ncourts need to apply a healthy degree of skepticism to state secrets \nclaims. . . . When the documents finally became public just a few years \nago, it became clear that the government had lied. The papers contained \ninformation embarrassing to the government but nothing to warrant top \nsecret treatment or denying American citizens honest adjudication of \ntheir lawsuit.''\n  Upon learning of the Herring case, which was filed in Philadelphia, \nit became clear to me that codifying provisions for a court to use in \nruling on state secrets cases was desirable for a number of reasons--\nincluding the added legitimacy of having a judge evaluate the validity \nof the claim. I think that by requiring in camera court review, we will \nultimately provide parties with greater trust in the integrity of the \nclaim and, importantly, appropriate closure.\n  The benefits of court review are illustrated by recent events in the \nNinth Circuit. On November 16, 2007, the Ninth Circuit decided Al-\nHaramain Islamic Foundation, Inc. v. Bush, 507 F.3d 1190 (9th Cir. \n(Ca.) 2007), a case in which the plaintiffs challenged alleged \nsurveillance of their organization under the terrorist surveillance \nprogram, TSP. The case stands out in TSP jurisprudence because the \nplaintiff alleged the Government had unwittingly provided proof that it \nwas surveilling the plaintiff by inadvertently disclosing a partial \ntranscript of phone conversations. The district court denied the \nGovernment's motion to dismiss on grounds of the state secrets \nprivilege, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Citing Totten and Reynolds, \nthe Al-Haramain court acknowledged that when the very subject matter of \nthe lawsuit is a state secret, dismissal without evaluating the claim \nmight be appropriate. However, given all of the public disclosures \nconcerning the TSP, the Al-Haramain court held that the subject matter \nof the lawsuit was not itself a state secret. Instead, the court \nconcluded that it ``must make an independent determination whether the \ninformation is privileged.'' This is 507 F.3d at 1202. It did so by \nundertaking a full review of the privileged documents in camera. The \nAl-Haramain court described its review of the sealed document at issue \nand the balancing test it imposed:\n\n       Having reviewed it in camera, we conclude that the Sealed \n     Document is protected by the state secrets privilege, along \n     with the information as to whether the government surveilled \n     Al-Haramain. We take very seriously our obligation to review \n     the documents with a very careful, indeed a skeptical, eye, \n     and not to accept at face value the government's claim or \n     justification of privilege. Simply saying ``military \n     secret,'' ``national security'' or ``terrorist threat'' or \n     invoking an ethereal fear that disclosure will threaten our \n     nation is insufficient to support the privilege. Sufficient \n     detail must be--and has been--provided for us to make a \n     meaningful examination. The process of in camera review \n     ineluctably places the court in a role that runs contrary to \n     our fundamental principle of a transparent judicial system. \n     It also places on the court a special burden to assure itself \n     that an appropriate balance is struck between protecting \n     national security matters and preserving an open court \n     system. That said, we acknowledge the need to defer to the \n     Executive on matters of foreign policy and national security \n     and surely cannot legitimately find ourselves second guessing \n     the Executive in this arena.\n\n  I cite 507 F.3d at 1203\n  The State Secrets Protection Act essentially codifies the Al-Haramain \ntest by requiring courts to evaluate the assertion of a state secrets \nprivilege in light of an in camera review of the allegedly privileged \ndocuments. I think it is highly advisable to codify both the means of \nasserting the privilege and the method for reviewing courts to go about \nresolving claims of privilege because the state secrets privilege is \nbeing asserted more frequently and the resulting decisions will benefit \nfrom more consistent procedures. Indeed, one recent study indicates \nthat, of the approximately 89 state secrets cases adjudicated since the \nSupreme Court's decision in Reynolds, courts have declined to review \nany evidence in at least 16 cases. It is unclear whether the courts \nreviewed any evidence in another 16 cases, so the number could be as \nhigh as 32, or more than a third of the total. The current bill would \nend this practice.\n  Reliable statistics on the use of the state secrets privilege are \nsomewhat difficult to come by because not all cases are reported. The \nReporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press claims that, ``while the \ngovernment asserted the privilege approximately 55 times in total \nbetween 1954 . . . and 2001, [the government] asserted it 23 times in \nthe four years after Sept. 11.'' With the use of the privilege \napparently on the rise, the risk of abuse also grows. As I have noted, \ncritics argue that the Government has abused the privilege to cover up \ncases of malfeasance and illegal activity. They point to the aftermath \nof Reynolds and more recently to the case of Khaled El-Masri, whose \nclaim that the was subject to extraordinary rendition was dismissed \nfollowing the Government's successful assertion of the state secrets \nprivilege at the district and appellate court levels. This is El-Masri \nv. United States, 479 F.3d 296 (4th Cir. (Va.) March 2, 2007), cert. \ndenied, 128 S.Ct. 373 (October 9, 2007). Although the Supreme\n\n[[Page S201]]\n\nCourt declined to revisit the state secrets doctrine in the El-Masri \ncase, there is ample cause for congressional action--both to protect \nlegitimate secrets and ensure public confidence in the process for \nadjudicating such privilege claims.\n\n  The State Secrets Protection Act establishes a clear standard for \napplication of the state secrets privilege and creates procedures for \nreviewing courts to follow in evaluating privilege claims. \nSpecifically, the Kennedy-Specter State Secrets Protection Act:\n  Defines state secrets and codifies the standard for evaluating \nprivilege claims: The bill defines ``state secret'' as ``any \ninformation that, if disclosed publicly, would be reasonably likely to \ncause significant harm to the national defense or foreign relations of \nthe United States.'' It requires Federal courts to decide cases after \n``consideration of the interests of justice and national security.''\n  Requires court examination of evidence subject to privilege claims: \nThe legislation requires courts to evaluate the privilege by reviewing \npertinent evidence in camera. By statutorily empowering courts to \nreview the evidence, the bill will substantially mitigate the risk of \nfuture allegations that the Government committed ``fraud upon the \ncourt,'' as asserted by the Reynolds plaintiffs 50 years after the \nlandmark decision.\n  Closes hearings on the privilege--except those involving mere legal \nquestions: Under the legislation, hearings are presumptively held in \ncamera but only ex parte if the court so orders.\n  Requires attorney security clearances: Under the bill, courts must \nlimit participation in hearings to evaluate state secrets to attorneys \nwith appropriate clearances. Moreover, it allows for appointment of \nguardians ad litem with clearances to represent parties who are absent \nfrom proceedings.\n  Permits the Government to produce a nonprivileged substitute: \nConsistent with the Classified Information Procedures Act, the bill \nallows for the use of nonprivileged substitutes, where possible. If the \ncourt orders the Government to provide a nonprivileged substitute and \nthe Government declines to provide it, the court resolves fact \nquestions involving the evidence at issue against the Government.\n  Protects evidence: The proposed bill incorporates the security \nprocedures established in the Classified Information Procedures Act and \npermits the Chief Justice to create additional rules to safeguard state \nsecrets evidence.\n  I commend the bill to all of my Senate colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S201-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING MARTIN P. PAONE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I wish to honor our distinguished \nSecretary of the Majority, Martin Paone, who announced recently his \nplans to leave the Senate after almost 30 years of exemplary service. \nDuring his career in the Senate, Marty has helped to guide this body as \nit has addressed some of the most pressing issues, and faced some of \nthe most difficult challenges, in our Nation's history.\n  Marty began his career in the Congress, working in the House Post \nOffice and the Senate Parking Office. From there, he quickly rose \nthrough the ranks to become an assistant in the Democratic cloakroom in \n1979. After demonstrating his keen understanding of floor procedures, \nhe became a member of the floor staff for the Democratic Policy \nCommittee and later assistant secretary of the majority. In 1995, he \nwas elected as secretary of the minority, and continued to serve in \nthat role, and later as the secretary of the majority, for the \nDemocratic caucus.\n  As we all know, the procedures of the Senate are complicated, and at \ntimes perplexing. Indeed, Americans watching us from home may wonder \nhow we are able get our important legislative work done. Well, one of \nthe principal reasons is that Republican and Democratic Senators alike \nhave been able to rely on Marty's counsel when it comes to questions \nabout the rules of the Senate. Marty possesses a vast and detailed \nknowledge of the history and procedures of the Senate that is possibly \nsecond only to that of our distinguished President Pro Tempore, Senator \nRobert C. Byrd. And he has a well-deserved reputation as a straight \nshooter. Whenever I have approached Marty with a question during my \ntime as a Senator, I have always been able to count on him for a \nstraight answer--even when my position may have run counter to that of \nmy leadership.\n  Throughout his tenure in the Senate, Marty has also served as a \nsteady hand, helping this Chamber through changes in our country's \nleadership and critical events in our Nation's history. Marty's career \nhas been marked by five different Presidents, five Republican Senate \nleaders and four Democratic Senate leaders. Marty has also served \nduring several key historic moments, from the end of the Cold War to \nthe tragic events of September 11, 2001. It was after September 11 that \nMarty's extensive experience and understanding became especially \nimportant as he helped guide this body during an extremely difficult \nand uncertain time. That service to the Senate, and to the country, was \ninvaluable, and I will always remember it.\n  I wish Marty, his wife Ruby, and their three children, Alexander, \nStephanie, and T.J., all the best as Marty begins this new chapter in \nhis life. He will be greatly missed, but he leaves behind a lasting \nimpact that will help guide this body for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S201-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S201-S202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we start a new year--and the Senate \nstarts a new session--the American people have a new law that honors \nand protects their right to know. I am pleased that during the waning \nhours of 2007, the President signed the Leahy-Cornyn Openness Promotes \nEffectiveness in our National Government Act, the ``OPEN Government \nAct,'' S. 2488, into law--enacting the first major reforms to the \nFreedom of Information Act, ``FOIA'' in more than a decade.\n  Today, our Government is more open and accountable to the American \npeople than it was just a year ago. With the enactment of FOIA reform \nlegislation, the Congress has demanded and won more openness and \naccountability regarding the activities of the executive branch. I call \non the President to vigorously and faithfully execute the OPEN \nGovernment Act, and I hope that he will fully enforce this legislation.\n  Sadly, the early signs from the administration are troubling. Just \nthis week, the administration signaled that it will move the much-\nneeded funding for the Office of Government Information Services \ncreated under the OPEN Government Act from the National Archives and \nRecords Administration to the Department of Justice. Such a move is not \nonly contrary to the express intent of the Congress, but it is also \ncontrary to the very purpose of this legislation--to ensure the timely \nand fair resolution of American's FOIA requests. Given its abysmal \nrecord on FOIA compliance during the last 7 years, I hope that the \nadministration will reconsider this unsound decision and enforce this \nlaw as the Congress intended.\n  In addition, for the first time ever under the new law implementing \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, Federal agencies will be \nrequired to fully disclose to Congress their use of data mining \ntechnology to monitor the activities of ordinary American citizens. I \nam pleased that this law contains the reforms that I cosponsored last \nyear to require data mining reporting and to strengthen the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board.\n  Surely all of these OPEN Government reforms are cause to celebrate. \nBut there is much more work to be done.\n  During the second session of the 110th Congress, I intend to work \nhard to build upon these OPEN Government successes, so that we have a \ngovernment that is more open and accountable to all Americans. As \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have made oversight of the FOIA \nreforms contained in the OPEN Government Act one of my top priorities. \nI will also continue to work closely with Members on both sides of the \naisle and in both Chambers to address the growing and troubling use of \nFOIA (b)(3) exemptions to withhold information from the American \npeople.\n  As the son of a Vermont printer, I understand the great value of \ndocumenting and preserving our Nation's rich history for future \ngenerations, so that our democracy remains open and\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\nfree. Next month, I will convene an important hearing of the Judiciary \nCommittee on the Founding Fathers Project and the effort to make the \nhistorical writings of our Nation's Founders more accessible and open \nto the public.\n  I will also work to ensure Senate passage of the Presidential Records \nAct Amendments of 2007, S. 886 to reverse a troubling Bush \nadministration policy to curtail the disclosure of Presidential \nrecords. And I will continue my fight to ensure the public's right to \nknow by urging the prompt consideration and passage of meaningful press \nshield legislation in the Senate.\n  More that two centuries ago, Patrick Henry proclaimed that ``[t]he \nliberties of a people never were, nor ever will be, secure, when the \ntransactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.'' I could not \nagree more. Open government is not a Democratic value, nor a Republican \nvalue. It is an American value and an American virtue. In this new \nyear, at this new and historic time for our Nation, I urge all Members \nto join me in supporting an agenda of an open and transparent \nGovernment on behalf of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S202-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation \nintroduced this week to extend unemployment benefits temporarily as a \nmeans of stimulus. Like many of my colleagues I certainly have a list \nof ideas for best stimulating our struggling economy. But unemployment \ninsurance certainly needs to be a part of the picture. I would like to \nthank Senator Kennedy for so quickly introducing this bill to extend \ncurrent unemployment benefits by at least 20 weeks, and by an \nadditional 13 weeks in States experiencing especially high unemployment \nrates.\n  There are two key principles this legislation addresses. First, we \nneed to make sure that we are prudently spending money in a way that \nencourages an increase in actual economic activity. Second, we need to \nhelp the people who are most hurt during difficult times. We need a \ncombination of prudent fiscal policy and human compassion.\n  So first, it is just plain good sense to target people who are \nunemployed. They are going to spend this money immediately on food and \nclothing, and this money will very quickly churn in the local economy. \nBut equally importantly, the goal of stimulating the economy should be \none of improving the quality of life for Americans. The people who are \nin the greatest need of help, directly hurt by economic decline, are \nthose who have lost their jobs. It only makes sense that we make their \nneeds a priority.\n  I think that this period of economic difficulty also highlights the \nneed to pass the broader unemployment reform efforts that Senator \nKennedy is spearheading. While this stimulus measure will help many \npeople who are unemployed, we need to cover part-time workers who have \nlost their jobs, and make sure we are counting all recent periods of \nwork toward unemployment eligibility and levels.\n  Extending unemployment benefits is regularly employed to stimulate a \nflagging economy, and these payments have been proven to quickly add \ndemand to the economy. I hope that we are all in agreement that this is \nan essential component of any stimulus package.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S202-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             RECOGNIZING GANNESTON CONSTRUCTION CORPORATION\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a small business \nfrom Maine's capital city that will be honored this coming Friday for \nearning the Kennebec Valley Chamber of Commerce's President's Award for \nits outstanding contributions to the quality of life in the greater \nAugusta area. Ganneston Construction Corporation, a woman-owned \nconstruction business that works in both the public and private \nspheres, is known for its sparkling and dependable structures.\n  Founded early in the 1960s as a builder of solely residential units, \nGanneston Construction subsequently moved into commercial construction \nand has continued to expand into other markets since. Presently a full-\nservice general contractor, construction manager, and design builder, \nGanneston has taken on projects of varying sizes throughout Maine, and \neach job is performed in a timely manner with painstaking sensitivity \nto that particular building's unique requirements. The firm has \nrestored landmarks like the Lewiston Library, made renovations to the \nwell-known Senator Inn in Augusta, and provided the Maine Veteran's \nHome and Down East Community Hospital in Machias with a new facility. \nGanneston has completed roughly 100 projects so far this decade, with \nexamples of its work on display in cities and towns across Maine. \nBecause the company's 45 employees consistently produce buildings of \nremarkable quality, annual sales have grown from $6 million in 2001 to \n$15 million in 2007.\n  While Ganneston is to be commended for its dedication to building \nsafe and secure structures, the community service its employees perform \nis what makes Ganneston so deserving of acknowledgment. Setting an \ninspirational example is Stacey Morrison, chief executive officer and \nowner of Ganneston Construction. In addition to managing the company's \nday-to-day operations, Mrs. Morrison makes time to serve the local area \nin multiple ways. She is a member of the board of Women Unlimited, a \npraiseworthy Maine organization that supplies women, minority, and \ndisplaced workers with the tools, training, and consistent support \nneeded to be successful in the technical, trade, and transportation \nindustries. Similarly, Mrs. Morrison volunteers for the Kennebec Valley \nUnited Way and was recently elected chairwoman of the chapter for 2008. \nGanneston's employees have emulated Mrs. Morrison's compassion and \nleadership and have donated countless hours and dollars to service \norganizations throughout central Maine.\n  Ganneston Construction's record of success and service is stellar. On \nthe one hand, Ganneston has never failed to complete a contract and \ncontinues to see its workload rise as a result of its first-rate \nperformance. Whether constructing for the Air National Guard or the \nUniversity of Maine, for shopping centers or apartment complexes, \nGanneston maintains a commitment to solid craftsmanship that has helped \nthe company earn its prestigious reputation. On the other hand, the \ncompany's officers and employees donate significant time and resources \nto help those in need, making good on Ganneston's value statement ``to \ngive back to the community in which we live.'' I thank Stacey Morrison \nand everyone at Ganneston Construction for their hard work and \ndetermined generosity, and congratulate them on their \nrecognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S202-4", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S202-S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ROBERT O. ANDERSON\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Robert O. Anderson was not a \ncitizen just of New Mexico, but I think it can be fairly said that he \nwas one of those people for whom the term ``citizen of the world'' was \nintended.\n  He died in December at age 90, and his memory was honored at this \npast weekend services in Roswell, NM. Our State has been his home for \ndecades. Those of us who knew him were reminded each time we talked \nwith him how wide-ranging his interests were, and how progressive and \ndetermined a man he was. It was his leadership and willingness to take \na risk that led to the discovery of oil on the North Slope of Alaska, \nand the pipeline that followed 7 years later.\n  He was a giant in the oil industry, in ranching, in business, in \npublishing, in politics and in environmental circles. A thoughtful and \nperceptive man--he warned of global warming years ago--he was a patron \nof the arts and of institutions devoted to study and research,\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\nincluding the Aspen Institute, the Worldwatch Institute and the John \nMuir Institute of the Environment.\n  As far as I know, he never sought public office, but he certainly \nheld positions of public trust. He was quoted as saying of his \nindustry:\n\n       Never look back in this business. If you do, you'll lose \n     your nerve.''\n\n  He certainly had that in common with many elected officials, \nincluding Members of this body, and Presidents of the United States, \nall of whom regarded him highly as did countless international leaders. \nHe could ``walk with kings, nor lose the common touch.'' It was that \nability which was a hallmark of his leadership, and was one of his most \nendearing and enduring qualities.\n  Married to Barbara Phelps Anderson for 68 years, he is survived by \nher, and by 7 children, 20 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. \nTheir loss is a great and one we all share in some measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S203-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        30TH ANNIVERSARY OF WOMEN ESCAPING A VIOLENT ENVIRONMENT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the 30th \nanniversary of one of the Capital region's most vital nonprofit \nagencies, Women Escaping a Violent Environment Inc., WEAVE, in \nSacramento, CA. In its three decades of service, WEAVE has provided \ninvaluable public service to victims of domestic abuse, as well as \ntheir families, and has helped to save countless lives as a result of \nthe education, counseling, and intervention they have provided to \nvictims of domestic abuse and sexual assault.\n  WEAVE was established in 1978 in Sacramento as a grassroots \norganization to serve survivors of domestic violence and their families \nby providing crisis lines and counseling services. Within the first 10 \nyears of its establishment, WEAVE broadened its role in the community \nto include legal advocacy, opened a safehouse that provides emergency \nservices to female victims of domestic violence and their children, and \nbecame a dual agency that expanded its mission to include sexual \nassault services. Victims are accompanied to appointments and are given \nemotional support, information, counseling, food and clothing.\n  In the next decade WEAVE recognized that employers and schools could \nalso be part of a solution in preventing domestic abuse and sexual \nassault. They provided prevention education to elementary and high \nschools, and began their Break the Silence Campaign that increases \nawareness of domestic violence by educating employers and their \nemployees to recognize signs of abuse and how to best respond. During \nthe 1990s, WEAVE also opened a Children's Center and WEAVE Works retail \nclothing store that provide revenues to support their mission in the \ncommunity.\n  Today WEAVE has 80 staff members and over 200 active volunteers in \ntwo locations, who serve over 20,000 survivors of domestic violence and \nsexual assault annually with intervention and counseling services, \nalong with educating an additional 10,000 members of the community on \nissues of domestic violence and sexual assault. WEAVE has achieved this \nsuccess through partnerships with local law enforcement, government and \nbusiness leaders.\n  As the community and staff gather to celebrate WEAVE's 30th \nanniversary, I congratulate and thank the staff, volunteers and \ncommunity partners of this important organization and wish them many \nmore years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S203-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING KENT HAWS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of a dedicated public servant, Detective Kent Haws \nof the Tulare County Sheriff's Department. On the afternoon of December \n17, 2007, while on motor patrol in rural Tulare County, Detective Haws \nwas killed in the line of duty while investigating a suspicious \nvehicle.\n  Detective Haws was born in Phoenix, AZ and raised in Visalia, CA. A \ngraduate of Mt. Whitney High School and College of the Sequoias, \nDetective Haws served in the United States Army 10th Mountain Division \nbefore achieving his long-time goal of joining the Tulare County \nSheriff's Department. For the past decade, Detective Haws dutifully \nserved the citizens and communities of Tulare County with great \ncommitment, integrity, and valor. Detective Haws' devotion to help \nothers, coupled with his passion for law enforcement, enabled him to \nbecome a model member of the Tulare County Sheriff's Department.\n  Detective Haws is survived by his wife Frances and children Dominik, \nNicholas, and Evan. Those who knew Detective Haws will always remember \nhim as a caring, kind, and devoted family man, colleague, and friend. \nDetective Kent Haws served Tulare County with honor and bravery, and \nfulfilled his oath as an officer of the law. His contributions to \npublic safety and dedication to law enforcement are greatly appreciated \nand will serve as an example of his commitment to protecting and \nserving the public.\n  We shall always be grateful for Detective Haws' heroic service and \nthe sacrifices he made while serving the community and the people he \nloved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S203-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN CELEBRATION OF LOUIS BURGELIN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to pay \ntribute to Louis--Lou--Brosnahan Burgelin for his 65-plus years of \ndedicated service to the greater Vallejo community.\n  Born on January 20, 1916 in Vallejo, CA, to Otto and Frances \nBurgelin, Lou graduated from Vallejo High School in 1932 and went on to \ngraduate from the Mare Island Naval Shipyard Apprentice School as a \nmarine machinist.\n  Always eager to exceed expectations, Lou held numerous management \npositions throughout his career with the United States Navy, including \nproduction control manager at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, chief progressman \nat Mare Island, and head progressman at Hunter's Point. In addition, \nLou worked his way up from charter member to national president of the \nNaval Civilian Manager's Association and also served as president of \nthe Council of Naval Employee Groups, which represents all of the \nemployees of West Coast naval shipyards.\n  After retiring from Federal service in 1972, Lou became the executive \nsecretary of the Armed Services Committee of the Vallejo Chamber of \nCommerce, a position he held for 19 years. This was just one of many \nleadership positions he held in his beloved hometown, with other civic \nengagements including first chairman of the Vallejo Senior Citizens \nCenter, Exalted Ruler of the Vallejo Elks Lodge, and president of the \nVallejo-Napa United Way.\n  Lou was also actively involved with the city of Vallejo's naval \nlandmark, Mare Island. His lobbying efforts for military construction \nprojects on Mare Island and his efforts to maintain dredging operations \nnecessary for shipyard operations culminated in his receipt of the \nPublic Service Medal by the Navy's Chief of Operations.\n  Proving that age will not slow him down, Lou is still active in the \ngreater Vallejo community, currently serving as president of the \nVallejo Council of the Navy League of the United States, treasurer for \nthe Salvation Army, and national legislative chair for the Vallejo \nNARFE Chapter 16. In addition to his ongoing civic involvement, Lou \nremains happily married to the former Betty Greenwell. Approaching 69 \nyears of marriage, Lou and Betty have three children, three \ngrandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.\n  When I first met Lou in the eighties, I knew he was a powerful voice \nfor his community and he became one of my top advisors when I \nrepresented Vallejo in Congress.\n  After more than 65 years of continuing service to the city of Vallejo \nand U.S. Navy, I remain in admiration of Lou's strong sense of civic \nduty. Along with hundreds of his friends and admirers throughout the \ncity of Vallejo, I wish him many more years of continued community \ninvolvement and leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S203-4", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S203-S204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S203-4", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S203-S204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S204-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S204-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under authority of the order of January 4, 2007, the following \nenrolled bills, previously signed by the Speaker pro tempore of the \nHouse, were signed on December 20, 2007, during the recess of the \nSenate, by the President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd):\n\n       S. 2271.

A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to establish an Interagency Working Group on \nEnvironmental Justice to provide guidance to Federal agencies on the \ndevelopment of criteria for identifying disproportionately high and \nadverse human health or environmental effects on minority populations \nand low-income populations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. CLINTON, Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nEnvironmental Justice Renewal Act, legislation to address the issue of \nenvironmental racism that is faced by far too many Americans today.\n  In our country, we have communities predominantly racial and ethnic \nminority and low-income communities in which the air is unsafe to \nbreathe, the water unfit to drink, the schools unsafe places to learn.\n  A 2005 Associated Press analysis of Environmental Protection Agency, \nEPA, air data found that African Americans were 79 percent more likely \nthan their white counterparts to live in an area where the levels of \nair pollution posed health risks. About half of lower-income homes in \nour Nation are located within a mile of factories that report toxic \nemissions to the EPA. Hispanic and African-American children have lead \npoisoning rates that are roughly double that of their white \ncounterparts. The evidence clearly documents the disproportionate \nimpact of pollution faced by minority and low-income populations.\n  For more than a quarter-century, activists have been working to \naddress this disparity in exposure. The work of residents in Warren \nCounty, NC, in protesting the placement of a toxic waste site in a \npredominantly African-American community sparked the modern-day \nenvironmental justice movement. Since that time, individuals in all \nparts of the United States have spoken out about the conditions in \ntheir own neighborhoods, and have joined together with schools, with \nchurches, and with local organizations to create positive change in \ntheir communities. But they cannot act alone. The Federal Government \nhas a clear role in reducing and eliminating the disparate pollution \nburden placed upon racial and ethnic minorities and low-income \npopulations.\n  This role has been acknowledged by the Federal Government by \nindividuals on both sides of the aisle. Under the first Bush \nadministration, the EPA released several reports on what was then known \nas environmental equity, now called environmental justice. President \nClinton promulgated Executive Order 12898, titled ``Federal Actions to \nAddress Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income \nPopulations,'' which directed federal agencies to account for the ways \nin which their activities would impact low-income and minority \ncommunities. The Federal Government took action to ensure that \nenvironmental justice was part of the mission of its agencies.\n  But under the current Bush administration, the EPA has not lived up \nto its motto ``to protect human health and the environment.'' Because \nof their inaction on environmental justice, too many minority and low-\nincome Americans lack equal access to protections that safeguard \nhealth, well being, and potential of children and families.\n  A 2004 report from the EPA's Office of the Inspector General found \nthe following: ``EPA has not fully implemented Executive Order 12898 \nnor consistently integrated environmental justice into its day-to-day \noperations.''\n  In 2005, the Government Accountability Office released a report \nconcluding that the agency has failed to consider environmental justice \nin making rules that protect families from environmental degradation \nand pollution.\n  In 2006, the Office of the Inspector General released another report \non the EPA's environmental justice record, concluding that EPA senior \nmanagement had not ``sufficiently directed program and regional offices \nto conduct environmental justice reviews.''\n  Earlier this year, the United Church of Christ released a report, \nToxic Wastes and Race at Twenty, which stated: ``Environmental Justice \nfaltered and became invisible at the EPA under the George W. Bush \nAdministration.''\n  The Environmental Justice Renewal Act will address the rollbacks that \nhave taken place during this Administration, and once again focus \nfederal attention and resources on environmental justice.\n  It will revitalize the Interagency Working Group, IWG, on \nEnvironmental Justice, codifying the IWG and requiring biennial \nassessments of their efforts by the Government Accountability Office, \nto ensure that all agencies are completing goals and following \ntimelines identified in each agency's environmental justice strategy.\n  It will establish new and expand current grant programs. With this \nadditional funding, community groups can address the complicated \nhealth, environmental, and economic components of the pollution \nproblems in their neighborhoods. The legislation will help states, \ntribes and territories develop and implement environmental justice \nstrategies and policies. It will strengthen the technical assistance \navailable to communities, by developing web-based Environmental Justice \nClearinghouse.\n  This bill will increase the number of federal employees who have \nreceived environmental justice training, and who are able to \nincorporate environmental justice into their daily activities, such as \npermit review. In addition, it would establish a training program for \ncommunity members modeled after the existing Superfund training \nprograms to help affected individuals gain the skills needed to \nidentify and monitor environmental concerns in their local areas.\n  Finally, the bill will increase public awareness of and participation \nin environmental justice activities, requiring the EPA to routinely \nhold community-based outreach meetings and ensuring increased \ninteraction with the National Environmental Justice Advisory Committee, \nwhich represents stakeholders and impacted communities. It will also \nestablish the position of Environmental Justice Ombudsman at the EPA, \nin order to receive, review, and process comments about the \nenvironmental justice work of the agency.\n  Groups supporting the legislation include the Sierra Club, ReGenesis, \nthe Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment, Earthjustice, the \nIndigenous Environmental Network, and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil \nRights Under Law.\n  We have neglected this issue for far too long, and it is time to once \nagain ensure that the federal government works to reduce and eliminate \nthese disparities that exist in our minority and low-income \ncommunities. I look forward to joining my colleagues in the Senate to \nget this enacted into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S209-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S209-S210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 421--HONORING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN \n                      PRINTING HOUSE FOR THE BLIND\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Bunning) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, let me begin my remarks, I know tomorrow we \nare going to begin more formal debate on the FISA legislation. This is \nto be a continuation of the effort, for those who wonder what this is, \nthis is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This was the debate \nwhich was the last item of debate before the holiday break back in mid-\nDecember.\n  The legislation was withdrawn and was not completed. Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Bond, the chairman and the ranking Republican, and \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Leahy, Senator Specter, \nand members of the Judiciary Committee, Republicans and Democrats have \nworked on this legislation.\n  I wish to begin my comments by thanking them for their efforts on \ntrying to develop a piece of legislation that would reflect the \nrealities of today.\n  There has been some history of this bill. My intention this evening \nis to spend some time talking about a section of this bill dealing with \nretroactive immunity, which my colleagues and others who followed this \ndebate know I spent some 10 hours on the floor of this body back in \nDecember expressing strong opposition to that provision of this bill; \nnot over the general thrust of the bill.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is critically important to \nour country. It provides a means by which you can have a proper warrant \nextended or given out by governmental authorities to collect data, \ninformation, critical to our security.\n  For those who know the history of this, it dates back to the 1970s as \na result of the Church Committee's efforts revealing some of the \negregious activities of the Nixon administration in listening in, \neavesdropping, wiretapping, without any kind of court order, warrant or \nlegal authorities.\n  So the Congress, working in a bipartisan fashion, I think almost \nunanimously adopted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the \nlate 1970s. Since that time, this bill has been amended I think some 30 \nor 40 times, maybe more, I know it has been a number of times over the \nyears. In nearly every instance, almost unanimously amended to reflect \nthe changes over the years and the sophistication of those who would do \nus harm or damage, as well as our ability to more carefully apprehend \nor listen in or gather information that could help us protect our \nNation from those who would do us great harm.\n  That is a very brief history of this. We are once again at a \nsituation to try and modernize and reflect the needs of our Nation. \nThere is a tension that that exists between making sure we are secure \nand safe and simultaneously doing it in a manner in which we protect \nthe basic rights of the American citizens.\n  There has been this tension throughout our history. But we are a \nnation grounded in rights and liberties. It is the history of our \ncountry. It is what made us unique as a people going back more than two \ncenturies.\n  Over the years, we have faced very significant challenges, both at \nhome and abroad. So we have had a need to provide for the means by \nwhich we collect data and information that would protect us, to make us \naware of those who would do us harm, and yet simultaneously make sure \nthat in the process of doing that, we do not abandon the rights and \nliberties we all share as Americans. The Constitution does not belong \nto any political party. I have said that over and over again. Certainly \ntoday, as we debate these issues involving the FISA legislation, I hope \neveryone understands very clearly my objections to the provisions of \nthis bill have nothing to do whatsoever with the important efforts to \nmake it possible for us to collect data that would keep us safe, but I \nfeel passionately that we not allow this vehicle, this piece of \nlegislation, to be used as a means by which we reward behavior that \nviolated the basic liberties of American citizens by granting \nretroactive immunity to telecom companies that decided, for whatever \nreason, to agree, at the Bush administration's request, to provide \nliterally millions of telephone conversations, e-mails, and faxes, not \nfor a month or 6 months or a year but for 5 years, in a concerted \neffort contrary to the law of our land.\n  So that is what brings me to the floor this evening. It is what \nbrought me to the floor of this body before the holiday recess, talking \nand expressing my strong opposition to those provisions of this \nlegislation. There are other concerns I would point out about this bill \nthat other Members will raise. Senator Feingold has strong objections \nto certain provisions of this legislation, others have other ideas I am \nconfident have merit.\n  But I commend Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond. They have done \nthe best job, in many ways, of dealing with these sets of questions. \nBut why in the world we decided we are going to grant retroactive \nimmunity to these telephone companies is what mystifies me, concerns me \ndeeply, because of the precedent-setting nature of it.\n  There are those who would argue that in order for us to be more \nsecure, we must give up some rights, that you have to make that choice. \nYou cannot be secure, as we would like to be, if we are unwilling to \ngive up these rights and liberties.\n  I think this false dichotomy is dangerous. In fact, I think the \nopposite is true. In fact, if you protect these rights and liberties, \nthat is what makes us more secure. Once you begin traveling down that \nslippery slope of deciding on this particular occasion we are going to \nwalk away from these rights and these liberties, once you begin that \nprocess, it gets easier and easier to do.\n  In this case, we are talking about telecom companies. We are talking \nabout communications between private citizens, e-mails, faxes, phone \nconversations. Why not medical information? Why not financial \ninformation? When is the next example going to come up where companies \nthat knew better, not should have known better, knew better, in my \nview.\n  One of the companies that may have complied with the Bush \nadministration's request, in fact, was deeply involved in the drafting \nof this legislation in the 1970s, in putting the FISA bill together. \nThis was not some first year law school student who did not know the \nlaw of the land in terms of FISA, they knew the law, they understood \nit.\n  In fact, there are phone companies that refused to comply with the \nrequest of the Bush administration absent a court order. Those \ncompanies said: Give us a court order, we will comply. Absent a court \norder, we will not comply.\n  So there were companies that understood the differences when these \nrequests were made more than 5 years ago.\n  So this was not a question of ``everybody did it,'' the same argument \nthat children bring to their parents from time to time, or ``we were \nordered on high,'' in what is known as the Nuremberg defense which \nasserts that there were those in higher positions who said we ought to \ndo this. That was the defense given in 1945 at the Nuremberg trials by \nthe 21 defendants who claimed they were only obeying orders given by \nHitler. Though this situation before us is obviously enormously \ndifferent, a similar argument, that the companies were ordered to do \nthis, defies logic and the facts of this case.\n  With that background and the history of the FISA legislation--and \nthere are others who will provide more detail--let me share some \nconcerns about this particular area of the law. I will be utilizing \nwhatever vehicles are available to me, including language I will offer \nto strike these provisions, to see to it that this bill does not go \nforward with retroactive immunity as drafted\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\nin the legislation included in the bill. I rise, in fact, in strong \nopposition to the retroactive immunity provisions of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act as passed by the Intelligence Committee. \nI strongly support the Leahy substitute to the current legislation. It \nis my hope the Senate adopts this important measure. If it does, it \nwill solve this particular problem. However, I am concerned that, once \nagain, we will return to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that \nwill grant retroactive immunity to telecom companies.\n  As my colleagues know, I have strongly opposed retroactive immunity \nfor the telecommunications companies that may have violated the privacy \nof millions of our fellow citizens. Last month, I opposed retroactive \nimmunity on the Senate floor for more than 10 hours. The bill was \nwithdrawn that day, but I am concerned that tomorrow retroactive \nimmunity will return, and I am prepared to fight it again.\n  Since last month, little has changed. Retroactive immunity is as \ndangerous to American civil liberties as it was last month, and my \nopposition to it is just as passionate. The last 6 years have seen the \nPresident--the Bush administration's pattern of continual abuses \nagainst civil liberties.\n  Again, if this were the first instance and it went on for a few \nmonths, a year, these companies acquiescing to an administration's \nrequest, an administration that had made it its business to protect the \nbasic liberties of Americans throughout its terms in office, I would \nnot be standing here. I am not so rigid, so doctrinaire that I am \nunwilling to accept that at times of emergency such as in the wake of \n9/11, you might have such a request being made by an administration--\nnot that I think it is right, but it could happen. I would say if it \ndid and a handful of companies for a few months or a year, even, \ncomplied with it and went forward, I wouldn't be happy about it, but I \nwould understand it. But that is not what happened here. That is not \nwhat this administration has been involved in. From Guantanamo, from \nAbu Ghraib, from rendition, secret prisons, habeas corpus, torture, a \nscandal involving the Attorney General's Office, the U.S. attorneys \noffices around the country--how many examples do you need to have? How \nmany do we have to learn about to finally understand that we have an \nadministration regrettably that just doesn't seem to understand the \nimportance of the rule of law, the basic rights and liberties of the \nAmerican public?\n  My concern is that we had a pattern of behavior, almost nonstop, \ngoing on some 6 years and still apparently ongoing today. Then add that \nto the fact that this collection of data, this collection of \ninformation went on not for 6 months or a year but for 5 long years and \nwould have continued, had there not been a story in the media which \nuncovered, through a whistleblower, that this was going on. It would \nstill be going on today, despite the absence of any court order, or a \nwarrant being granted by the FISA courts. There is a pattern of \nbehavior that is going unchecked, and behavior went on for more than 5 \nyears. That is why I stand here, because I am not going to tolerate--at \nleast this Member is not--accepting these abuses and granting \nretroactive immunity. It is, once again, a walking away from this \nproblem, inviting even more of the same in the coming days.\n  It is alleged, of course, that the administration worked outside the \nlaw with giant telecom corporations to compile Americans' private \ndomestic communications--in other words, a database of enormous scale \nand scope. Those corporations are alleged to have spied secretly and \nwithout warrant on their own American customers.\n  Here is only one of the most egregious examples. According to the \nElectronic Frontier Foundation:\n\n       Clear, first-hand whistleblower documentary evidence \n     [states] . . . that for year on end every e-mail, every text \n     message, every phone call carried over the massive fiber-\n     optic links of sixteen separate companies routed through \n     AT's Internet hub in San Francisco--hundreds of millions of \n     private, domestic communications--have been . . . copied in \n     their entirety by AT and knowingly diverted wholesale by \n     means of multiple ``splitters'' into a secret room controlled \n     exclusively by the NSA.\n\n  Those are not my words; those are the words of the Electronic \nFrontier Foundation. To me, those facts speak clearly. If true, they \nrepresent an outrage against privacy, a massive betrayal of trust.\n  I know many see this differently. No doubt they do so in good faith. \nThey find the telecoms' actions defensible and legally justified. To \nthem, immunity is a fitting defense for companies that were only doing \ntheir patriotic duty. Perhaps they are right. I think otherwise, but I \nam willing to concede they may be right.\n  But the President and his supporters need to prove far more than \nthat. I think they need to show that they are so right and that our \ncase is so far beyond the pale that no court ever need settle the \nargument, that we can shut down the argument here and now. That is what \nthis will do. It will shut down this argument, and we will never, ever \nknow what data was collected, why, who ordered this, who was \nresponsible, if we grant retroactive immunity.\n\n  Retroactive immunity shuts the courthouse door for good. It settles \nthe issue with politicians, not with judges and jurist, and it puts \nAmericans permanently in the dark on this issue. Did the telecoms break \nthe law? I have my own strong views on this but, candidly, I don't \nknow. That is what courts exist for. Pass immunity, and we will never \nknow the answer to that question. The President's favorite corporations \nwill be unchallenged. Their arguments will never be heard in a court of \nlaw. The truth behind this unprecedented domestic spying will never see \nthe light of day. The book on our Government's actions will be closed \nfor good and sealed and locked and handed over to safekeeping of those \nfew whom George Bush trusts to keep a secret.\n  Over the next couple of days, I will do my best to explain why \nretroactive immunity is so dangerous and, conversely, why it is so \nimportant to President Bush. But first it would be useful to consider \nthe history of the bill before us, as I did at the outset of my \nremarks, and how it fits into the history of the President's \nwarrantless spying on Americans.\n  For years, President Bush allowed Americans to be spied on with no \nwarrant, no court order, and no oversight. The origins of this bill, \nthe FISA Amendments Act, lie in the exposure of that spying in 2005.\n  That year, the New York Times revealed President Bush's ongoing abuse \nof power. To quote from that investigation:\n\n       Under a presidential order signed in 2002, the National \n     Security Agency has monitored the international telephone \n     calls and international e-mail messages of hundreds, perhaps \n     thousands of people inside the United States without warrants \n     over the past 3 years.\n\n  In fact, we later learned that the President's warrantless spying was \nauthorized as early as 2001. Disgraced former Attorney General Alberto \nGonzales, in a 2006 white paper, attempted to justify that spying. His \nargument rested on the specious claim that in authorizing the President \nto go to war in Afghanistan, Congress had also somehow authorized the \nPresident to listen in on the phone calls of Americans. But many of \nthose who voted on the original authorization of force found this claim \nto new Executive powers to be laughable.\n  Here is what former majority leader Tom Daschle wrote at the time or \nshortly thereafter:\n\n       As Senate majority leader . . . I helped negotiate that law \n     with the White House counsel's office over two harried days. \n     I can state categorically that the subject of warrantless \n     wiretaps of American citizens never came up. . . . I am also \n     confident that the 98 senators who voted in favor of \n     authorization of force against al Qaeda did not believe that \n     they were also voting for warrantless domestic surveillance.\n\n  Such claims to expand Executive power based on the authorization for \nmilitary force have since been struck down by the courts.\n  Recently, the administration has changed its argument, now grounding \nits warrantless surveillance power in the extremely nebulous authority \nof the President to defend the country that they find in the \nConstitution. Of course, that begs the question, exactly what doesn't \nfit in under defending the country? If we take the President at his \nword, we would concede to him nearly unlimited power, power that \nbelongs in this case in the hands of our courts. Congress has worked to \nbring the President's surveillance program\n\n[[Page S218]]\n\nback where it belongs--under the rule of law. At the same time, we have \nworked to modernize FISA and ease restrictions on terrorist \nsurveillance.\n  The Protect America Act, a bill attempting to respond to the two-\npronged challenge--poorly, in my view--passed in August. But it is set \nto expire this coming February. The bill now before us would create a \nlegal regime for surveillance under reworked and more reasonable rules.\n  But crucially, President Bush has demanded that this bill include \nfull retroactive immunity for corporations complicit in domestic \nspying. In a speech on September 19, he stated that ``it's particularly \nimportant for Congress to provide meaningful liability protection to \nthose companies.'' In October, he stiffened his demand, vowing to veto \nany bill that did not shield the telecom corporations. And last month, \nhe resorted to shameful, misleading scare tactics, accusing Congress of \nfailing ``to keep the American people safe.'' That is absolutely \noutrageous. An American President, at a time when there are serious \nthreats and reliable information that the threat still persists, an \nAmerican President is saying: Despite your efforts to modernize FISA by \nproviding the additional tools we need for proper surveillance on \nterrorist activities, I will veto this bill, I will deny you this \nlegislation, if you don't provide protection for a handful of \ncorporations that violated the law. That is an incredible admission, \nthe fact that he is willing to lose all of the efforts we are making to \nmodernize FISA in order to grant retroactive immunity so you are not in \na court of law. Who is putting the country at greater risk? That is \nwhat the debate is about. That is what the President has said. He will \nveto the bill if we don't provide protection for a handful of \ncorporations that, for 5 long years, when their legal departments knew \nexactly what the law was--AT was involved in the drafting of the FISA \nlegislation in 1978. How can that company possibly claim they didn't \nknow what the law of the land was when it came to FISA, going before \nthe secret FISA courts, getting those warrants to allow for the \nGovernment to go in and do the proper surveillance and grant the \nimmunity that these companies would receive under that kind of a \nsituation. To avoid that court altogether was wrong. For 5 long years, \nthey did that.\n\n  Now the President says: I don't care what Jay Rockefeller or what Kit \nBond or what the Intelligence Committee has done to modernize FISA. If \nyou don't give me those protections I want for those handful of \ncorporations, then you are not going to get this bill that modernizes \nthe surveillance on terrorist activity.\n  The very same month, the FISA Amendments Act came before the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. Per the President's demand, it \nincluded full retroactive immunity for the telecom corporations. Don't \ngive me it, I will veto the bill. And the committee went along. Senator \nNelson of Florida offered an amendment to strip that immunity and \ninstead allow the matter to be settled in the courts. It failed on a 3-\nto-12 vote in committee. As it passed out of the Intelligence Committee \nby a vote of 13 to 2, the bill still put corporations literally above \nthe law and assured that the President's invasion of privacy would \nremain a secret.\n  At that time, I made public my strong objections on immunity, but the \nbill also had to pass through the Judiciary Committee. Through an open \nand transparent process, the Judiciary Committee amended several \nprovisions relating to title I and reported out a bill lacking the \negregious immunity provisions. However, I am still concerned that when \nSenator Feingold proposed an amendment to strip immunity for good, it \nfailed by a vote of 7 to 12 in the committee.\n  So here we are, facing a final decision on whether the \ntelecommunications companies will get off the hook for good without us \never knowing anything more about it, because if you grant immunity, \nthat is it. We will never learn anything else. The President is as \nintent as ever he was on making that happen. He wants immunity back in \nthis bill at all costs, including a willingness to veto very important \nlegislation, without the meaningful provisions of this bill that would \nprovide this country with the kind of protection and security we ought \nto have. He is willing to lose all of that. He is willing to trade off \nall of that to give a handful of corporations immunity.\n\n  What he is truly offering is secrecy in place of openness. Fiat in \nplace of law. And in place of the forthright argument of judicial \ndeliberation that ought to be this country's pride, there are two \nsimple words he offers: Trust me.\n  I would never take that offer, not even from a perfect President. \nBecause in a republic, power was made to be shared; because power must \nbe bound by firm laws, not the whims of whomever happens to sit in the \nExecutive chair; because only two things make the difference between a \nPresident and a king--the oversight of the legislative body, and the \nrulings of the courts.\n  It is why our Founders formed this Government the way they did, with \nthree branches of government coequally sharing the powers to govern. \nEach is a check on the other. That is what the Founders had been \nthrough: the absence of that.\n  ``Trust me.'' Those two small words bridge the entire gap between the \nrule of law and the rule of men, and it is a dangerous irony that when \nwe need the rule of law the most, the rule of men is at its most \nseductive.\n\n       It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is \n     to be charged to the provisions against danger . . . from \n     abroad.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is \n     to be charged to the provisions against danger . . . from \n     abroad.\n\n  That is from James Madison, the father of our Constitution. He made \nthat prediction more than two centuries ago. If we pass immunity, and \nput our President's word above the courts and witnesses and evidence \nand deliberations, we bring that prophecy a step closer to coming true.\n  I repeat it again:\n\n       It is a universal truth that the loss of liberty at home is \n     to be charged to the provisions against danger . . . from \n     abroad.\n\n  James Madison.\n  So that is the deeper issue behind this bill. That is the source of \nmy passion, if you will. I reject President Bush's ``trust me'' because \nI have seen what we get when we accept it.\n  I go back and mention just the maze, the list of egregious violations \nof the rule of law over the last 6 years. With that aside, were this a \nDemocratic administration that would suggest this, I would be as \npassionate about it, not because I distrust them necessarily but \nbecause once we succumb to the passions or the desires of the rule of \nmen over the rule of law, then we trade off the most important \nfundamental essence of who we are as a people.\n  We are a nation of laws and not men. How many times have we heard \nthat? You learn that in your first week of constitutional law. You \nlearn in your American history class as a high school student the \nimportance of the rule of law. If we walk away from that, then, of \ncourse, we walk away from who we are as a people.\n  After all of that, President Bush, of course, comes to us in all \ninnocence and begs, once again: Trust me. He means it literally. Here \nin the world's greatest deliberative body only a small handful of \nSenators know even the barest facts; only a tiny minority of us have \neven seen the classified documents that explain exactly what the \ntelecoms have done, exactly what actions we are asked to make legally \ndisappear.\n  I have been a Member of this body for over a quarter of a century. I \nam a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee. I have no right \nto see this? As a Member of this body, as a senior member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, I am prohibited. Only the administration \ncan see this and one or two people here who are granted the right to \nactually see and understand what went on.\n  So we are being asked as a body to blindly grant this immunity, take \nthis issue away entirely so no one can ever learn anything more about 5 \nlong years of millions--millions--of Americans, with their private \nphone conversations, their faxes, and e-mails. Every word uttered is \nnow being held and kept. And this administration knows it. The people \nin charge of it know it. And we want to find out why this happened, who \nordered this, who provided this. If we grant this immunity, we will \nnever know the answers to those questions.\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\n  So as far as the rest of us--we are flying blind. And in that state \nof blindness, we can only offer one kind of oversight. The President's \nfavorite kind: the token kind. And here, in the dark, we are expected \nto grant President Bush's wish. Because, of course, he knows best. Does \nthat sound familiar to any of my colleagues?\n  In 2002, we took the President's word and faulty intelligence on \nweapons of mass destruction, and we mistakenly approved what has become \nthe disaster in Iraq.\n  Is history repeating itself in a small way today? Are we about to \nblindly legalize gravely serious crimes?\n  If we have learned anything--if we have learned anything at all--it \nmust be this: Great decisions must be built on equally strong \nfoundations of fact. Of course, we are not voting to go to war today. \nToday's issue is not nearly as immense, I would argue. But one thing is \nas huge as it was in 2002; and that is, the yawning gap between what we \nknow and what we are asked to do.\n  So I stand again and oppose this immunity--wrong in itself, \ngrievously wrong, I would add, in what it represents: contempt for \ndebate, contempt for the courts, and contempt for the rule of law. As I \ndid in December, I will speak against that contempt as strongly as I \ncan.\n  So I will reserve further debate and discussion for tomorrow, as we \ngo forward with this. I say this respectfully to my colleagues. I do \nnot know if a cloture motion will be filed or not, but I hope there \nwill be enough people who will join me.\n\n  This bill can go forward without this immunity in it. And it ought to \ngo forward. There are some amendments that will be offered, some of \nwhich I will support. There are ideas to improve on the FISA provisions \nof the bill to see to it that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nwill do exactly what we want it to do: to allow us to get that \nsurveillance on those who would do us harm and simultaneously make sure \nthat basic liberties are going to be protected.\n  But I will do everything in my power, to the extent that any one \nMember of this body can, to see to it we do not go forward in the \nprovision of this bill that grants retroactive immunity for the \negregious misbehavior, to put it mildly, that went on here.\n  The courts may prove otherwise. I do not know. Maybe someone will \nprove what they did turned out to be legally correct. But we are never \ngoing to know that if we, as a body--Democrats and Republicans--walk \naway from the rule of law and deny the courts of this land which have \nthe ability to do this. The argument that you cannot rely on the courts \nto engage in a deliberation involving information that should be held \nsecret is wrong. We have done it on thousands of cases over the years, \nand we can do it here.\n  So I hope there will be those who will join me in saying to the \nPresident: If you want to veto this bill, go ahead. You veto it because \nyou did not get your corporations' immunity. You explain that to the \nAmerican public, why we did not have the tools available that kept \nAmerica safe from those who would do us harm--because a handful of \ncorporations decided to violate the law, in my view, and did so because \nthe Bush administration asked them to do that. You are going to veto \nthis bill to deny us those tools that our intelligence communities \nought to have to protect American citizens at a dangerous time. You \nmake that decision.\n  So when this debate continues tomorrow, I will offer some additional \nthoughts in support of the Leahy amendment. I will be offering my own \namendment, to strike retroactive immunity, and I will be considering \nother amendments along the way.\n  If all of that fails, then I will engage in the historic rights \nreserved in this body for individual Members to talk for a while, to \ntalk about the rule of law, and to talk about the importance of it. I \ndo not think I have ever done this before. I have been here a long \ntime, and I rarely engage in such activities. I respect those who have.\n  The Founders of this wonderful institution granted the rights of \nindividual Senators to be significant, including the power of one \nSenator to be able to hold the floor on an important matter about which \nthey care deeply. I care deeply about this issue. I think all of my \ncolleagues do. I just hope they will care enough about it to see to it \nthis bill does not go forward with the precedent-setting nature of \ngranting immunity in this case. It is not warranted. It is not \ndeserved. It was not a minor mistake over a brief period of time.\n  There is a pattern of behavior, and it went on for too long, and it \nwould still go on if it had not been for a report done by a newspaper \nand a whistleblower who stood up within the phone company, who had the \ncourage to say this was wrong, or we would still be engaged in these \npractices today.\n  I think we as a body--Democrats and Republicans--need to say to this \nadministration, and all future administrations, that you are not going \nto step all over the liberties and rights of American citizens in the \nname of security. That is a false choice, and we are not going to \ntolerate that and set the precedent tonight or tomorrow by agreeing to \nsuch a grant of immunity in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the patience of the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/23/senate-section/article/S219-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
