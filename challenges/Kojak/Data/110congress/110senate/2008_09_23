Mr. President, when we finish leader time, we are going to \nproceed to a period of morning business to allow Senators to speak for \nup to 10 minutes each. The minority will control the first half hour, \nthe majority the second 30 minutes. Following morning business, we will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 6049, the tax extenders \nlegislation. There is an order that has been entered that we will \nfinish that legislation today.\n  We have been in discussion with the Republicans, and it is to \neveryone's best interest to not have any votes before the noontime \ncaucuses, the reason being, at 9:30 a.m., a hearing started in the \nBanking Committee. Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke are there. \nThe full committee will be there. They will all want to ask some \nquestions. I believe this hearing will not finish before lunchtime. \nThere has been word it might even go on after lunch. We will wait and \nsee what Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby come up with in that \nregard.\n  We are going to finish this legislation. We hope we can complete most \nall the debate this morning and start voting this afternoon. I hope \nthat, in fact, is the case.\n  The House is going to take up the continuing resolution tonight. I \nthink they are going to file it tonight, and I think they are going to \ntry to waive the 48-hour rule and have that vote maybe as early as \ntomorrow. That is on the CR. We also expect to be receiving an economic \nrecovery package from them shortly.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  With the financial crisis facing this country today, we are all \nwaiting to see what happens in the Banking Committee. Everyone is a \nMonday morning quarterback. We have former Speaker Gingrich who is \nstating Senator McCain should not support this legislation, it would be \nwrong to do that. We are just going to wait and see.\n  I think everyone has been convinced that we have a financial crisis \non our hands. The question is, What do we do about it? I cannot speak \nfor everyone on this side of the aisle, but we think there should be \nsomething done as quickly as possible. Does that mean tomorrow? No, I \ndon't think so. It means we should be deliberate in what we do but \ncertain that what we are doing is the right thing to do.\n  There has been certain agreement. There has to be something done \nabout executive compensations. The American people are demanding that. \nThat is what is happening, in all the calls to my office. Certainly all \nof the Senators would say the same. There has to be some way of \nrecouping some of these moneys the Government is paying to buy these \nbad loans so that there is some ownership in it from the Federal \nGovernment if money is made on these, and taxpayers should be \ncompensated. There is a question that the original proposal had \nlanguage in it that would\n\n[[Page S9224]]\n\nhave allowed foreign banks to be, in effect, taken care of. The \nAmerican people are concerned about that.\n  We are waiting for the hearing. There may be reasons for the very \nshort proposal the administration sent to us. Maybe that is all that \nshould happen. But if people are getting the same message I am, there \nis going to have to be some changes. We believe this should be done on \na bipartisan basis, that it should be done in keeping with the \nemergency we have before us.\n  In effect, I am saying let's wait until the hearings are over. \nHopefully, at that time, the two banking chairs, with their ranking \nmembers, Frank and Dodd, can point us in the right direction so we can \ncomplete this legislation in a reasonable period of time.\n  I will also indicate to the minority that I am ready to move forward \non the consent agreements regarding the Coburn matters.\n  What I have been told is Senator Bond is going to speak for--how \nlong?\n  Mr. BOND. Maybe 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. What I will do, Mr. President, is I will wait until Senator \nBond has completed his statement. I see the Republican leader is here. \nI ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of Senator McConnell \nand any that I wish to make, Senator Bond be recognized for 15 minutes \nand then, following his statement, I be recognized to do my business \nwith Dr. Coburn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9224-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the taxpayer can claim a major \naccomplishment today. At a time of high economic anxiety, this tax \nrelief extension bill we will be voting on later today encourages \ngreater energy independence and delivers much needed relief to job \ncreators across the country and ensures a much smaller tax bill for \nmillions of American families.\n  The Senate had been deadlocked on the provisions contained in this \nbill for a number of months, but in the end, Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle shut out the partisan rancor of the Presidential election, \nhammered out a compromise, and delivered. The result is a tribute to \nall the Senators and many staffers on both sides who worked so hard to \nget us to this point.\n  This legislation does a number of good things:\n  It blocks the alternative minimum tax from hitting about 20 million \nmiddle-class American families, including 137,000 in Kentucky, from an \naverage tax hike of about $2,000, and it doesn't raise taxes to do it.\n  It helps American families who are struggling to cover the high cost \nof a college education by giving single parents and married couples a \ndeduction of between $2,000 and $4,000 for college tuition payments \nthrough 2009.\n  Teachers will continue to get a valuable deduction for educational \nexpenses.\n  Research and development, the heart of future growth, is also \nencouraged.\n  At a time of record-high energy prices, this bill contains a number \nof incentives for increasing the use of clean energy and decreasing our \ndependence on Middle East oil. It extends a tax credit for companies \nthat produce renewable energy from wind, solar, and biomass. Domestic \ncarmakers get a new tax credit for investing in plug-in electric cars \nand trucks. Families that build energy-efficient homes will see \nsubstantial savings on their utility bills when they buy energy-\nefficient freezers, dishwashers, and other energy-efficient, common \nhousehold appliances. And refineries that process shale or tar sands \nwill also see help--a critical new step in expanding domestic energy \nexploration and development.\n  From a Kentucky standpoint, I recently met with a group of business \nleaders from west Kentucky who are pursuing a coal-to-liquids refinery \nin Paducah that could lead to more than 1,100 new jobs for Kentuckians. \nThey viewed extension of the expiring tax incentives for refinery \nconstruction as an incredible economic development tool and an \nimportant step toward energy independence by using abundant Kentucky \ncoal. And I was happy to help.\n  Taken together, the tax extenders in this bill amount to more than \n$100 billion in tax relief for America's workers and job-creating \nbusinesses, and they provide much needed certainties for a nation that \nhas faced enough uncertainty in recent weeks by ensuring that this \nrelief stays in place through next year.\n  This bill was not easy to complete. Both sides had to make major \nconcessions to get a good result. But this is how the Senate works. \nWith this bill, it worked very well, and both sides can take credit. \nThis tax relief will help the American people at a moment when they can \ntruly use the help.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this will be the ninth vote we have had on \nthe tax extenders as relates to renewable energy. There have been \ncompromises made. I say to my good friend the Republican leader, one of \nthe provisions I don't like in the bill is the coal-to-liquids. I wish \nit were not in there, but it is. I have been here long enough to \nunderstand that to get legislation passed, there have to be compromises \nmade. I hope when this matter goes to the House of Representatives that \nthey will take the seriousness of how difficult it has been for us to \nget this legislation passed.\n  My friend talked about the importance of these tax credits for \nrenewable energy. It is very important. But also there is another \ntranche that is extremely important, and that is the extenders for the \nbusiness community. We have done something that has not been done in a \nlong time. We have them for 2 years. This is a big step forward for the \nbusiness community, and it is a step forward that is very important.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the Capitol, in the House: \nDon't send us back something else. We cannot get it passed. If they try \nto mess with our package, it will come back here, it will die, and we \nwill have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. It would be a \nterrible shame that we would not be able to pass this legislation after \nhaving, for example, nine votes on the energy tax renewables. So I say \nto my friends in the House, Democrats and Republicans: Rise up and \naccept this because our procedures are different from the House. We can \nclaim a victory for the American people by getting this done. And I \nhope we will have a resounding vote. I am confident we will on this \nlegislation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9224-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank our leaders and the members of the \nrelevant committees for coming up with the extenders package. That is \ngood news. But I come here today to talk about some very difficult news \nthis country is facing, and that is our country's financial crisis.\n  We have heard lots of people who are very much concerned about the \ndetails and why we are doing it. As the majority leader announced, this \nis being addressed in the Senate Banking Committee today by Secretary \nPaulson and others. He also noted that the former Speaker of the House \nhas come out and said there is no rush; that we don't need to deal with \nthis expeditiously. We do need to deal with this. We need to deal with \nthis because the credit markets are frozen, the stock market is \ntanking, and the financial system is facing a stone age.\n\n[[Page S9225]]\n\n  Now, this doesn't just affect some well-known companies on Wall \nStreet and in major areas, it affects every one of us in our personal \nfinances, in our jobs, and in our homes. It is a question of if we go \nto the ATM, will we get money out? If we have a home mortgage, can we \nget it refinanced? Could we get a new mortgage? If you are a small \nbusiness, can you roll over your credits? If you are a farmer, can you \nget your operating loans for the next year? If you are an employee, can \nyour business get the money it needs through the financial system to \nkeep your job going or even to create new jobs?\n  We must respond to this financial crisis quickly, but we also must \nrespond responsibly. We should not just throw money at the problem. We \nmust also demand increased accountability, increased oversight, and \nincreased transparency so the taxpayers and our financial system are \nnever put in this position again.\n  Back in Missouri this weekend, and on the telephone since, I have \nheard from seniors worried about their retirement accounts, parents \nworried about their children's college savings, families worried about \ntheir checking accounts, and small businesses and homeowners worried \nabout their mortgages. Folks across the Nation are worried about what \nthis financial crisis means to their financial security. Missourians \nare worried about how this crisis on Wall Street is hitting hard on \nMain Street and throughout the State, from cities to farms to homes. \nThey want to know the job loss hitting Wall Street traders will not \ncripple small-town job sites, the city workplaces, and homes across the \nState.\n  But they also wish to know that the politicians, the elected \nofficials, are protecting their tax dollars and not just bailing out \nthose who made bad decisions with no consequences. Folks at home face \naccountability every day. At home, if you screw up and lose a lot of \nmoney, you lose your job. And you certainly don't get paid to leave. At \nhome, when people make mistakes, you don't throw a lot of money at them \nand not ask for anything in return or no change in their ways. We need \nto come together to end this crisis but also to make sure it does not \nhappen again.\n  Last week, I spoke on the Senate floor and asked my colleagues to do \nthat, to come together and work in a bipartisan way for American \nfamilies during this financial crisis. There are long-term remedies and \nchanges we must make. I don't know if we can get them done because \nright now the fire departments have called on us for more flame \nretardant, and we need to move to provide the flame retardant to stop \nthis crisis from raging across the country.\n  As soon as we do that, however, we need to change the other aspects \nof the regulatory system that allowed this blaze to get out of control. \nNow, some of that was mandated by Congress; some of it was a failure to \nexercise oversight; some of it was judgments made a long time ago which \nturned out not to work in these critical times. But it is absolutely \nessential we come together on this measure and work with bipartisan \ncooperation and understanding and communicating with our constituents. \nIt is critical that Americans see Democrats and Republicans avoid the \n``blame game'' and, instead, work toward solutions.\n  We are seeing that happening already. Secretary Paulson is working \nwith congressional leaders of both parties on his plan. He is \ntestifying before the Senate Banking Committee right now. In addition \nto bipartisan cooperation, this crisis demands the action be bold and \nswift.\n  I believe the free market system is the best in the world, but it \nmust have reasonable regulation. There are times when we must take \ntemporary emergency action to get us through the rare crisis. This is \none of those rare moments. This is an emergency crisis. On Friday, \nTreasury Secretary Paulson proposed bold action. Since his \nannouncement, we have been getting details about the administration's \nplan to stabilize the financial and housing systems now in crisis and \nget at the root causes of the problem. The plan outlines a change from \nthe ad hoc process we have been seeing to a comprehensive systematic \napproach. I agree we need a bold and comprehensive plan to get to the \nheart of the problem and get the economy back on its feet so it can \nagain start growing and creating jobs for the American people as soon \nas possible. At the same time, a bold plan is not enough. We must also \nhave a responsible plan. We cannot just throw money at this problem. \nAny plan that Congress adopts must ensure accountability, oversight, \nand transparency. It is our responsibility as elected officials to \ndemand accountability so we do not reward those who made bad decisions.\n  It is our responsibility as elected officials to demand greater \noversight so the taxpayers and the overall economy are protected. It is \nour responsibility as elected officials to demand transparency so \npeople can have trust in our financial system and know their money is \nsafe.\n  That is why I am preparing amendments to increase taxpayer \nprotection. These protections should be a larger part of the Treasury \nSecretary's mandate. I am working on amendments that increase \naccountability by giving the Secretary specific powers to reduce \nexecutive compensation and eliminate golden parachutes. We did it in \nthe Fannie Mae bailout and we can do it again.\n  We need to give the Secretary the power to take some equity in the \nbailed-out firms. We not only need to take the toxic paper off their \nhands--in what I trust will be below-market value for which we can sell \nthe paper--but we need to take some equity so, if our infusion works, \nas I believe it must, and the company grows, we as taxpayers will get a \nreturn on that equity. American families should not have to pay fat \nbonus checks for failed CEOs and golden parachutes, and it should not \nexpect bailed-out firms to be giving obscene executive compensation.\n  I also am preparing an amendment to increase transparency. We need to \nincrease disclosure requirements for mortgage-backed securities and \nrelated derivatives so we are not again caught by surprise. As I said \nlast week, we need to make sure all mortgage originators are \nappropriately regulated. Right now, we regulate the banks and the \nsavings and loans but not the people who offer loans outside those \ninstitutions. They need to be regulated. If firms refuse to participate \nvoluntarily in the program we pass in the Congress, then we need to \nconsider giving the Secretary the power to resolve those bad situations \nand not let them linger for another round of crisis.\n  Now, there has been talk--and there will be plenty more--about the \nneed to pass a clean rescue package. But once again I say we need to \nact quickly, and we shall act quickly, but there is plenty of time to \ntake a day and consider these types of amendments. We cannot write a \n$700 billion blank check, hand it over to unelected officials and not \nask for any accountability. I believe if we do this properly, the cost \nwill be far less.\n  I heard a commentator on CNBC saying yesterday that if they do it \nright, the taxpayer may even gain a little bit of money for it. Don't \ncount on that. But if we do it properly, if the Treasury sets up a \nsystem where they have the appropriate people contracted out under \nstrict oversight, with accountability and incentives to take these \nfailed mortgages at below the value of the underlying homes--not the \nmarket value, which may be zero--and then resell them and also take a \nslice of the equity of the firm from which they acquire those loans, \nthen the price should be many times less than $700 billion. We have to \ndo that, but we must act now.\n  We must act boldly to protect the economy, to protect our homes, our \njobs, and our communities throughout the Nation. We must protect \nAmericans' bank accounts, savings accounts, and retirement plans. We \nalso must protect the taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to work in a \nbipartisan way, to come together on a sound plan, and to do it as \nquickly as we can. Don't rush it so much that we don't include the \noversight, the accountability, and transparency. Include those elements \nand get it done now.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9226]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I spent 8\\1/2\\ hours yesterday trying to \nget back here, and I understand during a period of that time my name \nwas mentioned rather prominently several times on the floor, which is \nfine. I know Senator Reid is going to come out in a little bit and \noffer some unanimous consent requests, which I am certainly open to \nconsidering, but we just got the language on those and so we will be \nlooking at that. I will be objecting until I get a chance to see what \nchanges have been made, and I look forward to working with Senator \nReid.\n  But I think this whole debate about 35 bills and $10 billion is a \ngreat lesson for us. We stand right now as a nation on a fault line \nthat has created a lack of confidence in the financial system in this \ncountry--and not just in this country but in the world as well. While \nwe are facing what is being requested by the head of the Federal \nReserve, the Treasury, and the administration--a task of trying to \nreestablish confidence and liquidity in our markets--we have failed to \nlearn the lesson. The lesson is this: We cannot continue to \nindiscriminately create more Government without making the Government \nwe have efficient.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, regular order. The regular order was I was \nto have the floor when Senator Bond finished.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is correct.\n\n\n                   ADVANCING AMERICA'S PRIORITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday we started a process of trying to \nclear bills and passing matters. Prior to that, to remind everyone, 34 \nbills have been held up by Senator Coburn, held up for months. We have \ntried to work with him and it has borne no fruit. I want everyone here \nto understand that Senator Coburn may have been the person objecting to \nthese pieces of legislation passing, but the Republicans are complicit \nin this because they have joined with him in blocking these bills. He \ncould not do this alone. They have joined with him in doing this. So \npeople who go back to their constituency and say they are in favor of \nall these pieces of legislation are not leveling with their \nconstituents. I repeat, Senator Coburn may have been the person who \nmade the objection, but we have attempted to move forward. He has been \njoined by his Republican colleagues. Every Democrat, of course, is in \nfavor of moving these pieces of legislation, even though they are \nRepublican bills. We believe, for the good of the people, you don't \nidentify a good piece of legislation by whether it is a Democrat or \nRepublican sponsoring it; you identify it as to the merits of that \npiece of legislation.\n  Again, to recap, the legislation contains 34 bills with broad \nbipartisan support that have been held up by Senator Coburn, who \nobviously thinks he knows better than the House of Representatives--by \nthe way, these bills were passed overwhelmingly; the average vote is \n370--that he knows more than the committees that reported these bills \nout, both in the House and the Senate, and he knows better than the \nwhole Senate, since he will not give us simple votes on these bills. I \nrepeat, he has been joined by his Republican colleagues in the \nobstructionism.\n  I tried to get the whole block passed yesterday. I tried to move to \ndifferent sections--there are seven different sections--and there was \nan objection made on behalf of Senator Coburn to each of those. With a \nfew things on our plate; that is, the financial crisis facing this \ncountry, trying to complete a funding resolution to get us through this \nbeginning of the next fiscal year, an economic recovery package--we \nhave a lot to do. Because of that, I did not have the ability, again, \nto file cloture. It takes 2 days to vote on a motion to proceed, 30 \nhours; get on the bill, file cloture, 2 more days, 30 hours. We didn't \nhave time to do that. But we are going to continue working on these \nnext Congress. If we come back after this weekend--which is looking \nmore every day as though we are going to have to--we can consider \nmoving forward on these pieces of legislation at that time.\n  We are going to do what we can to get these extremely important \npieces of legislation passed. I again say, each one of these bills \noverwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives. Each one of these \nbills has been reported out of the Senate committee. We are going to \nsee if any of these will get the approval of the Republicans today.\n  We were told yesterday by Republican Senate staff that maybe there \nare other Republican Senators who are using Senator Coburn as a foil, \nusing him as somebody to do the blocking, so we will see. Yesterday it \nwas interesting, the junior Senator from Arizona said there are 8 bills \nwe could clear--8 out of 34, not very good, but 8 is a lot better than \nnothing. Within a few seconds after I agreed to that, well, he said, \nmaybe three. I tried to pin him down to three. He said you will have to \nwait until Dr. Coburn shows up.\n  I hope everyone is beginning to see a clearer picture of this \nobstructionism.\n  Also understand this: Not a single piece of legislation will cost the \nAmerican people 10 cents--nothing, not a penny, because they are all \nauthorizations. They allow the appropriations committees to take a look \nat these pieces of legislation. There are a lot of pieces of \nlegislation that pass that give authorization and then there have to be \npriorities set by the Budget Committee, sometimes the Finance \nCommittee, and the Appropriations Committee, to find out which \npriorities should exist.\n  The authorizations do not cost the American taxpayers anything; \nnothing; zero. That is why I was stunned when I got a letter from the \nSenator from Oklahoma saying you strike $10 billion in authorizations \nfrom these bills and then when the bills come forward you make an \namendment to put it back in.\n  I haven't gone to medical school, but I know that is illogical. We \nare not going to offer consent requests on each bill in this package \nbecause we have been told in no uncertain terms by Senator Coburn that \nhe will not accept that. Right now we have to deal with him. So I am \ngoing to start on a couple of titles and see what progress, if any, we \nmake today. As I have said, we are not going to give up on the rest of \nthe important pieces of legislation. But because the Republicans have \nsupported Senator Coburn, that is where we are. I repeat, even though \nhe is the person out front, the Republicans, the Republican caucus is \nresponsible for this.\n  I disagree with Dr. Coburn on his concerns about authorizations. I \nthink he is wrong, but he has a right to his opinion and I accept that. \nBut my disappointment is his Republican colleagues are supporting him. \nI do not think that is going to continue.\n  We do not know what is going to be the status next year, but I hope \nthere will be fewer of them and more of us and maybe that will lessen \nsome of the intransigence we have seen on the other side. I am happy to \ncontinue discussion with Senator Coburn's office which, frankly, we \nfound basically has been a big waste of time, but we will continue to \ndo that. I have tried to be patient and I will continue to do that so I \nhope we can get something done.\n  The first title of this package deals with health care. This title \nconsists of very important bills covering a range of diseases and \nconditions. I venture to say that every American and every family in \nAmerica has been touched by some portion of the health care provisions \nin this package. The health care provisions in this package include the \nALS Registry Act and the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act. That \npiece of legislation is interesting. Christopher Reeve, Superman, who \nwas badly injured in a horse accident, and his wonderful wife Dana, who \nwas so supportive through his very difficult life, are both dead. As \nyoung people they are both dead, even though there is legislation that \nhas been introduced and we tried to pass in their honor. They are both \ndead.\n  The STOP Stroke Act--I don't think there is a family in America who \nhas not been affected by stroke in some way.\n  The Legislation also contains the Melanie Blocker Stokes MOTHERS\n\n[[Page S9227]]\n\nAct, which focuses on postpartum depression, which now is more easily \ndiagnosed, and they are looking for ways to lessen the burden that \npeople who have postpartum depression have and the Vision Care for Kids \nAct and the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness \nAct.\n  Three of the six bills in the health care package were introduced by \nRepublicans. All these bills passed the House with extremely strong \nbipartisan support. Eighty-five percent of the people in the House of \nRepresentatives voted for these pieces of legislation. That is the \naverage. Of course, the same over here. We have bipartisan support. But \nprocedurally Republicans have supported Senator Coburn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9227-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1727\n\n  Mr. REID. First, let's take a look at the Christopher and Dana Reeve \nParalysis Act, one key provision that has been obstructed. It is an \nimportant piece of legislation dealing with paralysis. This legislation \nwould support and enhance cooperation in paralysis research, \nrehabilitation, and quality of life programs for people with paralysis. \nIt authorizes grants and research funding for clinical rehabilitation \nof paralysis. The bill has been languishing on the Senate calendar for \nwell more than a year and, I repeat, passed the House with extremely \nbroad bipartisan support.\n\n  Dr. Coburn's office has indicated on several occasions that, OK, \nlet's pass this. But we have heard that before.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of H.R. 1727, the Christopher and Dana Reeve \nParalysis Act, and the Senate proceed to its consideration, that the \nbill be read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and there be no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, will the Senate majority \nleader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. COBURN. You sent over some 20 or 30 bills to our side. Is this \none of those bills and has there been any change in what we have since \nour discussions?\n  Mr. REID. This is the exact language from the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. COBURN. Pending the time we get to review all of that, I will \ngladly accept a unanimous consent but, reserving the right to object, I \nwill object at this time until I have a chance to look at the bills. \nThey were given to us less than 20 minutes ago and we wish an \nopportunity to look at that. The majority leader has my word I will not \nobject if that is the case.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, he has had more than a \nyear to look at this. It is the exact bill from the House. Fine. Take a \nlook at it.

Mr. President, now we turn to another important piece of \nlegislation. This is what we mentioned earlier, the Lou Gehrig's \ndisease legislation. The bill would build upon, expand, and coordinate \namong pre-existing ALS registries, helping to collect data essential to \nthe study of this dread disease.\n  The reason this is important is the average time from discovering a \nperson has Lou Gehrig's disease until they die is 16 months. Time is of \nthe essence.\n  The bill would create a Federal advisory committee on the national \nALS Registry and promote research access to ALS data. The bill passed \nthe House 411 to 3 a year ago. Both House and Senate committees marked \nthe bill up with bipartisan support. Senator Coburn said he wanted some \nchanges made so we have made those changes. Each change he told us he \nwanted we have made. Then he asked for an additional change and we made \nthat. Now we have made extensive changes to the bill to accommodate the \nconcerns Senator Coburn said he had with the bill, so I hope we can get \nit passed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 518, \nthe ALS Registry Act, that all after the enacting clause be stricken, \nthe amendment at the desk consisting of the compromise amendment based \non the language of subtitle (a) of title I of S. 3297 be inserted, that \nthe amendment be considered and agreed to and the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time, passed, and the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, again, after looking at \nthis, if what the majority leader said is accurate, I plan on \nsupporting this. But until I have had a chance to read what was sent \nover this morning--I will object until that time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9227-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9227-S9228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 507\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is the Vision Care for Kids Act. What \nthis would do is ensure that children get the vision care they need to \nsucceed in school.\n  I think most everybody knows I was born in a little town and raised \nin a little town--no doctors, no hospital. I was born in a house, not \nin a hospital.\n  When I went away to high school, which is also a fairly small high \nschool, I was a baseball catcher on the baseball team. When we would \nmove inside to the gym when the weather was very bad, which was not \nvery often in Nevada, and I would be catching, I had trouble picking up \nthe ball. But I thought it was that way for everybody. I thought other \npeople had trouble seeing the ball. It was not until I was a freshman \nin college that somebody said: You must not be able to see very well. \nAnd so as a freshman in college I got a pair of glasses. I will never \nforget it. I came back to my dormitory; I had never seen green on the \nhills. I did not know things looked that way. But with my glasses, I \ncould see it was green now. Now I know why I could not see the ball.\n  That is what this is all about, so kids like me have an opportunity \nmaybe to be able to see with glasses or whatever it takes to improve \ntheir eyesight. Is this bill going to solve all of those problems? No, \nbut it certainly would help. It would establish a program through the \nCenters for Disease Control to complement and encourage existing State \nefforts to improve children's vision care.\n  I am not suggesting to anyone that I was blind. I just didn't see \nvery well, and I didn't know that. I thought everybody was like me. But \ncan you imagine how--I can imagine. I was there. I know. I came home, \nand I could not believe it. I called my friends: Look, it is green over \nthere.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of H.R. 507 and the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; that the bill be read a third time, passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. This bill has never been before the HELP Committee. It\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\nhas never had a hearing in the Senate. There has been no discharge of \nthis from the committee. We have never even voted on this bill. With \nthat, I plan on objecting until I see exactly what has been offered by \nthe majority leader later today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this exact language passed the House. This \nis a Republican bill, Senator Bond. My friend is right, it did not go \nthrough the committee. I think Senator Bond is right by being the chief \nadvocate over here. Maybe he can help us with Senator Coburn. But the \nsame thing we had before, it passed overwhelmingly. Maybe after he \nlooks at it, he will allow it to pass later on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9228-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1375\n\n  Mr. REID.

The bills Senator Coburn blocked included the Emmett Till \nUnsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, to help solve unsolved civil rights-\nera crimes; the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction \nReauthorization and Improvement Act; the reauthorization of the \nsuccessful Drug Endangered Children Program, to help kids who are \nvictims of the drug trade; the PROTECT Our Children Act, to stop \ndangerous Internet child predators, molesters, and pornographers.\n  Each of these bills passed the House with broad bipartisan support. \nOf course they have broad bipartisan support here. Procedurally, we \nhave been blocked because of Senator Coburn, and being procedurally \nsupported by his Republican colleagues. I hope we can pass some of \nthese.\n  Let's talk about the child pornography prosecution bills.

It may not \nbe their immediate family. It may be some distant family members, \nit could be neighbors. But my nephew died of a drug overdose. He had a \nproblem from his time as a teenager until he died at the age of 38 or \nso. There is a terrible problem with illegal drugs; it leaves many \nvictims. Many are innocent children who are found in homes, hotels, \nautomobiles. My nephew died in a sleazy motel. Among those are innocent \nchildren who are found, as I have indicated, in homes, hotels, \nautomobiles, and apartments where all kinds of illegal substances are \nproduced.\n\n  The product that is causing so much problem now is meth, \nmethamphetamine. This bipartisan bill would authorize the Department of \nJustice to award $20 million per year--remember, this authorizes it--in \ngrants designated to improve coordination among law enforcement, \nprosecutors, child protection services, social service agencies, and \nhealth care providers to help transition these drug-endangered children \ninto safe residential environments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of H.R. 1199 and the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; that the bill be read a third time and passed \nand the motion to reconsider be laid on the table; that there be no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

One of the bills in this package that has been languishing \nfor well over a year--and I think it is shameful that is, in fact, the \ncase--is the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act.\n  Emmett Till was a 14-year-old boy from Chicago visiting his relatives \nin Money, MS, way back in 1955 when he was brutally mutilated and \nkilled for whistling at a white woman. Remember, his courageous mother, \nwanting everyone to see the brutality of how her boy was killed, had an \nopen casket. That open casket said it all.\n  The killers in this case, like so many others during that time, were \nnever\n\n[[Page S9229]]\n\npunished for their violent, treacherous acts. However, by passing this \nEmmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Act, the Justice Department \nwill have the tools necessary to investigate and prosecute violations \nof the civil rights statutes in which the alleged violation occurred \nbefore January 1 of 1970 and resulted in death.\n  The bill has broad bipartisan support. I hope we can pass the House-\npassed bill. That way, the bill will be signed by the President \nimmediately.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 237, \nH.R. 293, that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid on the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.)

I understood from your statement that this does not \nhave any of the changes we talked about, this is strictly the House-\npassed bill.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object further, we will relook at \nwhat that is. I will object at this time and hope we can work out with \nthe majority leader what we had discussed earlier in terms of a \ncompromise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9229-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9229-S9230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1738\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, again, as has happened during this long \nprocess where these bills have languished, we keep getting suggestions \nfor changes. We make them, and it does not make any difference. And \nlast night, again, Senator Coburn suggested a change. We certainly can \ngo along with that. We will make the change, send it over to you, and \ntake a look at it.\n  I want to take a minute to talk about another one of the 34 pieces of \nlegislation that is so important. Its name is ``PROTECT Our Children \nAct,'' or the PROTECT Act. This bill seeks to increase the prosecution \nof individuals producing and trading in child pornography by providing \nfunding to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.\n  The Crimes Against Children Task Force has developed the ability to \nidentify individuals in the online distribution of child pornography \nbut lacks the manpower needed to pursue and prosecute the offenders. \nThis bill would give the Crimes Against Children Task Force the \nresources it needs.\n  This bill would also help promote coordination and strategic planning \nof Government resources to catch child predators by requiring DOJ to \ndevelop and implement a national strategy to combat child exploitation.\n  This bill would go a long way toward rescuing the thousands of \nchildren who are being exploited by child predators. Studies show that \n30 percent of the people identified by the Crimes Against Children Task \nForce are actively engaged in molesting a child. Yet, right now, of the \nover 500,000 known cases, we are investigating 2 percent of them \nbecause law enforcement does not have the resources to do more.\n  This legislation was introduced in October 2007 and passed the House \nabout a year ago, 415 to 2. The Senate companion legislation passed the \nJudiciary Committee. The Senate bill Republican cosponsors include \nSenators Stevens, Hatch, Hutchison, and Murkowski. So it is the right \nthing to do to pass this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 862, \nS. 1738, that a substitute amendment which is at the desk be agreed to, \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid on the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, a question again for the \nmajority leader. As confused as I was on a previous act, this does not \ninclude the language of the SAFE Act?\n  Mr. REID. That is right. The reason it doesn't--there are lots of \nreasons it doesn't, but we have a letter from the Justice Department. \nThe Justice Department--Bush's Justice Department we all know about--\ndecided to take a look at that. Even the Bush Justice Department said \nthis needs a lot more work. Keep in mind, I have described in detail \nwhat we are trying to do. The SAFE Act the Senator is talking about is \na different piece of legislation, and it should not be tied into what \nwe are trying to do with this child pornography thing. I would hope we \nwould get this done. We will be happy to work with the Justice \nDepartment and everybody else to see if we can work something out on \nthe SAFE Act. It is not yet ready for passage. We all agree there is a \nneed to combat Internet pornography. But important questions about the \ntext of Senator Coburn's proposed legislation must be answered. We have \nquestions. I used the Justice Department as an example. It is not only \nus. It is the Bush Justice Department. While some version of the SAFE \nAct might pass, let's not fool ourselves. The SAFE Act will help \ndevelop leads, but right now only 2 percent of all cases are \ninvestigated because law enforcement does not have the resources. The \nSAFE Act does absolutely nothing to bolster law enforcement resources. \nThe PROTECT Act fills the known hole that has resulted in 98 percent of \nexisting leads on child predators to go uninvestigated.\n  The Judiciary Committee, the committee of jurisdiction, has not held \na hearing on the SAFE Act. It has not been the subject of committee \nmarkup. I don't believe any Republican on the committee even formally \nasked for a markup. It is ironic that Senator Coburn, the self-\ndesignated champion of insisting that bills be scrutinized before \npassage, now wants to circumvent the legislative process for a bill he \nnever even bothered to raise in committee.\n  The Justice Department has serious concerns about this act. In a six-\npage letter sent last year, DOJ made numerous suggestions for improving \nthe text of the bill. Some of the suggestions were addressed in the \nHouse version of the bill but many were not. In addition, officials \nfrom the Internet service providers that would implement this new law \nhave raised important practical questions. They are concerned about \nvague definitions and requirements in the bill. There is no point in \nrushing to pass a bill that will be ineffective or struck down by the \ncourts as unconstitutionally vague.\n  Last week, I asked my staff to convene a group of Republican and \nDemocratic staffers to try to revise the text of the bill in light of \nthe concerns expressed by the Department of Justice and others. Senator \nCoburn's staff is part of that effort. I am hopeful we can reach \nbipartisan agreement on the SAFE Act. The staff negotiations are \nongoing. We will continue to work in good faith to get this bill in \nshape, but we are not there yet. Meanwhile, we are there on the PROTECT \nAct. It is ready to go. It has been for a long time. We can pass it \ntoday and get it to the President's desk immediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Continuing my reservation of the right to object, by the \nsame logic that the majority leader has argued on all these other \nbills, the SAFE Act passed the House 390 to 2. So with the wisdom of \nthe House, under which we are basing all the other requests for \nunanimous consent, why is that wisdom not any good now with the SAFE \nAct? The fact is that it isn't. I regret that unless we can pass the \nPROTECT Act with the SAFE Act and unless we can actually do something--\nthe SAFE Act actually will do something tomorrow, the day it is signed. \nThe PROTECT Act will not do anything until the money comes through \nCongress a year from now. So the fact is, if we had the SAFE Act, we \nwill stop child pornography faster than if we don't. The question of \nthe fourth amendment rights of child pornographers versus the rights of \nchildren being abused is not a hard thing to figure out. With that, I \nobject until we add that to the bill.\n  Mr. REID. It is interesting how my friend isn't interested in the \nauthorization of money this takes. It is obvious from what we have \nheard from my friend, supported by his Republican colleagues, that \nthese important pieces of legislation have been held up and are \ncontinuing to be held up. That is unfortunate. We have not a single \npiece of legislation today that has been approved. That is the way it \nis, this arrangement. I hope the Republicans accept what they have \ndone. They have supported this. The Republicans have\n\n[[Page S9230]]\n\nsupported Senator Coburn's blocking bills that have passed \noverwhelmingly in the House. They would pass overwhelmingly here, but \nRepublicans are supporting his procedural blockage of these bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9230-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2982\n\n  Mr. REID. Another bill is the Runaway and Homeless Youth Protection \nAct. It would help combat youth homelessness and help protect \nvulnerable runaway youth. The prevalence of homelessness among young \npeople is high. Recent studies have suggested that more than 2 million \nyoung people either run away or are thrown out of homes each year. Many \nof them become homeless.

Madam President, there is a homeland security bill in the \npackage that Senator Coburn's office has objected to, being supported \nby his Republican colleagues. This legislation would establish two \nprograms to assist African Americans and others in conducting \ngenealogical and historical research. It would require the Archivist of \nthe United States to establish, as part of the National Archives, an \nelectronically searchable database and of historic records of \nservitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction contained \nwithin Federal agencies. The bill would also require the National \nHistorical Publications and Records Commission to provide grants to \nStates, colleges, universities, libraries, museums, and genealogical \nassociations to preserve records and establish databases of local \nrecords of such information. The bill passed the House 414 to 1.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of subtitle (b) of title VI of \nS. 3297, that we proceed to that, that the bill be read three times and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and there be \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me say, as Senator Coburn leaves the \nfloor, he knows there isn't a single bit of my mind or body that has \nany ill will toward him. He does this. I disagree with his doing this. \nHe has a right to do this. My objection is not with him. It is his \ncolleagues who procedurally support him in this. I want him to know our \nrelationship is very good. I like him. The fact that I like him doesn't \ntake away from my ability to disagree with him. Again, I would hope \nthat maybe later today we can come here and pass some of these other \nbills we have tried to do today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, it is my understanding I have 14 minutes \nremaining in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I appreciate the attitude with which the \nmajority leader comes. We have attempted to work out several bills that \nI think we will get worked out today. I would like to provide a more \ngeneral discussion about what went on here because the American people \nneed to know.\n  All these bills could have come to the floor for debate and \namendment. They haven't been blocked. What has happened is one Senator, \nmyself, to the dismay of most of my colleagues on my side of the aisle \nwho want these bills to pass, has said the American people ought to \nhear a debate. We ought to be able to amend the bills. We are talking \nabout $10 billion in new spending, 37 new Government agencies, and we \nare to pass that by not having any debate and just saying yes.\n  I will not do that. I understand that is frustrating to my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle. As a matter of fact, I get much more \nconsternation from Republicans than I do from Democrats for my desire \nfor us to be frugal with taxpayer dollars and also to be transparent. \nThe fact is, we ought to have debates. We ought to amend. If one \nwatches C-SPAN at all, what they see is, the vast majority of time, we \nare not doing anything in here. So there is plenty of time for us to do \nit.\n  I will make another significant point. We have in front of us a \nfinancial crisis that we are going to ask the American taxpayer to \nfund, some $700 billion in guarantees on loans, one way or the other, \nfor loans that are not performing, whether that be mortgages or other \nloans, commercial real estate, home real estate. We are getting ready \nto ask the American people to do that. The contention I have had in \nthis body since I have been here is completely opposite of what Senator \nReid voiced yesterday and again this morning, that these don't cost \nanything. If they don't cost anything and we are not going to spend any \nmoney, then they are not ever going to have any impact, if we don't \nspend the money. The fact is, authorizations matter because we do \nintend to spend the money. Therefore, if we continue to authorize and \nauthorize and grow the Government bigger than what it is today--and one \nof reasons we are in the jam today is because the Federal Government is \ntrying to do things totally outside the enumerated powers of the \nConstitution that were specifically given to us to limit the range and \nimpact and reach of the Federal Government. That is why we are going to \nbe asking for $700 billion of the next generation's money to make up \nfor mistakes that Congresses have made as we have reached beyond what \nthe Constitution says.\n  The very idea to claim that these don't spend any money flies in the \nface of reality. I would like to submit to the record a release on \nmilitary aid spending. It shows the duplicity associated with our \nwords. The majority leader said none of this spends any money. We \npassed the Defense authorization bill. Lo and behold, what are the \nreleases of all the Members of Congress that had marks and things that \ngo home on parochial interests? Here is what they say. They will spend \nmoney. Major research and military infrastructure needs will receive an \nenormous boost. Nearly $200 million in Federal spending to ensure the \nState's bases have everything they need.\n\n  Well, if authorizations do not spend any money, why are we claiming \nin press releases they do? We cannot have it both ways. The fact is, if \nwe say they do not spend any money, and we do not intend to appropriate \nit, what we are doing is playing a hoax on the American people.\n  We are going to have before us this week some very difficult \nchallenges for the Congress. The medicine, the painful medicine this \ncountry is going to have to take to reestablish confidence in our \nfinancial markets is directly related to the behavior of not \ndeauthorizing and not getting rid of wasteful programs. The fact is, \nthe Government Accountability Office has specifically listed out, along \nwith the inspectors general of each of the agencies, as well as the \nCongressional Budget Office and Congressional Research Service, over \n$300 billion of waste, fraud, or duplication.\n  When was the last time we aggressively eliminated waste, we \naggressively eliminated fraud, we aggressively eliminated duplication? \nThe President has admitted that combining the debt with what we are \nborrowing from Social Security, this next year we are going to have a \n$600 billion deficit.\n\n[[Page S9233]]\n\nNot only are we going to take $700 billion and put it into \nnonperforming loans, we are going to borrow another $600 billion from \nthe next generation to operate the Government, when we know over $300 \nbillion of that is waste.\n  What are we doing? We are passing more authorizations with new \nspending, which will get spent, or we are being dishonest with those \npeople who say we are supporting those programs. It is time for a \nchange. Both campaigns on the Presidential side are talking about that. \nBut the change that needs to happen is a change inside Congress, that \nwe will start addressing the real problem. Imagine the fact that HHS \nput out that in 2007 31 percent of all Medicare payments were \nimproperly made, with about 80 percent of those being overpayments.\n  It does not sound like much until you see that is almost 80 billion \nof Medicare dollars that were improperly paid. Where is the bill on the \nfloor now to fix that? Where is the bill on the floor to get us out of \nthe energy jam we are in? Instead, we are authorizing new programs \nwithout eliminating others and continuing the very errors of our ways \nthat got us into the jam we are now going to ask the American taxpayers \nto give us $700 billion to get us out of.\n  It time for a timeout in Washington. It is time for us to reconsider \nhow we do things, why we do things, and when we do things. Passing \nlarge numbers of new authorizations without eliminating the areas that \nare not working now does not fix anything. All it will do is make it \nmore expensive to continue to fail. It also means we do not hold the \nbureaucracies accountable, which we are not.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer the amount of time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 41 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Presiding Officer. I will finish in a moment.\n  The question the American people ought to be asking of Congress right \nnow, I believe, is this: You took an oath to uphold the Constitution. \nThe Constitution has in it this very significant component that is \ncalled the Enumerated Powers Act. It is article II, section 8. It tells \nus exactly what we are to be about, what we are to do, and what we are \nnot to do. The question you ought to measure us on is: Are we following \nthe U.S. Constitution? Many of the bills Senator Reid just brought \nforward are well within the bounds of the Enumerated Powers, but many \nof them are not. Yet we think at a parochial level and a political \nlevel about our own reelections and we forget this document that has \nguided this country so well.\n  My hope is the American people will start demanding that we follow \nthis rule book, this guide book. If we do, not only will we eliminate \nthat $300 billion of waste, fraud, and abuse, we will eliminate another \n$300 billion worth of programs that do not have any role coming out of \nthe Federal Government, and we will put Government closer and more \ndirectly accountable to the very people who are being governed, and \nthat is back at the local and State levels.\n  I will say in finishing up, Senator Reid made several references to \nthe Republican caucus. I will assure him that the vast majority of the \nmembers of my caucus do not support my position on authorizations. \nTheir only support of me came in light of contrasting it next to an \nenergy bill, which we still have not accomplished.\n  Congress has still not done anything about the No. 1 national \nsecurity issue facing us, which is our dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy. That is what we ought to be about this week. We ought to pass a \nCR. We ought to do what we have to do to fix the financial crisis. And \nwe ought to be back making sure that another year does not go by where \nwe do not have a comprehensive plan that utilizes every bit of \nAmerica's talents, every bit of America's resources to make us less \ndependent and more secure on the issue of energy.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this document be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Reid Set To Deliver Nearly $200 Million to Nevada To Aid Military\n\n       Washington, DC.--Major research efforts in Nevada and \n     military infrastructure needs statewide could soon receive an \n     enormous boost from Nevada Senator Harry Reid, who is \n     delivering nearly $200 million in federal funding to help \n     ensure the state's bases have everything they need.\n       As part of the defense authorization bill passed Wednesday \n     by the Senate, Nevada will see important benefits if \n     President Bush drops his veto threat. Notable are the \n     construction of a $33.9 million Army Reserve Center in Las \n     Vegas, as well as nearly $64 million in improvements at \n     Nellis Air Force Base. This includes construction of a hangar \n     and aircraft maintenance unit, and infrastructure upgrades \n     for the F-16 aggressor squadron at the base.\n       There is also more than $32 million for improvements at \n     Creech Air Force Base in Indian Springs, including funds for \n     the construction of the Unmanned Aerial Systems Flight \n     Simulator and Academics Facility.\n       ``Safety abroad begins with strength at home, and I will \n     always make sure Nevada's military installations are as \n     strong as possible,'' Reid said. ``This money will improve \n     both our ability to protect our country and the quality of \n     life for the troops we appreciate so greatly. I will always \n     deliver for our military and for our veterans when their \n     military service ends, and I call upon the President to do \n     the same by signing this bill.''\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

HARRIS, SR.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today with a heavy heart to \nremember Kenneth N. Harris, Sr., of Baltimore City.\n  Ken Harris was a Baltimore City councilman, community activist, and \nchampion of safe and family friendly neighborhoods. He loved his \nfamily, was so proud of his children, and he was my good friend.\n  Ken grew up in west Baltimore's Sandtown and Park Heights \nneighborhoods, where the strict guidance of a single mother and \nafternoons at the YMCA gave him the self-assurance and direction he \nneeded to succeed in an environment where so many others struggled to \nsurvive. He graduated from Dunbar High School and worked four jobs to \nput himself through Morgan State University. After graduation, Ken went \nto work for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland and began his \nprofessional life in the corporate world, including Comcast Cable. For \nmany, professional achievement and financial security are enough. But \nnot for Ken.\n  Concerned about his children's school and his neighborhood, Ken soon \nbecame a community leader serving as president of the Leith Walk \nElementary School PTA and the Glen Oaks Community Improvement \nAssociation. Encouraged by his ability to make a positive change, Ken \nran for office and was elected to two terms in the Baltimore City \nCouncil, representing the 4th District, an elected office he would, no \ndoubt, continue to hold today had he not decided to run for president \nof the city council.\n  While in the city council, Ken championed the rights of his \nneighbors. He sponsored legislation to stop landlords from throwing \ntenants' belongings out on the street--saving many tenants from \nhomelessness and cleaning up the streets. He pushed for remedial \nprograms in the public schools, such as the Baltimore Truancy \nAssessment Center, to encourage students to stay in school. He took the \npolice to task for not having enough real community policing but too \nmany reckless warrants, arrests. Last month, when the new Hilton Hotel \nopened in downtown Baltimore, it was remembered that it was Ken Harris \nwho insisted that if the city was going to financially ensure the \ndevelopment of the hotel, the city and the developer also had to ensure \nfinancial support for college students and afterschool recreational \nopportunities for schoolchildren.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Ken's family, his wife \nAnnette, his daughter Nicol, and his son Kenneth, Jr., for sharing her \nhusband and their father with our city and the State of Maryland. His \nlife, which ended all too soon, made a difference in the lives of many \nothers, and his contributions will not be forgotten.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 6049, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6049) to amend the Internal Revenue Service \n     Code of 1986 to provide incentives for energy production and \n     conservation, to extend certain expiring provisions, to \n     provide individual income tax relief, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5633\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Grassley and \nmyself, I call up amendment No. 5633, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 5633.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this amendment would extend and improve \ntax incentives for clean, renewable energy. It is a good energy \namendment and energy policy for America.\n  Here is the bottom line: This amendment would create thousands of new \nAmerican jobs--jobs that would pay good wages. This amendment would \nbegin the end of America's dependence on foreign oil. And this \namendment gives us a chance to show America, before we go home in \nOctober, that Congress can actually work for them.\n  This amendment would extend and improve tax credits for wind and \nsolar power. It would extend and improve tax incentives for building \nand appliance efficiency. And it would extend and improve incentives \nfor clean coal and biofuels.\n  And this amendment would create new incentives for clean energy. It \nincludes a credit of up to $7,500 to help consumers purchase plug-in \nhybrid cars. It includes a breakthrough credit for the capture and \nstorage of carbon dioxide.\n  And it includes a new tax incentive for what people are calling \n``smart meters.'' Smart meters provide real-time information on \nelectricity use. And thus smart meters have proven to reduce \nelectricity use.\n  This amendment would allow my home State of Montana to further \ndevelop its vast energy resources, from wind power to biofuels, from \nclean coal to solar power.\n  I have been trying to pass a version of this amendment for most of \nthe last couple years. And I am very pleased that passage may well be \nat hand.\n  Mr. President, the last bill that extended energy tax provisions was \nthe Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. The ink was hardly dry on \nthat law before I set out to extend and modify the energy incentives \nthat it included.\n  The Finance Committee undertook a series of hearings on energy-tax \npolicy at the beginning of last year. Our hearing topics ranged from \nrenewable electricity to biofuels, from electric vehicles to carbon \nsequestration, from energy efficiency to clean coal technology. We \nheard from a wide range of experts on the need for reliable, long-term \ntax incentives for clean energy, and how best to invest in these \nincentives.\n  We used this input to develop a far-ranging clean-energy bill. It \nwould have invested roughly $30 billion over 10 years.\n  Our bill included long-term extensions for the wind and solar tax \ncredits. It included long-term extensions and modifications of \nincentives for improved building efficiency. It included new \nincentives, such as favorable tax treatment for transmission lines, so \nwe can get renewable power to the market. And it included a credit for \ncellulosic biofuels, which I am proud to have helped pass a couple \nmonths ago in the farm bill.\n  In keeping with the philosophy of paying-as-you-go, the Finance \nCommittee offset the cost of that package. The offsets largely scaled \nback or repealed tax breaks for the long-established oil and gas \nindustry.\n  We scaled back tax incentives for oil and gas companies in order to \nincrease tax support for clean energy. Our rationale was twofold.\n  First, we argued that as America moves to address global warming, we \nshould begin to provide Federal support for energy that is less carbon-\nintensive, not more.\n  Second, we argued that with oil and gas prices on the rise, the oil \nand gas industry did not need tax incentives that it may have needed in \nthe past. Indeed, in 2005, President Bush said, ``I will tell you with \n$55 oil we don't need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore.'' \nWhen the Finance Committee reported our bill on June 19, 2007, oil \ntraded at more than $69 a barrel.\n  We needed 60 votes to pass the bill. And the oil and gas industry \nlobbied hard to prevent us from reaching that threshold. We had a \nstrong Senate majority for the Finance Committee product. But we fell 3 \nvotes shy of the 60 needed to break a filibuster.\n  So we went back to the drawing board. We listened to the concerns \nfrom the other side that the oil and gas tax offsets were too big. We \nscaled back our bill. We worked with the House Ways and Means Committee \nto produce a package with a roughly $20 billion pricetag--about a third \nsmaller than our committee-reported bill.\n  And the argument for our offsets grew stronger. When the Finance \nCommittee reported its bill, a barrel of oil sold for $69. Four weeks \nlater, oil crossed the $75 threshold. In October of last year, oil \ntopped $85 a barrel. And a month after that, oil reached $95 a barrel.\n  In December of last year, we presented our revised $20 billion energy \npackage to the Senate. When the Senate voted on that package, oil \ntraded at $92 per barrel.\n  Our argument swayed a couple of votes, but not enough to break 60. \nDespite dramatically scaled-back oil and gas tax offsets, our bill fell \nshort by just one vote: 59 votes to 40.\n  So I went back to the drawing board another time. I wrote an energy \ntax package without oil and gas offsets.\n  I introduced legislation to pay for an energy-tax package by closing \ntax loopholes and by delaying a tax benefit for multinational \ncorporations. These items also offset the cost of expiring nonenergy \ntax provisions, such as the tuition deduction and the research and \ndevelopment credit.\n  I have tried to move this package for the last several months. While \nI dropped the oil and gas tax offsets, some still objected. We made \nseveral attempts to pass this vital legislation, with non-oil and gas \ntax offsets. But it did not clear the Senate.\n  But now energy prices are sky-high. And many more Senators have come \nto agree that it makes sense to scale back oil and gas tax breaks.\n  So Senator Grassley and I worked together to rewrite our energy tax \npackage one more time. The package before us today is a bit more modest \nthan it used to be. But it is still a valuable set of incentives.\n  It would foster clean-energy jobs, here in America. It would help us \nto address energy independence. And it would help us to address global \nwarming.\n  Our amendment would extend the section 45 production tax credit, for \nwind and biomass and geothermal. It would provide an 8-year extension \nof the credit for solar projects. And it would remove the $2,000 cap on \nthe residential solar credit, giving consumers a strong incentive to \npower their homes with solar power. The amendment would extend the \nbiodiesel credit, as well as the incentive for property used to refuel \nalternative vehicles.\n  As before, today's amendment also has several new incentives. It \nincludes the new plug-in hybrid credit--an incentive of up to $7,500 \nfor consumers to purchase clean-running, next-generation vehicles. The \namendment includes new incentives for conservation as well--in the form \nof those ``smart meters'' and investments in recycling property.\n\n[[Page S9235]]\n\n  This energy package would help move us in the right direction toward \ncleaner, home-grown energy.\n  The amendment is offset by a series of tax provisions, both energy- \nand nonenergy-related. For example, the amendment addresses the section \n199 manufacturing deduction for oil and gas activity. Congress passed \nthis deduction in 2004, when oil traded at about $50 a barrel. It is \nset to increase to 9 percent in 2010. Our amendment would freeze that \ndeduction at 6 percent for oil and gas activity.\n  Another offset closes a loophole related to oil companies' foreign \nincome. This provision passed the Finance Committee last year. And it \nwould streamline and simplify reporting of income earned on overseas \noil and gas activity.\n  Another offset is basis reporting. This provision would improve tax \ncompliance. It would require brokers to tell their clients and the IRS \nthe cost basis of securities sold during the year. This provision would \nhelp taxpayers to file more accurate tax returns. And it would help the \nIRS to more efficiently identify tax returns that are not correctly \nfiled.\n  In essence, it will help us close the tax gap. As you know, about \n$340 billion a year worth of revenue legally owed to Uncle Sam is not \nbeing collected today. This tax reporting provision will help put a \ndent in that tax gap.\n  This amendment does not include everything that I would like. On the \nclean energy incentives side, I would have liked to extend the \nrenewable production credit for a longer period. I would have liked to \nprovide incentives for improving our electricity grid.\n  I would have liked a more robust set of measures to address the use \nof clean coal. No matter how much some people dislike coal, the fact is \nthat we get half of our electricity from coal. We need to burn it \ncleanly.\n  As for offsets, while oil has retreated from an all-time high of \nnearly $150 per barrel, the price of crude closed at $121 a barrel \nyesterday. That is still a very strong incentive to explore and \nproduce. Whether the price of oil is $121 or $150--or even, as \nPresident Bush said, $55--it's hard to argue that oil and gas activity \nneeds a boost from the American taxpayer. We will continue this debate \nin the next Congress.\n  This amendment does not do everything. But it would prevent vital \nenergy tax extensions from expiring. And it would add new clean-energy \nincentives. We cannot start addressing global warming without a \nrecognition that--at least for now--clean and alternative energy \ngenerally cannot compete with the fossil-based variety without at least \na little help from incentives like these.\n  And so I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I urge their \nsupport to create thousands of jobs in the clean tech industry. I urge \ntheir support to help address global warming. I urge their support to \nhelp foster greater energy independence.\n  Let's adopt this amendment. Let's show America that Congress can work \nfor them. And let's finish what we have to do before the end of the \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am pleased that we are finally \ndiscussing legislation that is designed to deal with time-sensitive tax \nmatters. I thank Chairman Baucus for his cooperation in working in a \nbipartisan way on this legislation.\n  There are five categories of time-sensitive tax matters. These are \nthings that are sunset. For those in the public who don't recognize the \nword ``sunset,'' at certain times, legislation comes to an end and must \nbe reenacted. That is called sunset.\n  The first category of this sunset legislation is the alternative \nminimum tax fix. It expired on December 31 of last year. If we don't \nact, 24 million families will face an average tax increase of at least \n$2,000 each.\n  The second category of tax relief includes several tax benefits \navailable to middle-income taxpayers. These expired also December 31 of \nlast year. Included are deductions for out-of-pocket expenses for \nteachers who buy supplies for their classrooms, sales tax in various \nStates that have a sales tax but not income tax, and college tuition \nfor middle-income families. Millions of taxpaying families would face \nan unexpected tax increase if this sunset legislation is not reenacted.\n  The third category in the bill consists of many valuable business \nincentives, such as the research and development tax credit that has \nlikewise expired and has put corporations in a position of not doing \nresearch and development or maybe wondering whether the tax incentives \nare going to be available to them. This will reenact incentives such as \nthat.\n\n  In this time of high oil prices and instability in the energy market, \nCongress should send a clear signal in support of alternative energy \nand conservation. This very important issue is dealt with in the fourth \ncategory in this bill. We will be considering that issue today to send \na strong signal in support of alternative and renewable energy, as well \nas conservation. We will not let the wide assortments of tax incentives \nfor alternative energy and conservation expire this year, which would \notherwise happen.\n  The fifth and final category deals with the disasters that have \nravaged the Nation's heartland, especially my State of Iowa and, of \ncourse, most recently the gulf coast, particularly along Galveston. We \nneed to respond to help these folks in these regions, and these tax \nincentives are meant to help both business rehabilitation, as well as \nindividual rehabilitation.\n  I believe this legislation is must-do business. Congress cannot \ndawdle any longer. And with a sense of emergency and urgency, Senator \nReid and Senator McConnell, the leaders of the Senate, have devised a \npath for the Senate to complete action on these provisions. I would \nrather have processed this legislation over a period of time. Several \nmonths ago would have been a better time to process this sensitive \nbusiness. Better late than never, and this is late, and better to do it \nnow than not to get the job done at all.\n  Our leaders provided Chairman Baucus and me with the authority to do \na compromise. That, of course, was a critical step. I am glad our \nleaders were able to get together on that point. So Chairman Baucus and \nI pulled out our note pads and resharpened our pencils and, of course, \nhere we are with this bipartisan compromise.\n  I am confident that the Senate will approve the first and third \namendments that will be before the Senate. The first amendment will \ndeal with the fully offset energy tax incentives package that I will \ndeal with in some detail in a minute. The third amendment will contain \na bipartisan compromise on the alternative minimum tax fix and, of \ncourse, these business extenders to which I have referred.\n  In between those two bipartisan amendments will be an amendment to be \noffered by Senator Reid for the Democratic caucus. All amendments will \nface a 60-vote threshold.\n  Last year, I laid out the principles Senate Republicans would follow \nwhen it came to revenue raisers, and those principles are still in \neffect, somewhat modified by the bill before us. But the basic \nrationale behind the Senate Republicans on revenue raisers is still \nthere.\n  The first principle I laid out is whether the proposal is good tax \npolicy. If the proposal is good tax policy, then we would support, and \nvice versa, not support if it is bad tax policy.\n  The compromise before us meets fully the needs of all Republicans on \nthis point that the principles of this bill are good tax policy.\n  The crackdown on offshore deferred compensation plans is appropriate \ntax policy. I am pleased we made it tougher on hedge fund managers by \nremoving a charitable loophole. Likewise, the offsets in the energy \nportion of the bill are appropriate policy.\n  The second principle I laid out last year deals with how revenue \nraisers are accounted for. This is where our two parties differ. How do \nthe two caucuses differ? Republicans do not want to go down the \nslippery slope of building in a bias toward automatic tax increases--I \nshould say almost automatic tax increases--and against current law tax \nrelief. This is especially compelling when appropriations are wholly \noutside the Democratic version of their pay-as-you-go principle.\n  Let me explain that we find it in our Republican caucus inconsistent \nthat Democrats would say, when you are going to continue existing tax \npolicy, you need to raise taxes on other Americans to pay for it. We \nbelieve existing\n\n[[Page S9236]]\n\ntax policy should be continued without offset.\n  The inconsistency for us comes from the Democratic point of view that \nif you want more spending in appropriations bills, you don't have to \npay for it. We find that highly inconsistent.\n  Also, I could say that expiring entitlement spending does not figure \nin to the Democratic caucus's pay-as-you-go proposition--another \ninconsistency.\n  The Democratic version of pay as you go sets us down an irreversible \npath of higher taxes and higher spending. If expiring tax relief and \nexpiring spending and appropriations were treated similarly, maybe the \ndeficit reduction rationale behind pay as you go would be credible. As \nit exists now, it only reinforces an ideology of higher taxes and \nhigher spending. The rejection of Senator McConnell's deficit-neutral \noffer on alternative minimum tax and the extenders proves my point. I \nwill refer to a chart which shows the bias toward more spending and \nagainst current law tax relief.\n  If we look at that chart, we see the red line is one of mandatory \nexpiring spending. We see the annual increase in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending going up very much. We see the annual cost of \nincreased AMT, the solid green line, going down, and we see making \ncertain other tax provisions permanent and what that does.\n  In any event, we found ourselves at an impasse on this point, but we \nstill were able to reach this compromise that is before us.\n  In getting to that compromise, Democrats insisted on offsetting \ncurrent law tax relief, and Republicans resisted more tax and spend. \nRepublicans were willing to use revenue raisers for new policy and for \nlong-term or permanent tax policy. Republicans did not want to use \nrevenue raisers for new spending.\n  We came to a compromise by looking at this impasse as kind of a \nprism. A prism breaks one beam of light into several different shades. \nI have a chart showing the most famous prism of recent decades. It is a \ncopy of the album entitled ``The Dark Side of the Moon'' by the band \nPink Floyd. I am not, of course, a big fan of rock music. I am not a \nfan of its lyrics and its culture, but I think this piece of art by \nitself makes this very important point as ideal with this compromise \nlegislation before us.\n  As we can see, there is a beam of white light on the left side of the \ntriangular prism. On the right side, the beam of light is very \nfractured and multishades.\n  At the end of the day, we will have an alternative minimum tax fix, \nwe will have extenders, and we will have an energy and disaster relief \npackage that is a compromise. That is the white light on the left side. \nRepublicans will see that the compromise meets their principles.\n  Let's say Republicans see the red light on the right. The offsets are \ngood policy. From a Republican standpoint, there is enough new policy \nin the energy part of the deal to tie the nonenergy offsets; otherwise, \nenergy incentives are reformed. That is our way of looking at this \nwithin the policy I annunciated a year ago. Republicans can see that \nthe biggest item in the bill, the alternative minimum tax, is not \noffset. That preserves our point that the unfair alternative minimum \ntax--hitting 23 million middle-class Americans if we don't fix it--\nshould not be a reason to raise taxes on other taxpayers.\n  Likewise, there is enough new and modified policy to tie to the \noffshore deferred compensation revenue. The bottom line is that the \nleaders were able to secure a longer term extension of current policy, \nas well as with the revenue.\n  Democrats are able to see the offset policy from their standpoint. \nThat is the blue strand of light on the right side of the prism. \nDemocrats wanted significant revenue raisers, and they got them. Both \nsides wanted the underlying revenue-losing extensions and new policy.\n  Most prisms are delicate. They are transitory. This one is no \ndifferent. Our friends in the House need to see that. They can break \nthis fragile prism. The shards will cut millions of taxpaying families.\n  This deal defers the very vital debate between Republicans and \nDemocrats on whether we tax our way out of this fiscal situation--the \nDemocratic view--or contrariwise, do we restrain spending. That is the \nRepublican view. That is a very important debate which has held us up \nfor so very long. That very important debate is deferred to another \nday.\n  Each side holds to its principles. Each side does the people's \nbusiness. I thank Chairman Baucus and both leaders for getting us to \nthis point of compromise where each of us can have some victories. But \nfor me, it is preserving the very basic policies of the Republican \ncaucus.\n  Using the prism that presents the opportunity to preserve tax relief \nfor millions of middle-income families, I ask that we pass this \ncompromise.\n  Madam President, one of the amendments we will be voting on today is \nthe energy tax extenders bill that I just told you I would refer to in \ndetail, and here it is.\n  I once heard a man say he always went everywhere with his wife \nbecause he never wanted to kiss her goodbye. Our dependence on foreign \noil is very similar. As Americans, we know our dependence on foreign \noil is not pretty but have not found a way to kiss that dependence \ngoodbye. We need to enact commonsense, bipartisan laws, such as this \nenergy tax extenders amendment that we will be voting on, the first \nvote midafternoon. It will help America move toward ending its \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  We are almost three-quarters of the way through this year, 2008. \nSince January 1 of this year, a number of energy tax relief provisions \nhave already expired. In addition, a number of energy tax provisions \nare set to expire in just 3 months. For example, section 45, production \ntax credit for energy production for wind and refined coal, is extended \nthrough the year 2009.\n  Importantly, the wind production tax credit does not have the harmful \n35-percent cap that the House Democratic leadership wants to place on \nit.\n  Another provision contained in this amendment is a new credit for \nelectric plug-in vehicles. Consumers who purchase an electric plug-in--\nand it has to be a passenger vehicle--can get up to a $7,500 tax \ncredit. If Americans are using electricity instead of gas to power \ntheir cars, it is a step toward reducing our dependence on foreign oil, \nmuch as ethanol has reduced our dependence on foreign oil for use in \nour cars by at least 5 percent.\n  Included in this amendment is a provision to reduce the tax on idling \nreduction units. These units are designed to eliminate the need for a \nbig rig to idle to provide heating, air-conditioning, and electricity \nwhen it is stopped.\n  That brings me to the fact that we are saving diesel in big Mack \ntrucks because they don't idle because we have this incentive for the \nseparate unit to keep the cab cool while people are sleeping. It \nirritates me then, when I look back to this summer--and maybe even \nright now for all I know--when I saw Government officials using their \nchauffeured SUVs which were idling outside our office buildings wasting \na great deal of fuel. As Members of Congress, we should be setting a \ngood example for the American people by conserving fuel and not wasting \nit. For instance, I have a Ford Taurus. You don't see it idling outside \nmy home or outside of wherever I am momentarily stopped. You surely \nwould not see my driver in it because I don't have one. If you do see \nanyone else driving my Taurus, please call the police because someone \nhas stolen my car. I would like to refer to Ashton Kutcher, from Cedar \nRapids, IA, saying: ``Dude, Where's my car?''\n\n  So far, the Senate has not passed these popular expiring and expired \nenergy tax extender provisions. However, the Senate has now reached a \nbipartisan agreement that should enable us to pass this first amendment \nthat we will be voting on midafternoon. This first amendment contains \nthese popular energy tax extender provisions--many beyond what I have \nalready talked about--as well as revenue offsets for these provisions.\n  My fellow Republicans were divided on whether energy should be \noffset. Some opposed any tax increase on oil and gas. Others, such as \nthis Senator, looked to convert conventional energy tax incentives into \nincentives for alternative energy and conservation. On the other hand, \nalmost all Democrats were in this ``conversion'' camp. I kind of\n\n[[Page S9237]]\n\nfeel myself like we have had a lot of incentives for old-time fossil \nfuels; that those industries are developed, and it is okay to move that \nmoney from that source over to alternative energy--a new industry that \nwe are in the middle of developing and, in the case of ethanol, for a \nlong time have been developing.\n  We compromised between Republicans and Democrats by cutting back the \nfollowing oil and gas tax incentives, which totaled roughly $9 billion. \nFirst, we froze the manufacturing deduction for all oil and gas \nproduction at 6 percent. We reformed the use of the foreign tax credit \nfor major oil companies. This offset is very important to get done. \nFinally, we raised the cap on funding for the oil spill trust fund.\n  To reach the $17 billion target for fully offsetting this energy tax \npackage, we used a couple of nonoil and gas offsets totaling roughly $8 \nbillion. First, we included the Bush administration's ``tax gap'' \nproposal to have securities firms report the cost of stock purchases \nand sales to the Internal Revenue Service. Secondly, we extended the \nunemployment surtax.\n  In keeping with the principle that tax offsets should make good \npolicy sense and should be used to pay for new tax policy, we used \nthese $8 billion in nonoil and gas offsets to pay at least $8 billion \nin new energy tax policy because it is a Republican program that if you \nhave new tax policy, it should be offset. Our objection is to \noffsetting existing tax policy that might sunset; that you want to \nextend it in the same way it has been functioning for the last several \nyears.\n  So the bottom line of this is that both sides compromised. Democrats \nyielded on unoffset popular current law tax relief--AMT as an example--\nand Republicans agreed to offsets that were good tax policy. But we \nensured that our principle that major current law tax relief, such as \nthe alternative minimum tax fix, should not be conditioned on other tax \nincreases.\n  It is important to note that if we don't do more to encourage \nalternative energy, we might one day run out of oil and end up having \nto drive the alternative vehicles, such as Fred Flintstone, as you \nrecall from the cartoon on television.\n  So I urge a ``yes'' vote on this first amendment that we will be \nvoting on midafternoon, and I hope we can get this bipartisan agreement \nthrough and get it to the House of Representatives because we only have \na little time left before we adjourn for the elections.\n  I yield the floor, and as I don't see any other Member who wants to \nspeak, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent, \nMadam President, before you call the roll, to divide the time that \nlapses in the quorum call between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I have been in meetings all morning \ntrying to work through the hurricane relief package that is certainly \nimportant to my home State of Texas, meeting with the mayors of Houston \nand Galveston as they go to their hearings for oversight for FEMA and \ndisaster relief. I know we are learning much about what can be done, \nbut I think we are doing so much better than with any previous \nhurricane relief.\n  But I am also absorbed in the financial crisis that is certainly \npresent in our country today and is affecting so many people, so many \njobs, so many families, and so many lives. All of us are going to be \nmaking some very tough decisions this week, and I wished to talk about \nthe parameters I am going to put around any package that is put before \nus for passage that would help us get through this historical time in \nour country with regard to our economy.\n  Here is what I am looking for. I am looking for a package that, first \nand foremost, protects the American family who is doing the best they \ncan and doing the right thing; the family who has put their money in a \nmoney market fund, as well as bank deposits. We need to protect them. \nWe are hearing that will be done without any further action. So we need \nto do that. We need to protect those money market funds so no one will \nlose their life savings because they are doing what is right for their \nfamilies--saving for their retirement or for their futures or for their \nemergency needs or people trying to keep their homes. If they are \nkeeping their mortgages current or they are working with their bank to \ntry to extend or lower interest rates, and they have an agreement in \norder to keep that mortgage going, we want to make sure they are able \nto do that.\n  That is what we are looking for in a package that we would pass. It \nis the most important thing that every American is looking toward \nCongress to do. We want to work together in a bipartisan way--the \nCongress, the administration, the Federal Reserve--to address this \nfinancial issue in a way that protects every family and every person \nwho is doing what is right for their futures and their families.\n  The second major part of any package has to be protection of the \ntaxpayers. The taxpayers are going to basically underwrite what we \ndecide is the right thing to do. So if we are going to underwrite, we \nwant the taxpayers to also have an upside. We want the taxpayers to be \nprotected. We want the taxpayers to have the regulatory underpinnings \nthat would assure they are protected and we want them to have the \nupside. There is an upside in the AIG bailout that the Federal Reserve \nhas put in place, and that is good, because I believe there is a great \nchance that will turn out to be a profit for the taxpayers if that is \ndone correctly.\n  I think that should be the model for the package coming forth this \nweek upon which we will decide; that there will be an upside position \nfor the taxpayer, so that when the packages are put together and the \nbad loans--or the nonperforming loans--are taken off the books, there \nis an upside to that if those loans perform or if the company succeeds \nafter the bad loans are out.\n  Going down the road, I do think Senator Gregg is saying it best. I \nthink he will probably be able to come out and talk about his view, but \nit is that we put everything that comes back--in the stabilization that \nwe would provide--to debt reduction. Instead of taking the debt up to \npossibly $1 trillion, we would pay down the debt so there would be \nrelatively no cost to the taxpayer and we would begin the very long \nprocess of not only putting our financial house in order, but we would \nalso start putting our monetary system and our debt repayment back in \norder.\n\n  Before 9/11, this country had wiped out the deficit. Congress had \nwiped out the deficit. We had wiped out the deficit and were paying \ndown the debt. That is where all of us want to be again--that we would \nwipe out deficits by careful, prudent spending and that we would start \npaying down that debt so the interest payments do not overwhelm us. \nThose are the basic parameters I believe Congress should put in the \nmix, as we are being asked to vote for a very important stabilization \nof the financial institutions and the families of this country. \nCongress can put its stamp on this package in our fiduciary \nresponsibility and we can do this right and assure that we do it right. \nThat is our job. That is our responsibility--to carefully look at the \npackage that will be put forward, to have input from Congress and the \nkey people in Congress who are working with the Secretary and the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, to do what is right for our country. \nPolitics should be thrown out the window right now. We should be \ntalking about what is our role, our fiduciary responsibility as elected \nofficials, elected by the taxpayers, and we should be doing it on a \nbipartisan basis. We should be inclusive, not exclusive.\n  I think we are going to do it. We have an opportunity here to give \nthe taxpayers and American people the confidence that we will do this \nin their best interests and do it right. That is my hope. I do have the \nconfidence we can do it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9238]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance \nof the renewable energy amendment that is coming before us on the next \nvote in the Senate. For the past several months I have worked with \nSenator Cantwell, as well as many other Members of this body, in a \nbipartisan manner to develop a way forward on renewable energies.\n  We know and agree that more renewable green energy is needed for the \nUnited States. That was evidenced by an amendment that Senator Cantwell \nand I brought to the floor on the housing bill last April that passed \nby a vote of 88 to 8. We all realize that there is broad bipartisan \nconsensus and that we want more renewable green energy for the United \nStates.\n  The question was, how do we get it enacted into law? What we have \nbefore us today, through working together in a bipartisan way once \nagain, is a compromise of how to offset the cost of some of these tax \ncredits.\n  I am very pleased that, with the help of Chairman Baucus and Ranking \nMember Grassley of the Finance Committee, Senator Cantwell and I were \nable to come up with this renewable energy amendment that is fully \noffset and fully paid for, so that we can get this bill finally passed \ninto law.\n  What does this mean for our country? Well, first, I think most \nAmericans are well aware of what is going on in Washington right now. \nOur country is on the brink of financial catastrophe. We are working \nvery hard to stop this from happening and bring consumer confidence \nback to our financial markets.\n  This, however, only solves the immediate crisis. We have a longer \nterm economic problem in this country. There is nothing more important \nto our economy than having a comprehensive energy plan for the United \nStates. Renewable energy is only part of that comprehensive energy plan \nfor the United States though.\n  Within the bill we have before us, there are strong incentives for \nall types of clean energy, including solar power, geothermal, wind, and \nbiofuels. If somebody wants to add solar power panels to their home, \nthere are currently some incentives in today's law, but those \nincentives are not adequate. We encourage more and more people to put \nsolar power into their own homes so they can actually help solve the \nenergy problems we have in this country in their own home.\n  I think it is important that the Senate say to the House of \nRepresentatives, let's pass this bill in a strong bipartisan fashion. \nThis is so the House of Representatives will take up this bill, pass \nit, and send it to the President where he can sign this bipartisan \npiece of legislation into law.\n  I strongly believe that we need a comprehensive energy plan for the \nUnited States of America that includes an all-of-the-above approach. \nThis would include alternative green energies, drilling for more oil \nand natural gas, more clean coal energy, and clean nuclear energy, all \nof which include more conservation for the United States. We need all \nof this if we are to stop sending $700 billion overseas. A lot of that \nmoney is going to countries who do not like us. Some is even going to \nfund terrorist organizations that want to do harm to the United States \nof America.\n  It is critical that we have a comprehensive energy plan. Let's at \nleast do the renewable energy part of the energy plan, today. I want to \nthank all who have worked so hard on this. On the solar part of this \nbill alone, it is estimated that 400,000 jobs could become permanent in \nthe United States between now and the year 2016. These people would be \nbuilding solar panels for houses, for businesses, for powerplants and \nthe like. Over 1 million jobs will be produced in the building of a \npowerplant.\n  This is a good bill for our economy. It is a good bill for the power \ngeneration of the United States of America, and it is a good bill for \nour environment.\n  In many ways, this is a very exciting bill. Right now, unfortunately, \nit is being overshadowed by what is happening in our financial markets. \nBut that does not mean this bill is not important; it is more important \nthan ever. I encourage all of our Senators to vote for it, and then the \nmessage needs to go to the House of Representatives: Let's not delay on \nthis bill; let's get this bill signed because this is the last week of \nbusiness we have this year. Let's get it passed in the House and sent \nto the President so that he can sign this bill into law and we can \nstart getting these jobs now.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this afternoon we will vote on energy tax \nextenders or tax incentives for renewable energy. I wanted to make a \ncomment about the importance of this legislation. I believe this will \nbe our tenth vote to try to extend the tax incentives for renewable \nenergy. It has been previously blocked nine times, which is almost \nunbelievable to me.\n  But at a time when we face a very severe energy problem in this \ncountry, and when we need to incentivize and begin developing \nadditional renewable sources of energy to make us less dependant on \nSaudi Arabia and Kuwait, Venezuela, Iraq, at a time when we need to be \nless dependent and produce other kinds of energy, we have been blocked \nin extending these energy tax credits. It makes no sense at all to me.\n  If you are going to address the energy problem in this country, we \nneed to do a lot of things. We need to conserve more. Yes, we need to \ndrill more, and we need much greater energy efficiency. We need to do a \nwhole lot of things, but this country needs to move ahead with respect \nto renewable energy on a much more aggressive path.\n  A substantial amount of energy comes every day from the Sun, and we \nuse precious little of it. A substantial amount of energy is available \nfrom the wind, and we use too little of it.\n  How does this compare to other energy resources? Now, here is what we \nhave done in the past for those who look for oil and gas. In 1916 this \ncountry said: If you are searching for oil and gas, we are going to \ngive you a big fat set of tax breaks, because we want you to find oil \nand gas. That has existed for nearly 100 years, those tax incentives \nfor those who search for oil and gas. Contrast that with what we have \ndone for those who want to proceed with renewable energy such as wind \nand solar.\n  In 1992, we put in place the production tax credit. These were short-\nterm and rather shallow tax incentives. They have been extended short \nterm five times. They have been allowed to expire three times. We have \nseen projects to put up new wind turbines and new solar projects put on \nthe shelf because these tax incentives have been in a start-stop, \nstutter step approach. It makes no sense. It is a pathetic, anemic \nresponse.\n  This country should be saying: Here is where we are headed for the \nnext decade. For the next decade you can\n\n[[Page S9239]]\n\ncount on this. We are going to develop wind resources and solar energy \nall across the country that will make us less dependent on Saudi \nArabia, Kuwait, and others. That is what this country should do.\n  We have had great difficulty getting a 1-year extension from these \nproduction tax credit for wind energy, as an example until December 31 \nnext year. I am going to celebrate today, if we pass this legislation. \nI believe we will. It is an achievement, but it is not a giant step \nforward. It is a baby step in the right direction because we have been \nblocked nine times by the minority from passing this legislation during \nthis Congress. My hope is that today, finally, we will get it done and \nget this finally sent back to the House and to the President for \nsignature.\n  We have had a lot of time on the floor of the Senate in recent weeks, \na lot of wringing of hands, mopping of brows and gnashing of teeth \nabout energy. This country's economy runs on energy. Sixty-five percent \nof the oil we use comes from overseas. We are unbelievably dependent on \nforeign sources of energy. How do we overcome that dependence to make \nus less vulnerable? We can do that by producing more here, which means \ndrilling and by substantial amounts of conservation. We are prodigious \nusers of energy, and we waste a lot. So while we produce more, we need \nto conserve more too. In everything we use every single day, from the \ntime we turn the light switch on in the morning, to all of our \nappliances like refrigerators, air-conditioners, dishwashers, and more, \nwe must make them more efficient. Many of these machines are more \nefficient now than they were in terms of all appliances. But we can \nimpose even greater standards and create greater efficiency. So \nproduction, conservation, and efficiency--all are elements of an \nimportant national energy program.\n  I believe most important is the decision to pursue renewable energy. \nWe do it with ethanol by taking alcohol from corn and extending our \nenergy supply. We do it with biodiesel too. We do it with a range of \nareas. Especially in the area of biomass, wind, solar, and geothermal \nenergy, there is such great potential. We have had so much difficulty \nproviding certainty about where America is going to head with renewable \nenergy.\n  I have introduced legislation saying we ought to do this for a full \ndecade. We ought to say to the world, to investors and businessmen and \nwomen: Here is where America is headed. You can count on it. We will \nproduce a lot of energy from renewable sources. We will maximize the \nopportunity to receive energy from the Sun. We have some projects that \nare interesting, but we have fallen far behind on solar energy. We are \nnot anywhere near where we ought to be in producing solar energy. We \nare not near where we can be in producing energy from the wind. We have \nunbelievable turbines now that are much more powerful. They can take \nenergy from the wind and use that energy to extend America's energy \nsupply.\n  This is a very important vote, but it is only a small step forward in \nthe right direction. It needs to be followed by a much larger step that \ntells the world where America is going. Yes, we will drill, conserve, \nall those things, but this country needs to decide that we want \nsubstantial amounts of additional renewable energy to make this economy \nless dependent on Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and Venezuela. They \nprovide us energy that comes from off our shores. Using more renewable \nenergy and using this energy wisely are very important elements to \nsustain our country's economic strength and opportunity in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I will vote for the renewable \nenergy tax legislation, Baucus-Grassley Amendment No. 5633, included in \nthe tax extenders package because it is the best balanced approach to \nencourage renewable and alternative forms of clean energy that the \nSenate has had a chance to consider. I especially like the fact that, \nafter many years, Congress is finally encouraging solar power in a \nserious way.\n  But the proposal would be much better if it would use the subsidy \nmoney designated for wind power instead for a dramatic new Federal \ninvestment in clean energy research and development.\n  This legislation adds nearly $5 billion to the $11.5 billion in \nFederal taxpayer dollars that are already committed to subsidize wind \npower over the next 10 years. This means that Congress will be spending \ntwo-thirds as much over the next 10 years to subsidize wind turbines as \nit did--in today's dollars--on the Manhattan Project to build the atom \nbomb. Wind power is a proven technology, useful in some places for \nclean electricity, but this disproportionate allocation of tax dollars \nis unwise because:\n  Wind turbines produce 1 percent of America's electricity.\n  There is only one wind farm in the southeastern United States because \nthe wind doesn't blow hard enough in that part of the country.\n  There is almost nowhere in the U.S. where consumers can rely mainly \non wind power without also needing coal, nuclear or gas--or maybe solar \nthermal--plants.\n  Wind power provides 2.7 percent of U.S. carbon-free electricity, \nwhich helps deal with climate change, but nuclear power provides 69 \npercent of U.S. carbon-free electricity.\n  Under existing law--without the new subsidies in this energy tax \nlegislation--beginning in 2010 the largest Federal taxpayer subsidy for \nproducing electricity would go to wind.\n  Per kilowatt hour, Federal subsidies for wind in 2007 were: 53 times \nthe subsidy for electricity made from coal; 15 times the subsidy for \nnuclear power; and 27 times the subsidy for all other forms of renewal \nelectricity.\n  If the Federal Government were to subsidize each kilowatt hour that \nnuclear power produces at the same rate it now subsidizes wind power, \nthe cost to taxpayers for the nuclear subsidy over the next 10 years \nwould be $289 billion.\n  On average, for every dollar Texas utilities pay wind developers, the \nFederal taxpayer pays another 69 cents.\n  Some say that by 2030 wind could generate 20 percent of America's \nelectricity. Over 10 years the Federal tax subsidy for this much wind \npower would be enough to give 55 million Americans $3,000 to help buy \nan electric plug-in car or truck.\n  Wind turbines are a dramatic disruption to the landscape. A typical \n1.5 megawatt wind turbine is as tall as a 40-story building. Its blades \nreach from 10 yard line to 10 yard line on a football field, and its \nblinking lights are visible for up to 20 miles.\n  I suspect the value of my vacant lot on Nantucket Island will go up \nwhen values go down on the other side of the island where a wind farm \nis being built.\n  Wind power is useful but not a true alternative energy because it \nblows only when it wants to--turbines operate, on average, 34 percent \nof the time--and can't be stored for baseload power, the kind our jobs \nand homes depend on, or for peaking power, the kind utilities buy in \nthe late afternoon when every home appliance is on. When cost of \ntransmission from remote locations is added, wind power can become very \nexpensive.\n  Instead of spending another $5 billion to subsidize a proven \ntechnology, wouldn't it be wiser to make a dramatic new Federal \ninvestment in energy research and development--a series of mini-\nManhattan Projects, for example--to: Make electric cars and trucks \ncommonplace, make solar power cost competitive, capture and store \ncarbon from coal-burning power p1ants, reprocess and store nuclear \nwaste, make advanced biofuels from crops we don't eat, encourage green \nbuildings, and provide energy from fusion.\n  According to MIT president Susan Hockfield, Federal funding for \nenergy research has ``dwindled to irrelevance''--$2.4 to $3.4 billion a \nyear--less than half the R budget of America's largest pharmaceutical \ncompany.\n  Use the wind subsidy money for new Manhattan projects, and use wind \nturbines where the wind blows and where transmission line costs make \nsense--and where both don't spoil the natural beauty of the great \nAmerican outdoors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5634\n\n  (Purpose: To provide alternative minimum tax relief, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending\n\n[[Page S9240]]\n\namendment be temporarily set aside so I may call up amendment No. 5634.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5634.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. What is the time on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour equally divided.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have offered this amendment to prevent \nthe alternative minimum tax from hitting 26 million taxpayers in 2008. \nMy amendment is fully paid for. That is how we should provide \nalternative minimum tax relief.\n  We need to wake up around here. We are facing a fiscal crisis, in \npart because of the massive deficits and debt we have run up as a \nNation that has helped propel this bubble. Our markets are in turmoil. \nThe Bush administration is now proposing to spend hundreds of billions \nof taxpayer dollars to stabilize Wall Street. We simply cannot continue \nto pile debt on top of debt. We have to begin to send a signal that the \nUnited States is going to start paying its bills. We are running \nmassive budget deficits, massive trade deficits. The debt of the \ncountry has mushroomed.\n  In one fell swoop, the administration is proposing adding $700 \nbillion more. That is on top of the $100 billion dedicated to Fannie \nMae, the $100 billion dedicated to Freddie Mac, and the $85 billion \ndedicated to AIG. Let's add that up. That is nearly a trillion dollars. \nLet's add the $30 billion for Bear Sterns. We are over a trillion \ndollars.\n  Let's think very carefully about what is happening. Yesterday, the \nWashington Post reported the dollar declined in value against the euro \nby more than 2 percent in a single day. I ask people who are watching \nand listening to think very carefully now about how these events are \nconnected. The dollar has gone down in value sharply. Already in the \nlast 6 years it has gone down about 40 percent against the Euro. \nYesterday, in one day, it went down 2 percent. In one day, the stock \nmarket went down almost 400 points. In one day, the price of oil went \nup by a record amount for a single-day increase. These events are all \nconnected. We have to connect the dots. The dollar goes down in value, \noil sells in dollar terms. That puts upward pressure on oil prices.\n  Of course, as people see that we are headed toward some kind of \neconomic weakness, they look for safe havens. One place to look is \ncommodities. A key reason people are losing confidence in the dollar is \nthe mushrooming debt. To add in just a matter of days almost a trillion \ndollars to a debt that already stands at $9.6 trillion has an effect on \npeople's confidence in the ability of the United States to repay. That \nmeans they are going to insist on higher interest rates in order to \ncontinue to extend us credit.\n  As we run up these massive deficits and debt, where do we get the \nmoney to pay for this? We get it by borrowing, and increasingly we have \nbeen getting it from borrowing from other countries. We cannot afford \nto continue on this course of not paying for things.\n  We can look back now and see the results of these irresponsible \nfiscal policies. In the last eight years, we have seen the five highest \ndeficits ever recorded, with the highest of those now projected to come \nin 2009. The 2009 estimate of the deficit does not include the still \nunknown cost of the Federal intervention to help the financial markets. \nBut our budget situation is actually even worse. The debt is going up \nmuch more rapidly than the reported deficit. For example, the increase \nin the debt in 2008 will be far greater than the estimated $407 billion \ndeficit. That is because the general fund of the United States is \ntaking the surpluses from Social Security and Medicare and using those \nfunds to pay other bills. Let me repeat that: The debt increase in 2008 \nwill not be the $407 billion advertised deficit. The increase in the \ndebt will be $647 billion. For next year, the deficit is estimated to \ngo up $438 billion. The debt will go up by more than $800 billion. And \nall that is before we include those bailouts. We could easily see the \ndebt of the country go up a trillion dollars next year. The debt, as we \nsit here today, is $9.6 trillion. That is the gross debt of the United \nStates.\n  This President has been building a wall of debt: $5.8 trillion at the \nend of his first year; now they want to increase the debt ceiling to \nover $11 trillion. This chart shows $10.4 trillion in 2009. That has \nnow been erased because what they are proposing to do is increase the \ndebt ceiling to over $11 trillion, nearly a doubling of the debt in \nthat short period of time.\n\n  Here is what the New York Times headline from this weekend said: \n``Administration Is Seeking $700 billion for Wall St.; Bailout Could \nSet Record.'' That could mean hundreds of billions of dollars of debt \nadded to the wall of debt we already face. That is an unsustainable \ncircumstance. It is a key reason why the dollar went down 2 percent in \nvalue in one day.\n  One of the great risks that is being run by this fiscal policy is the \nrisk of a sharp downward break in the value of the dollar. If that were \nto occur, we would be faced with a series of unpleasant alternatives. \nOne would be a sharp cut in spending by the United States. A second \npossibility would be a dramatic increase in taxes. A third would be a \nsubstantial increase in interest rates to attract additional capital to \nfloat this boat.\n  I hope people are listening. I know this is hard to fully comprehend \nbecause economic issues are complex. But they are related. They are \ntied together. The fact that we have dramatically increased the debt \nand deficit has an impact on the value of our dollar. When we flood the \nworld with dollars, the value of those dollars goes down. When those \ndollars go down in value, that puts us in a position of having to find \nsome way to attract additional dollars. One way open to us is to \nincrease the rent we pay for those dollars we call interest. If we had \nto dramatically increase the interest rate to attract dollars to be \nable to float this enterprise, that would have an adverse effect on \neconomic growth and economic activity.\n  So all of these things are connected. They are related, and they \nmatter. We are already seeing the dollar fall further in response to \nthe prospect of billions of dollars of additional debt being piled on.\n  The Washington Post article I showed earlier said ``Currency's Dive \nPoints to Further Pain.'' ``Currency's Dive Points to Further Pain''--\nagain, a 2-percent reduction in the value of our currency in a single \nday. This is after the dollar has already lost about 40 percent of its \nvalue against the euro since 2002.\n  I am not the only one who believes we have to start paying for \nthings. Earlier this month, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nreiterated his opposition to deficit-financed tax cuts. This is what \nAlan Greenspan said on Bloomberg Television:\n\n       [U]nless [tax cuts are] paid for on the so-called pay-go, \n     I'm not in favor of it. I'm not in favor of financing tax \n     cuts with borrowed money.\n\n  To my colleagues who say: Well, it is the people's money so let's \ngive it back to them in a tax cut, what people are we talking about \nhere? It is the people's money, so we give it back to them. The problem \nis, the people's Government does not have any money. The people's \nGovernment is out of money. It is borrowing money, and increasingly it \nis borrowing from foreign entities. So when people say: We ought to \ngive the people's money back to them, it is a little late. We already \ndid that. We did that, and much more. We went and borrowed money to \ngive it to them.\n  Now, who is going to get stuck with the tab? It is going to be the \nAmerican taxpayer. Because you can only continue to stack up debt for \nso long. At some point the chickens come home to roost. That is why I \nsupport a fully paid-for alternative minimum tax relief amendment. This \nalternative minimum tax relief provides tax relief in the first year \ncosting $76 billion, but it is paid for over the next 10 years.\n  I remind my colleagues that pay-go does not require that these bills \nbe paid for immediately. It requires the legislation be paid for over 6 \nand 11 years. Given the economic downturn and turmoil we now confront, \nI would not call for paying for AMT relief right now. But we can \nprovide offsets over time to cover the cost. That would be the \nresponsible thing to do, and it would send\n\n[[Page S9241]]\n\na signal to the financial markets that we are serious about putting our \nfiscal house back in order.\n  Some have argued we should not be raising taxes to pay for \nalternative minimum tax relief. We are not talking about raising taxes. \nWe are talking about closing tax loopholes and making hedge fund \nmanagers and oil companies pay their fair share.\n  Here is a list of the offsets or the pay-fors included in my \namendment.\n  One, ending deferral of offshore compensation by hedge fund managers \ntrying to evade current taxation. Two, delaying implementation of a new \nworldwide interest allocation provision designed to benefit some \nmultinational corporations. Three, correcting underpayment of royalties \nfor oil and gas production on federal land in the Outer Continental \nShelf. Four, codifying economic substance--prohibiting transactions \nwith no economic rationale, done solely to evade taxes.\n  Does anyone oppose closing these loopholes? Does anyone oppose these \noffsets, these means of paying for what is needed? Because certainly \nalternative minimum tax relief is needed. Otherwise, 26 million people \nare going to get hit by the alternative minimum tax.\n  It is important to recognize these annual alternative minimum tax \nfixes, as costly as they are, conceal the much longer and larger long-\nterm cost of fixing this problem. The cost to reform the alternative \nminimum tax over the next 10 years is a staggering $1.6 trillion. Let \nme repeat that. To fix the alternative minimum tax over the next 10 \nyears would cost $1.6 trillion.\n  So if we continue to pass alternative minimum tax patches that are \nnot offset, that is the real amount, as shown on this chart, we are \ngoing to be adding to the Nation's debt. Over the summer, I asked the \nCongressional Budget Office to examine the impact on our budget and \neconomy from continuing to pass these unoffset tax cuts. CBO found that \nthe debt absolutely explodes if we continue with unoffset alternative \nminimum tax reform and unoffset extension of the President's tax cuts--\nrising to 602 percent of the gross domestic product by 2082.\n  Let me repeat that. This is what the Congressional Budget Office has \ntold us will happen if we continue on this course. As shown on this \nchart, this is the debt if we proceed with the current policies. That \nis the green line. Now, this is the debt that will accrue if we \ncontinue to pass alternative minimum tax reform unpaid for. That is the \nblack line. Finally, the red line is what happens to the debt with \nunoffset alternative minimum tax reform and extension of the Bush tax \ncuts. In that case, the result is the debt of the country goes to 600 \npercent of gross domestic product. That is five times the record \namount. That is five times the record amount of debt to gross domestic \nproduct in our Nation's history.\n  What is the implication of such an explosion of debt? What would it \nmean? I asked the Congressional Budget Office to tell me what would \nhappen if we fail to pay for alternative minimum tax reform and the \nBush tax cuts. What would happen to economic growth? Here is what they \nconcluded. As shown on this chart, the black line is the economic loss \nfrom not paying for alternative minimum tax reform. You can see, it is \nvery dramatic, the drop in GNP per person. Here is what happens to \neconomic loss from not offsetting the alternative minimum tax reform \nand the extension of the Bush tax cuts. CBO projects that, over time, \nit would reduce American living standards by 50 percent.\n  It is because the debt operates as a gigantic drag on the economic \ngrowth of the country. How is that possible? Well, very simply, as I \ndescribed earlier, if you keep adding to the debt, you have to finance \nit. How do you finance it? You borrow it. Increasingly, we borrow from \nabroad. That undermines the value of the dollar. That puts upward \npressure on interest rates. Rising interest rates stifle economic \ngrowth. Again, that is not just my view. Here is what the Congressional \nBudget Office said in a letter to me on July 17 of this year concerning \ntheir estimates:\n\n       Despite the substantial economic costs generated by \n     deficits in that model, such estimates may significantly \n     understate the potential loss to economic growth from \n     financing the tax changes with deficits . . . In reality, the \n     economic effects of rapidly growing debt would probably be \n     much more disorderly and could occur well before the time \n     frame indicated in the scenario.\n\n  Is anyone listening to what our own advisers are telling us? Deficit \nfinancing of tax cuts hurts long-term economic growth, and the reaction \ncould be disorderly changes in the markets well before the models \nsuggest. I believe that, in part, that is what we are seeing today: a \nsharp drop in equity values, a sharp drop in the value of the dollar, \nand all the while we see a massive increase in our deficits and debt.\n  As shown on this chart, this is the long-term budget scenario of the \nCongressional Budget Office. This is where we are to this point. This \nis where we are headed without fundamental changes. If we keep patching \nthe alternative minimum tax without paying for it, if we extend the \nBush tax cuts without paying for them, there is going to be, according \nto those who advise us, a sharp reduction in economic growth, a sharp \nreduction in the economic strength of our country.\n  We have to start somewhere. I propose we start today by paying for \nthe alternative minimum tax relief that is needed. We could do it \ntoday. We could open a new chapter. We could get serious about the \nlong-term economic prospects of our country. The alternative is to stay \non the current course, keep running up the debt, keep running the risk \nof a sharp break in the value of the dollar, keep running the risk of a \nsharp break in the economic strength of our country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5633\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from North \nDakota. He is diligent. He means well. And I care for him a great deal. \nHe has an impossible job, in my opinion. One reason he does is because \none side thinks the only way to solve our problems is to increase \ntaxes. Our side believes the only way to solve our problems is to \nreduce spending. We all know the only way you can do that and be \nsignificant is to take on some of the entitlement problems that exist, \nand that causes even more of an explosion. But I respect him very much \nfor the fight he wages all the time.\n  I rise today to express my support for the Baucus-Grassley substitute \nand perfecting amendments to the tax extenders bill before us today. \nThese amendments may sound a bit confusing, so I will try to clarify \nbriefly what they do.\n  The Baucus-Grassley substitute amendment is a bipartisan compromise \non the soon-to-be expired tax provisions dealing with energy \nproduction, alternatives, and conservation. This important group of tax \nincentives enjoys a great deal of support from Members on both sides.\n  Unfortunately, the passage of these energy extender provisions has \nbeen held up over discussions about energy policy in general, and more \nparticularly, over the question of whether and how to offset the lost \nrevenue.\n  The Baucus-Grassley perfecting amendment is also a bipartisan \ncompromise, but this amendment features the retroactive extension of \nimportant tax provisions that expired at the end of last year, as well \nas extending the so-called alternative minimum tax patch for 2008, and \na package of disaster relief tax provisions.\n  This long-delayed group of provisions also enjoys broad support among \nSenators, but it too has been held up by the question of how or if to \npay for the lost revenue.\n  I want to first congratulate those of my colleagues whose hard work \nand flexibility have made these compromises possible. Getting to this \npoint where we can hopefully pass this tax extenders bill today is a \nbig achievement, and one that should not be overshadowed by the \nnecessities of dealing with other urgent legislative business this \nweek.\n  The chairman and the ranking Republican of the Finance Committee, \nSenators Baucus and Grassley, along with the majority leader and the \nrepublican leader, deserve all of our thanks for guiding us to this \ncompromise.\n  As with all compromises, this one is completely satisfactory to no \none. My position all year long on the offset question, along with that \nof most of my Republican colleagues, can be summed up in two sentences. \nFirst, it\n\n[[Page S9242]]\n\nis wrong to raise taxes on one group of Americans in order to prevent \nanother group of Americans from suffering a tax increase. Second, it is \nwrong to raise taxes on a permanent basis in order to pay for the \ntemporary extension of expired or expiring tax provisions.\n  The other side has put forward the position that, in the name of \nfiscal responsibility, we should not allow the budget deficit to grow \nhigher as a result of extending current law tax provisions. I respect \nthis position, and as someone who has long been concerned with this \nNation's fiscal health, I also do not want to see the deficit climb.\n  However, the rate of Federal spending for the past several years has \ngrown alarmingly high. According to the CBO's latest baseline budget \nprojection, the deficit is estimated to explode from last year's $161 \nbillion to $431 billion by 2010. So, yes, it is obvious that we have a \ndeficit problem. However, over this same 3-year period, annual Federal \nrevenues are projected to increase by $313 billion from fiscal year \n2007 levels. This is an increase of more than 12 percent.\n  Over that same period, however, the amount of annual Federal spending \nis projected to climb by $583 billion. This is an increase of more than \n21 percent. Therefore, it seems obvious that we do not have a problem \nwith revenues. We have a problem with spending growing much faster than \nrevenues are growing.\n  It seems to me that the answer to the offset question is not to raise \ntaxes but to cut spending growth. And yet after months of impasse, we \nmade no progress in getting the other side to line up for spending \nrestraint instead of tax increases.\n  However, the leadership on both sides, along with the two leaders of \nthe Finance Committee, have found a way to move us forward in a manner \nacceptable to both sides.\n  The energy extenders amendment is fully offset, as has been insisted \nupon by the Democrats. However, it is true that much of this amendment \nis comprised of expansions of current policy and not strictly \nextensions of current law. Therefore, some offsets are acceptable. I \nwish they were offsets in the form of spending cuts, but my voice is in \nthe minority on this desire.\n  Moreover, the tax increases in the energy amendment have been \nmoderated from earlier versions. Instead of a full repeal of the \ndeduction for the domestic production of oil and gas, the amendment \nfreezes the current deduction at 6 percent. And, instead of an \nobnoxious and unprecedented new Federal severance tax on oil drilled in \nthe Gulf of Mexico, the amendment includes a small set of offsets that \nare relatively acceptable in light of the positive provisions included \nin the package.\n  In the AMT and extenders amendment, the other side has conceded that \nit need not be fully offset. This amendment does include a large tax \noffset dealing with offshore deferred compensation. I am not fully \nconvinced that current law is in need of reform in this area. However, \nagain the benefit to our economy and to taxpayers of having the expired \nprovisions extended on a retroactive basis justifies this compromise.\n  We are obviously in a time of great economic peril. While the size of \nthis combined tax extenders package might pale in comparison with the \nlarger number of dollars involved with legislation we are considering \nthis week to ensure the liquidity of our financial markets, we should \nnot underestimate the importance of these tax provisions to our \neconomy.\n  We must not subject another 23 million American families to the \ncruelties of the alternative minimum tax. What a nasty and unfair \nsurprise to these unsuspecting households we would be leaving at their \ndoorsteps absent this bill. Because the AMT patch will save these \ntaxpayers almost $62 billion, in just one year, not passing the AMT \npatch would go a long way toward reversing the benefits of this year's \neconomic stimulus tax rebates.\n  Let me mention two other vital provisions that are extended in this \npackage, among many important ones.\n  First is the provision to extend the exemption of active financing. I \nknow this sounds confusing, but it is critically important to keeping \nAmerica's financial services firms competitive with their overseas \ncounterparts.\n  The Internal Revenue Code imposes worldwide taxation on its citizens \nand domestic corporations. Many of our trading partner nations do not \nimpose this kind of taxation on their home-based companies. Without the \nexemption for active financing income, which expires at the end of this \nyear, our firms will have a significant disadvantage in competing with \ncompanies based in these other nations.\n  The second, and I believe, the most important, is the research \ncredit, which expired at the end of last year. Research and development \nis the lifeblood of American innovation. This is an area where our \nNation has clearly held the lead for decades.\n  However, we are at serious risk of losing this edge to other \ncountries. No longer is the U.S. the only place to find talented \nscientists and other researchers. No longer does the U.S. have the only \nworld class research facilities. And certainly, no longer do we have \nthe only tax incentives for research in the world. Many other \ncountries, each of which would love to take our lead away, are vying \nfor this research.\n  We simply cannot afford to allow this credit to lose its incentive \nvalue and thus allow research to escape our shores. I fear it is \nalready happening, but passing this bill is the first step in fighting \nto keep this indispensable segment.\n  This is obviously a historic week in a monumental year. Hugely \nimportant questions with tremendous ramifications lie before the \nCongress and before the American people and must be decided in the next \nfew days and weeks.\n  The issue at hand today might be overshadowed by other matters, but \nis nevertheless a vital one. We must pass this tax extenders and energy \nincentives bill, and I hope the House can get it done this week as \nwell. Let us put this part of our financial house in order today.\n  Then, I hope and pray we as a Congress can make the right decisions \nin solving our financial and liquidity crisis, and that the people of \nAmerica choose wisely in the elections that are just a few weeks away.\n  As a Nation and as a Congress, we have a lot of work ahead of us to \nbolster the confidence of the people. We need health care reform and we \nneed a tax system that helps us compete in the world, instead of \nleaving us at a disadvantage.\n  I personally compliment the distinguished Senator from Montana and \nthe distinguished Senator from Iowa, Senators Baucus and Grassley, for \nthe work they have done, and, of course, others who have participated \nin this. Let's build on this work as we move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes from the time in \nopposition to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the series of votes \nwe are going to be having on the extenders package and to thank my \nChairman, Senator Baucus, for his leadership on this legislation \nbecause this is important legislation my colleagues are going to be \nvoting on in a short period of time.\n  Senator Baucus has been diligent in working with Senator Grassley on \nvarious provisions that I believe are good for Washington State and for \nthe country--specifically, the R tax credit and the continuation of \nthat credit for 2 years. I thank Senator Baucus and Senator Hatch, who \nworked out a more robust tax credit for the future. We also are \nextending the college expense deduction; a continuation of that at \n$4,000. Many parents are struggling with many financial obligations, \nand college education costs that are continuing to rise. This \nlegislation makes sure they can deduct some of these expenses and helps \nout those taxpayers.\n  For us in Washington State, it also is critically important we be \nable to continue to deduct sales tax from our Federal income tax \nobligations. It was about 22 years ago that Congress took away this \nopportunity for Washingtonians to be treated fairly, just like other \nStates in the Union, to be able to deduct sales tax. We recently \nreestablished this policy, and this bill continues it for another 2 \nyears, so that we\n\n[[Page S9243]]\n\nare able to deduct what obligations we pay to the State of Washington \nfrom our Federal income tax obligation. This is stimulus to us in \nWashington State, and it is about tax fairness. We are glad that, for 2 \nmore years, Washington residents will be able to either take a standard \ndeduction or itemize their deductions and claim these taxes against \ntheir Federal tax obligation.\n  I remind my colleagues, too, about the importance of the energy \nprovisions we are about to vote on. We are making a significant change \nin energy policy by promoting clean energy solutions for our country. \nIn fact, were we to look at the 2005 bill we passed, which had many \nsimilar tax provisions in it related to energy production, it was \nprobably two-thirds tilted toward fossil fuel and one-third for green \nenergy. This bill turns that equation on its head; it is two-thirds for \ngreen energy solutions and one-third for fossil fuel. That heads us in \nthe right direction as a Congress and as a country, it is where we \nshould put our priorities.\n  This legislation unleashes the ability for us to focus on solar power \nin America. It unleashes the ability of solar power by giving it an 8-\nyear tax credit horizon, the same we are giving to fuel cell \ntechnology. Concentrating solar power technology is a new endeavor that \nholds great promise for us in America and particularly in the \nSouthwest. We think that over 400,000 jobs could be created in the next \n8 years thanks to this technology, and those are jobs right here in the \nUnited States. That gives the United States the ability to produce \nenough power for probably over 7 million American households. It is \nalso a $232 billion investment that we expect to see into our economy \ncoming from these investment in solar energy. We are truly unleashing \nthat power and producing what will be emission-free fuel for our homes \nand businesses.\n  For plug-in electric cars, this bill provides up to a $7,500 tax \ncredit so an American citizen will be able to get a plug-in car and use \nthat to drive down their cost of transportation. If you think about it, \ninstead of spending $4 a gallon for gasoline, with a plug-in vehicle, \nyour cost per gallon would probably be only about a dollar. That would \nbe significant savings for the American consumer.\n  Third, we are including, for the first time in the Tax Code, faster \ndepreciation for what are called smart meters. This technology is going \nto help us as consumers understand the power we are using and how we \ncan manage that usage to reduce our energy costs. Tom Friedman has done \na good job of evangelizing this. He believes this is where IT meets \nET--where Internet technology meets energy technology. The fact is that \nwe can build a smart electricity grid that understands what consumers \nare using and empowers those consumers to help drive down their costs. \nOnce we get these meters installed throughout the country we will begin \nto realize energy savings just by moving power more efficiently around \nthe electricity grids. We can save 10 percent on what power we are \nusing today by just consuming it in a more efficient fashion.\n  This provision will help with the deployment of smart meters and \nsmart grid technology that will help us move forward.\n  When we think about this platform of distributed generation, smart \ngrid technology, the advent of efficiencies, we can see how we can \nbuild a national smart grid that will help us immensely because we know \nwe are going to have an increase in demand, we know we want to reduce \ncarbon emissions, we know there are intermittent sources of power such \nas we are talking about with wind and solar that we can work in \ncooperation with our other power sources, and we know that substituting \nelectricity for oil can make a major transition for us in getting off \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n  All of these are improvements to that electricity grid. It is like \ntaking our current two-lane dirt road highway and turning it into a \nsuperhighway of a smart electricity grid that can empower us in making \nthis transition.\n  I am very happy that the accelerated depreciation provision made it \ninto the legislation. I thank Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley for \nmaking that part of the tax incentives we are going to pass here today.\n  Lastly, there are over $10,000 in tax breaks to American consumers to \ntry to help them lower their energy costs into the future. I know from \nthe Presiding Officer that in the Northeast part of our country, a lot \nof people have suffered under the high cost of home heating fuel. This \nlegislation helps them with tax breaks on wood-burning stoves so they \ncan install the latest technology to turn wood pellets into a better, \nmore efficient source of fuel and help drive down the demand on home \nheating oil. Hopefully this can help reduce the cost to many of the \nNortheast residents who are still using oil as their primary heating \nsource.\n  The $10,000 in tax breaks, as I said, for items such as plug-in \nautomobiles, wood stoves, solar panels on the homes, small wind farms, \nand a variety of things are going to help the American consumer reduce \nthe burden they are now facing from higher energy costs.\n  We are taking this direction and moving closer to what we think the \nUnited States can be--a world leader in green technology. We are \ncreating the platform and putting in place the right incentives in this \nlegislation that will move our country away from its dependence on \nfossil fuel and on to the clean energy technologies that will make the \nUnited States a world energy leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5635 to Amendment No. 5633\n\n(Purpose: To amend the internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend certain \n              expiring provisions, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily set aside and I be allowed to call up my \namendment No. 5635.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 5635 \n     to amendment No. 5633.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes of the time in favor of \nthe third amendment to the senior Senator from New Mexico, a lead \nsponsor of the mental health parity provisions in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my thanks to the chairman.\n  First, I wish to thank a number of individuals and institutions.\n  First and foremost, I thank Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy is my \nlong-time partner and friend in our work on parity and other mental \nhealth issues. Obviously, he cannot be here today, but he is fully \naware of what we are doing. I know he is very pleased with what we are \ndoing and thrilled that we have found the offset for our bill, the bill \nthat has been accepted by the House.\n  The question is whether our bill with the offset or our bill with a \ndifferent offset becomes law. There should be no doubt that we will now \nget parity of treatment for a large number of Americans suffering from \nmental illness.\n  My further thanks go to Senator Enzi. I could not have asked for a \nbetter colleague to help work on this issue of mental health parity.\n  Senator Dodd, my long-time friend, has done an admirable job standing \nin for Senator Kennedy, not to mention his own work on mental health \nissues.\n  Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley: Simply put, we could not be \nhere without you.\n  Leaders Reid and McConnell: I cannot say enough about the fantastic \nassistance the leaders have provided and they should certainly share \nwith us the optimism that comes from this bill.\n  Members of the House of Representatives Kennedy and Ramstad, the \nchairmen and members of the committees of jurisdiction and the \nleadership in the House; our superb coalition outside the Senate and \nHouse. Mental health groups, insurance companies, and business \norganizations banded together and stayed together to ensure a broadly \nsupported bill.\n\n[[Page S9244]]\n\n  It might shock some, but I read the long list of those who banded \ntogether. And yes, you will see that this bill is supported by \nbusinesses--by big businesses--by those who pay for the large numbers \nof people who are covered by insurance and who are going to be \nguaranteeing parity of treatment under this bill. Finally, my dear \nfriend Paul Wellstone. He was always the one who pushed and prodded me \nto move quicker and faster. I know he is watching us today and is \nextremely proud of what we have accomplished.\n  Let me take a couple of minutes to talk about the historic mental \nhealth parity compromise before the Senate.\n  Twelve years have passed since the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 \nbecame law. The compromise is the product of 3-plus years of continuous \nwork and thousands of hours of labor. Rather than say just thousands, I \nwill say a thousand hours at a minimum. For those 3-plus years I would \nwalk into my office from time to time and I would see my conference \nroom occupied by 30 or 40 people. Whenever that conference room was \nfull, I knew that the member of my staff who handles mental health \nparity, Edward Hild, who is sitting at my right hand today, was among \nthem. He was working with them to see what they could agree on and to \nsee which problems could be solved. Joined with him was Senator \nKennedy's aide, Connie Garner. I thank the two of them especially. \nWithout them we could not have completed this bill. They worked and \nworked in order to get all sides to agree. And now we have what many \nhave waited for a long time. My thanks to Ed Hild, and Connie Garner, \nwho works for Senator Kennedy.\n  What does this bill do? It provides mental health parity for about \n113 million Americans who work for employers with 50 employees or more. \nIt ensures that 98 percent of the businesses that provide a mental \nhealth benefit do so in a manner that is no more restrictive than the \ncoverage of medical and surgical benefits.\n\n  It ensures that health plans do not place more restrictive conditions \non mental health coverage than on medical and surgical coverage; parity \nfor financial requirements, such as deductibles, copayments, and annual \nand lifetime limits; parity for treatment limitations, and the number \nof covered hospital days and visits.\n  It provides an out-of-network parity for mental health coverage if a \nplan provides out-of-network coverage for medical and surgical \nbenefits.\n  It provides a small employer exemption for companies with fewer than \n50 employers and provides a cost exemption to all covered employers.\n  Simply put, our legislation will ensure that individuals with a \nmental illness have parity between mental health coverage and medical \nand surgical coverage. No longer will people with mental illness have \ntheir mental health coverage treated differently than their coverage \nfor other illnesses. That means there will be parity between the \ncoverage of mental illness and other medical conditions such as cancer, \nheart disease, and diabetes.\n  No longer will people be treated differently only because they suffer \nfrom a mental illness. And that means 113 million people in group \nhealth policy plans will benefit from our bill.\n  We have worked with the mental health community and business and \ninsurance groups to carefully craft a compromise that all members of \nthe coalition support.\n  I wish to take a minute to talk about what we are doing and what we \nare not doing. I have done that in all of my remarks, talking about \nwhat we are doing and what we are not doing.\n  Mr. President, I say to everyone here, I do believe that if Senator \nKennedy had his way, he would be standing over there where his chair is \nand he would be speaking as long as I speak or maybe longer. He and I \nwould be discussing how difficult it has been to get this very basic \nAmerican insurance coverage for the mentally ill.\n  Parity means fairness. We have been unfair to the mentally ill since \nwe started medical insurance coverage for people with illnesses. \nSomehow we got off the track. We said, of course, we will treat \neverything that has to do with the heart, but, for instance, we won't \ndo anything having to do with illnesses that affect the brain. Perhaps, \nit was because we didn't know that illnesses such as schizophrenia were \ndiseases of the brain. We started talking about them as if they were \nsomething else. So we began saying they don't get the kind of coverage \nthat people with heart problems do, or people with cancer do, or people \nwith tuberculosis do.\n  What we have had is millions of Americans, since health insurance was \nfirst started, to this date, millions of Americans have been born and \ndied with mental illnesses. Illnesses never covered by health \ninsurance. However, over time the unfairness has been whittled away, \nand we have become more and more fair.\n  Today this bill says all of the group insurance policies in the \nUnited States of America, no matter who wrote them, no matter where \nthey were written, no matter which company they were written by or for, \nwill have to provide for the mentally ill who are covered. If they are \ngoing to have any mental health coverage, those insurance companies \nmust cover them with the exact same coverage they give to others who \nsuffer from other diseases as I have described in the last 6 or 7 \nminutes.\n  This is a red-letter day for fairness, a red-letter day for doing \nsomething very positive. This was a tough one, and it should have been \neasy. But it was tough. It took many years to get it through here. In \nfact, the last effort we had, believe it or not, we had a Senator who \nwas so concerned about his work that he said he wanted one more \nweekend. To which I said: What can you do in one more weekend? And his \nresponse--and he was sincere--he said: I want to finish reading the \nbill. Nobody tells us that, but he did. He finished reading the bill. I \nthank him. I said: You must be a genius to understand what we wrote. I \ncompliment you. That was one of our last hurdles. That was months ago \nin the Senate. Then it got to the House, this final bill, this bill \nbefore us today.\n  We had a parity bill a number of years ago which was quasi almost \nparity. That got through here a little easier, although even that bill \nwas resisted in the House. Many of us have warmed to the idea finally \nthat the mentally ill of our country are truly people who are sick, and \nif they are treated by doctors or in hospitals for that ailment--be it \nschizophrenia, be it bipolar, be it depression, any of those doctors \nhave to treat--those patients ought to be covered by general health \ninsurance.\n  I am so pleased we are finally doing this bill. I am so unhappy that \nmy friend Senator Kennedy cannot be here today. He and I spent many \nhours talking about this legislation, changing it, moving it around. I \nknow he would have loved to have been here. So I say on behalf of \nSenator Kennedy that he and I thank the Senate for this bill. It will \nbe adopted shortly.\n  My 10 minutes is up. This is on a bill which is destined to pass. We \nwere glad to put it on the bill. Maybe we helped the bill; maybe the \nbill helped us. In any event, we are trying to do everything that \nanybody asks of us. We even had the Congressional Budget Office say \nthis bill costs the Government money, and that was a hard thing to eat \nand buy, but we did buy it. It took us a long time because we had to \nhave an offset. We did get one.\n  For those people interested in the bill, I have said everything about \nthe bill and the people with mental illness across our land. I have \nseen these people by the thousands--the mothers and fathers and \nrelatives of the mentally ill. They are my friends across the land. \nToday, we have added other things and we are getting close to covering \nthe mentally ill, as we should--as a concerned, considerate country \nshould do.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes on the third amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I particularly wish to thank my friend from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Conrad, for his courtesy because I know his \nremarks\n\n[[Page S9245]]\n\nare extremely important, given these tough fiscal times.\n  I will be speaking on the third amendment and particularly the part \nof that third amendment that addresses the extraordinary economic hurt \nin much of rural America. Senator Baucus and the ranking minority \nmember, Senator Grassley, have worked very closely with me and a number \nof Members of the Senate who represent rural communities where the \nFederal Government owns much of the land, and tonight it looks like \nthere is some promising news ahead for these desperately hard-hit rural \ncommunities.\n  More than 100 years ago, our rural communities entered into an \nagreement with the Federal Government. What these rural communities \nsaid was that, in effect, they would give up their land so there could \nbe a national forest system, and in return the Federal Government would \nensure that these rural communities would have sufficient funds for \nschools and basic services.\n  This was facilitated by tying these payments to the rural communities \nto the amount of timber that was cut in these areas.\n  Now, this went quite well for many years. But as the environmental \nlaws in our country began to change, this money shriveled up. It \nshriveled up and we were faced, in rural communities, with the prospect \nof having school 3 days a week. In my part of the country, our law \nenforcement officials were faced with not having the funds that they \ndesperately needed to fight this epidemic of methamphetamines. Suffice \nit to say there was a real question--and there continues to be--as to \nwhether some of these communities and some of these rural counties \nwould actually survive. We have three in our State that are walking on \nan economic tightrope right now.\n  So what Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley have done, working with \na host of us from these communities--myself, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Cantwell, Senators Murray, Smith, Boxer, Crapo, \nCraig, and other colleagues on both sides of the aisle--is they have \ngiven us the opportunity, if this third part of the extenders package \npasses tonight, to give new hope to these rural areas. The hope comes \nin the form of a multiyear reauthorization of the law that I wrote in \n2000 with Senator Craig to the Secure Rural Schools legislation.\n  It provides a safety net for these communities in our part of the \ncountry so they can educate their kids, fight drugs and crime, and pay \nfor essential services. Right now, pink slips have been sent out in my \nState and elsewhere to county workers, teachers, and others. Without \nthe legislation that has been put together so carefully by Chairman \nBaucus and Senator Grassley, my view is we will see devastating losses \nto the very fabric of rural communities. Some of those rural \ncommunities will not survive. Today's vote--the vote we are going to \nhave this afternoon--provides the best opportunity we have seen in many \nmonths to ensure that rural communities do not drown in this economic \ncrisis.\n  The reason this proposal is so very important is that it is a \nmultiyear reauthorization of the law that Senator Craig and I wrote in \n2000. The reason we feel so strongly about a multiyear reauthorization \nis it will give our rural communities an opportunity to plan for new \neconomic development efforts where they can create good-paying jobs for \ntheir people.\n  I know for a fact, given the huge problems we have had with fires in \nthe West, that it will be possible to put together a strong thinning \nprogram, where we can thin out, for example, the overstocked second \ngrowth stands and get those merchantable materials--they are \nmerchantable materials--to the mills and put our people to work.\n  We are going to be able to take other steps. We want to have new \nclean energy programs, using biomass, something where the Senate has \nbrought together the forest product sector, the environmentalists, \nscientists, and others. We are looking at new opportunities in carbon \nsequestration. But to have the time for our rural communities to get \ninto the thinning, to get into biomass, to get into carbon \nsequestration, we desperately need this 4-year reauthorization program \nto take these rural communities off the economic roller coaster they \nhave been on since the time in which these funds ran out.\n  We have had wave after wave of bad economic news in rural America. We \nare now in a position to vote for a measure that will give new \nopportunity to these rural communities and particularly the opportunity \nover the next few years to survive and to look at additional business \nventures that are tailor-made for the times. They are going to be \ngreener, they are going to be sustainable, but they are going to create \nfamily wage employment.\n  In our part of the country, we recognize this is a different day than \nit was 100 years ago, when folks in the Northwest and other parts of \nrural America made this agreement with the Federal Government. Times \nhave changed, and they are certainly tough fiscal times, made tougher \nby the events of the last few weeks. But the people I have the honor to \nrepresent in the Senate are up to making these changes.\n  On this legislation that we will vote on shortly, I am very hopeful \nthat this time the other body will finally approve it; we have had 74 \nvotes in the Senate in favor of this package. What Chairman Baucus and \nSenator Grassley have added to the legislation virtually mirrors the \nvote that we had on the amendment I offered earlier in the Congress. \nChairman Conrad worked very closely with westerners to ensure that this \nwas fiscally responsible. Senator Grassley, the ranking Republican on \nour Finance Committee, on which Senator Conrad and I serve, worked \nclosely with us. This is truly bipartisan. It is a vote that would \nbring new hope to rural America, ensuring their survival and the chance \nfor better days ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the third part of the tax extenders \npackage.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota for the courtesy of speaking \nat this time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to address the extenders package \nand the alternative minimum tax amendment now under consideration.\n  Earlier this morning, we debated an amendment to provide several \ncritical energy tax provisions which was fully offset--it was fully \npaid for. They were important items, such as provisions that will \npromote renewable and alternative sources of energy. But now we are \ndebating another important amendment, the underlying provisions of \nwhich I also support, such as the extension of the research and \ndevelopment tax credit, and other important extender provisions that \nwill help middle-class families and promote economic growth, and \nanother 1-year fix for the alternative minimum tax to ensure that 26 \nmillion taxpayers are not thrown onto the alternative minimum tax in \n2008.\n  But as the chairman of the Budget Committee, I wish to be clear to my \ncolleagues that the provisions in this amendment are not paid for. The \nextender and other provisions are only partially paid for, and the \nalternative minimum tax relief is not paid for at all. That, I believe, \nis a serious mistake. I fully support these provisions, but they should \nbe paid for. I earlier offered an alternative minimum tax package that \nwas paid for--fully paid for--and paid for in a way that it should be.\n  This spring, I made a commitment to the Blue Dogs in the House that I \nwould raise a point of order against any unpaid alternative minimum tax \nbill in the Senate. The Blue Dogs are to be commended for fighting for \nfiscal discipline. I intend to keep my commitment to them and to raise \na pay-go point of order against this bill. I do it not just because I \nmade that commitment but because I believe it is the right policy as \nwell.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that pay-go does not require that \nthese bills be paid for immediately. Pay-go requires that the \nlegislation be paid for over 6 and 11 years. Given the economic \ndownturn and turmoil we now confront, I would not call for paying for \nthese tax reductions right now. But I also do not believe we can simply \nadd them to the national debt without any offset over any period of \ntime. That I believe is a mistake.\n  We can provide offsets to pay for these measures over the longer \nterm, and we should. That would be the responsible thing to do, and it \nwould send\n\n[[Page S9246]]\n\na signal to our financial markets that we are serious about putting our \nfiscal house back into order. So I will vote to uphold my point of \norder today, but I also recognize my point of order will fail and that \nthis legislation will pass and be sent to the House.\n  Now, why is there a need to have alternative minimum tax relief? \nWell, the simple answer is: Because if we don't, 26 million people will \nbe hit with additional taxes. In 2008, we would have 4.2 million \naffected if we passed the alternative minimum tax relief. With no AMT \nfix, 25.7 million would be affected. In other words, we would have 21 \nmillion more affected if we don't have a 1-year fix.\n  The 1-year cost of this alternative minimum tax and extender package \nis $104 billion. But these annual fixes, as costly as they are, conceal \nthe much larger long-term cost of fixing this problem. The cost to \nreform the alternative minimum tax over the next 10 years is $1.6 \ntrillion. Let me repeat that. The cost to fix the alternative minimum \ntax over the next 10 years is $1.6 trillion.\n  On the path we are following, we will absorb all that additional debt \nwithout a dime of it being paid for. I believe that is a profound \nmistake. Not only do I believe it, but the Congressional Budget Office \nconfirms it. Over the summer I asked the Congressional Budget Office to \nexamine the impact on our budget--and, more importantly, on our \neconomy--from continuing to pass these unpaid-for, unoffset tax \nreductions. The Congressional Budget Office found that the debt \nabsolutely explodes if we continue to pass the alternative minimum tax \nfixes without paying for them, without offsets. To go further, to pass \nan extension of the President's tax cuts without paying for them, \nwithout offsets, would increase the debt as a share of the gross \ndomestic product to 602 percent.\n  Is anybody fiscally responsible in this Chamber anymore? Does anybody \ncare about the effect on the debt, and more importantly, on the \neconomy? The Congressional Budget Office, let me repeat, made it very \nclear. Here is what is going to happen to the debt without fixes to the \nalternative minimum tax, without extending the President's tax cuts. \nYou can see the debt under any scenario is going to rise dramatically, \nbut, if we keep passing alternative minimum tax fixes without paying \nfor them, the debt will skyrocket. If we add to that an extension of \nthe President's tax cuts without it being paid for, the red line shows \nwhat happens to the debt. Under that scenario, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the debt will reach 602 percent of the \ngross domestic product in 2082.\n  After World War II, the debt as a share of GDP was about 125 percent. \nThe debt was about 125 percent of the gross domestic product. The \nCongressional Budget Office is telling us if we continue to pass these \nalternative minimum tax fixes without paying for them, and add in the \ncost of the President's tax cuts, the debt will reach over 600 percent \nof gross domestic product in 2082.\n  More importantly, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the \neffect on economic growth would also be dramatic and devastating. \nSpecifically, the Congressional Budget Office found that a failure to \npay for these policies, the alternative minimum tax fixes and extension \nof the President's tax cuts, will result in an economic loss of almost \n50 percent in the gross national product, per person, in roughly the \nnext 65 years. In other words, instead of growing the economy, the \nCongressional Budget Office is finding and telling us that the debt \ncreated by these unoffset tax cuts will act as a giant anchor on this \neconomy, dragging us down with debt and deficits, leading to higher \ninterest rates, leading to less economic growth, more unemployment, and \na weaker America.\n  In CBO's letter to me presenting the results of its analysis, the \nagency noted that the economic disruption caused by these deficits and \ndebt is likely to be far worse than their own models show. Here is what \nthey said:\n\n       Despite the substantial economic costs generated by \n     deficits in that model, such estimates may significantly \n     understate the potential loss to economic growth from \n     financing the tax changes with deficits . . . In reality, the \n     economic effects of rapidly growing debt would probably be \n     much more disorderly and could occur well before the time \n     frame indicated in the scenario.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I don't know when we are going to absorb \nthis cruel lesson, but deficits and debt do matter. It is not just \nnumbers on a page. This is the question of the economic performance of \nthis country. What the Congressional Budget Office is telling us is \nthat the explosion of deficits and debt hurt long-term economic growth \nand hurt it a lot--a reduction of 50 percent of the gross national \nproduct per person of this country.\n  I deeply believe one of the reasons we have the economic turmoil we \nhave now is because of the explosion of deficits and debt fueling a \ngigantic bubble. That bubble is bursting and the pain is spreading.\n  We have to make a judgment. We have to make a determination. When do \nwe start paying for things around here? When do we quit shuffling it \noff onto the debt? When do we stop threatening long-term economic \ngrowth and the economic strength of the country?\n  Today could be the day that we begin the march toward responsibility. \nFor that reason I will offer a budget point of order on this measure \nthat is unpaid for and urge my colleagues to support the previous \namendment I offered to fully pay for the alternative minimum tax fix \nthat otherwise will hit over 25 million Americans.\n  Mr. President, under the rules of the Senate I will offer the budget \npoint of order as we approach that vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5634\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak on the second or third \namendments we are going to be voting on. But before I do that, I think \nthe Senator from North Dakota has asked a very important question that \nI want to address: Is anyone around here concerned about the debt?\n  I want to remind everybody that it seems uncharacteristic to be able \nto speak about concern about the debt when it comes to the issue of tax \npolicy, and not reducing taxes but basically in this bill keeping taxes \nwhere they have been for years and in some instances for more than a \ndecade, but at the same time not think in terms of the debt when it \ncomes to spending policy.\n  I have heard the Senator from North Dakota speak about concern about \nthe debt when it comes to tax policy and the necessity to raise taxes \nto keep the existing tax policy in place. But at a time that we have \nincreases in spending, I do not hear people talking about offsetting \nincreases in expenditures.\n  I spoke this morning about pay-as-you-go somehow applying to taxes, \nbut when it comes to increased spending we do not see the same concern \nabout spending as it is with tax policy. That is an inconsistency that \nshows to me that the other party--at least the Senator from North \nDakota--is concerned about the debt when it comes to talking about \ntaxes, but when it comes to talking about spending I do not see that \nsame concern. Hence I see an inconsistency in the debate on the issue \nof pay-as-you-go.\n  On this issue in this tax bill we are not talking about reducing \ntaxes, we are talking about taxes that have sunset and periodically \nCongress deals with: Should we keep those same tax policies in place? \nFor the most part, this bill is nothing more than keeping existing tax \npolicy in place. As on the alternative minimum tax, it has been a \npolicy of this Congress for a long period of time, at least since 2001, \nthat we would not tax middle-income people because the alternative \nminimum tax was not indexed. This bill does that for the year 2008, so \n25 million middle-income families do not pay more. They were not \nintended to pay it with tax policy of that nature--keeping it right \nwhere it is.\n\n  It is one thing to say we ought to raise taxes on other Americans to \nkeep that tax policy where it has been, of not taxing the middle-income \nfolks with the alternative minimum tax. But the game around here and in \nthe amendment suggested by the Senator from North Dakota is to raise \ntaxes permanently but to reduce the alternative minimum tax--I should \nnot say reduce it, keep it so it doesn't hit 25\n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\nmillion Americans, where it has been, for 1 more year. So you have a \ntax increase forever to offset the tax policy that is for 1 year and \nsunsetting and have to deal with it next year. So next year we come \nback and if you follow his analogy, you raise taxes someplace else \nforever but probably deal with the alternative minimum tax for a short \nperiod of time of a year or probably at most 2 years.\n  We see it as a gimmick to raise taxes forever but not to take care of \nthe problems of middle-income taxpayers not being hit by the \nalternative minimum tax, but for 1 year--once in a while for 2 years \nbut in this bill for 1 year. So that is my response to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota. I hope people, as we have, do as we have done before. \nThis body last year decided that when we keep tax policy where it has \nbeen for a long period of time and we want to extend it for 1 more \nyear, we do not raise taxes on other Americans to continue doing what \nwe have done for a long period of time.\n  While Members of this body may disagree on a lot of issues, there are \nsome concepts that I think we should all be able to agree on. For \ninstance, I think we can all agree it is not fair to penalize one group \nof people for another group of people's mistakes; second, that two \nwrongs don't make a right. Despite the fact that all of us may agree on \nthese basic ideas, the amendment we have before us today suggests \notherwise. So the Conrad amendment attempts to violate these \nprinciples--first by punishing taxpayers for the repeated mistakes of \nCongress not indexing the alternative minimum tax and, second, by \nattempting to correct Congress's original mistakes with yet another \nmistake.\n  The original mistake I am referring to, of course, is the alternative \nminimum tax. We all know the story. The alternative minimum tax was \ncreated 40 years ago in response to the discovery that a few people, \n155 wealthy taxpayers, were able to eliminate their entire tax \nliability through legal means. The goal of the AMT was to guarantee \nthat extremely wealthy people were not able to game the system and \navoid paying some income tax. While this doesn't sound like a bad \nplan--on the surface, at least--the design and execution of this plan \ncould not have been worse. That is because it was not indexed. Today, \nnearly 40 years after this travesty of a law that was put into place, \nthe alternative minimum tax continues to fail on every level as a \npolicy instrument while plaguing more than 4 million American taxpayers \non a yearly basis. If we do not do something, 25 million more people \nwill be hit this very year.\n  Since 2001 the Finance Committee has produced annual legislation to \ndo what we call hold harmless the amount of families and individuals \nwho are subject to this AMT. The amendment before us, if agreed to, \nwould fully offset the alternative minimum tax fix for the year 2008. \nWhile I have said it on numerous occasions in the past, I want to say \nit again: The alternative minimum tax is a phony revenue source. It \nshould not be offset, since it collects revenue that was never meant to \nbe collected in the first place. In other words, it was meant to be \ncollected only from very wealthy people and not from middle-income \nAmericans. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting this \namendment.\n  Let's look at some of the reasons the 2008 AMT fix should not be \noffset. First, we need to go back to the original purpose of the \nalternative minimum tax. As I said earlier, 155 wealthy taxpayers were \nable to completely avoid Federal income taxes in 1969, and the AMT was \nput in place to make sure this practice did not continue.\n  So in 2008 has this problem been eliminated? Well, the answer is, \nabsolutely not. In 2004, IRS Commissioner Mark Everson informed the \nFinance Committee that the same number of taxpayers, as a percentage of \nthe tax-filing population at large, continued to pay no Federal income \ntax. In fact, the most recent IRS data available on high-income returns \nshow that this problem is getting worse. According to an IRS analysis \nof tax year 2004, 2,351 taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 or more who \ndo not use the medical or dental expense deduction had no income tax. \nIn 2005, the number rose to 6,640. In other words, 6,640 taxpayers with \nincomes of $200,000 or more paid no income tax in 2005, which is over \n42 times greater than the number--the 155--of wealthy taxpayers who \npaid no income tax in 1969. After nearly 40 years of failure and \nfutility by the alternative minimum tax, the problem of wealthy \ntaxpayers legally eliminating their entire tax liability is over 40 \ntimes worse than it was in 1969.\n  Clearly, the alternative minimum tax was and is a mistake. It is not \ndoing what it was proposed to do. If you keep it on the books, it is \ngoing to kill the middle-income taxpayer.\n  Despite widespread agreement that the alternative minimum tax is a \nmistake and that something needs to be done about it, agreement on what \nexactly to do is not so widespread. A major factor in the disagreement \nrelates to the massive amount of money the alternative minimum tax \nbrings into the Federal Government, which is the only thing the AMT \nactually does well. In 2006, AMT filers paid more than $21.8 billion \ninto the Federal Treasury, which is up from $17.2 billion in 2005 and \ngreater than the $12.8 billion in 2004.\n  If we do not extend the most recent AMT hold harmless, that number is \nprojected to balloon to a much greater amount, and long-term budget \nforecasts currently show this greater amount coming into the Treasury. \nWhen forecasters put their projections together, they are working under \nassumptions that the hold harmless that was extended last year will not \nbe extended again because they base their assumptions on what the law \nsays right now. Because of this, budget planners make the assumption \nthat revenues will be much higher than everyone who is frustrated with \nthe AMT thinks they ought to be because we have concluded that middle-\nincome people never have paid this tax, never should pay it, so \nconsequently the revenue is not going to come in. But the reason for \nthis is then the AMT balloons the revenue base as it is projected to \nincrease revenues as a percentage of GDP. There is a great deal of \nevidence to support this. Therefore, since these projections showing \nthe AMT ballooning revenues are used to put together budgets, the \ncentral problem in dealing with the AMT is money.\n  There are some people who say we can only address the AMT if \noffsetting revenue can be found to replace the money the AMT is \ncurrently forecast to collect. Anyone who says this sees the forecasts \nshowing revenues being pumped up as a percentage of GDP and wants to \nkeep them there.\n  This argument is especially ridiculous when one considers that the \nAMT was never meant to collect nearly so much revenue. Subscribers to \nthis argument want taxpayers to pay the price for a tax that was \ndesigned poorly and, through a comedy of errors, was allowed to \nflourish. It is simply unfair to expect taxpayers to pay a tax they \nwere never intended to pay.\n  Offsetting the AMT would be a clear case of attempting to correct a \npast congressional mistake by punishing innocent taxpayers both today \nand into the future. If we are going to solve this problem, we need to \nlook on the other side of the ledger; that is, the spending side. \nBudget planners need to take off their rose-colored glasses when \nlooking at long-term revenue projections and read the fine print. In \ngeneral, it is a good idea to spend money within your means, and that \nwisdom holds true in this case as well. If we start trying to spend \nrevenues we expect to collect in the future because of the AMT, we will \nbe living beyond our means. We need to stop assuming that record levels \nof revenue are available to be spent and recognize that the AMT is a \nphony revenue source.\n  As we continue to consider how to deal with the AMT, we must first \nremember that we do not have the option of not dealing with it. The \nproblems will only get worse every year and make the solution even more \ndifficult.\n  We must also be clear that offsetting the revenue that the AMT would \nfail to collect as a result of repeal or reform should not be a \ncondition of repeal or reform. We should not call it ``lost revenue'' \nbecause it is revenue that we never had to begin with. Making the \noffsetting of the AMT's ill-gotten gains a condition of an AMT fix is \nto punish the American taxpayer for ill-conceived and poorly executed \npolicy that has been a total failure.\n\n[[Page S9248]]\n\n  Aside from not increasing the proportion of wealthy taxpayers who pay \nincome tax, the AMT is projected to balloon Federal revenues over \nhistorical averages and to become a greater source of revenue than even \nthe regular income tax. Budget forecasters need to recognize that the \nAMT is not a legitimate source of revenue, and Congress needs to be \ndisciplined enough to show restraint on spending so that the AMT \nsolution does not boil down to the replacement of one misguided policy \nwith another. The amendment before us would certainly be such a \nmisguided policy, so I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment \nbecause two wrongs certainly do not make a right.\n  We are almost three quarters of the way through the year 2008, and \nsince January 1 of this year, several tax relief provisions have \nexpired. These are what we call the tax extenders. The biggest one I \nhave just referred to is the alternative minimum tax affecting 25 \nmillion Americans. There are a number of other widely applicable tax \nrelief provisions in the bill. One provides millions of families with \nthe deduction for college tuition, and another provides a deduction for \nteachers for out-of-pocket expenses. There is one that is very \nimportant to innovation in American business, which is a research and \ndevelopment tax credit.\n  All of these tax relief provisions expired over 8 months ago. So far, \nthe Senate has not passed these popular expiring and expired tax \nextender provisions. However, the Senate has now reached a bipartisan \nagreement that should enable us to pass this third amendment we will be \nvoting on shortly. The third amendment contains these popular \nindividual and business tax extender provisions as well as the \nalternative minimum tax fix, the incentive stock option AMT fix, \ndisaster tax relief, and other important provisions such as the secure \nrural schools and mental health parity provisions.\n  You might ask, now that the Senate is expected to pass these tax \nextenders and other tax relief in this third amendment, what could hold \nup these important, bipartisan, time-sensitive tax relief measures? \nThey are time sensitive. In short, the answer is, the philosophy in the \nother body by the Democratic leadership's version of pay-go.\n  I have worked with the Senate Democratic leadership, including my \nfriend Chairman Baucus, in putting together this bipartisan tax relief \npackage. However, it seems in the other body the leadership is saying \nthat instead of taking this amendment we will pass today, along with \nthe energy tax extenders we will pass today, they will instead insist \nthat more of this tax relief be offset with tax increases elsewhere.\n  I have spoken on this before, and the hangup the leadership in the \nother body has is that they obsess over raising taxes to offset \ncontinuing current tax relief policies. I offered a deficit-neutral \npath for these tax extenders, a restraint on new spending, but I got no \ntakers. The leadership of the other body has been so obsessed with \nraising taxes that they were willing to hold hostage popular, \nbipartisan tax relief measures. Now the House leadership is threatening \nto kill these tax extenders unless they get the tax increase they want \nso badly.\n  It reminds me of the nursery rhyme story. I am referring to the story \nof the big bad wolf. I have a chart here that depicts the big bad wolf. \nYou remember the story--the big bad wolf that threatened the three \nlittle pigs. He said: I am going to huff and puff and blow your house \ndown. The Democratic leadership is playing the role of the big bad wolf \nright now. There is some serious huffing and puffing from my friends in \nthe Democratic leadership in the other body.\n\n  For those millions of families sending their kids to college, forget \nabout your tax deduction unless Democrats get their offsetting tax \nincreases. They have ignored the spending cut proposals I circulated a \nfew months ago. So they are not holding tax extenders hostage to a \npledge to pay for them; they are holding tax extenders hostage to their \nversion of pay-go, which is guaranteed tax increases. More revenue \nmeans more spending and bigger Government.\n  What we have is huffing and puffing and a threat to blow the tax \nextenders house down by the big bad wolf. A partisan obsession with a \ntax-increase version of pay-go will not, at the end of the day, trump \nbipartisan, popular tax relief measures that millions of families are \ncounting on. The House should take up the bill we have passed today and \npass it through the House as well so we can send it to the President \nfor his signature. If the House does not do this, the House leadership \nwill have some explaining to do to millions of families and hundreds of \nthousands of businesses that will ask: What is more important--a \npartisan agenda or doing the taxpayers' business? Will House Democrats \ntell their constituents that having a big Government was more important \nto them than providing tax relief to their constituents suffering from \nnatural disasters, as one example? Will House Democrats tell their \nconstituents that partisan politics was more important to them than \nproviding tax incentives to lower the high gas prices they are paying \nand moving away from our dependance on foreign oil, as another example? \nI will wait for a response from the House leadership. More importantly, \nthe House Democrats' constituents should hear the answer.\n  I urge you to vote yes on this third amendment. I also urge our \nfriends in the House to pass this genuine compromise.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nPresident's Statement of Administration Policy dated September 23 in \nsupport of this compromise.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget, Washington, DC,\n                                               September 23, 2008.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\nSenate Amendments to H.R. 6049--Energy Improvement and Extension Act of \n 2008 and Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008\n\n       The Administration supports prompt passage of the above-\n     named Senate amendments to H.R. 6049. This legislation is \n     important to protect about 26 million Americans from an \n     unwelcome tax increase in the form of the Alternative Minimum \n     Tax. This legislation would also extend the tax credit for \n     research and experimentation (R) expenses, incentives for \n     charitable giving, subpart F active financing and look-\n     through exceptions, and the new markets tax credit. The \n     Administration supports these provisions and supports the \n     passage of this legislation, despite the inclusion of several \n     provisions that the Administration opposes.\n       The Administration supports tax incentives for renewable \n     energy and has proposed replacing the current complicated mix \n     of temporary incentives with a comprehensive unified approach \n     that is carbon-weighted, is technology-neutral, and provides \n     long-term certainty. The Administration believes this \n     approach would be preferable to the provisions included in \n     the Senate amendments.\n       It is the policy of this Administration that efforts to \n     avoid tax increases on the American people should not be \n     offset by provisions to increase revenue and treated as the \n     equivalent of additional government spending under budgetary \n     guidelines. Protecting taxpayers from the higher 2008 AMT \n     liability and extending current rules for business taxation \n     should not be impeded by the same procedural barriers as \n     provisions to increase Congressional spending. For this \n     reason, the Administration supports the provisions in the \n     Senate amendments that provide individual and business tax \n     relief without subjecting Americans to offsetting tax \n     increases.\n       The Administration remains strongly opposed to provisions \n     that would freeze the domestic manufacturing deduction for \n     one industry, change the tax treatment of foreign income for \n     American energy companies operating abroad, and eliminate the \n     cap on the oil spill liability trust fund, raising the price \n     of a barrel of oil. These provisions will increase the costs \n     of American oil production, will give further advantages to \n     foreign suppliers, and will likely result in higher prices at \n     the pump. At a time when consumers are already struggling \n     with the high price of gasoline and diesel fuel, Congress \n     should not put additional upward pressure on fuel prices. As \n     a matter of general principle, the Administration opposes \n     singling out particular industries, based on political \n     considerations, to be denied the full amount of broadly \n     available tax advantages. In addition, the Administration \n     strongly opposes the provision in the bill treating U.S. \n     citizens with deferred compensation from certain employers, \n     in all industries, more unfavorably than other U.S. citizens. \n     The Administration is also concerned about certain incentives \n     included in the bill, such as expensive and highly \n     inefficient tax credit bonds. The Administration urges \n     Congress to eliminate all such provisions from the final \n     bill. Finally, the Administration opposes new mandatory \n     funding for Payments in Lieu of Taxes, and believes that any \n     extension of rural community payments should be phased out, \n     as it\n\n[[Page S9249]]\n\n     has previously proposed. The Administration urges Congress to \n     eliminate all such provisions from the final bill.\n       The Administration supports passage of mental health parity \n     legislation included in the Senate amendments to H.R. 6049 \n     that eliminates disparities between mental health benefits \n     and medical and surgical benefits without significantly \n     increasing health coverage costs. Also, the Administration is \n     pleased that the Senate amendments include the President's \n     Budget proposal to restructure and eventually retire the debt \n     of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL.) The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes from the time on the \nbill to the senior Senator from Connecticut, a senior member of the \nHELP Committee and a longstanding advocate of the mental parity part of \nthe third amendment. I also yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota from the time on the bill for her to use after the Senator \nfrom Oregon speaks, following the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, first let me thank my dear and longtime \nfriend, Senator Max Baucus, for his kind comments. I appreciate them \nvery much. And let me thank him and Senator Grassley as well. There are \na lot of people to thank about all of this, but we wouldn't be here \ntoday talking about this were it not for Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley \nmaking it possible, as part of the tax extenders bill, to deal with \nthis longstanding issue, mental health parity, that affects so many \nmillions of our fellow citizens. I am confident mental health parity is \ngoing to become the law of the land before we adjourn, in a few days, \nthis session of Congress.\n  I rise in strong support of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici \nMental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, which, as I \nmentioned, is included in the tax extenders package. This is a very \nproud moment for millions of Americans who have fought for this but \nalso who know, who are themselves, have family members, neighbors, \nfriends, neighbors, coworkers affected by mental illness.\n  Let me begin by commending someone who is not here today, Senator Ted \nKennedy, who we all know is recovering from a strong challenge himself \nat his home in Massachusetts. He asked me, along with Barbara Mikulski, \nto take on a couple issues when he had to leave and go back home to try \nand get his health back. Barbara Mikulski did a remarkable job in \ndealing with the higher education bill. Senator Kennedy asked me to \nmonitor and work with our Senate colleagues and our colleagues in the \nother body on the mental health parity bill. While it has not yet been \nadopted, we are about to do so in the Senate. It is a moment to \ncongratulate our friend and colleague from Massachusetts who needs no \nfurther words from me about his commitment or his family's commitment, \nhis remarkable sisters, Eunice Shriver, Jean Kennedy Smith, and his \nbrothers over the years. This has been a family crusade, the issue of \nmental health parity, in addition to the work of Paul Wellstone and \nPete Domenici.\n  This is also a great triumph. I know it is a matter of deep pride but \nalso of relief as well that at long last we will recognize the \nimportance of mental health. Let me mention Pete Domenici. Pete is a \nwonderful friend of mine. We are two people of opposite political \nparties who don't agree on a lot, looking back over the years we have \nbeen here together. We have taken different sides of many issues. But \nPete and Nancy Domenici are remarkable people. He will be leaving the \nSenate in a few days after a distinguished career. I had the honor of \nbeing with Pete and Nancy in Las Cruces, NM, to speak at a dinner for \nhim at the Pete Domenici Center for Public Policy, which is now going \nto be part of New Mexico State University. I had dinner with Pete and \nseveral colleagues, past and present, who have worked with him over the \nyears. The Domenicis know about this issue, not just from an \nintellectual standpoint but a personal one as well. It is a matter of \ngreat pride to Pete and his family as well that our country, at least \nby the expression of this body and the other, recognizes the deep \nimportance of this issue. We will hear shortly from my friend from \nOregon who understands this matter very well indeed, personally, as \nwell.\n  I thank all those involved. Paul Wellstone was a remarkable guy. What \na tragedy to lose him a few years ago, him and his family, in that \ndreadful plane crash. No one cared more about this issue day in and day \nout than Paul Wellstone. The first day he arrived, he started talking \nabout it and never stopped during his tenure. Today, we are recognizing \nhim by calling this the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici mental health \nparity bill. His son Dave has been a champion on behalf of his father's \ncause. I wish to mention Dave and how proud his parents would be that \nhe has carried this cause on to both Chambers. Patrick Kennedy as well \nhas championed this issue on the House side, Senator Ted Kennedy's son, \nwho is a distinguished Member in his own right of the House of \nRepresentatives and has done a great job on this issue. I know there \nare a lot of others who are part of this. I don't want to forget \nanyone.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of some 250 organizations that \nhave been a part of this crusade be printed in the Record. I also ask \nunanimous consent that a statement by Mrs. Rosalynn Carter, Former \nFirst Lady of the United States and Chairwoman of the Carter Center's \nMental Health Task Force, in support of passage of the Paul Wellstone \nand Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Mental Health Liaison Group,\n\n                                               September 10, 2008.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Minority Leader,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader Boehner, Leader Reid, and \n     Leader McConnell: We are writing to express our support for \n     the mental health and addiction parity compromise developed \n     by House and Senate negotiators. We urge Congress to pass \n     this important legislation before adjourning in September.\n       Congress has taken a major step forward in developing this \n     thoughtful and balanced bipartisan legislation. We applaud \n     the long, hard work engaged in by you and your colleagues in \n     approving and reconciling the bipartisan House and Senate \n     parity bills (H.R. 1424, S. 558). We urge Congress to take \n     the last, most important step by passing this legislation.\n       Passage of the balanced and bipartisan mental health and \n     addiction parity legislation would represent the fruition of \n     many years of work by members of Congress, advocates, \n     employer organizations and health plans to build on the \n     Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. This broad and diverse \n     coalition stands united in support of the parity compromise. \n     Now, Congress has the chance to reach the goal of enacting \n     this consensus legislation, before a new administration and a \n     new Congress take office, and broader health policy issues \n     begin demanding policymakers' time and attention.\n       We ask Congress to pass federal mental health and addiction \n     parity legislation now.\n           Sincerely,\n         Active Minds, Inc.; ADAP Advocacy Association; Aetna; \n           AFL-CIO; Alliance for Children and Families; Alliance \n           for Eating Disorders Awareness; America's Health \n           Insurance Plans; American Academy of Child and \n           Adolescent Psychiatry; American Academy of Cosmetic \n           Surgery; American Academy of Family Physicians;\n         American Academy of Neurology Professional Association; \n           American Academy of Pediatrics; American Academy of \n           Physician Assistants; American Association for \n           Geriatric Psychiatry; American Association for Marriage \n           and Family Therapy; American Association of Children's \n           Residential Centers; American Association of Pastoral \n           Counselors; American Association of People with \n           Disabilities; American Association of Practicing \n           Psychiatrists; American Association of Suicidology.\n         American Association on Intellectual and Developmental \n           Disabilities; American Benefits Council; American \n           Counseling Association; American Dance Therapy \n           Association; American Federation of Teachers; American \n           Foundation for Suicide Prevention; American Group \n           Psychotherapy Association; American Hospital \n           Association; American Humane Association; American Jail \n           Association; American Mental\n\n[[Page S9250]]\n\n           Health Counselors Association; American Music Therapy \n           Association; American Nurses Association; American \n           Occupational Therapy Association; American \n           Orthopsychiatric Association; American Psychiatric \n           Association; American Psychiatric Nurses Association; \n           American Psychoanalytic Association; American \n           Psychological Association; American Psychotherapy \n           Association.\n         American Public Health Association; American School \n           Health Association; American Society of Addiction \n           Medicine; American Society of Plastic Surgeons; \n           American Thoracic Society; Anxiety Disorders \n           Association of America; Aspire of Western New York; \n           Association for Ambulatory Behavioral Healthcare; \n           Association for Behavioral Health and Wellness; \n           Association for Psychological Science; Association for \n           the Advancement of Psychology; Association of American \n           Medical Colleges; Association of Jewish Family & \n           Children's Agencies; Association of Recovery Schools; \n           Association of University Centers on Disabilities; \n           Association to Benefit Children; AstraZeneca \n           Pharmaceuticals--US; Autism Society of America; Barbara \n           Schneider Foundation; Bazelon Center for Mental Health \n           Law.\n         Betty Ford Center; BlueCross BlueShield Association; \n           Bradford Health Services; Brain Injury Association of \n           America; Caron Treatment Centers; Carter Center Mental \n           Health Program; Center for Clinical Social Work/ABE; \n           Center for Policy, Advocacy and Education, Mental \n           Health Association of NYC; CENTERSTONE Child, \n           Adolescent and Family Division (Nashville, TN); Child \n           and Family Guidance Center (Tacoma, WA); Child \n           Neurology Society; Child Welfare League of America; \n           Children & Families First (Wilmington, DE); Children \n           and Adults with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity \n           Disorder; Children's Healthcare Is a Legal Duty; \n           Children's Hospital Boston; Children's Aid and Family \n           Services, Inc.

When I began no one understood the brain or how to \n     treat mental illnesses. Today everything has changed--except \n     stigma, of course, which holds back progress in the field.\n       Because of research and our new knowledge of the brain, \n     mental illnesses now can be diagnosed and treated \n     effectively, and the overwhelming majority of those affected \n     can lead normal lives--being contributing citizens in our \n     communities.\n       I join many individuals and hundreds of national \n     organizations calling for an end to the fundamental, \n     stigmatizing inequity of providing far more limited insurance \n     coverage for mental health care than for treatment of any \n     other illnesses. Again, I join forces with my friend Betty \n     Ford in urging action on this important issue.\n       Jimmy and I founded The Carter Center 25 years ago, and I \n     have a very good mental health program there. Annually we \n     bring together leaders to take action on major mental health \n     issues of concern to the nation. We have focused many times \n     on stigma and discrimination and the importance of insuring \n     adequate, equitable coverage for people with mental \n     illnesses.\n       To me, it is unconscionable in our country and morally \n     unacceptable to treat 20 percent of our population (1 in \n     every 5 people in our country will experience a mental \n     illness this year) as though they were not worthy of care. We \n     preach human rights and civil rights and yet we let people \n     suffer because of an illness they didn't ask for and for \n     which there is sound treatment. Then we pay the price for \n     this folly in homelessness, lives lost, families torn apart, \n     loss of productivity, and the costs of treatment in our \n     prisons and jails.\n       I have always believed that if insurance covered mental \n     illnesses, it would be all right to have them. This may be \n     why the stigma has remained so pervasive--because these \n     illnesses are treated differently from other health \n     conditions.\n       All mental illnesses are potentially devastating. But today \n     living a life in recovery from a mental illness is not only \n     possible, but expected. We had an intern at The Carter Center \n     this spring, for example, who has obsessive compulsive \n     disorder and depression. While she was in high school, she \n     once spent two solid weeks in her house, unable to leave or \n     be with her friends. I am happy to say that she received \n     treatment, is a college graduate with Phi Beta Kappa honors, \n     and just got a job in Washington, DC. Without resources and \n     support, she could still be sick and shut in her home, which \n     is what happens to so many who do not get the help they need \n     because of lack of the ability to pay for services. We as a \n     country lose all the many contributions of these wonderful \n     people.\n       I have the pleasure of being friends with Tom Johnson, the \n     former publisher of the Los Angeles Times and former CEO of \n     CNN and a person who has struggled with depression. He has \n     been interested in the mental health benefits offered by \n     employers in Atlanta. He and two other prominent CEOs in the \n     Atlanta community--all of whom have suffered from severe \n     depression and are now great leaders--have had an enormous \n     impact on businesses in the area.\n       Through the research of people like Howard Goldman and \n     Richard Frank, we know that parity in insurance benefits for \n     behavioral health care has no significant increase in total \n     costs when coupled with management of care. We also know that \n     a number of enlightened companies such as AT, Delta Air \n     Lines, Eastman Kodak, General Motors, and IBM have provided \n     comprehensive coverage for their employees. (Report to the \n     Office of Personnel Management, by Washington Business Group \n     on Health)\n       Since the mental health commission we held during Jimmy's \n     presidency, there have been several major reports released \n     including the first Surgeon General's Report on Mental \n     Health, President Bush's New Freedom Commission on Mental \n     Health, and the Institute of Medicine included mental and \n     substance use conditions in its series of reports on the \n     quality of American health care. All of the reports reinforce \n     the statement that effective treatments are available, but \n     most people who need them do not get them.\n       The whole nation has learned a lot about the importance of \n     mental health issues through the events of Hurricane Katrina \n     and the needs of our returning soldiers and National Guard \n     troops. We support our troops in the field, and it is \n     critical that we continue to support them when they come \n     home.\n       Finally, I would like to comment on the number of states \n     that have moved ahead with parity. These have been long-\n     fought battles with some states managing wonderful successes. \n     It is so important that stronger state parity laws continue \n     to improve the lives of people with mental illness and \n     addiction. It is also critically important that plans not \n     override the intent of this legislation by discriminating \n     against those with certain diagnoses of mental illness and \n     addiction in their coverage. I am glad to see that this \n     legislation includes efforts to keep a close watch on this \n     issue. The intent of this law is fairness, not \n     discrimination.\n       After waiting for 15 years, we finally have mental health \n     and addiction parity legislation in sight. If this \n     legislation is passed, many of our citizens will be \n     healthier, and our nation will be stronger, more resilient, \n     and more productive.\n       On behalf of the millions of people affected by mental \n     illnesses, I applaud your efforts to pass the mental health \n     and addiction parity legislation. I know the work has been \n     hard, but the benefits to our nation will be enormous.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank them and others who have been a part of this. \nSenator Harry Reid, the majority leader, doesn't often get recognized, \nbut without him, none of this happens. While we associate mental health \nparity issues with Senator Kennedy and Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici \nand others, the majority leader makes all this possible. While he \nprobably wouldn't say so himself on this issue, I can guarantee you we \nwere not going to leave for this session of Congress without a chance \nto vote on this issue. Harry Reid made it a quiet, personal commitment \nthat this body would have a chance to express itself on this issue. \nWithout that kind of commitment from the distinguished majority leader, \nthese matters often can slip away and disappear. To Harry Reid, the \nmajority leader, the Senator from Nevada, to the millions of people \naffected by this issue as well, we thank him for his commitment.\n  This legislation has the potential to impact 1.8 million insured \nindividuals from my home State of Connecticut, 150 million Americans in \nthe United States, but with 1 in 5 American families directly affected \nby mental illness, the impact of this legislation will be much broader. \nEvery one of us, every American knows a friend, has a relative, a \nneighbor, a coworker, colleague whose life has been touched by mental \nillness in one way or the other. With this legislation, we are saying \nthat mental illness will no longer take a backseat to physical illness.\n  With this legislation, we are taking an important step toward tearing \ndown the stigma that people with mental illness face every single day \nand have for decades. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental \nHealth Parity and Addiction Equity Act will end health insurance \ndiscrimination between mental health and substance abuse disorders and \nmedical and surgical conditions. Upon passage of this bill, health \ninsurers will no longer be permitted to charge higher copays or limit \nthe frequency of treatment for people with mental illness than what \nthey would for a medical or surgical condition. The bill before us \nbuilds on what the Senate passed unanimously 1 year ago. The bill \nstrengthens the requirements around out-of-network benefits for mental \nillness and improves the transparency of decisions made by insurance \ncompanies with respect to mental health coverage.\n  A component of the bill I wish to highlight is its protection of \nState laws that provide for greater consumer protection than what \nexists in Federal law. I take pride in the fact that I represent the \nsmall State of Connecticut. Yet my State recognized the disparity \nbetween insurance coverage for physical and mental illness years ago. \nThey did so by taking a significant step to address mental illness by \nenacting strong mental health parity and consumer protection laws. \nThese laws far exceed what currently exists in Federal law, and I \nbelieve the bill before us today will allow my State and others to \nmaintain those strong laws in the future. The protection and \npreservation of State law is an issue I have fought long and hard for \nduring Senate consideration of this bill. It is an issue of crucial \nimportance to my State and will no doubt be a central issue next year, \nwhen I hope this body acts on legislation to finally make mental health \ncare universal in this country as part of a universal health care \neffort.\n  Of all the health care issues I have worked on, it is a rarity to \nfind an issue with as many diverse interests putting their full weight \nbehind passage of a bill such as this. As I mentioned, more than 250 \nnational organizations, representing consumers, family members, \nadvocates, professionals, and providers have signed a letter urging \nCongress to pass this legislation\n\n[[Page S9252]]\n\ninto law. It is so important that we have that kind of support. I will \nnot go through all the organizations involved, but I wish to highlight \nthe work of the Connecticut Psychological Association, Aetna, which is \nheadquartered in Hartford, and the Connecticut Insurance Department and \nOffice of Healthcare Advocacy. They have all played an important role \nin this legislation.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to act now and pass this bill. We tip our \nhat to Ted Kennedy, Paul Wellstone, Pete Domenici, and all those who \nfought and care about this issue. It is a great moment for the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd, for his statement on health parity. When I first began wrestling \nwith this issue, he was unusually helpful to me in breaking the dam, \nthis cause of mental health and suicide prevention. I thank him for \nthat. I will never forget him for that. I think of Senator Kennedy and \nof Pete Domenici and others who have been my allies to move not just \nthe youth component but mental health parity as an essential \ningredient, to help move it forward and put it on a basis that is equal \nwith physical health. The truth is, if you have physical health and you \ndon't have mental health, you do not have health. In fact, you may have \nsomething just as lethal as leukemia or any other dreaded disease.\n  America is taking a great step forward with the passage of this \nextenders package today. I suspect many of my colleagues are having \ntheir phones ring off the hook as we speak on the issue of financial \ninsecurity that is leading the headlines of the papers and on all the \nnews shows and talk shows. It is something that is deeply distressing \nto every American and certainly to this American.\n  What we have in this country that we are dealing with, at its root, \nis a crisis in confidence over credit. Right or wrong, like it or not, \ncommerce in this country runs on credit. Small businesses without \ncashflow have to take out loans. As I evaluate this package--and I have \nmade no decision on it--I am going to be looking to make sure there are \nno golden parachutes, to make sure this is not a bailout of fat cats \nbut that this goes to Main Street in ways that help people who are \nalready suffering the consequences. We can do things such as extending \nunemployment insurance, improving LIHEAP. We can even add additional \nfunds to food stamps. But at the end of the day, what does matter to \nthe people who have a job and go to work is to have employers who are \ncreditworthy. If their banks are not creditworthy, if their banks have \nwritten their assets down so much that when you put your money in, they \nkeep it, they don't lend it out--when that happens, commerce stops. \nJobs are lost. The carnage spreads. That is what we are dealing with in \nthis very difficult week in the Senate, to make sure we do the best we \ncan in this deliberative body that the Constitution gives the purse \nstrings.\n  We have to do it right. If it comes up wrong, we have to start over \nand do it better. There is no place for golden parachutes for those who \nhave taken advantage of the rules on Wall Street in ways that have \nvictimized many people. We have already put $300 billion toward the \nbailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These are government-sponsored \nenterprises. In those institutions, apparently the leaders, the boards, \nwere playing fast and loose with the terms Congress gave them in their \ncharter in a way that is both deplorable and more than lamentable. \nThere are people who need to be held accountable for what has happened. \nBut Fannie and Freddie are the central plank in the problem of our \ncredit. That is what started the dominos.\n  Having said that, I do wish to suggest that this extenders package is \nmost worthy of passage, not just because of the mental health parity \nthat is included, but I wish to talk about another feature that my \ncolleague Ron Wyden and I have been working on ever since we have been \nin the Senate together. That is the secure rural schools extension. \nThis has been most difficult because it has not been easy to explain to \nour colleagues all over the country who do not know what it is like to \nhave the Federal Government own most of your State. When the Federal \nGovernment owns your State, the local governments cannot tax the \nFederal Government. So dating back to the beginning of statehood in \nOregon in 1859, there was a relationship developed between the Congress \nand Oregon, and other similarly situated States, whereby they would \nreceive 25 percent of what are called timber taxes or mining taxes or \nextraction taxes, these kinds of resources that come from public lands.\n  It is through that, because the counties don't have a tax base, that \nrural folks are able to have schools, streets, and neighborhoods that \nare safe, with police protection. That worked very well, even through a \nbig reformation period under Teddy Roosevelt, when these things were \nredone. It has worked very well. But in the 1990s, there came a great \neffort to save the spotted owl. There came a change in forest policy \nwith the Clinton administration. The purpose was to save the spotted \nowl. We learned now, decades later, that the spotted owl was not \nimperiled by logging. It is now imperiled by catastrophic wildfire. It \nis now imperiled by a nonnative owl called the bard owl, and the bard \nowl likes to eat the spotted owl. Nevertheless, the carnage has been \ndone. At the end of the Clinton administration, the President was good \nenough to sign replacement revenues which are called county payments or \nsecure rural schools funding.\n  It has been hard to get these funds reauthorized. We had it extended \nby one year last year. This package extends it 4 years. It needs to be \nextended. This is not a golden parachute. This is keeping the covenant \nwith rural counties. This is vital if we are to keep faith with rural \nplaces and people in very vulnerable areas.\n\n  I am delighted this legislation is included in the package. The \nSenate has passed it before with huge majorities because Senator Wyden \nand I--he has worked that side of the aisle and I have worked this side \nof the aisle--made sure we got it in, that we keep enough support on \nboth sides that it could make it to the House of Representatives, where \nI hope and I pray it will be accepted.\n  But I would conclude my remarks by saying: I understand from some of \nmy neighboring States that the formula had to be changed. This bill \nrepresents a declining interest to Oregon of 60 percent. The 60 percent \nis based on a cut to Oregon, which is based on a new formula. The new \nformula is not based on history. You see, the old formula was that the \nmoney goes to those counties where God put the trees. Now, it is \ndistributed differently, so our neighboring States can get more, and \nOregon gets less. I do not like that.\n  But I want to say there is a way to remedy that deficiency, and that \nis to go back to a balance on forest policy that allows for a \nsustainable yield, allows for the creation of timber jobs, allows for \nthe development of American timber for American homes and American \ncommerce. Instead of being a nation that imports lumber, we can once \nagain be a self-sufficient country in lumber.\n  We need the help of the administration. We have had it with President \nBush. We have not had it with the courts. But the courts, I hope, are \nchanging because this is literally a matter of economic life and death \nfor vulnerable rural communities. So what we have to have is this, \nwhich is the best we can get, and we need it for 4 years.\n  Then we need to make up this deficiency the old-fashioned way, by \nletting men and women in rural places go back to work, to manage our \nforests, these public lands that can be managed in a way that is \nconsistent with the environment and creates the economic blessings \nOregon and other places have known in the past. Those blessings, in \nshort, are family-wage jobs, the kinds of jobs that pay property taxes, \nbuild schools, pave streets, and keep neighborhoods safe. If we can do \nthat, all will be well and this day will represent a good day for the \nState of Oregon and particularly its rural parts and places.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer for the time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for \nhis support for the Paul Wellstone and\n\n[[Page S9253]]\n\nPete Domenici mental health parity bill, something I am going to talk \nabout in a minute.\n  Madam President, as we focus on the very serious and urgent challenge \nfacing our financial system, we must not lose sight of the equally \nserious challenge of building a solid foundation for America's economy \nin the long term. Today, we have the opportunity to vote on a \nbipartisan bill--the Energy Improvement and Extension Act--which will \nhelp America build that long-term foundation.\n  I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus for their work on this \nbill. The bill we vote on today provides an opportunity for the first \nstep to move America forward. The way we have been handling these \nenergy incentives has been like a game of red light, green light: on \nagain, off again, on again, off again. While our country develops so \nmuch of the technology for wind and solar, we have now been leapfrogged \nby other countries that have more long-term policies in place that \nencourage investment in these areas.\n  You can drive past hundreds of massive wind turbines along Buffalo \nRidge in southwestern Minnesota. My State is the third leading producer \nof wind power, and that is because our State, on a bipartisan basis, \nhas set some standards and put those incentives in place. On the Iron \nRange in northeastern Minnesota, a large mining company has just \nannounced it will invest $15 million to build a facility to produce a \nrenewable biofuel using a variety of sources, such as switchgrass, corn \nhusks and stover, wood byproducts and oat hulls. This is about the \nfuture of energy.\n  When I get questions about this and how we need to move with energy, \nI always remind people of the first start of the computer age when we \nhad those big computers in those big rooms and they were inefficient, \nand over time they got more and more efficient, so those computers can \nfit in the palm of someone's hand. But to do that, as a country we are \ngoing to have to have that individual focus and that determination to \ninvest and set those standards.\n  Today is the first step. I think our energy challenge offers similar \nopportunities that we had when we put a man on the Moon. So we have to \nask ourselves this: Will the United States be a leader in creating the \nclean energy technology jobs and industries of the future or are we \njust going to sit back and watch the opportunities pass us by with \nJapan and Europe and India leading the way? Today, with the bill before \nus, we have the opportunity to be that energy leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5635\n\n  We also have a chance to be a better leader in an area of health care \nwhere we have come up short for far too long. I am referring to the \nmental health parity bill that is included in this package. We have \ntried to pass this legislation through the Senate over and over again. \nThese efforts predate my time in the Senate, and they continue to this \nday.\n  My friend and our former colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, Paul \nWellstone, fought for this law as a matter of justice and fairness. \nSenator Domenici, on the other side of the aisle, was right there with \nhim and has continued to press for this legislation. Senator Kennedy \nhas been a champion for this legislation, and Senator Durbin. In the \nHouse, there is Patrick Kennedy and one of my favorite Republican \nCongressmen, Jim Ramstad from Minnesota. He is stepping down this year, \nand he does not want to leave until this bill gets done.\n  As Paul Wellstone always insisted: A mental health parity law is \nabout equality and fairness. It is also about human dignity. Although \nmuch has changed over the years, people who suffer from a mental \nillness continue to suffer from a deep social stigma--something that \ncan be just as challenging to live with as their illness. Their \nfamilies suffer too. This legislation is not just about health \ninsurance. It is also about eliminating the stigma and affirming the \ndignity of the Americans who suffer from a mental illness or an \naddiction.\n  Paul knew about this and cared about this issue because of his \nbrother Steven who had a mental illness. He was hospitalized. His \nfamily was thrown into debt. Paul would often talk about how, during \nthose years, there was a darkness in their home. Paul's brother \neventually got proper treatment and secured his dignity at great cost \nto their family. Paul did not want anyone else to go through what their \nfamily went through.\n  He also cared about this bill because he always cared about the \nunderdog, the person for whom it seemed as though there was nothing \nelse there for them. That is what Paul Wellstone was about: putting \nthose people first in the Halls of the Senate.\n  Whenever I walk through the Senate and say I am a Senator from \nMinnesota, I hear stories from other Senators about Paul. But the \nstories I remember most are those I hear from the secretaries in the \nfront offices or the tram drivers or the police officers who guard the \nfront of the Capitol. They, too, tell me about Paul and how good he was \nto them and how he treated them with respect. That is what Paul brought \nto this job. That is why he cared so much about this legislation.\n  In 1995, Minnesota enacted a mental health parity law that is among \nthe strongest in the Nation. In the past 10 to 15 years, other States \nhave enacted some version of mental health parity. The problem is that \ndespite these State laws, 82 million Americans do not benefit because \ntheir employers' self-insurance plans come under the jurisdiction of \nthe Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. It is \ntime for them to receive the same protection as Americans whose \ninsurance does not come under ERISA.\n  I think about the legendary Supreme Court Justice, Justice Brandeis, \nwho had a famous saying about States being the laboratories of \ndemocracy. He said:\n\n       It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that \n     a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve \n     as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic \n     experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\n\n  But Justice Brandeis did not mean that ``novel social and economic \nexperiments'' must forever stay at the State level. If an experiment is \nsuccessful at the State level--especially in many States--then it may \nvery well be something that should be taken up on a larger national \nscale. Mental health parity has proven its value in State after State. \nNow it is time to take this well-tested innovation to the national \nlevel so our country has a uniform, equal standard of mental health \nparity that applies to self-insurance plans under the jurisdiction of \nERISA.\n\n  There are so many good reasons for our Nation to have a mental health \nparity law: economic reasons, health reasons, criminal justice reasons, \nand reasons of basic fairness and human dignity. For me, there is one \nspecial reason why we must pass this legislation. That reason is Paul \nWellstone. This legislation is about everything he stood for--about \nfighting for people who do not have power and do not have a voice, \npeople who would rather hide than speak up because of the stigma and \nthe shame, people who needlessly suffered because of discrimination and \nprejudice. This bill is about Paul. It is about his brother Steven. It \nis about his family. And it is about his determination to help bring \njustice and dignity to millions of Americans who live in the shadow of \nmental illness. When Paul was alive, many people in this Chamber said \nthey wanted to pass this bill, and when Paul died, they said they \nwanted to pass this bill. Well, the time has come to pass this bill.\n  Senator Kennedy, home watching everything that goes on in this \nChamber, wants to get this done. Before he retires, Jim Ramstad wants \nto get this done. And Paul Wellstone's sons have been here day after \nday walking the halls of the Capitol, knocking on doors, trying to do \nthis for their father's memory. We have waited too long.\n  We have the opportunity to finally get this bill into law. It is an \nopportunity to put aside all the excuses and, instead, to put front and \ncenter all of the many good reasons this law will serve our Nation \nwell. I hope, when this vote comes up today, this bill will pass and it \nwill pass by a large margin. It is a tribute to Paul and to all the \npeople who have waited for so long to get their dignity.\n  I thank the chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this third amendment, which I hope we \nvote\n\n[[Page S9254]]\n\non successfully very soon, addresses tax relief for American families \nand tax relief for American businesses. The amendment addresses jobs, \nfamilies, disaster relief, and mental health parity.\n  I was particularly struck by the last speaker. She is right. The \nmental health parity provision is so important for so many reasons, \nespecially for the people who deserve equal treatment, in addition to \nbeing in honor of Senator Ted Kennedy and also in honor of Paul \nWellstone.\n  This amendment also prevents the alternative minimum tax from hitting \nmillions more American families. Our economy is struggling, and so are \nAmerica's working families. Markets are experiencing volatility. At \ntimes such as these, Americans need tax cuts that they have come to \ncount on and that can help them get by. That is why this amendment \nincludes a 1-year patch for the alternative minimum tax. This patch \nwould protect more than 21 million Americans from falling victim to the \nAMT. We will not let more taxpayers fall into the alternative minimum \ntax.\n  In addition, the amendment would extend expiring individual and \nbusiness tax provisions for 2 years. These provisions include the \nqualified tuition deduction to give families relief from high tuition \ncosts. In my home State of Montana alone, almost 14,000 families would \nget help with high college tuition.\n  The amendment also includes the teacher expense deduction. This \ndeduction gives back to teachers some of the money they spend on school \nsupplies to educate America's children.\n  The amendment includes a State and local sales tax deduction for \nthose States without an income tax.\n  The amendment covers several business incentives that help keep \nAmerican businesses competitive and create jobs. The amendment includes \nincentives such as the research and development credit. This credit \ngives an incentive to businesses to invest in research. It helps to \ncreate and keep American jobs with good wages, and it helps to keep \nAmerica competitive in the global economy.\n  This package does more than just extend expiring provisions. It \nexpands the refundable child tax credit. By expanding this valuable \ncredit, nearly 3 million more children will be eligible for this tax \nincentive.\n  This amendment would also help to improve health care for countless \nfamilies dealing with mental illness. This mental health parity \nlegislation would mandate equal assistance for those suffering from \nmental illness. This legislation has been championed by our late \ncolleague, Paul Wellstone, and our colleagues Ted Kennedy and, of \ncourse, Pete Domenici. It has long been a goal in the Senate and it is \na goal that we can finally meet today.\n\n  The amendment would provide much-needed relief to families and \nbusinesses that have been devastated by natural disasters.\n  Right now, our country is experiencing rough economic times. Congress \nshould do more than just extend legislation; Congress needs to meet the \nneeds of the American people.\n  Let us help to create jobs. Let us help working families make ends \nmeet. Let us achieve mental health parity once and for all. Let us \nprovide relief for those who have suffered from natural disasters.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:45, \nall time be considered yielded back, and the Senate then proceed to \nvote in relation to the amendments and the motion to waive the Budget \nAct in the order in which offered; that prior to each vote, there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form; \nthat after the first vote in the sequence, the remaining votes be 10 \nminutes in duration, with the remaining provisions of the previous \norder governing consideration of H.R. 6049 still in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nupon disposition of H.R. 6049, the Senate then proceed to a period of \nmorning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, a couple words on the first amendment to \nbe voted on. The energy amendment would help create well-paid jobs in \nthe growing field of new energy technology, help to secure our \nindependence from high-priced foreign oil, and move us closer to \naddressing global warming. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I speak in favor of the Baucus-\nGrassley amendment, which is an important step in our effort to free \nAmerica from our addiction to foreign oil. The amendment converts tax \nincentives for conventional energy and, in turn, puts that as an \nincentive for alternative energy, as well as conservation.\n  The amendment continues the path to development of clean coal, hybrid \nvehicles, and biofuels. A vote for this amendment is a vote for a \nbrighter American future for all families, for cleaner fuel. I ask that \nyou all support the amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. DeMint) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar).

The motion to reconsider is made and laid on \nthe table.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5634\n\n  There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided on Conrad \namendment No. 5634.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered today is a \nfully paid for alternative minimum tax fix. To go down the road of \nfixing the alternative minimum tax without offset, without paying for \nit, will only\n\n[[Page S9255]]\n\ngrow the debt dramatically. The 10-year fix for the alternative minimum \ntax costs $1.6 trillion, all of it added to the debt.\n  Yesterday, I say to my colleagues, the dollar dropped 2 percent in \nvalue in 1 day, after already falling 40 percent in value over the last \n2 years. The key reason analysts gave was burgeoning debt in the United \nStates that undermines the credibility of our national credit.\n\n  It is time to start paying for things. This is a fully paid for, \nfully offset alternative minimum tax, paid for in ways that are not \ncontroversial.\n  I thank the Chair, and I urge my colleagues to vote aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, everyone, of course, agrees with the \nSenator from North Dakota that the fiscal situation is unsustainable. \nSo as an alternative--as the minority ought to offer a reasonable \nalternative--on this side, our leader a few weeks ago offered a \ndeficit-neutral proposal on AMT and on extenders. That proposal would \nhave reduced new above-baseline spending nondiscretionary \nappropriations for future years. That deficit-neutral proposal was \nrejected. In its place is this amendment, which insists that AMT relief \nbe conditioned on a tax increase.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote to hold AMT relief now, and in \nthe future, hostage to a tax increase. That is not reasonable. I urge \nmy colleagues to reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n5634.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, 60 votes being \nrequired to adopt the amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5635\n\n  There is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided on the Baucus-\nGrassley perfecting amendment. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, 53 Senators voted to pay for an \nalternative minimum tax fix. That is a majority. I am now raising the \npoint of order, a budget point of order against an unpaid-for \nalternative minimum tax fix, again reminding our colleagues the cost to \ncontinue on this path to fix the alternative minimum tax for 10 years \nis $1.6 trillion, all added to the debt.\n  Yesterday the dollar went down 2 percent in value in 1 day. \nColleagues, we simply have to begin to pay for things; otherwise, the \ncreditworthiness of our country will be in question and at risk.\n  Therefore, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates the pay-go section 201 of the S. Con. Res. 21, a concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable budget \nprovisions for the consideration of the Baucus-Grassley amendment No. \n5635.\n  I might say, if this point of order is not waived, then the \nunderlying extenders bill will not pass and AMT will be felt by \nmillions of taxpayers next year. As much as we would like to pay for \neverything, we cannot pay for everything in this context at this time. \nWithout this amendment, the tax extenders will not pass. The underlying \nbill for the AMT should pass for a year. It fixes the child tax credit, \nprovides support for rural schools, the mental health parity \nprovisions, as well as finally it provides disaster relief for families \nand businesses. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and waive \nthe point of order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could direct a question to my friend, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee. We already had this vote. Do we \nneed another one? It is obvious it is not going to get it. I committed \nto the House we would have a vote. What purpose is there of this vote? \nWe have already proven we cannot get 60 votes, so why do we need \nanother vote?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have raised the point of order. I made a commitment to \nour colleagues in the House to carry that out. I feel honor bound to \nhave a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n\n[[Page S9256]]\n\n  Pursuant to the previous order, the amendment is agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider is considered made and laid on the table.\n\n\n                        National Disaster Relief\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Baucus, for joining me to discuss the \nSenate Finance Committee's substitute amendment to H.R. 6409.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is my understanding that the Senator would like to \nspeak about an issue related to the national disaster relief section of \nthe Finance Committee substitute to H.R. 6409.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is correct. Throughout the summer a swarm of \ndry lightning storms sparked more than 2,000 fires across drought-\nridden land in California, burning over 900,000 acres of public and \nprivate land. These fires damaged and destroyed homes and businesses \nacross the State.\n  As the Senator knows, his bill makes taxpayers in ``federally \ndeclared disaster'' areas under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \nand Emergency Assistance Act eligible for certain tax relief \nprovisions.\n  Under the Stafford Act, the President has the ability to designate a \ndisaster area under a ``major disaster declaration'' or an ``Emergency \nDeclaration.'' Areas affected by wildfires in California this year were \nprovided an ``Emergency Declaration'' by the President.\n  In the matter of what ``federally declared disaster'' areas are \neligible under the bill on the floor, the Senator's Finance Committee \nstaff and the Congressional Research Service have indicated that both \ncategories of disaster declaration have historically been eligible for \ndisaster tax relief purposes.\n  Is it the Senator's understanding that the term ``federally declared \ndisaster'' includes both categories of disaster declarations, and that \nCalifornians affected by the 2008 wildfires are eligible under division \nB, title VII, subtitle B, sections 706-711 of the substitute to H.R. \n6409?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, it is the committee's intention that Californians in \nfederally declared disaster areas will be eligible for tax relief in \nthe sections the Senator has referenced.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Paul \nWellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity \nAct of 2008.\n  Enacting comprehensive parity legislation is long overdue. This is \nsimply a matter of fairness and I hope the Senate will pass this \ncompromise legislation so it can be sent to the House today. We owe \nnothing less to the more than 80 million Americans suffering with \nmental illness and addiction.\n  Thoughtful compromises were made so that the bill we are considering \ntoday provides mental health and addiction benefits on par with other \nmedical and surgical conditions and, for the first time after 12 years, \na compromise is supported by all of the business, insurer, addiction \nand mental health groups.\n  Throughout my time in office, I have been a strong advocate for \nending the discrimination against people suffering from mental illness \nand addiction and ensuring those in need have access to effective \ntreatment services. This passion was shaped by the many Minnesotans who \nhave raised their voices to get us to where we are today in this \nimportant fight. In particular, I want to thank all the people at \nHazelden Foundation, Kitty Westin from the Anna Westin Foundation, NAMI \nMinnesota, the Minnesota Psychological Association, Mental Health \nAmerica's Minnesota advocates and others. Finally, this bill will not \nonly be a living legacy to their tireless efforts, but also to the \nunwavering support from Senators Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici, and \nRepresentative Jim Ramstad.\n  As a supporter of parity legislation since I arrived in the Senate, I \nknow that passage of comprehensive parity legislation and ensuring \naccess to treatment is long overdue. I know that effective mental \nhealth and addiction treatment can mean the difference between \nhappiness and hopelessness and in some cases, even life and death. The \ngood news is that those of us on both sides of the aisle and both wings \nof the Capitol finally recognized this and are coming together to send \na strong bill to the White House.\n  The time is now. Let's end the discrimination by passing the Paul \nWellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity \nAct of 2008.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while this is far from being a perfect \nbill, I am pleased that the Senate is finally taking up this package of \n``tax extenders'' after repeated filibusters of this effort by the \nminority.\n  I am a strong supporter of advanced and alternative energy \ntechnologies and believe that the tax incentives included in this bill \nare an essential component of bringing these technologies to the \ncommercial market place. We need a balanced energy strategy that \nincludes energy from a broad array of sources--renewable technologies \nsuch as solar, wind, and biomass, as well as more conventional sources \nsuch as clean coal and natural gas. We also need to reduce our \nconsumption and dependence on petroleum by promoting expanded use of \nadvanced, more fuel-efficient vehicle technologies and alternative \nfuels such as ethanol and other biofuels. Critical to the success of \nall of these advanced and alternative energy technologies are tax \nincentives, which will both spur development of these technologies and \nmake them accessible and affordable to consumers.\n  The energy tax extender package was a long time in coming. The Senate \nconsidered it first in June 2007, again in December 2007, and then \nmultiple times in this calendar year. This package extends many \ncritical existing tax incentives--including those for renewable \nproduction of electricity from wind, solar, and biomass; it extends \nexisting tax credits in the area of alternative fuels production and \nalternative fuel infrastructure; and it extends tax incentives for \nenergy efficient appliances and residential home energy improvements. \nThe package also includes new tax incentives for plug-in hybrid \nvehicles, small residential wind investments, and carbon capture and \nsequestration technologies.\n  This package of energy tax provisions will take important steps \nforward to develop and commercialize all of these technologies. \nRenewable technologies such as wind and solar are becoming more \neconomical every year and our manufacturing sector can play a major \nrole in the production of these technologies. Extension of these tax \ncredits is critical to the development of these technologies and \ncritical to our manufacturers ability to commit to projects that will \nutilize these technologies. Similarly, extension of the tax credit for \nalternative fuel pumps for ethanol and natural gas, and extension of \ntax credits for production of ethanol and other biofuels are essential \nto both the production and distribution of these fuels.\n  I am particularly pleased to see in this package establishment of a \nnew tax credit for consumers for plug-in hybrid and all-electric \nvehicles. All of our auto manufacturers are working to develop new \nvehicle technologies that will use advanced batteries and will draw a \ngreater percentage of their power from electricity. These technologies \nwill revolutionize the way in which we drive and the distances that we \ncan go without refueling. But the development and commercialization of \nthese technologies are also expensive. Therefore, these tax incentives \nare key not only to the development of these technologies and but also \nto consumer acceptance and widespread use of these vehicles.\n  This bill also provides help to those affected by the numerous \nfloods, tornadoes, and severe storms that occurred this summer in the \nMidwest. I am pleased that those individuals and businesses that \nsuffered losses this past June in Michigan's declared disaster areas \nwill be eligible for these benefits.\n  I am also glad that this bill extends the research and development \ntax credit. At a time of increasing globalization, America's prosperity \ndepends more than ever on its capacity for innovation. For decades, our \nNation's leadership in basic and applied research has led to \ndiscoveries that have dramatically improved living standards and given \nrise to new industries that have in turn created millions of high \npaying jobs in engineering, research and technology. Other countries \nare well aware of the significant economic benefits that flow from R \nactivities, and many have created strong\n\n[[Page S9257]]\n\ntax incentives designed to increase levels of local R and attract R \ninvestment from around the world. Particularly for large multinational \ncorporations, the question is often not whether to invest in R, but \nwhere. I hope that in the near future we can cement our commitment to \nthis incentive by making the R credit permanent.\n  There are a number of other good policies that I am pleased are in \nthis bill, including the IRA rollover provision which allows \nindividuals over the age of 70\\1/2\\ to donate up to $100,000 from their \nindividual retirement accounts to qualifying charitable organizations \non a tax-free basis. This provision has contributed to a considerable \nincrease in IRA donations to eligible charities across our country. \nUnfortunately, the provision was only temporary, and it expired at the \nend of 2007.\n  I am also glad that this bill extends the critically important \nadjustment to the alternative minimum tax. Relief from the AMT is \nneeded to avoid imposing an unintended tax increase on millions of \nmiddle income families. But in order to have money for other \npriorities, AMT relief should be done without busting the budget. I \nwish that the amendment that would have paid for this provision had \nbeen adopted.\n  There is another part of this bill that deserves mention: the Paul \nWellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity \nAct. This critical piece of legislation will address inequities between \nhealth insurance coverage for medical and surgical benefits and \ncoverage for mental health and substance abuse disorders for group \nhealth plans with more than 50 employees.\n  Under most health insurance plans, beneficiaries of mental health or \nsubstance abuse services do not receive the same level of coverage as \nmedical and surgical services. An earlier piece of legislation, the \nMental Health Parity Act of 1996--title VII of Public Law 104-204--\nsought to address this issue by providing limited parity for mental \nhealth coverage under employer-sponsored group plans. While the 1996 \nparity law prohibits insurers from establishing more restrictive annual \nand overall lifetime limits on mental health coverage than for other \nhealth coverage, it is far from adequate. For example, the Act did not \nrequire that mental health benefits be offered as part of a health \ninsurance package. Additionally, it did not require parity in \ncopayments or deductibles for mental health services nor does it \nrequire health plans to cover a minimum number of inpatient days or \noutpatient visits. As a result, many health plans have found ways to \ndiscourage the use of mental health care by setting higher copayments \nand deductibles, or by lowering limits on the number of hospital days \nand physician visits for which they would pay.\n  Under this new legislation, if such a group health plan provides both \nmedical and surgical benefits as well as mental health or substance \nabuse benefits, the plan's requirements and limitations must not be \nmore restrictive as applied to mental health or substance abuse \nbenefits. For example, if such a plan provides out-of-network coverage \nfor medical and surgical benefits, then it must also provide parity in \nout-of-network coverage for mental health or substance abuse disorder \nbenefits. If the change leads to increases in cost for a particular \nplan, the legislation establishes a procedure whereby an employer can \napply for 1-year exemptions.\n  Mental health parity is about basic fairness and equity. Individuals \nsuffering from mental health illnesses deserve access to adequate and \nappropriate health care. I am glad that Congress is righting this \nwrong.\n  My concerns with this bill are not over what is included, but rather \nwhat is not. The main dispute in the long drawn-out battle over these \nextenders has been whether we could do this in a way that is fiscally \nresponsible, so that we do not leave our children and our children's \nchildren to foot the bill. I am troubled by the fact that this bill \npays for only $42 billion of the $161 billion 10-year cost of extending \nthese incentives. Some of my colleagues argue that Congress should just \nadd the $62 billion cost of the AMT fix to the deficit and leave it at \nthat. But while taxpayers are given necessary relief, if we don't pay \nthe cost, but merely increase the debt, the burden is shifted to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Paying for these extenders does not need to be controversial, and we \ndo not need to raise taxes on the middle class. It is estimated that \nthe use of offshore tax havens by tax dodgers robs our Treasury of more \nthan $100 billion in revenue each year, leaving honest taxpayers to \nfoot the bill. Last year I introduced the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, \nS.681, which would provide important tools to combat offshore tax \nabuses and would bring in a significant amount of that lost revenue. I \nwill continue to fight to enact that bill and other commonsense \nmeasures to close tax loopholes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as a Senator that not only represents a \nleader in renewable energy technology but also helps run the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, I am pleased that we have finally reached \na compromise which will allow us to extend important tax credits for \nrenewable energy.\n  History tells us that our most promising technologies frequently need \ngovernment assistance in order to get off the ground and become \neconomically viable. One of the most effective ways we can do this is \nthrough our Tax Code.\n  Our Nation is facing unprecedented challenges in our financial \nmarkets and in energy. I have spent much of my time over the last few \nmonths talking about the need to build a bridge toward our energy \nfuture. I believe that bridge consists of increased oil and gas \nproduction from American lands offshore. I am pleased to note that \nsince the time I first introduced legislation to open up lands offshore \nin May, there has been a sea change in both public opinion and the \nopinions of my colleagues on this issue.\n  But the domestic oil and gas that I am talking about is not the \nentire solution. In fact, as I said, it is just a bridge to the \nultimate solution, and that is the development of new technologies that \nwill allow us to use far less oil. Those technologies include plug-in \nhybrid cars as well as renewable energy sources like wind, solar, \nbiomass and geothermal.\n  In 2005, as chairman of the Energy Committee, I was pleased to lead \nthe Senate to pass the largest and longest tax credits for renewable \nenergy in history. We have renewed those tax credits several times \nsince then, but these credits are once again set to expire. Every time \nthey get close to expiring, investments in the industry begin to dry \nup, and the uncertainty hurts our Nation's ability to deploy these \ntechnologies in a timely and cost-effective manner.\n  We have struggled with the tax extensions during this Congress, \nbecause, frankly, the majority has decided to play politics with them. \nFor the first time in history, they have demanded that they be offset \nthrough tax increases. Although the Senate voted 88-8 to extend them \nwithout those tax increases earlier this year, the House refused to \nconsider our proposal, and the renewable energy industry has suffered \nas a result.\n  At last, there appears to be a light at the end of the tunnel if the \nHouse of Representatives doesn't seek to politicize this issue once \nagain. A reasonable, commonsense agreement to extend the tax credits \nfor renewable energy, as well as do several other important things like \nmental health parity and fixing the AMT problem, has been reached. I \nwill address those subjects in greater detail, but it should be noted \nthat the agreement now before us does offset much of the cost of the \ntax credit extensions, but it does so in a way that will not harm \ndomestic production of energy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this agreement in its totality, and I \nsincerely hope that the House will take up this entire package and pass \nit so that these essential tax credits will once again not be allowed \nto expire.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. I thank all my colleagues in the Senate and their \nstaffs who have worked so long and hard and well to bring us to this \nhistoric day on mental health parity.\n  In particular, I recognize our late friend and colleague, Senator \nPaul Wellstone, who championed this fight for so many years. Without \nthe leadership of Senator Wellstone and our colleague Senator Domenici, \nwe would not be here today.\n\n[[Page S9258]]\n\n  Americans believe we are all created equal. This legislation brings \nus closer to that ideal by ending a particularly invidious form of \ndiscrimination--discrimination in health insurance against tens of \nmillions of Americans who suffer from mental illness.\n  One in five Americans will face mental illness this year. Today at \nleast, the Senate can say to them loud and clear, you will no longer \nhave to suffer in the shadows.\n  Through the miracle of modern medicine, mental illnesses are just as \ntreatable as physical illnesses--but patients with mental illnesses are \nstill treated very differently.\n  That difference is unfair and unacceptable. It makes no sense for \nhealth insurance companies to charge patients more for mental health \ncare than they do for physical health services.\n  It is tragic when any family member is diagnosed with an illness; it \nis heart-wrenching for a parent to watch their child suffer.\n  But the tragedy is even greater, when treatment is denied solely \nbecause the child's illness is a mental illness.\n  This discrimination can tear families apart, exactly when they should \nbe coming together to support their loved one. The last thing any \nparent should have to worry about is whether insurance will pay for the \nneeded care and treatment.\n  When mental illnesses of our fellow citizens are treated, they get \ntheir health back--and we get back our friends, our family members, and \nour coworkers.\n  The parity legislation before us is a landmark agreement after 10 \nyears of stalemate, not only in Congress, but also with the mental \nhealth community, businesses, and the insurance industry.\n  Now, we have come together and agreed at long last to end the \nsenseless discrimination at all levels of society that has plagued \npersons living with mental illness.\n  Together, we have worked to end injustice that has denied them the \ncare and treatment they deserve. We have agreed that equal treatment of \nmental illness is not just an insurance issue--it is also an issue of \ncivil rights.\n  At its heart, mental health parity is an issue of fundamental \njustice, and today that fundamental justice arrives in the lives of \nmillions of our fellow Americans, and I thank all my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for making this day possible.\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, for far too long, American workers \nand businesses have awakened each day to wave after wave of bad news: \nrising foreclosures, $4 gasoline, job losses, inflation, bank runs, \ncredit crises, embassy bombings, triple-digit stock losses, devastating \nhurricanes . . . the bad news just keeps coming. The burden is heavy \nand Americans are tired.\n  But today, a ray of sunlight is peeking through the storm clouds. \nToday, I am happy to share some good news with you. It is good news \nwhen the Senate can rise above partisan politics and find solutions to \ntough problems. And it is very good news when that solution lets \ntaxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money.\n  The legislation before us will provide much needed tax relief to \nindividuals, families, and American industry and put us on the path \ntowards recovery. It will spur the development of alternative energy \nsources and help free our dependence on foreign oil. It will protect \nworking Americans from the overarching reach of the alternative minimum \ntax and expand the child tax credit to help low-income working \nfamilies.\n  This bill also includes some very good news for Wyoming. It preserves \nthe sales tax deduction on taxable income. This will enable residents \nof Wyoming and other States that have no State income tax to deduct \ntheir State sales taxes when filing their Federal income tax returns. \nWithout it, Wyoming residents would shoulder an unfair share of the \nFederal tax burden.\n  This bill also enhances funding for rural schools. In States like \nWyoming where a large percentage of land is federally owned, local and \nState governments lose property tax revenues which are traditionally \nused to fund education and other local government functions. \nHistorically, the Federal Government shared timber sale produced \nreceipts with rural counties with Federal forests but timber receipts \nhave been inconsistent creating budget uncertainty for rural counties \nto provide for schools, roads, and other county needs. This tax \nextenders bill would reauthorize and expand the Secure Rural Schools \nand Community Self-Determination Act and provide additional support for \nWyoming schools.\n  The bill also includes important tax provisions that promote \ncharitable giving and reward the tireless volunteers who help rebuild \nour communities after natural disasters.\n  This legislation will encourage business research and development--\nthe twin engines that power our economy by spurring the development of \nnew technology and creating more jobs.\n  And for the first time, the Senate will establish health insurance \nparity between mental health coverage and medical surgery coverage.\n  The Presidential campaigns spend a lot of time engaged in endless \nvolleys about reforming health care, but my colleagues Senators Kennedy \nand Domenici--and I have actually done something about it. This is an \naccomplishment we have worked long and hard to achieve and I would like \nto take a moment and explain how important this is.\n  In 1996, Senator Domenici and the late Senator Paul Wellstone \nauthored a law that provided parity specifically for annual and \nlifetime limits between mental health coverage and medical surgical \ncoverage. Although it was a landmark accomplishment and an important \nstep forward, it was just the first step in the effort to address this \nissue.\n  Our bill will improve upon the 1996 law by including deductibles, \ncopayments, out-of-pocket expenses, out-of-network benefits, \ncoinsurance, covered hospital days, and covered outpatient visits. \nEssentially, it will require health insurance plans that offer coverage \nfor mental health to offer it in parity with their coverage for \nphysical health. It will help ensure Americans with serious mental \nillnesses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are treated fairly \nand can receive appropriate care. It will not mandate mental health \ncoverage, but it will improve coverage that is available to 113 million \nAmericans.\n  Mental health parity has been a long time coming. We are here today \nbecause my colleagues and I worked together with business, insurance \nand mental health groups for thousands of hours over many years to \nforge a common solution. Instead of fighting for the same old \npositions, where one side wins and the other loses, we worked hard to \nfind a third way to get it done.\n  I often say that on any given issue, people can agree on about 80 \npercent of it, and they will never agree on the other 20 percent. By \nfocusing on the 80 percent we could agree on, instead of the 20 percent \nwhere we'll never reach agreement, we found common ground on mental \nhealth parity and a third way that addressed the concerns of \nstakeholders.\n  The broader tax extenders package before us today isn't perfect. It \nis expensive and some of the temporary tax credits are offset with \npermanent tax increases, but it's a start. I think Americans are tired \nof watching Congress pit the ``perfect'' against the ``pretty good'' so \nthat both sides lose and nothing gets done. We have accomplished \nsomething today and makes today a good day.\n  Indeed, this bill is good news and I am happy to share it with the \npeople of Wyoming and all hard-working Americans.\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are reaching the end of a long \nroad. We are about to pass the compromise on the AMT patch, extenders, \nenergy tax incentives, and disaster relief.\n  I urge my friends in the House leadership to take a careful look at \nthe votes the Senate took this afternoon. Also, they should take a look \nat the White House policy statement. House Democrats will see $42 \nbillion of revenue raisers. House Republicans will see an unoffset AMT \npatch, extenders and other items.\n  There must be a majority to match the supermajority here.\n  I thank Chairman Baucus, Leader Reid, Leader McConnell, and their \nstaffs. I wish to single out Russ Sullivan, Bill Dauster, Cathy Koch, \nJosh Odinitz, Pat Bousilman, Tiffany Smith, Mary Baker, Bridget Mallon, \nand Ryan Abraham.\n\n[[Page S9259]]\n\n  I also wish to thank the Senate legislative team led by Jim Fransen. \nFinally, the crew at Joint Tax went above and beyond the call of duty. \nEd Kleinbard, Tom Barthold, and the Joint Tax team moved effectively \nand efficiently.\nMr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will support this measure, but I \ndo so reluctantly because in passing this bill the Senate is also \npassing its cost on to our children and grandchildren rather than \npaying for it. With the exception of the provisions relating to \nemergency disaster relief, the provisions of this measure were entirely \npredictable and as such could have been fully offset with spending \ncuts, revenue increases, or some combination of both. The emergency \ndisaster relief provisions are another matter, and I do not suggest \nthat they should have been offset, though it is always preferable to do \nso whenever possible. But the disaster relief provisions, which I \nstrongly support, represent a tiny fraction of the entire cost of this \nbill. The bulk of the cost stems from one provision, namely the so-\ncalled 1-year patch of the alternative minimum tax to ensure that tax \ndoes not expand its reach to millions of average families. The need for \nthis fix has been known for some time. Indeed, it has become almost an \nannual ritual to extend the AMT patch, and regrettably Congress has \ndone so without paying for the fix. Instead, we have just added the \ncost to the debt. This year, the 10-year cost of that provision will \namount to over $60 billion, every penny of it added to our already \nmassive debt.\n  As I have noted frequently on this floor, every dollar that we add to \nthe Federal debt is another dollar that we are forcing our children and \ngrandchildren to pay back in higher taxes or fewer government benefits. \nWhen the government in this generation chooses to spend on current \nconsumption and to accumulate debt for our children's generation to \npay, it does nothing less than rob our children of their own choices. \nWe make our choices to spend on our wants, but we saddle them with \ndebts that they must pay from their tax dollars and their hard work. \nAnd that is not right.\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, although long overdue, I am very \npleased that the Senate has come to an agreement to renew expiring tax \nprovisions critical to families across America, as well as to provide \nincentives for the production of clean energy and conservation that \ncould create 100,000 new jobs. As working families are struggling to \nput food on the table and gas in their cars, I am especially grateful \nthat the package assists the least fortunate among us by including a \nproposal to lower the income threshold for the refundable child tax \ncredit that Senator Lincoln and I have championed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this responsible and balanced \npackage. And, I would like to especially thank Senators Baucus and \nGrassley as well as their staffs for working days, nights, and weekends \nin forging this agreement. These two gentlemen exemplify the bipartisan \ntradition of this Senate and how this body can get its work done if \nMembers are willing to reach across the aisle to find some middle \nground.\n  Unfortunately, partisan gridlock too often ties the hands of even \nthese Senate stalwarts. Frankly, it is unconscionable that in what \ncould potentially be the closing hours of this Congress, we are only \nnow moving a step closer to enacting this legislation. At a time when \nrenewable energy projects are being mothballed because of this \nuncertainty and Americans are demanding action on energy policy, I \ncannot believe that we have been abrogating our duty to serve the \nAmerican people by our inaction on this time-sensitive issue. It seems \nto me that these tax extensions should have been the low-hanging fruit \nthat we could have done much sooner.\n  We could have unleashed sooner renewable energy projects creating \njobs, provided targeted tax relief to low-income working families \nstruggling to pay the high cost of food and fuel, encourage an infusion \nof capital into rural and urban communities, provide tax incentives for \nretail businesses looking to grow their business, and help keep the \njobs associated with film production within our borders.\n  This is occurring at a time when our economy teeters on the brink of \nrecession; when we have seen the collapse of a banking institution \nfounded in 1850; when the U.S. government has seen no other way but to \ntake over and buy the assets of other major financial institutions; \nwhen unemployment surged to 6.1 percent last month the highest rate \nsince 2003; when gasoline at the pump is near $4 a gallon; when oil \ncosts are have risen to over $120 per barrel; and when foreclosures \nhave hit historic level, do we really want to say that we can't extend \na renewable energy tax credit that caused 45 percent growth in wind \nenergy production last year and that we can't adopt energy efficiency \ntax credits that create necessary incentives to reduce energy demand?\n  Consider the economic impact of inaction. Dr. Mark Cooper of the \nConsumer Federation of America estimates that from 2002 to 2008 annual \nhousehold expenditures on energy increased from about $2600 to an \nastonishing $5300. In my state of Maine, where 80 percent of households \nuse heating oil to get through winter, it is going to be even worse.\n  Last year at this time, heating oil prices were at a challenging \n$2.70 a gallon--for a Mainer who on average uses 850 gallons of oil \nthat is $2,295. With current prices at $3.80 per gallon, the cost per \nMainer just to stay warm will be $3230, and that is not even \nconsidering gasoline costs. That is the difference between a burden and \na crisis.\n  Now is not the time to allow energy efficiency tax incentives and the \nrenewable production tax credit to expire. But that is what we are \ndoing unless we pass this bipartisan package today. Energy efficiency \nis by far the most effective investment that our country can make to \naddress the calamity of an absent energy policy. It constitutes a \ndereliction of duty if Congress allows energy efficiency tax credits to \nexpire. In fact, some tax credits already have expired, and as a \nresult, there are currently no incentives to purchase efficient \nfurnaces. At a time when Americans are worried about paying heating \nbills this winter, we must provide the assistance to encourage \ninvestment in energy efficient products that will reduce our collective \ndemand for energy, and save Americans money.\n  Yet, we have jettisoned a $300 tax credit to purchase a high \nefficiency oil furnace, which would produce more than $430 in annual \nsavings for an average home--according to calculations based on \nDepartment of Energy data and recent home heating prices. We have \nsidelined an extension of a tax credit for highly efficient natural gas \nfurnaces that would save an individual $100 per year. However, this tax \ncredit ended at the beginning of this year--when oil prices began their \nhistoric rise.\n  And for businesses that are competing against countries that \nsubsidize oil, the situation is untenable. Earlier this summer, \nKatahdin Paper Company in my state announced that the cost of oil used \nto operate its boilers has caused the company to consider closing the \nmill's doors. Talks are under way to find alternative solutions to re-\nstart the mill's operations and revive its 208 jobs, but it is \nundeniable that these jobs hang in the balance because of unprecedented \nenergy costs.\n  One remedy would be to create more renewable energy jobs that would \nhelp right a listless economy and invest in a secure energy future. \nIndeed, more than 100,000 Americans could have been put to work this \nyear if clean energy production tax credits had been extended.\n  We could have already unleashed renewable energy projects creating \njobs, but instead, projects currently underway may soon be mothballed. \nClean energy incentives for energy efficient buildings, appliances, and \nother technologies, as well as additional funding for weatherizing \nhomes, would similarly serve to stimulate economic activity, reduce \nresidential energy costs, and generate new manufacturing and \nconstruction jobs. It is irresponsible to allow a bright spot in our \neconomy, the renewable energy industry and energy efficiency \nindustries, to falter, when the output of these industries is so \nessential to the future of this country.\n  Extending these expiring clean energy tax credits will ensure a \nstronger, more stable environment for new investments and ensure \ncontinued robust growth in a bright spot in an otherwise slowing \neconomy. I am encouraged by\n\n[[Page S9260]]\n\nthe bipartisan agreement that is before us today. We must not lose yet \nanother opportunity to raise the bar for future domestic energy systems \nand energy efficiencies, benefiting our economy, our health, our \nenvironment, and our national security. I hope that the House of \nRepresentatives will quickly take up and pass this package.\n  Some may argue this is an election year and we must lower our \nexpectations for getting things accomplished. I couldn't disagree more. \nAnd I met a remarkable woman from Maine earlier this year who couldn't \ndisagree more--because time is quickly running out on this Congress to \ntake necessary steps to help Americans like her. She told me she had \nthree jobs--the first to pay for the mortgage, the second to pay for \nheating oil, and the third to pay for gas to be able to drive to her \nother two jobs and this was back in April.\n  Solving this crisis isn't about party labels. It isn't about \nRepublicans or Democrats--or red states or blue states. It is about \nwhat is good for America, and what unites us as Americans under the \nred, white, and blue. We must move in that direction as a country.\n  But, there is much more in this package beyond energy tax incentives. \nThe legislation before us will extend the New Markets Tax Credit \nthrough 2009. Based on the New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act of \n2007, which I introduced with Senator Rockefeller, this provision will \nhelp to ensure that investment dollars continue to flow to underserved \ncommunities.\n  Additionally, the tax extenders package will enable retailers who own \ntheir properties to depreciate over 15 years, instead of 39 years, \nimprovements to those structures. Based on my legislation, this Main \nStreet-friendly provision levels the playing field between owner-\noccupied and leased retail space and will help to generate additional \nconstruction and renovations to stores nationwide by lowering the cost \nof capital in a tightening credit market.\n  Also included is a provision that will allow companies to claim \naccelerated depreciation for the purchase of recycling equipment. This \nprovision is based on my Recycling Investment Saves Energy, RISE, Act \nand will save energy, create jobs, strengthen local recycling programs, \nand improve the quantity and quality of recycled materials.\n  So as you can see, this package is more than just extending expiring \ntax provisions. This legislation will create jobs, move us closer to \nenergy independence, encourage investment in low-income communities, \nand provide much-needed relief to low-income families struggling to \nmeet just their basic needs.\n  I would hope that when we finally adjourn, we can say we extended \nthis critical tax relief. I would also hope that at the beginning of \nnext year, when a new Congress is sworn in, we will commit ourselves to \nserving those who have entrusted us with their votes, where reaching \nacross the aisle is the norm, not the exception--where looking for \nconsensus is viewed as the answer, not an aberration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Members, we are going \nto shortly have our last vote of the evening. The work we have \naccomplished today is historic. This is the ninth time we voted on \nrenewing and extending the renewable tax credits. We finally did it.\n  We are going to send over to the House a package that is remarkably \ngood, a 2-year extension of the business tax extensions that are so \nnecessary. For the first time in a long time, it is not 1 year, it is 2 \nyears. The business community thinks this is extremely important, as do \nI.\n  As I said earlier this morning, I hope the House accepts what we do. \nI do my very best to get along with the House, Democrats and \nRepublicans. But everyone should understand we have had a very \ndifficult time getting to the point where we are, in passing the final \nversion of this bill. If the House does not pass this, the full \nresponsibility of not passing this is theirs, not ours.\n  Now, people may say: Well, we want all the tax credits paid for. But \nI say to my friends in the House, AMT is not going to be paid for. Much \nof what we do around here is not paid for. It is nothing I necessarily \nlike. But are we asking that the war be paid for? I ask what is more \nimportant, to extend these tax credits for 2 years and bring about some \nstability in the business community or have, out of the blue, the House \ntelling us that everything has to be paid for? AMT is not going to be \npaid for. So how do they pick and choose what is right to be paid for?\n  So I would hope everyone understands the importance of this \nlegislation, and all 100 Senators, if you would be good enough to call \nyour counterparts in the House and tell them--I think if they had a \nvote in the House on our passage, it would pass overwhelmingly. I hope \nthat can be arranged.\n  I would hope my friends will do that. We have not accomplished much \nthis work period. That is an understatement. This would be an \naccomplishment for us. I hope we can do that.\n  Tomorrow we are going to come in and have morning business. We are \nmoving to proceed to the Coburn matter. That is an effort so we have \nsomething on the floor to proceed to. We are not going to do anything \non that piece of legislation. We are going to pass a few of the things \ntonight, I think 4. That will be 5 things we have passed when we are \ndone. There are still 29 to go.\n  But tomorrow I hope Senators would take this opportunity, when we \nhave a relatively free day, to come in and perhaps give statements \nabout those Senators who are retiring and whatever else you wish to \ntalk about.\n  Now, when we get things from the House, we will move to those as \nquickly as we can. The House, it is my understanding, is filing and \ngoing to order both tonight, filing and doing the order on the CR. We \nshould get that maybe tomorrow, maybe Thursday. They are then going to \ndo a stimulus. We will see what happens with that, an economic recovery \npackage.\n  As we speak, we are trying to work something out on this financial \ncrisis facing this country. Democrats and Republicans had some concern \nabout this. I hope we can work to get this done. I am not giving a \npolitical speech here, but I am giving a factual speech the best I can.\n  None of us are happy about the situation we are in. I can direct \nblame just as well, and sometimes better, than a lot of people as to \nwhy we are here. But we are here. We have to figure out some way to \nmove beyond where we are. I would hope the White House is listening. I \nwould hope the Republicans are listening and Democrats are listening \nbecause a lot depends on what we do, and we have to do it right. I am \nnot asking anyone to do anything fast; we have to do it right. Maybe we \ncan do both, do it fast and do it right.\n  So there are meetings going on tomorrow that will hopefully help move \nus down the road. I got some good news in the last hour or so, that it \nappears Senator McCain is going to come out for this. It would be a \ntremendous help if he would do this. As you know, Senator Obama has \ncome out for this package, with basically the same thing that--I think \nhe and McCain are pretty well in line with this. Some of the statements \ncoming out of the McCain camp last night were not very good, but they \nhave changed over the day. I certainly hope that is the case.\n  So we all want to work together. We want to do the best we can to \nmove this forward. This week those are the things we need to do before \nwe leave. I have talked about them on a number of occasions. We have to \ntry to do something on economic stimulus. That is still a jump ball. \nThe continuing resolution is pretty well, from our perspective, going \nto be filed tonight. We have been fortunate to work with Congressman \nObey. The latest word I got is that the Defense appropriations bill is \ngoing to be in the CR. That is extremely important.\n  We all know what is finally in it. It is not loaded down with a lot \nof extraneous material. Then we are going to work on the economic \nrecovery package and try to make sure we have a vote on that sometime \nbefore we leave.\n  We got good news today. The Defense authorization conference has been \ncompleted. We are going to finish that before we leave. If it takes a \nnumber of cloture votes, then we will have to do it. But it is \nsomething that has been worked on long and hard. We have been through \nthat.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the distinguished leader yield? I hope to have a \nmeeting\n\n[[Page S9261]]\n\nin the Vice President's Office with my Republican colleagues to explain \nthe status of that bill. I think the distinguished chairman has set up \na similar meeting for his colleagues.\n  Mr. REID. I think I have covered everything we need to do before we \nleave. Again, I would say it is not a question of us leaving on a given \nday or time, but it is a question of being able to complete our work \nbefore we go, and we have an opportunity to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a couple of words underlying what the \nleader said in his remarks. These are not only for our membership but \nalso for the other body.\n  The underlying bill has mental health parity in it. The underlying \nbill is also 2-year extenders. We are wrapped around the axle too much \nin this body by having actual extenders every year. This is 2 years.\n  Third, this is a compromise between both bodies. They want everything \npaid for, this body does not. It is a compromise in the middle. For \nthose reasons, I very much hope the other body supports this measure we \nare about to adopt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the passage of the bill, as \namended.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, while I think most of us have been focused \non H.R. 6049, as amended by the Senate, primarily on the tax extenders \nand some of the energy tax credits and provisions that we believe are \ncritically important to our economy and to the American business sector \nthat is, by any measure, having difficulty at the moment, something is \nalso in this legislation that is phenomenally important to timber-\ndependent school districts throughout the United States but dominantly \nin the Pacific Northwest. That is a provision called the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Program.\n\n  Now, if I were in Oregon, I would call it the Wyden-Craig bill. If I \nam in Idaho, I call it the Craig-Wyden bill. It is legislation that \nboth Senator Wyden and I, a good number of years ago, fashioned when I \nwas chairing the Forestry and Public Lands Subcommittee and he was my \nranking member, when we came to the Senate and said we have the rural \nschools of our timber-dependent communities and counties in crisis.\n  Through the decade of the 1990s, we saw a dramatic reduction in the \nallowable cut of timber on our public land forests for a variety of \nreasons. As a result, a 1908 policy, established by Gifford Pinchot and \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt, said if we are going to create these forest \npreserves, we have to connect the communities of interest with them. By \nthat, I do not mean the Sierra Club. I mean that little community \nsitting out in the forest that is trying to make a living off our \nforests and to supply to its county its roads and bridges and to its \ncitizens its schools. We will give them a piece of the stumpage or the \nfee the Federal Government is paid by a private logging company to cut \nthat tree and turn it into lumber.\n  Down through the years, we did just that. We financed many of our \ncounties and many of our schools in these dependent communities largely \nwith the stumpage fee from public timber. In some counties, it was 50 \nor 60 percent of the county budget. In certain counties of Oregon, in \nthe O lands of Oregon, it was oftentimes the near whole school budget \nand oftentimes a very large chunk of the county budget.\n  Well, when that timber went away, for a lot of different reasons, \nmost of them environmental, so went the money. We saw that as a crisis \nin our school districts, looked at it, evaluated it, established a \nformula, came to the Senate, and said: We have to help these school \ndistricts that do not have fee land. They do not have private property \nto tax. They are all public lands.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I have counties in my State that are \nlarger than your entire State, Mr. President, and most of them are 60 \nor 70 percent public lands. They don't pay taxes, but they produce \nproduct. We, a long time ago, nearly 100 years ago, decided that \nproduct the Government was selling ought to pay something back to the \ncommunities. So we established this legislation, Craig-Wyden. It lived \nits life. It secured our schools and our communities. It allowed some \nself-determination. It brought together regional advisory groups, issue \ngroups who were warring amongst each other, and it brought common cause \nto the public concern on our national forested lands. It was highly \nsuccessful, but it expired.\n  In a time of deficits and financial difficulties and finding all of \nthe needed resources we need for our Government, it became very \ndifficult to refinance, to reauthorize this program. I have school \ndistricts that were laying off essential educators, canceling programs \nthat would provide for the quality education of the students simply \nbecause we could not pass this legislation.\n  Today, we passed the legislation. Today, we reauthorized, for a \nperiod of up to 4 years, this program. It is vastly important to \nhundreds of school districts across the Nation. When I say the Pacific \nNorthwest--Idaho, Oregon, and Washington--it is Montana, it is \nCalifornia--northern California tremendously--it is Mississippi. I \nsuspect\n\n[[Page S9262]]\n\nthere are a few school districts in the State of Colorado and other \nplaces that are highly dependent upon this particular piece of \nlegislation.\n  So I am here this evening to thank my colleagues for being sensitive \nto these public land-bound counties that simply do not have fee land to \nfinance their essential needs--roads, bridges, schools--and they cannot \nask the other taxpayers to assume their burden outside the counties \nwithin the State.\n  My State anticipated the difficulty of reauthorizing and created some \ncontingency, but still it would not have funded the full school \nprogram. So tonight we have acted and sent a very clear message to \nthese counties, to these schools that we take educating the young \npeople of these school districts as a high priority, that we see the \nvitality of these communities as extremely important.\n  So tonight, in section 601, the Secure Rural Schools and Community \nSelf-Determination Program, we have reauthorized Craig-Wyden. I thank \nmy colleagues for allowing that to happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, something happened on the floor of the \nSenate moments ago which was a long time in the making. We passed a \nbill, the mental health parity bill, that has been debated in this \nChamber for 10 years or more.\n  The reason I come to the floor today, after its passage, is to note \none of the Members of the Senate who was an inspiration for this bill. \nHis name was Paul Wellstone. Six years ago, he died in a plane crash, \nrunning for election in the State of Minnesota. He used to sit in the \nback row over here and at a corner desk. He had an especially long cord \nfor his microphone, and he used to wander all up and down the aisle \ntalking. It was a sight to behold--a short, little fellow, and because \nof his passion for college wrestling, his back was all beat up and he \nkind of hobbled around. But he had a heart of gold, and he was one of \nthese people you loved to be serving with because he brought out the \nbest in you.\n\n  The last time I ever saw him was here in the well of the Senate on \nthe night of the vote authorizing the war in Iraq. He was one of 23 of \nus who voted against it.\n  I knew he was going home to Minnesota to face a tough election, and I \nsaid to him: I hope this doesn't cost you the election, Paul.\n  He said: It is all right if it does. This is what I believe. This is \nwhat Minnesota expects of me. And whatever happens, I am all right.\n  That was the last conversation I had with him. Within days, he died \nin a plane crash.\n  When we returned after a memorial service and a lot of heartfelt \nexpressions of sympathy for him and his wife Sheila, who died, as well \nas members of their staff, there was always a question about, what is a \nfitting tribute to Paul Wellstone for a great, inspiring legislative \ncareer? Those of us who knew him knew the last thing in the world he \nwould ever want is a statue or a bridge named after him or a post \noffice--just not the kind of thing that would mean anything to Paul. \nBut this bill, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health \nParity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, is the tribute Paul Wellstone \nwould have wanted.\n  I thank Senator Pete Domenici, who was his partner in this effort for \nthis mental health parity bill, for agreeing to allow Paul Wellstone's \nname to be the lead name on this legislation. It will be the Wellstone-\nDomenici bill for all of us, and both of them deserve praise for all \nthe work they did. But when Pete Domenici said: Put his name first, it \nmeant a lot to many of us. This was the fitting tribute we were hoping \nfor for Paul Wellstone.\n  What does it mean? It means for Paul Wellstone's family and the \nfamilies of millions of Americans that mental health will now be \ntreated differently in their health insurance plan. For the longest \ntime, we have languished in ignorance over mental health. We have fed \nour prejudices instead of learning about this illness. We have treated \nit not as an illness but a curse, and we have basically said that we \nofficially give up on finding cures for mental illness.\n  That is just plain wrong on every count. Mental illness is an \nillness. For the vast majority of Americans, it is a curable illness. \nWhat those suffering from mental illness need is professional \nassistance and the right medication, and many of them will lead \nabsolutely normal, happy, productive lives. But the health insurance \ncompanies refused to cover mental illness--most of them--so many people \nwith family members who were suffering from mental illness had no place \nto turn, and many times they could not afford the medications, and many \ntimes their lives were compromised as a result.\n  Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici said a long time ago that is just \nunfair and America is a better place. Thanks to their hard work and \ninspiration, thanks to the hard work of Teddy Kennedy, who should have \nbeen here today voting for it--his name belongs in this pantheon as \nwell when it comes to mental health parity--Tom Harkin, and Max Baucus, \nwho put this in this package to make sure it passed--I just want to say \nit is a great day for America, a great day for us to give so many \nmillions of Americans who struggle with mental illness or have a member \nof their family struggling with mental illness a fighting chance. That \nis what this gives them: a fighting chance that their health insurance \npolicies will cover this, for the first time in many instances. It is \nlong overdue, and this tribute to Paul Wellstone is long overdue. But 6 \nyears after he left this Chamber, 6 years after he died, we finally \ngave the right tribute to a great man who served us so well.\n  Mr. President, today is an important day for the U.S. Senate and the \nNation.\n  With the passage of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental \nHealth Parity and Addiction Equity Act, the Senate not only \nacknowledges the struggle for civil rights in our country, but also the \nfight of one man never neglected that struggle.\n\n[[Page S9263]]\n\n  In 1992, the late Senator Paul Wellstone worked with Senator Pete \nDomenici to introduce the Mental Health Parity Act to correct the \nunfair burden placed on American families living with mental illness \nwithout access to mental health services.\n  For his entire public service career, our friend Paul fought \nvaliantly for equal rights for all, regardless of their race, religion, \nsocioeconomic status, or health status. He fought for parity as he \nfought for all civil rights--he fought to end discrimination against \npeople with mental illness and addiction in insurance coverage.\n  For over a decade, the Wellstone name has been synonymous with the \nDemocratic effort to push mental health parity.\n  Finally, with the passage of mental health parity legislation, we are \nassuring millions of Americans that mental illness deserves equal \ntreatment as physical illness.\n  But we also honor our dear friend and his lifelong commitment to \nseeing parity enacted.\n  I only wish that Paul Wellstone could have lived to see this day.\n  Although Paul himself could not be here, his memory lives on in his \ntwo sons, David and Mark.\n  Paul would be proud of his sons and the great work of Wellstone \nAction, a national center for training and leadership development for \nthe progressive movement with a mission to honor the legacy of Paul and \nSheila Wellstone by continuing their great work.\n  And Paul would be proud of all of us for moving this important bill \nforward.\n  As Paul said, ``Politics isn't about big money or power games; it's \nabout the improvement of people's lives.''\n  I am pleased to support this bill, in honor of Paul and Sheila, and \nthe millions of people living with mental illness whose lives will \nhopefully be improved by its enactment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have David Wellstone's written comments \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Statement for the Record in Support of the Passage of the Paul \n Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity \n                              Act of 2008\n\n       I am pleased to speak in support of the Paul Wellstone and \n     Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act \n     of 2008. This legislation is critically important to the \n     future of health care, and it is also very close to my heart. \n     During his time in the Senate, my father never stopped \n     fighting for fairness in coverage and treatment of mental \n     illness and substance use disorders. My family and I are \n     grateful for the effort in the Senate and the House to pay \n     tribute to my father's legacy by naming the bill after him \n     and his close colleague, Sen. Pete Domenici.\n       My brother and I founded Wellstone Action to carry on my \n     father's work, and through this organization, thousands of \n     people are trained each year to run for office and to develop \n     grassroots skills in organizing and leadership. But nothing \n     represents my father's passion and commitment more than his \n     work to pass legislation that would end the discrimination \n     against those with mental illness and substance use \n     disorders. This legislation is a major achievement and will \n     do so much to end that discrimination.\n       For some time, I have been coming to Washington to speak on \n     behalf of this legislation, but the fight for parity has a \n     long history with many milestones: the 1996 federal law; the \n     1999 Executive Order that gave federal employees mental \n     health and addiction parity benefits; the many successes at \n     the state level to strengthen their parity laws; the times \n     that Congress came very close to passing the expansion of the \n     federal law; and the endorsement by President Bush in 2002. \n     For my father, these milestones were very personal. His \n     dedication stemmed from his personal observations of the \n     terrible conditions in psychiatric institutions when his \n     brother was hospitalized in the 1950s. These conditions, and \n     the eventual catastrophic financial toll that my grandparents \n     had to bear, inspired my father to do everything he could to \n     make things right for those in similar circumstances.\n       The legislation that my father and Sen. Domenici passed in \n     1996 was groundbreaking and important, for it established in \n     law an important first principle of parity: that those with \n     mental illness should not be discriminated against in \n     insurance coverage. But my father knew that it was not \n     enough, and that is why this legislation is so necessary. It \n     is the critically important next step toward ending the \n     persistent discrimination against people who suffer from \n     mental illness and addiction.\n       In the Senate, the tireless leadership of Senator Edward \n     Kennedy and Senator Pete Domenici on this effort has been \n     extraordinary, especially with their efforts to bring \n     together the coalition of business and advocates to work to \n     get this bill completed. They and the Senate Leadership, \n     especially Senator Harry Reid and Senator Dick Durbin, should \n     be proud of their efforts to make this legislation one that \n     will strongly protect the needs of millions of Americans who \n     have mental illness and substance use disorders. In the \n     Senate, the efforts by Senator Chris Dodd, Senator Tom \n     Harkin, Senator Max Baucus, Senator Barbara Boxer, and \n     Senator Amy Klobuchar also did so much to bring this bill to \n     final passage. And, as I know well, nothing is accomplished \n     without the unflagging commitment of hundreds of dedicated \n     staff and advocates who have worked so hard to right the \n     wrong of discrimination that has existed for so long in our \n     country. I also want to extend my deep gratitude to former \n     First Lady Rosalynn Carter for her many years of leadership \n     on this issue and many other problems related to mental \n     illness. She and my father worked closely together on parity \n     for many years, and he was always grateful for her support \n     and leadership.\n       We know that mental illness is a real, painful, and \n     sometimes fatal disease. It is also a treatable disease. My \n     father used to say that the gap between what we know and what \n     we do is lethal. Available medications and psychological \n     treatments, alone or in combination, can help most people who \n     suffer from mental illness and addiction. But without \n     adequate treatment, these illnesses can continue or worsen in \n     severity. Suicide is the third leading cause of death of \n     young people in the U.S. Each year, 32,000 Americans take \n     their lives, hundreds of thousands attempt to do so, and in \n     90 percent of these situations, the cause is untreated mental \n     illness. This legislation will save lives. It will also go a \n     long way toward ending the stigma that is behind the \n     discrimination.\n       People have asked me why I am so involved in this issue. My \n     first response is, ``Because of my father, of course''. I \n     loved him and I miss him, and I have learned that many others \n     here in Washington and throughout the country miss him too, \n     especially his courage and his compassion. He fought hard for \n     those who had no voice, and he had a strong personal \n     commitment to helping those with mental illness and \n     addiction. After he died, Congressional members honored him \n     and my family by promising to name the parity bill after him, \n     and this meant a great deal to my family. But I also knew the \n     kind of man my father was, and the kind of parity bill he \n     would have wanted finally passed into law, and I wanted to \n     help ensure that the final bill was one worthy of his name. \n     The safeguards for patients that have been included in this \n     final bill, such as protections of stronger state laws, out \n     of network benefits, oversight of diagnosis coverage, and \n     transparency of medical necessity, are essential to a strong \n     law. This Congress can be remembered as the one that had the \n     courage and leadership to pass a strong parity bill, one \n     where everyone's voices had a chance to be heard.\n       I, along with millions of Americans, look forward to the \n     day when people with mental illness and substance use \n     disorder receive decent, humane, and timely care. The passage \n     of the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity \n     and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 brings us closer to this \n     day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9263-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9263-S9265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is a hard week around here because we \nare being asked to consider something that is historic. This question \nof bailing out financial institutions because of a struggling economy \nhas called into question a lot of very basics about the way we govern \nthis Nation.\n  I think most people understand the economy is in trouble. For working \nfamilies, they have known it a long time. They have been falling behind \nfor 8 years. Their incomes do not keep up with the cost of living. The \nexpenses they face grow dramatically, whether we are talking about \nmortgage payments, utility bills, groceries or gasoline or health care \ncosts. They know the economy is weak. No matter how hard they work, \nthey cannot keep up with it. They are the ones who have been wondering \nwhen Congress was going to understand this and do something about it.\n  It took a tragedy in another sector of the economy for Congress to \nact, and that tragedy is in the credit institutions. You see, what \nhappened to the credit institutions in America was totally avoidable. \nWhat happened was we created a parallel credit operation, parallel to \nthe banks and other regulated institutions--investment banks and other \nWall Street entities--which had basically no rules. They played by \ntheir own rules. They were not regulated. There was no Government \noversight, very little transparency. They loaned money in ways and with \nterms that were not publicly disclosed on a regular basis.\n  The attitude for the longest time around Washington was: Keep your \nhands off of them. These are the dynamos of capitalism. Give them a \nchance.\n\n[[Page S9264]]\n\nThey will just create wealth and opportunity in every direction. Well, \nthat sounds too good to be true, and it turned out it was. They started \nmaking loans that were careless, negligent, and wrong.\n  They started loaning money, for example, on mortgages to people under \nterms that were unreasonable, to people who could not afford them in \nsome instances, and started collapsing. They just counted on the fact \nthat the default rate would be low when it came to mortgages, even if \nthe mortgage was full of tricks and traps. They counted on the fact \nthat real estate would always appreciate in value. Eventually, the \nhouse of cards tumbled and they ended up holding the mortgage \nsecurities and other mortgages that were worthless. Nobody wants to buy \nthem. They are called illiquid assets.\n  As the portfolios of these investment banks got loaded up with \nworthless securities and paper, they started struggling to survive. \nSome of them didn't. Bear Stearns was about to go out of business, and \nthe Federal Government stepped in. This administration said: We will \nkeep you going. Lehman Brothers was about to go out of business, and \nthey said: We won't step in. But for the portion rescued by Barclays, \nthousands of jobs were lost.\n  I think the net result of this is very clear. First, what we are \nfacing today was avoidable. If we had not bought into the economic \nphilosophy of those who argued that regulation is inherently evil, we \ncould have avoided some of these mistakes and tragedies. But we didn't. \nVoices in the Senate, like former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, argued \nwith vigor: Get out of the way. Capitalism will work just fine. All the \nGovernment can do is mess it up.\n  Well, we saw what happened. In the last several weeks, some of the \ngiants of Wall Street and some of the major institutions in Washington \nhave either been compromised or perished. In some instances, the \nFederal Government stepped in. In stepping in, it has created new \nobligations for our Government and our taxpayers.\n  I think this chart I put together is fairly close to what we are \nfacing. The current national debt of the United States of America is \n$9.73 trillion. That represents the accumulated debt of every \nadministration in the history of the United States, from George \nWashington through George W. Bush. That is $9.73 trillion.\n  Look what happened in the last several weeks: First, we had the \nTreasury Secretary step in and say that we are going to keep Bear \nStearns afloat. So they did that by allocating some $30 billion. Then \nthey came in and said: We are going to stand behind--guarantee--the \nmortgages being held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the tune of $5.3 \ntrillion.\n  Admittedly, there are security and collateral behind these, but we \nare on the hook now for $5.3 trillion.\n  AIG, the biggest insurance company in America, was about to go out of \nbusiness. It would have been catastrophic. We stepped in and, for $80 \nbillion, said we would stand behind them and purchase a share of AIG \nand expect to be paid back. I hope we are.\n  Money market insurance, money market mutual funds are those cash \noptions for people who don't want to invest in securities and, at some \npoint last week they could not pay a dollar on a dollar given to them. \nSo we stepped in to provide insurance for them, an exposure of $3.35 \ntrillion. Then comes President Bush's bailout plan that Secretary \nPaulson brought to us, to the tune of $700 billion.\n  So in the last several weeks, we now have a new exposure to taxpayers \nof this country, a liability of $9.46 trillion. The accumulated debt of \nAmerica, from its beginning to today is $9.73 trillion, and the new \nexposure is $9.46 trillion. This is a dramatic and, in many ways, \ntroubling scenario that has unfolded.\n  Lack of regulation, lack of accountability, lack of transparency led \nto terrible decisions based on greed and on the fact that no one was \nlooking. Many people got rich in the process. Some of them went away \nwith millions of dollars in income as executives, and others from the \ninvestments that did pay off, and some with golden parachutes did quite \nwell.\n  Most of the American taxpayers didn't realize any gains from that, \nbut now they are on the hook for this proposal of $700 billion. What \ndoes that come out to for every man, woman, and child? It is $2,300 in \nnew liability that every man, woman, and child in America will have as \na result of the Bush bailout proposal.\n  Many of us have serious problems with the President's bailout \nproposal. I don't question that we need to do something and do it in an \nexpeditious way. But we should do as much as we need to do and not \nmore. We should make certain we are not subsidizing the compensation of \nexecutives of these failed companies. These men and women who ran these \ncompanies into the ground, who bought these rotten portfolios we are \nnow rescuing, don't deserve a gold watch or a million dollars as they \nleave the office. Certainly, the taxpayers should not have to pay it. \nThat is No. 1.\n  Executive compensation ought to be off the table. If they want to \nplay with taxpayer money, let them be restrained and restricted in \nterms of their income to the highest salary paid in the Federal \nGovernment, which is a generous $400,000. That is enough, nothing \nmore--not a million-dollar going-away gift for incompetent and failed \ncorporate executives.\n  Secondly, we have to make sure whatever we do is not torn apart by \nconflicts of interest. Whatever allocation of money is given to the \nTreasury Department is going to be spent on companies, and we have to \nmake certain it doesn't go to buddies and friends but to the companies \nthat can make a difference in the economy.\n  When the Treasury Secretary gave us this three-page bill asking for \n$700 billion, he specifically said none of the decisions or actions \ntaken under that bill would be subject to review by any court in \nAmerica, any administrative agency, and the rules he would draw up for \nthe conduct of this activity would not be subject to the ordinary \ncourse of business and laws of America. I am sorry. I will never vote \nfor that. I cannot.\n  How can the Secretary of the Treasury be above the law? Why wouldn't \nhe be held accountable for conflicts of interest?\n  I believe Henry Paulson is an honorable man. I don't think he is out \nto do anything wrong. But what of those who work for him? There can be \na lot of people spending taxpayer dollars. I want them to know they are \nheld to the same standards of ethical and legal conduct as anybody \ndoing business or anybody involved in our Government. So that is \nsomething I insist on.\n  The third point I want to make is this: If we are going to come to \nthe rescue of some of these companies and buy their illiquid assets \nthat nobody wants to buy--if the taxpayers are going to put that money \non the line, I want them protected. If those companies survive and \nsucceed, the American taxpayers should reap at least some of the \nprofits. That is not unreasonable. Why should we be left holding the \nbag for $700 million for their mistakes, and when they get well, they \nwill basically stand around and complain about Government getting in \ntheir way again. I would insist on that as well.\n  The other element is one that I authored and is included in both the \nHouse and Senate versions of the Democratic alternatives to the Bush \nbailout. This really goes to the heart of it. This economic mess \nstarted because of subprime mortgages--mortgages that were basically \npredatory lending, where people were being taken advantage of. We see \nwhat has happened. People were drawn into mortgages they could not pay, \nand they are about to lose their homes. Foreclosures are at the highest \nlevel since the Great Depression.\n  If we are going to get this economy moving forward again--and we \nshould do it quickly--we have to go to the heart of the problem. The \nrot at the bottom of the pyramid is foreclosures. As long as mortgages \nare being foreclosed in record numbers, people will not only lose their \nhomes, but every one of us suffers. I recently had an appraisal on my \nhome in Springfield, and the value is down 20 percent. We made our \npayments. We didn't do anything wrong. That is the real estate market \nin Springfield, IL. That is what is affecting homes across America. \nUntil we staunch the bleeding of this mortgage foreclosure crisis, I am \nafraid we are not going to get well.\n\n  One of the provisions in this bill relates to bankruptcy. It says if \nsomeone owns a home and goes into bankruptcy\n\n[[Page S9265]]\n\nfacing foreclosure, the Bankruptcy Court has the right to rewrite the \nterms of the mortgage so if it is possible, that person can stay in \ntheir home.\n  This is not a radical idea. It applies now to all second homes, \nvacation homes, farms, and ranches--just not your primary residence, \nfor no good reason. It should apply. If we put this provision in the \nlaw, trust me, those institutions that are issuing the mortgages are \ngoing to be much more open to renegotiating the terms and making them \nmore reasonable. Unless we put it in, they will continue to say let \nthat homeowner lose their home. That is an outcome that doesn't help \nanyone.\n  I hope we can see a balanced package come through when this is all \nover. I hope we can see some equity and fairness for the taxpayers in \nthis country. Lord knows, they have paid enough. To ask them to pay \nanother $2,300 deeper into our national debt is unreasonable if we \ndon't have safeguards to stop excessive executive compensation, to give \nthe taxpayers the upside of these businesses, if they do get well; to \nmake sure that we police against conflicts of interest and wasting of \ntaxpayer dollars and, finally, make sure we do something about the \nhomeowners who are at the root cause of the economic downturn we are \nnow facing.\n  We need to do it and do it quickly. I know banks will hate this \nprovision on bankruptcy. They have made up so many stories about what \nthis will do to them. They talk about interest rates going up on \nmortgages across the board. But there was an analysis done by Adam \nLevitin, a Georgetown law professor. He said:\n\n       Taken as a whole, our analysis of the current and \n     historical data suggests that permitting bankruptcy \n     modification of mortgages would have no or little impact on \n     mortgage markets.\n\n  I agree. It is just a smokescreen. The same banks that want to be \nbailed out don't want to be held accountable. They created this mess, \nand they want to continue to profit from it. They want the taxpayers to \nsubsidize it, and they don't want to step up to the table and work with \nfamilies and homeowners to keep them in their homes.\n  That is not the way we do business in America. I hope we have learned \na bitter lesson. Those who were champions of deregulation--John McCain \nused to talk about that being his mantra. He was opposed to regulation. \nHe was all for Senator Phil Gramm's attitude toward keeping your hands \noff the economy. Look where it brought us today: the mess that we face.\n  In just a matter of a couple weeks we will see an exposure of \nliability to our Federal Government almost equal to the combined \nnational debt accumulated in the United States since its inception. \nThat is poor management. It reflects poor thinking. It reflects an \neconomic philosophy that needs to be tossed onto the dustbin of \nhistory.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today concerned about the current \ncrisis in our financial markets and the state of our economy. I am also \nconcerned about the course that is being laid out by both the \nadministration and the congressional leadership.\n  Specifically, I fear that the magnitude of what we are undertaking is \nbeing swallowed by the concerns of an election campaign and, quite \nfrankly, I don't believe that is any way to govern. Of course, the \nsense of urgency being expressed by my colleagues is warranted given \nthe circumstances.\n  In the last year, price increases, particularly in food and energy, \nhave exceeded our income growth. The unemployment rates have edged up. \nAlready we have lost some 700,000 jobs. Obviously, the fallout was \nparticularly severe in the housing sector. But it should be noted that \nsome of the slowdown is due to the aging of the economic expansion and \nthe completion of the capital investment spurred by the 2001 and 2003 \ntax cuts. Clearly, these need to be renewed and expanded to encourage \ngrowth in the economy at large.\n  However, we are dealing with more than a sputtering in our economy. \nLosses on mortgage-backed securities, coupled with the loss of \nconfidence in the financial sector, threaten to turn a predictable \neconomic slowdown into something far worse. Indeed, we are in the grips \nof a financial panic of monumental proportions.\n  The sharp decline in confidence has led to runs on many institutions, \nmost apparently among our investment banks that operated largely on \nborrowed money at high rates of leverage. Most of these institutions \nhave either sought merger partners or are being sold to stronger firms. \nOthers are reconstituting themselves as commercial banks in order to \nobtain additional Federal deposit protection and regulation.\n  Many investment banks were too shaky to survive, unable to absorb \nlosses on housing-related securities that exceeded their capital and \nhaving insufficient time to obtain an infusion of capital from new \ninvestors.\n  Most financial institutions here and around the world have suffered \nmanageable losses. Except for the uncertainty which has made our banks \nreluctant to deal with one another or to issue new loans, they are \notherwise in good condition.\n  Banks and other financial institutions around the world have \nconsiderable assets but cannot access them. Normally, an institution in \nneed of cash would sell some of its assets to others. But at the \ncurrent time, entire classes of assets cannot be valued properly and, \nas a result, there is no functioning market for them. These \ninstitutions cannot wait for the market values to be sorted out because \nthey owe money now that is due for repayment.\n  We have to buy the banks enough time to properly sort out their \nassets. When the sorting is complete, they will likely find that their \nassets still have considerable value, perhaps between 70 cents and 90 \ncents on the dollar. Delinquency rates on mortgages are significantly \nup from a year ago, from about 2.4 percent to a bit over 8 percent as \nof the end of June. However, the homes and the land are still in \nexistence and have retained much of their intrinsic real value. Most of \nthe borrowers are paying their mortgages, and most of the mortgage-\nbacked bonds are still paying interest. Unfortunately, if the bonds \nhave to be resold today in this unstable, panicky market, they will \nyield far less than their real value. If the bonds can be held until \nthe crisis is sorted out, the losses will be greatly decreased. \nCertainly, the losses will be substantial and inconvenient for many \ninstitutions and for a number of individual investors, but they will be \nmanageable.\n  These are not insurmountable problems. We have dealt with financial \ncrises before. We overcame the devastating stagflation of the 1970s, \nhalting inflation and renewing economic growth through a mix of new \nmonetary tax-and-spend policies enacted in 1981. We solved the savings \nand loan crisis of the mid-1980s, even as income and unemployment rose \nrapidly, without resorting to renewed inflation.\n  In short, our greatest fear should not be the crisis itself but the \npossibility of an inappropriate response to the crisis.\n  In order to determine the best course going forward, we need to \nexamine what got us here. While it would be easy, especially during the \ncampaign season, to lay the blame at the feet of certain individuals, \nthe actual problems we face are simply too complex to be pinned on a \nsingle actor or party.\n  Right now, we are seeing the consequences of a long series of policy \nerrors, both in the private and public sectors, which combined to \ncreate a perfect storm of financial instability. Many of our problems \nstem from our monetary policy at the Federal Reserve. From 1988 to \n1999, the Fed pursued a relatively stable monetary policy. However, in \nanticipation of serious problems with the financial sector's computer \nsystems as the year 2000 approached, the Fed flooded the system with \nmoney in 1999. This contributed to the ``dot com'' bubble, and \nsubsequent efforts to take out the excess cash contributed to the \nrecession of 2001.\n  In order to spur the economy, the Federal Reserve held short-term \ninterest rates too low for too long, well\n\n[[Page S9266]]\n\nbelow the expected rate of inflation. The money that subsequently \npoured into housing and commodities created excessive demand, \ncontributing to the housing and commodity price bubbles, both of which \nburst due to the most recent efforts of the Fed to return to a less-\ninflationary stance.\n  The easy credit made available from these policies was quickly \nsteered into the housing sector, facilitated by increased availability \nof adjustable rate mortgages, rising demand for mortgage-backed \nsecurities, and the globalization of financial markets.\n  The proverbial plot thickened as loan origination companies and many \nbanks continually borrowed at the prevailing low rates and resold the \nmortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or other firms generating \nmortgage-backed securities, all of which planned to sell the mortgages \nrather than keep them on their books. So they had little reason to be \nconcerned with the quality of loans or the borrowers' ability to repay.\n  As a result, lending standards fell. Subprime loans were given to \nmany debtors who could not, under normal conditions, qualify for or \nafford the debt they were taking on. These people were offered \nadjustable rate mortgages with low teaser rates, borrowing on the \nassumption that they could always refinance at the same low rates later \non. In effect, low-income buyers became speculators in the midst of a \nbubble. Borrowers and lenders assumed that real estate prices would \nrise indefinitely. Therefore, many assumed that, even if they could not \nrefinance, they would be able to sell their houses later on at a \nprofit.\n  The infusion of money into the housing market increased demand and \ndrove up housing prices, leading to overconstruction. Eventually, the \nprices had to come down to Earth, leading to the losses and defaults \nthat we are facing today.\n  Make no mistake, we are facing difficult times. But I must urge my \ncolleagues to maintain some perspective about the overall state of our \neconomy. True enough, these were unprecedented challenges, but given \nwhat is at stake, the American people need an accurate portrayal of the \nobstacles we face. Once again, our current problems are difficult but \nnot fatal, and contrary to the claims of some of my colleagues, this is \nnot 1929 and America has not become a country of Tom Joads.\n  While, once again, the financial failures have placed us in an \nextremely tenuous position, the overall economy has not collapsed. As a \nresult of the reduction in tax rates beginning in 2001 and 2003, we saw \nmore than 4 years of strong economic growth. After a single quarter of \nnegative growth at the end of 2007, our economy has continued to grow \nthis year, though at a slower rate. Productivity has been on the rise \nand inflation has been on the decline. Of course, these facts are not \nlikely to comfort those in our country who are struggling through the \nuncertainties, but they should give us cause to believe we can weather \nthis storm.\n\n  Yet what we hear from some Democrats regarding these matters are more \npartisan attacks and fingerpointing. The country is in shambles, and \nPresident Bush and John McCain, they say, are entirely to blame. Of \ncourse, these attacks are simply ridiculous, just as it would be \nridiculous for me to stand here and lay the blame entirely on \nDemocratic congressional leaders. The stakes are simply too high on \nthis issue for our response to be muddled by campaign rhetoric or \nelection-related agendas. I sincerely hope we can move past any \npartisan wrangling and address these matters in a sensible, bipartisan \nfashion.\n  This week we are working on, and are likely to pass, an economic \nrelief package that, if it resembles what has been advertised, will put \nthe American taxpayers on the hook for about $700 billion--$700 \nbillion--and the American taxpayers will become the proud owners of a \nmountain of questionable mortgages. The fact that this gargantuan \nnumber can be discussed in these Chambers without causing all of us to \nshudder says a lot about how detached from reality many of us have \nbecome.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, whom I greatly respect \nand admire, announced a proposed bailout last Friday. According to the \ncurrent agenda discussed among congressional leaders, they hope to be \nable to finalize the package and have it on the President's desk by the \nend of the week.\n  To sum up, we are preparing to authorize $700 billion in new spending \nand to fundamentally alter the balance between the Government and the \nprivate sector, and we will not take longer than a week to debate and \ndiscuss the legislation.\n  I know many of my colleagues are anxious to get back on the campaign \ntrail so they can blame President Bush, Senator McCain, or anyone with \nan ``R'' next to their name for the financial crisis. But I think the \nAmerican people expect more out of us. Indeed, if we are going to spend \n$700 billion of their money, we had better be certain it is the right \nthing to do.\n  The proposal clearly has the potential to work. Under the plan, the \nSecretary will be given authority to spend up to $700 billion to \nacquire large quantities of questionable mortgage-related debt that \nhave caused the financial markets to freeze. Fortunately, from what we \nhave been told, that $700 billion figure is only the gross cost of the \nprogram. The assets acquired by the Treasury will eventually be sold. \nIf--and this is a big if--all goes according to plan and the assets are \npurchased at appropriate discounts, there is a chance the Treasury will \nrecoup the taxpayers' investment or even turn a profit.\n  As we heard from Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke on Tuesday, \nthis outcome cannot be guaranteed and, at this point, much uncertainty \nremains. However, as we all know, the cost of doing nothing could be \nmuch greater. By failing to act, we may inflict even greater hardship \non the working people, small business owners, and retirees throughout \nthe country.\n  In addition to the inherent risks in the program, a number of other \nfactors must be considered. First of all, we need to remember that \nSecretary Paulson will not be running the Treasury for much longer. \nThat is a possibility. In fact, it is a probability. Given the sheer \nsize of this proposal, passage of this bill, coupled with the start of \na new administration in January, the choice regarding the next Treasury \nSecretary will suddenly become one of the most important political \nappointments in a generation. We would be passing on to an unknown \nadministration unprecedented powers over the financial markets and the \nprivate sector. While I have great confidence in the leadership and \nabilities of Secretary Paulson, such uncertainty gives me pauses.\n  Second, there is a conspicuous lack of transparency, oversight or \naccountability in the Secretary's proposal. Instead, it contains \nexplicit provisions exempting his decisions from any kind of review. No \nconsultation is required for any purchase, nor is there a requirement \nthat either his decisionmaking process or his decisions themselves be \nmade public. The shudder I feel over the $700 billion price tag grows \nexponentially if there is going to be no accountability.\n  If Congress is to approve a bailout of this magnitude, we must take \nproper precautions to ensure we do not compound the inherent \nuncertainty of the plan with more uncertainty in the legislation. We \nneed to include some sort of guidelines or oversight in order to ensure \nthat this administration and the next one do not abuse or misuse such a \nhuge grant of trust.\n  Finally, we need to consider any response to the current crisis in \nthe context of our long-term economic needs. While the proposed bailout \nmay hold off an impending economic meltdown, any action we take now \nwill be meaningless if it is not followed up with decisive action on \nour part.\n  Foremost, we need to change the way the financial sector works. The \nFederal Reserve needs to rethink its definition of good monetary policy \nand determine whether its existing policy tools--such as reserve \nrequirements, oversight capabilities, and reporting rules--are \nadequate. In addition, Congress must reconsider what it has charged the \nFederal Reserve to do. The Fed has been charged with two goals: No. 1, \nproviding a sound currency with stable purchasing power; and, No. 2, \nmaintaining steady economic growth with low unemployment. At this \npoint, it is obvious that an aggressive, excessively easy monetary \npolicy in pursuit of short-term growth is self-destructive in\n\n[[Page S9267]]\n\nthe long run. It leads only to inflation and speculative excesses in \nthe credit markets that might harm the economy, and probably will. Only \nby focusing on a stable currency can the Federal Reserve achieve both \nits objectives.\n  We also need to completely rethink Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As we \nhave heard countless times over the last few weeks, in creating these \ntwo government-sponsored enterprises, we have made sure the benefits of \ntheir investments are private while all the risks are public. Put \nsimply: This is bad policy with considerable moral hazard.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together represent an immense government-\ncreated and government-coddled duopoly. In the years since their \ncreation, they have focused mainly on their own expansion, recklessly \nurged on by many in Congress who believed this was the way to make home \nownership more affordable for low-income families. However, as a recent \nFed study has demonstrated, most of the benefit of the previously \nimplicit--now explicit--Federal guarantee of their debt has gone to \ntheir shareholders as higher earnings, not to reducing costs for new \nhomeowners. In their efforts to expand, Fannie and Freddie took too \nmany unwarranted risks. They needed an ever-expanding supply of new \nmortgages to package and resell and to hold for income. Others fed this \nexpansion effort with unsound lending.\n  The recent Federal bailout of these institutions requires an \nimmediate step: an end to their lobbying to Congress. It is a little \nlate in coming, but as of right now, it is essential. We need to stop \ninsisting that Fannie and Freddie have an ever-expanding role in the \nhousing market. We should also consider breaking each of them into \nseparate pieces to promote more competition and to ensure that no one \npart of them will ever again be too big to be allowed to fail.\n  The regulatory and rating agencies also need to be reviewed. We need \nto ask whether they have enough resources for adequate supervision and \nwhether they have failed to recognize the evolutionary changes in the \ncredit markets and the new business arrangements that reduced \ntransparency in financing. These and other questions will have to be \nexplored as we move forward.\n  Congress must also recognize its responsibility to help the economy \ngrow. I, for one, would like to see some willingness among the \nDemocratic leaders to enact policies that are actually intended to spur \nlong-term economic growth in our country. It is simply appalling that \nthe United States has the second highest corporate tax rate in the \nindustrialized world. Yet it is almost sacrilegious among Democrats to \nconsider reducing those rates in order to spur growth among our \nNation's businesses and employers. Capital gains in this country are \ntaxed at a higher rate than they are in many countries throughout the \nworld, and all we hear from Democrats are proposals to increase taxes \non capital gains and dividends, which, as history has shown, creates \ndisincentives for investment. During these months of slow economic \ngrowth, it has been our exports that have kept our economy afloat. One \nwould think this should incentivize Congress to promote free trade with \nour allies throughout the world. Yet we have consistently seen efforts \nto open our exports to foreign markets stalled by the Democrats in \nCongress.\n  Finally, we spend $700 billion a year to purchase oil from outside \nthe United States. But if you looked at any of the so-called energy \nbills we have considered in Congress, they do not contain any \nprovisions that will actually increase oil production at home, except \nthe bill we Republicans offered here a month or so ago.\n  We clearly need to reform our financial markets and refine the powers \nof the Federal Reserve in order to ensure crises such as this don't \nhappen again. And though I hesitate to support the idea, it is not \nunreasonable to conclude that the proposed bailout can provide \nimmediate relief and prevent any more catastrophic losses in the near \nfuture and give the financial market time to sort out the mess. But if \nwe don't adopt policies that are pro-growth, pro-business, and pro-job \ncreation, we won't be able to ensure long-term economic security for \nour country, no matter how many bad mortgages we purchase with the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  These are indeed difficult times for our financial markets and the \nhousing sector of our economy. I agree with my colleagues that we need \nto act fast. I only hope that, as we work toward a solution, we do so \naccording to a timetable that is appropriate to the problems we face \nand not one based on election year expediency. I also hope that we can \nconsider the long-term implications of our actions and consider the \nfuture as well as the present.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9267-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9267-S9268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on September 11, the senior Senator from \nMissouri, Mr. Bond, came to the floor to introduce a resolution which \nsuggests that the Appropriations Committee should establish an \nIntelligence Subcommittee. While I don't agree that this would be \nbeneficial to either the Senate or the Nation, the Senator, of course, \nhas a right to his opinion.\n  I would inform my colleagues that the leaders of the Appropriations \nCommittees, Senators Byrd and Cochran, who are responsible for the \ndivision of labor on the committee addressed this matter in a letter \nthey sent to Senators Reid and McConnell earlier this year.\n  Rather than debating this matter I would just point out that the \nchairman and ranking member make a very compelling case in opposition \nto this proposal articulating the significant damage to intelligence \noversight that could result from the proposal offered by Senator Bond. \nI would like to highlight one observation from their letter. They point \nout that the proposal that the Senator makes would have the effect of \nfurther limiting the number of members who have access to the details \nof intelligence programs. It would put all decisionmaking into fewer \nhands. They suggest that for intelligence programs in which the general \npublic, the watchdog groups, and the press must be denied access to the \ninformation, the absolutely worst thing the Congress could do would be \nto further constrain oversight and eliminate the benefits that come \nfrom having more individuals share responsibility in the decisionmaking \nprocess. I share their view that the proposal made by the Senator from \nMissouri would not improve congressional oversight of intelligence.\n  My colleague from Missouri spoke eloquently and passionately about \nthe tragedy of 9/11 and the impact it had on him and this institution. \nOn a personal note, I would like to thank him for the kind words he \nexpressed about me and my role as chairman of the Defense Subcommittee. \nSenator Bond and I have served together on the Appropriations Committee \nsince he joined us in 1991. He has served the committee in a number of \nkey areas including on our Defense Subcommittee, but most notably as \nchairman of the former VA-HUD Subcommittee and currently as the ranking \nmember of the Transportation-HUD Subcommittee. On the Appropriations \nCommittee we have come to count on him for his expertise and sound \njudgment in these areas. As such, I must say I was surprised by some of \nthe characterizations he made regarding action on classified programs.\n  Senator Bond noted that billions of dollars has been spent on \ntechnology programs which, as he described, ``never get off the \nground.'' I concur with this description and share his concern. He \nrightly blamed executive branch officials for many failures. But in so \ndoing he failed to note that the Congress, including the Intelligence \nCommittee, reviewed these programs for several years and authorized \nfunding for them.\n  He discussed a program that he referred to as a ``silver bullet.'' If \nI am right in assuming which program that is, I would point out that \nthe Intelligence Committees, Appropriations Committees, and the \nintelligence community all originally supported the program. While the \nSenate Intelligence Committee soured on the program a few years ago, it \nremained supported by the House oversight committees, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, the Director of National Intelligence, the \nSecretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, \nand the Chairman of the Strategic Command. But, yes, it was expensive. \nWhen a new DNI, new Secretary, and\n\n[[Page S9268]]\n\nnew Under Secretary assumed their posts, they determined that it simply \nwasn't affordable.\n  The Senator from Missouri postulates that it didn't work. Since it \nwas not completed, we will never really know, but no one involved in \nthe program in DoD and the intelligence community ever contended it \nwouldn't work. It was cancelled because the executive branch determined \nit wasn't worth the continued investment. By cancelling the program as \nurged by the Intelligence Committee, the Government did, to use the \nSenator's word, ``waste'' billions of dollars. But this is not the only \nexample of problems in this community.\n  One notable program that was finally killed by the administration in \nthe past few years on which significantly more funding had been spent \nwas strongly supported by the Intelligence Committee from the program's \ninception. The committee had even suggested that this program could \npartially serve as an alternative to the program referred to above. It \nhad been behind schedule and overbudget for years, but it continued to \nbe supported by the executive branch and the Congress with the hope \nthat it could be saved. Eventually, the administration realized that \ntechnically it could not be made to work, and it was cancelled.\n  For the Senator to claim that it is the appropriations process which \nis so disconnected from the workings of the Intelligence Committee that \nbillions of dollars come to naught puts the blame squarely on our \ncommittee for the failures which have occurred. This is not only \nunfair, but it is completely inaccurate.\n  Mr. President, while the Senator and I may disagree on the relative \nmerits of programs, and while I am not particularly proud of the \nGovernment's record in recent years, the responsibility for wasting of \nbillions of dollars is shared by all of us, the executive branch, the \nAppropriations Committees, and the Intelligence Committees.\n  The Senator attempted to link these past failures to a particular \nprogram which he advocates which was not funded by the Appropriations \nCommittee this year. I would point out that the administration did not \nrequest funding for the program and that the Director of National \nIntelligence opposes funding the program. The funding sought by Senator \nBond was not authorized by the House oversight committee. It was not \nrecommended by the Intelligence oversight panel of the House \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Moreover, I would disagree with his characterization of the action by \nthe Defense Subcommittee on this subject. We recognize that several \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee feel this would be a worthwhile \nprogram. Senators Stevens, Cochran, and I considered the actions by the \nIntelligence Committee on this and many other programs very carefully. \nTo address the concerns of the Intelligence Committee, we reallocated a \nsubstantial sum of money from other programs and provided an amount \nwith which the intelligence community could fully fund the program that \nSenator Bond advocates. However, we didn't mandate that outcome. There \nis disagreement within the community about the proper approach which \nshould be taken. In recognition that a new administration will be \ntaking office, we requested that the program supported by Senator Bond \nbe analyzed along with those of other contractors and the best option \nor options be selected next year.\n  We felt we met the Senator halfway. We recommended sufficient funding \nwhich could be used for this program even though it was funded by \nneither the other intelligence oversight committees nor the \nintelligence community.\n  We are familiar with the program in question. We believe it may have \nmerit. We have confidence in individuals associated with the program, \nbut we also are aware of those with great technical expertise who argue \nthat the program will not work for technical reasons which I cannot \ndiscuss in unclassified session. We believed locking the intelligence \ncommunity into another multibillion-dollar sole source contract when \nthere are legitimate questions about its potential is probably a \nmistake. To imply that this program has broad-based support and that it \nis the Appropriations Committee which is out of step is categorically \ninaccurate.\n  It is somewhat ironic that the Senator from Missouri is urging \nsupport for responding to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission \nwhile at the same time he is telling the Senate to ignore the judgment \nof the Director of National Intelligence who was established and \nempowered to make such decisions as the principal recommendation of the \n9/11 Commission.\n  Finally, I would note that the Senator claimed that the root problem \nis that the Appropriations Committee simply does not have enough staff \nto pay adequate attention to intelligence.\n  The Defense Subcommittee has a small staff and the Intelligence \nCommittee staff is fairly large. But I would point out that the \nIntelligence Committee has one professional staff member on the \nmajority staff who reviews the budget for the National Reconnaissance \nOffice; so do we. The Intelligence Committee has one professional staff \nmember on the majority staff who reviews the budget for the National \nSecurity Agency; so do we. Moreover, the staff which the Defense \nSubcommittee devotes to overseeing the intelligence budget has far \ngreater experience in reviewing budgets than does the staff of the \nIntelligence Committee for such programs. I would also point out that \nseveral other subcommittees on the Appropriations Committee have \njurisdiction over portions of the intelligence budget. To single out \nthe Defense Subcommittee misses one of the key points of the \nappropriations process: that many individuals have oversight over these \nmatters.\n  I don't want to stir up passions on this issue any more than I may \nalready have. I have the greatest respect for the workings of the \nIntelligence Committee. Many of my younger colleagues may not be aware \nthat I served as the first chairman of the Intelligence Committee. I am \nproud of my service on that committee. I believe the work that Senators \nRockefeller and Bond do is extremely important to the Senate. I believe \nthey have a very competent staff. Since I resumed the chairmanship of \nthe Defense Subcommittee last year, I have directed my staff to work \nclosely with the staff of the Intelligence Committee to ensure that we \nhave the benefit of their expertise and to minimize any disagreements \nbetween our two panels, and they have done so. Our staffs attend many \nbriefings together. Members of our staffs have traveled together to \nreview programs. I believe we have established a good relationship that \nstrengthens Senate oversight.\n  For example, there are literally thousands of line items in the \nintelligence budget. Our staffs spend countless hours discussing items \nwhich one committee or the other believes should be adjusted. We \ncarefully review the classified annex of the Intelligence Committee and \nprovide recommendations to the Appropriations Committee which are very \nclose to those of the Intelligence Committee. This year we had two \nissues out of hundreds of items under review on which we disagreed. On \none we were able to reach an agreement easily. The other has been \ndescribed in vague terms above.\n  Last year, Chairmen Byrd and Rockefeller, Ranking Members Cochran and \nStevens, and I signed a significant memorandum of agreement between our \ntwo committees pledging greater cooperation. Senator Bond chose not to \nbe party to that agreement. Since that time the signers and their \nstaffs have tried to live up to the letter and the spirit of that pact. \nI believe we have been generally successful and the Senate is better \nserved that two separate panels are continuing to review the \nintelligence budget but working together and generally resolving our \ndifferences amicably.\n  It is rare for me to openly disagree with another Member. I want to \nassure all my colleagues that I do not mean anything personally by my \nstatements today. However, the assertions and implications that were \nlevied against the Appropriations Committee earlier this month were \nsimply untrue. At times all of us can become passionate on matters \nwhich we care about. Perhaps that explains why such inaccuracies were \noffered as facts.

Mr. President, I wish today to honor the life and service \nof a dedicated marine, MSG Kenneth Nathaniel Mack. On May 5th, 2007, \nMaster Sergeant Mack gave his life in service to his country fighting \nin Iraq. In his 23 years of service to the U.S. Marine Corps, Master \nSergeant Mack proved himself a dedicated marine and a trusted colleague \nto all who served by his side.\n  Born in Goldsboro, NC, on December 18, 1964, Kenneth's family soon \nmoved to Texas, where he graduated from Southwest High School in 1982 \nand attended Tarrant County Junior College in Fort Worth.\n  While still in college, Master Sergeant Mack joined the Marine Corps \nReserves, following his love of country, as well as his interest in \nautomotive repair work. While many of his fellow students considered \nweekends simply a time to relax, Kenneth chose to spend many of those \nweekends at military drill in Abilene. In 1991, Kenneth was called upon \nto serve his country in combat during Operation Desert Storm. It would \nnot be the last time he served on a far-away field of battle.\n  Following the conclusion of the first gulf war, Kenneth returned \nhome, married his wife Peggie, and started his family. Like so many \nmembers of our Nation's Reserve forces, Kenneth worked hard to balance \nhis military service and civilian job with his family life. He \nsucceeded, as evidenced by the lasting legacy of love and compassion \nthat he left behind with his family. He cherished his time with them \nand was known for always bringing the family together.\n  In 2004, Kenneth was once again called to serve overseas and deployed \nin support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. After helping to liberate the \nIraqi people from an oppressive government regime, Master Sergeant Mack \nreturned home. In March of 2007, he answered his country's call for the \nthird time, returning to serve in Iraq. Sadly, just a few short months \nlater, Master Sergeant Mack was killed by an improvised explosive \ndevice while conducting combat operations there.\n  In honor of his service and his selfless sacrifice, Congress passed \nlegislation earlier this year naming the Wedgwood Station Post Office \nthe ``Master Sergeant Kenneth N. Mack Post Office Building.'' Master \nSergeant Mack will be remembered across Texas for his generosity and \nloving attitude towards children, which extended well beyond his own \nfamily. He will also be remembered for his enthusiasm for hobbies such \nas scuba diving, skydiving, and motorcycle riding; and his love for the \nU.S. Marine Corps.\n  MSG Kenneth Mack is survived by his wife, Peggie; his children, \nCandace, Courtney, Shyquadra, and Nathaniel; his mother, Mahalia S. \nMack; and his brothers, Timothy and Robert. It is my honor today to \nshare Kenneth's story, and pay tribute to his remarkable service and \nsacrifice for this country, which shall be forever indebted to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9269-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just last week Congress passed a 1-year \nextension of the Department of Education initiative to buy back student \nloans from lenders who have difficulties accessing capital in the tight \nfinancial market. I was pleased to support the extension of this \nprogram which has injected more than $1 billion in capital to lenders \nand has had a hand in ensuring students have access to federally \nguaranteed student loans in the 2008-2009 school year.\n  However, the continued need for the Federal Government to prop up \nstudent lenders, many of which already operate at a profit, concerns \nme. Companies making loans through the federally guaranteed program \nalready receive generous subsidies and a guarantee of 95 percent of the \nvalue of the loan. While extending the buyback program for another year \nwill provide stability in the student lending market for the 2009-2010 \nschool year, it raises the question of how much Federal funding is too \nmuch when there is a cheaper alternative that offers the same Federal \nloans to students.\n  That alternative is the direct loan program which issues the same \nfederally guaranteed student loans without reliance on banks and \nlenders. In addition to cutting out the middleman, the direct loan \nprogram is far cheaper for the government to administer. According to \nthe President's most recent budget, the cost to the taxpayer per loan \nthrough the direct loan program is $.77 compared to $5.25 through the \nFFEL program.\n  Iowa State University, the University of Iowa, University of Northern \nIowa, Kirkwood Community College, Des Moines Area Community College, \nand many other Iowa colleges, all issue loans through the direct loan \nprogram. I continue to hear from students and financial aid \nadministrators at those schools that the program serves them well. An \nadded benefit of the direct loan program is that in these troubled \neconomic times students at direct loan schools receive their student \nloans without the worry of whether their lender will be there for them \nnext year. Any college worried about loan availability for their \nstudents should immediately sign up for the direct loan program.\n  But the problem is deeper than any one school or lender. As our \neconomy continues to falter and the cost of college rises, we owe it to \nour young people and their parents to provide student aid that is \nreliable, efficient and comprehensive. The Federal student loan program \nis one of the best investments our country can make. It should be a \npriority to provide those loans in the most fiscally responsible way \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9269-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHINA'S DOUBLE TEN NATIONAL DAY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Bill Gates, \nSr.'s contributions to civic programs and initiatives that have changed \nthe lives of many in our home State of Washington and across the \ncountry. On Friday September 26, 2008, the University of Washington \nwill be holding an event to honor Bill Gates, Sr. and it is my pleasure \nto share my sincere gratitude to Bill Gates, Sr. for his extensive \ncivic engagement and accomplishments.\n  Bill Gates, Sr. has a long history of serving others. First as an \nEagle Scout and later serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, \nBill Gates, Sr. made a conscious choice to lead by example. Bill Gates, \nSr. has dedicated his time and efforts to numerous organizations that \nstrive to improve the lives of individuals and families across the \nNation and world. His active leadership roles in organizations such as \nthe United Way of King County and the United Way of America; local and \nnational boards of Planned Parenthood; and the Bill and Melinda Gates \nFoundation are just a few examples of his passion and commitment to \nhelping others.\n  As a fellow education advocate, I appreciate the work Bill Gates, Sr. \nhas done to increase the ability of our youth to access and afford a \nquality education. Bill Gates, Sr. clearly understands the importance \nof education and he has worked on this issue from many angles: as a \nchair of a Seattle Public School Levy Campaign, a member of the Board \nof Regents for the University of Washington, and as cochair of the Bill \nand Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates, Sr. is an integral part of \ndecisions made about influential\n\n[[Page S9270]]\n\neducation initiatives. Recently, Bill Gates, Sr. chaired a $2 billion \ncapital campaign for the University of Washington that included funding \nfor the Husky Promise, which supports an endowment to help lower income \nstudents access higher education and attend the University of \nWashington.\n  Bill Gates, Sr. has also worked to advance projects that provide \nsupport for individuals and families in need around the world. As chair \nof the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates, Sr. has helped \nlaunch initiatives that tackle major health and poverty issues for the \ndeveloping world. The initiatives have focused on practical solutions \nthat empower international communities and help save lives.\n  I would like to thank Bill Gates, Sr. for both his past activities \nand his current pursuits to help create healthier and happier \ncommunities. I am sure Bill Gates, Sr. will continue to embrace the \nopportunities and challenges of tomorrow through his work with many \ncharitable organizations, and I am pleased he is being honored for his \nyears of dedication to helping others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9270-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9270-S9271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this \npurpose to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for your vote to stop the cap and trade thing, \n     but it will come back with [a new president. We would be \n     better off to be] drilling the deep reserves of the Williston \n     Basin (more oil than Saudi Arabia in Dakota farmers fields) \n     or the ANWR 5,000 acres or 5 million acres, or off shore \n     where the Chinese will soon have rigs. We would be gearing up \n     like the moon landing to get oil out of our coal whose \n     estimated reserves are five times all the oil ever pulled out \n     of the Middle East. . . . or the even more vast oil shales of \n     Colorado or the tar sands. We would be building nuclear \n     reactors and starting up those on moth balls right now . . . \n     or better building refineries or making the hydrogen car that \n     GM already has. Or how about this: All Of The Above.\n       But we are stuck [because of money influence] and nothing \n     will change.\n     Dennis.\n                                  ____\n\n       Will It Ever End?\n       I have several examples of how the energy cost is driving \n     my life.\n       1. High propane cost has increased my heating cost to an \n     increase of over $600 more this year. Propane has had a large \n     increase and now is over $3 per gallon. Five years ago it was \n     under .60 cents per gallon. Propane is a by product of gas \n     exploration. I feel this is a very large price for a by-\n     product.\n       2. The government rating for mileage rate is at 50.5 per \n     mile. Why have they not raised this? Gas prices soar, but the \n     rate stays the same.\n       3. Thanks for the stimulus check. I just wish I could have \n     used it to buy something extra.\n       4. Diesel prices are out of control. Why is diesel almost a \n     dollar more a gallon than gas?\n       5. Just about the time you feel you are getting somewhere, \n     someone takes more of your income. It is no wonder people are \n     losing houses and entering into get rich adventures. \n     (Lottery, gambling)\n     B.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is the third email that I have sent over the past few \n     months on this subject, and my message this time will be \n     short and succinct--reducing speed limits is among the \n     quickest solutions to help us in addressing the current \n     issues with fuel pricing. Highway fuel consumption can be cut \n     considerably (perhaps by as much as 20%--depending on the \n     engine) by lowering speed limits. This is only a part of the \n     solution. We also need to step up efforts on many fronts \n     including utilizing more domestic resources, pushing the \n     development of renewable energy sources and providing \n     incentives to reduce energy consumption (i.e.--building \n     smaller, more energy efficient homes that utilize solar/wind/\n     geothermal energy). It is a complex challenge requiring \n     strong leadership.\n       This brand of leadership will require some to act without \n     regard for political ramifications (courage)--We are looking \n     to you to provide your share of that leadership.\n     Rich.\n                                  ____\n\n       You and your fellow congressman are a little late to help \n     with this energy problem as we are at peak oil and prices \n     will continue to rise. I am totally amazed at Congress's lack \n     of action on coming forth with a sensible energy program.\n     James.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for this opportunity to discuss my concerns. \n     Higher gas prices have forced my family to reduce times spent \n     together. We have to drive, because of very little public \n     transportation. I would support your efforts for the oil \n     companies to build more refineries. Every time one goes down \n     for ``maintenance,'' we get burned. Let them use their \n     profits to build them. I think we need to force auto \n     companies to build more efficient cars. We need more good \n     choices for higher mpg autos, not just one per auto company. \n     As a side note, we need to start a federal public works \n     program. Get people employed and get our bridges/roads, \n     schools, libraries, etc. rebuilt. This would stimulate our \n     economy more than Bush's tax break plan. We need authority to \n     install toll booths on our interstate highways to help keep \n     them maintained. I think we are ready for nuclear energy at \n     INL. The time is right. We need leaders in Congress, not \n     Republicans or Democrats. Can you be one? Thanks again for \n     this opportunity.\n     John, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I had to take a medical disability from my job of 24 years \n     as my health was getting so bad. My husband is 69 years old \n     and I am 64. We find when we go to the grocery store we have \n     to decide whether we should buy groceries or put gas in our \n     tank so we can get home if we can buy groceries. We cannot \n     afford to sell our house and move into town. We have no \n     public transportation for five miles, I am trying to help my \n     daughter with her children as she had to go back to work and \n     I can get them to the Mall on public transportation but we \n     would have to walk the five or six miles to get the rest of \n     the way to my house. Our utilities are getting out of sight \n     also and just the necessities in food are more than our \n     Social Security and other bills allow. And then they want to \n     give our Social Security to illegal aliens who have never \n     worked and paid into it. My Grandmother had worked for years \n     and when she applied they told her she was a quarter short to \n     collect S.S., but we can give it to people who have never \n     worked or paid into it? What are we supposed to do when we \n     have our hands tied and no one wants to help back there and \n     you are our only hope because you pass the laws and we have \n     to live with them. Please help us as there are so many things \n     they can use as alternative fuel and they seem to drag their \n     feet about it. We have all kinds of weeds we will donate for \n     the purpose of alternative fuel.\n     Nancy.\n                                  ____\n\n       The cost of energy is devastating to seniors on a fixed \n     income such as me.\n     Jerry, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I want to thank you for the opportunity to address my views \n     on the situation we are in, not only in Idaho, the United \n     States but the entire world. The affects of high energy \n     prices will continue until Wall Street speculators are \n     stopped. The auto manufacturers here in the United States and \n     abroad have been given every opportunity to produce high \n     efficient automobiles for decades. They have failed. Congress \n     has [not acted to create] mass transit high speed \n     transportation from coast to coast. The technology has been \n     here for many decades with nothing being done in Washington \n     D.C.\n       What are we to do with the waste from nuclear energy \n     plants? I believe that technologies for coal, wind and solar \n     should be explored. We should be exploring technologies of \n     our ocean's salt water as a useful solution to our energy \n     situation. We need qualified people to manage our water and \n     other natural recourses here in Idaho and throughout the \n     world.\n       If Congress would only work together for the betterment of \n     mankind. These are but a few of our hopes and dreams for the \n     future of our existence.\n       Thank you, Senator Crapo, for your efforts in Congress and \n     for this consideration.\n     Greg, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       Sorry Mr. Crapo, but I do not agree with you about your \n     vote against the climate change legislation.\n       In 2000, I recall paying between $.99 and $1.09 for gas for \n     many months in Boise, occasionally a little more, but in that \n     range. Now, eight years later, we are paying 400% more. The \n     administration has refused during this time to get involved \n     in the Kyoto agreements and only just in the last year or so \n     acknowledged that climate change was even real, but attacked \n     and prevented the science that warned us of it throughout his \n     term. Gasoline prices going up 400% in Boise in the past \n     eight years is painful, but it is caused by many factors, \n     mostly, I believe, due to rich people getting insanely richer \n     at the expense of the rest of the world. Meanwhile, we still \n     do very little to protect against the disastrous consequences \n     of global warming.\n       So, if we are going to be subjected to 400% increases and \n     do nothing but make the rich\n\n[[Page S9271]]\n\n     richer, how can you be unwilling to vote for a bill that \n     might make us pay 12.5% more, but will take huge strides \n     toward protecting the future of our planet and safeguarding \n     against additional enormous energy costs in the future. Penny \n     wise and pound foolish. What we should do is get to the \n     bottom of exactly why prices have gone up 400% in eight \n     years.\n       I feel angry that our society is willing to mortgage our \n     future almost completely for slight increases in personal \n     luxury and benefit in the present (consider the gas tax \n     reprieve that [was] proposed this summer as one tiny \n     example). Where are our values for providing for the future \n     of our children and our planet? I believe we need to \n     prioritize much greater efforts on green and renewable \n     resource R I believe that if we put our innovation behind \n     solutions that the entire world needs, we can more than \n     offset the upfront costs. This is the strength of capitalism \n     and I believe we ought to focus on our strengths. I do not \n     want us to emphasize further oil exploration and drilling and \n     opening up of our protected public lands (such as ANWR).\n                                                      Scot, Boise.\n\n       P.S. Please have the courage and honesty to include \n     critical comments like mine as well when you compile comments \n     from the public. Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our farm has been severely impacted by high energy prices \n     and the price of corn, which is a by-product of the energy \n     crisis. We have gone from 100 employees down to 34. We are \n     currently liquidating our calves because we can no longer \n     make money raising them. We will soon be down to 12 \n     employees.

Oil is 1000% more efficient than \n     these ``alternative'' fuels and drilling and refining our own \n     oil is proven to work, while these other fuels are not. There \n     is too much energy used to make ethanol to make it efficient. \n     I believe that the mere announcement of drilling and building \n     refineries will drastically help our economy. Just think of \n     the excitement of jobs. The excitement of better times to \n     come. Anyone can hang on if they have hope. There are no \n     downsides to drilling in our own country.

Unfortunately, for many of us, our lives become a \n     struggle to get the dollar to buy the foods to keep going, \n     pay our property taxes for homes we cannot afford to sell, \n     get the fuel to get us to the place to make that dollar which \n     is worth less every day and employers cannot afford to pay \n     more in wages and the cycle goes on and on.\n       Everyone says ``Oh, let us just raise the minimum wage. \n     That will fix it.'' Think again. The average small business \n     man is one step away from sinking in this quicksand himself. \n     He cannot afford health or dental insurance or retirement for \n     him or his family, but he cannot have much of a business \n     without employees, either. So he gives a raise to his \n     employees and has to cut somewhere else, quality or quantity \n     of goods sold and then the purchaser suffers. It all affects \n     every one of us.\n       Transportation, fuel costs, value of the dollar, energy \n     costs, making ends meet becomes increasingly difficult and \n     our situations look increasingly dismal. Our society, like it \n     or not, is tied to the umbilical cord of fuel oil pricing and \n     something needs to be done to remove the grip on that cord \n     that is choking out the life-giving fluids our nation needs \n     to function. We need to control our own supplies of energy, \n     provide for ourselves everything this nation needs to not \n     just survive, but to thrive. We have oil supplies of our own \n     under our own soil and off our own coasts; use them. That is \n     what they are there for. As you use them, develop new \n     sources, require more renewable energy implementation, but \n     use what you've got. Stop letting the nation get the life \n     strangled out of it. Make renewable energy more affordable, \n     for one thing. It was going to cost me over $40,000 to put in \n     a wind generator to power my home. That would never ever pay \n     for itself before it self destructed. It is ridiculous to \n     have solar power and wind power devices so overpriced to make \n     them unattainable.

Here in Rexburg, I have found that at age 56, I can \n     still ride a bike to work. I may even start doing groceries \n     and other errands with my bike. I am getting in good shape, \n     although I already was in good shape. My family and I find \n     that we consolidate errands. Instead of going to town for one \n     thing, we make sure it is for three or more things. If it is \n     not, we just wait until we have more to do downtown or \n     elsewhere. I have aging parents who need help, and gas prices \n     have not made getting to their house very easy, but what we \n     can do, we have to go. So we go without a lot of things. We \n     pass by the treats and other not so important purchases (we \n     were doing that before anyway). I think where this really \n     hits us the hardest is in going to see our grandkids far \n     away, or taking a simple trip like to Mt. Rushmore or even \n     Yellowstone Park. The gas prices have eaten those options up \n     pretty fast. It is too bad that we sit around as a nation and \n     let the oil rich countries dictate to us how we can live our \n     lives. We should have started doing something about these \n     fifty years ago, but apparently, nobody had that much far \n     sight into the potential problem. We'll survive and we do not \n     feel bad for ourselves, but it is not easy.\n     Ferron.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9271-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DEAN STONE\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, on August 25, 2008, Idahoans \nresiding on the Boise bench in the area of the Oregon Trail and \nColumbia Village subdivisions experienced immense devastation caused by \na brush fire that became a residential nightmare. With the combination \nof 50 m.p.h. winds, dry sage brush, high heat, sloped terrain and homes \nwith cedar shake shingles and wooden decks, a small grassfire exploded, \nclaiming the life of one woman, destroying 10 homes and causing \nextensive damage to nine others. Mary Ellen Ryder, a professor at Boise \nState University, beloved wife of Peter Ryder and a friend to the \ncommunity, was the single fatality. My thoughts and prayers and those \nof many Idahoans are with the Ryder family.\n  Although the fire caused great devastation, many lives and homes were \nsaved because of the efforts of several courageous Idahoans. I would \nlike to formally recognize one homeowner, two Boise police officers, \none firefighter and one local humanitarian. Without their selfless \nservice and personal sacrifices of physical safety, expense and time \naway from families and careers, the outcome and aftermath of the fire \nwould have been much harder to endure. Thanks to homeowner Kent\n\n[[Page S9272]]\n\nHallamore, a survivor of the fire, my office gained key insight into \nthe contributions of these five citizens.\n  The first Idahoan I would like to acknowledge is Rod Poe. When the \nfire reached Rod's subdivision, he quickly alerted neighbors and \nevacuated the surrounding homes. Even before emergency assistance \narrived, Rod was hosing down houses within the fire's path and putting \nout new blazes as they emerged. He stayed on the scene for the entire \nnight and for many subsequent evenings inspecting the area for hot \nspots and patrolling for looters. His leadership in the community \nextended beyond physical service. He comforted the suffering, acquired \nhousehold goods for those who had none, and contacted Boise's mayor to \ndiscuss future fire prevention solutions for the bench area.\n  Like Poe, officers Jason Rose and Chris Davis of the Boise Police \nDepartment were among the first to begin working at the location of the \nfire. These two men ran door-to-door urging residents to leave their \nhomes. As homes ignited, the inferno-like conditions worsened and took \ntheir toll on the men. Their clothing caught fire; their vision \nblurred; and both suffered from smoke inhalation. Yet they faced these \nrisks with valor, persisted in their duties and saved the lives of many \nresidents.\n  Firefighter Charlie Ruffing is the sole coordinator of the \nFirefighters Burn-out Fund, a collection fund for the immediate needs \nof fire victims. In the aftermath of the Oregon Trail Fire, Ruffing \nresponded on his personal cell phone around the clock. He worked \ndiligently to collect cash and household goods and distribute them. To \ndate, he has collected over $110,000 in cash and gift-card donations. \nHe displayed tremendous compassion and individual care for each family \nhe assisted. He exceeded his responsibilities and earned the trust and \nrespect of those he sought to assist.\n  Finally, Pattie Wagstaff organized an assistance network and \ncoordinated a community donation event which amassed even more personal \nand household goods than the fire victims needed. Since the coordinator \nof her church's disaster relief program was among the victims of the \nfire, Wagstaff heroically filled the void. Taking 2 weeks off from her \njob to help in the relief efforts, Wagstaff quickly came to play an \nintegral part in helping the affected families begin to return to \nnormal life. Her presence inspired many during times of great shock and \nemotional upheaval.\n  Many hands played valuable roles in quelling the flames and caring \nfor the people who survived the Oregon Trail Fire. To these five \nindividuals and members of the Boise Police and Fire Departments as \nwell as the others who so selflessly served their community, I join \nwith family, friends and neighbors to offer my sincere \ngratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9272-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO ROBERT FISCH AND EUGENE LANSING\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a remarkable story of generosity and public spiritedness.\n  Twenty years ago, in October 1988, I opened an official office in \nDubuque in order to better serve people in that part of Iowa. Almost \nimmediately, two wonderful citizens--Robert Fisch and Eugene Lansing--\ncame forward to be of service to me and to the staffers in my new \nDubuque office.\n  Both of them were retired Army veterans. Bob, who was 67 at the time, \nwas a veteran of World War II. Gene, who was 57, was a veteran of the \nKorean war.\n  We eagerly accepted their offers of assistance. But little did we \nknow that this initial act of kindness and generosity would extend for \nanother two decades.\n  Over the years, Bob and Gene have been faithful friends and valued \nhelping hands to my Dubuque staff. They have pitched in answering \nphones, taking messages, and helping out with many of the mundane but \nnecessary tasks that keep an office running efficiently.\n  Bob usually comes into the office twice a week. Gene comes in once a \nweek, driving 50 miles round trip from his home in Dyersville.\n  They have given their time and energy. But they have given much more: \ntheir wisdom and experience, their enthusiasm, and their amazing \ngenerosity of spirit. Bob Fisch and Gene Lansing are outstanding \nexamples of the old saying that ``you don't have to be on the public \npayroll to be an outstanding public servant.''\n  Bob Fisch, after leaving the Army, worked for 42 years at Dubuque \nPacking Company and 14 years at the 4th Street Elevator. He is involved \nin many civic and volunteer organizations, and he founded an \norganization of community activists called the 11th Street Neighborhood \nGroup. He and his beloved wife Marion, who died in 1999, were married \nfor half a century. They have five adult children--four daughters and \none son.\n  Gene Lansing and his wife, Marvel, have been married for 36 years. \nThey have two sons and one daughter. After the Korean war, Gene worked \non a tanker on the Great Lakes for 10 years, then went on to work at \nWickes Lumber and, later, in the Dubuque City Parks Department. He is \nactive in his church, Trinity Lutheran. He is also active in American \nLegion Post 136, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Veterans of \nForeign Wars.\n  Mr. President, as you can imagine, Bob Fisch and Gene Lansing have \nbecome dear friends to my Dubuque staff over the years. I have gotten \nto know them, as well, and I have tremendous respect and admiration for \nboth of them. That is why I wanted to take this opportunity, here in \nthe Senate, to salute these two exceptional Iowans. I want to publicly \nthank them for two decades of selfless service to my staff and me, and \nto the people of Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9272-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9272-S9273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FORT DODGE COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

He \nwas preceded in death by his grandmother, Carlotta Joann Cochran.\n  Shavonte served a 14-month deployment in Iraq as a petroleum \nspecialist with the Army National Guard. Those who knew him best recall \na devout man who loved making people smile. Shavonte's family said he \nhad an ``energetic personality and an infectious sense of humor that \nspread to all those in his vicinity.'' He was a member of the \nProgressive Baptist Church of Fort Wayne. At the time of the accident, \nShavonte was moving back into civilian life, set to start a new job as \na customer service representative with AT the next day.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Shavonte set as both a soldier and a father. Today \nand always, he will be remembered by family, friends and fellow \nHoosiers as a true American hero, and we cherish the legacy of his \nservice and his life.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Shavonte Dontrell Fields in \nthe Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for \nhis profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. I pray that \nShavonte's family can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah \nwho said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will \nwipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Shavonte.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9274-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9274-S9275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MIKE CRITELLI\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to someone I \nhave known for many years, both because of his guidance of a major \ncompany in Connecticut as well as his leadership in the mailing \nindustry--Mike Critelli, executive chairman of Pitney Bowes Inc.--which \nis headquartered in Stamford, CT. Mike will be retiring late this year, \nafter dedicating 30 years to both Pitney and the mailing industry.\n  Mike and I have come to know each other not only because Pitney Bowes \nis headquartered in my home State of Connecticut but also because he \nhas been the chairman of the Mailing Industry CEO Council, an \norganization of chief executive officers of companies in the mailing \nindustry.\n  The Mailing Industry CEO Council, under Mike's able leadership, has \nbeen at the forefront of educating policymakers about the mailing \nindustry for years. Although those of us who follow mailing industry \nissues know by heart now the key statistics--a $900 billion industry \nrepresenting over 8 percent of the gross domestic product and employing \n9 million workers--there was a time when the impact of the industry was \nless well known. Mike Critelli and the Mailing Industry CEO Council \nhelped to change that. The CEO Council came to town several times a \nyear to meet with me and others in Congress to provide support for the \npostal reform legislative effort. They helped to spread the word to \nmany of my colleagues who are not on the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction over postal \nissues, about the importance of the mailing industry and the impact of \nthe industry on jobs in each of their States. As we moved forward with \npostal reform legislation in the 109th Congress, having others in \nCongress actively supporting the mailing industry proved very helpful.\n  As we worked together on the Postal Accountability and Enhancement \nAct, my staff and I were always impressed by the attention and care \nMike gave to every detail. As a lawyer, Mike took the time to read the \nvarious versions of postal reform legislation page by page. He got into \nthe details and commented on specific provisions--and the final outcome \nwas better as a result. He was critically important in brokering some \nagreements with interested parties that helped get us over the final \nhurdles towards enactment. In the final days of the 109th Congress, the \nPostal Accountability and Enhancement Act passed the House and Senate \nand was signed into law. Mike Critelli played an essential role in \nhelping to educate others about the importance of the mailing industry \nand the need for the legislation that enabled it to get done.\n\n[[Page S9275]]\n\n  He began his career at Pitney Bowes as a staff attorney and rose \nthrough various leadership positions over the years. He served as \ngeneral counsel, chief personnel officer, and then became president of \nPitney Bowes Financial Services. He was then CEO and chairman and now \nserves as executive chairman of the board. He has brought the company \nthrough many changes--acquisitions and transformations. He has also \nserved as an effective ambassador for the mailing industry. After the \ndeadly anthrax attacks of fall 2001, Mike wasted no time in working \nwith the U.S. Postal Service to advocate on its behalf so that our \nmailstream would quickly regain the confidence of the American people.\n  Under Mike's leadership, Pitney Bowes has been a leader as well on \nhealth care issues. The company invests heavily in the health of its \nemployees and has found that the focus on prevention, wellness, early \ndiagnosis and treatment, and chronic disease management has improved \nhealth and minimized costs for employees as well as the company. This \nhas helped to make Pitney Bowes a model for other companies.\n  Mike has also demonstrated a strong commitment to diversity. Under \nhis tenure, Pitney Bowes has been consistently recognized as one of the \nbest corporations in America for diversity. Although this record began \nbefore Mike took the helm as CEO, he continued to grow the diversity \nefforts within the company. Outside of the office, Mike served for \nseveral years in a Connecticut chapter of the Urban League and as \nchairman of the National Urban League Board.\n  As I wish Mike Critelli well as he begins a well deserved retirement, \nI can't help but be disappointed that Connecticut's business community \nis losing a great leader. For our sake, I hope he continues in some \ncapacity assisting us with public policy issues of concern to our \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9275-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY J. HARDING\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish today to honor Anthony J. \nHarding for his leadership, integrity, and many accomplishments at \nUnited Water, one of the Nation's largest private water companies. \nDuring the past 5 years, Tony has been the chief executive officer of \nUnited Water, and he was responsible for the success of the company's \nwater and wastewater operations of both regulated and nonregulated \nbusinesses. Last month, Tony was named chairman of the board at United \nWater, a subsidiary of Paris-based Suez Environment.\n  Tony has over 35 years of experience in engineering and operations \nincluding management of major water businesses in Europe and Asia. \nPrior to joining United Water, he was president of Suez Environment in \nthe Asia Pacific Region, with overall responsibility for water \noperations in the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Australia, and New \nZealand. He also enjoyed a long and distinguished career managing water \noperations for two of England's most prestigious water companies: Essex \nand Suffolk Water Plc. and Northumbrian Water Plc.\n  In 2003, Tony was named chief executive officer at United Water and \nhe immediately made an impressive impact in the United States water \nservices industry, making the company the respected and sought-after \ninstitution it is today. As CEO, Tony has made great strides in \nimproving the water services to people in cities and towns across the \ncountry. As a result of his remarkable skills, United Water now \nprovides water services to customers in the 48 continental States as \nopposed to 21 States when Tony took over as CEO.\n  In 2005 Tony worked with then-Governor Kempthorne of Idaho to install \nhigh-tech membrane water filtration technology at a brandnew water \ntreatment plant in Boise. In 2006 he worked with Pennsylvania \nCongressman Tim Holden to bring similar technology to the people in the \nHarrisburg community. In 2007, Tony launched an aggressive $110 million \nproject in northern New Jersey, utilizing the latest water filtration \ntechnology to improve water quality for nearly 1 million residents in \nthe State.\n  Additionally, Tony has provided his wealth of experience to the \nNational Association of Water Companies and the American Water Works \nAssociation. He is also on the board of directors for the United Way in \nnorthern New Jersey. Dedicated to both his community and his family, \nTony and his wife, Christine, have two daughters, Rhyan and Bethan.\n  Tony received his bachelor of science degree in civil engineering \nfrom the University of Glamorgan in Wales. He was also a contributing \nauthor to the textbook ``Instrumentation and Computer Integration in \nWater Utility Operations,'' a joint project between the American and \nJapanese Water Associations.\n  There is no doubt that Anthony J. Harding exhibits all the qualities \nof an exemplary leader who has greatly impacted this Nation's water and \nwastewater industry. Therefore, I am pleased to pay tribute to Anthony \nJ. Harding and know my colleagues will join in wishing him continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9275-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1907.

A bill to improve the administration of the Minerals \nManagement Service, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \nintroduce legislation intended to bring much needed reform to the \nMinerals Management Service. After recent reports of the widespread \ncorruption at the agency, I came together with my colleague Senator \nNelson from Florida to work on legislative solutions that will address \nthe complete and total lack of ethics at this agency. I would also like \nto take this time to thank Senator Nelson for his outstanding work on \nthis bill. I know there are few people out there that show as much \ndedication and clear vision on this issue as he does.\n  The cries of Drill! Drill! Drill! have reached a fevered pitch and \nproponents of drilling say that a profitable relationship between the \nGovernment and the oil industry will benefit everyone involved.\n  However, as we have recently learned from reports released by the \nDepartment of Interior Inspector General's Office, the influence of Big \nOil corrupts absolutely. Honestly, we have been learning that lesson \nover and over again since we sent an oil man to the White House. The \ninfluence of Big Oil has led us to make policy decisions that are \ndiametrically opposed to the best interests of this country. With \nbarrels of Big Oil lobbying money, this administration has led us all \nhead first into policies that benefit Big Oil and almost no one else. \nWe are more addicted to oil than ever before and we continue with this \naddiction to the detriment of our economy, our energy infrastructure, \nour environment, and even our national security.\n  Once Big Oil is involved, it is as if all reason flies out the \nwindow. Nowhere has this become clearer than at the Minerals Management \nService. The most recent reports from the Inspector General's office \ndescribe corruption at MMS on a level difficult to believe. The \ndescriptions of drug use and sexual activity between oil company \nrepresentatives and MMS employees are not suitable for network \ntelevision, much less the floor of the United States Senate. This is \nthe agency tasked with leasing Federal lands to oil companies and \nensuring the adequate compensation of such leasing and yet their \nemployees behaved like oil company lackeys with complete disregard for \nthe interests of the American taxpayer.\n  I am sure no one is surprised by the increased influence of the oil \nindustry since we elected a former oil man to the White House, but this \nis truly beyond the pale. The Inspector General's report concludes that \nMMS is plagued by ``a culture of ethical failure.'' This is an agency \nwhere conflict of interest is not only the norm, but where officials do \nnot think the rules even apply to them. This is an agency with a \ncomplete free-for-all atmosphere where employees go on golf and ski \noutings, concerts, and sporting events all paid for by oil executives. \nThis is an agency whose culture is ``devoid of both ethical standards \nand internal controls'' where officials are LITERALLY and figuratively \nin bed with industry.\n\n[[Page S9283]]\n\n  This is the agency that we want to trust with our shorelines. This is \nthe agency we want to trust to lease thousands of miles of our beaches \nto the oil industry and then collect compensation for use of that \npublic land--OUR LAND--with oil and gas. The Government Accountability \nOffice has already released reports that concluded that MMS has no idea \nif they are collecting the right amount of oil through the Royalty-in-\nKind program. Not only that, but the agency has refused to institute \nthe reforms recommended by GAO in order to collect the correct amount \nof compensation from the oil industry. Of course, considering the \nInspector General's report, their lack of reform is not surprising as \nthey were too busy living the high life on the oil industry's dime.\n  This agency is clearly in desperate need of regulation. If the \nofficials at MMS believe that the rules do not apply to them, then \nclearly we need tougher rules. That is why I rise today with my \ncolleague Senator Nelson from Florida to introduce legislation that \nwill dramatically toughen the ethics rules for employees at the \nMinerals Management Service.\n  First, this legislation holds MMS employees to the same standards as \nfederal procurement officials and addresses the revolving door between \nthe agency and industry. There would be a one year ban on agency \nemployees taking any private sector job for companies the \nemployee worked with while a federal employee. This means ANY job, not \njust ``representational activities'' such as lobbying. Any real first \ncrack at reform has to be stopping this revolving door.\n\n  Second, this legislation requires that MMS employees divest all \nindustry investments before working at MMS. Currently, the law only \nrequires that employees recuse themselves from working on a matter \nspecifically having to do with a particular company in which they have \na financial stake. Needless to say, trusting MMS employees who believe \nthe rules do not apply to them and that the agency is here to serve the \nneeds of industry seems unrealistic at best and downright dangerous at \nworst.\n  Third, we would increase the number of MMS employees required to file \npublic financial disclosure forms and forms revealing past employment. \nThose who earn incomes at the base level of a G-13 employee or higher \nwill now have to reveal this information.\n  Currently, only employees compensated at 120 percent of GS15 level or \nmore must disclose. However, as this report makes clear, the extreme \ninfluence of industry on the agency means that employees beyond merely \nthe top officials need to be held to a higher standard of objectivity.\n  Of course, as I mentioned, the issues at MMS do not end with the \nethical standards, or lack thereof, among agency employees. The \nRoyalty-In-Kind Program is broken and the Federal Government is not \nbeing compensated for the leasing of land to the oil industry. This \nprogram is part of the second largest source of revenue for the Federal \nGovernment, yet it currently operates on what basically amounts to an \nhonor system. We are supposed to trust the oil companies to pay the \nright amount and for the employees to see that the Government receives \ncompensation.\n  Therefore, our legislation would suspend the Royalty-In-Kind program \nuntil the following conditions are met. First, the MMS must conduct a \ncomprehensive review to determine if it has been accurately collecting \nroyalties and report its finding to Congress. We all know the oil \nindustry is flush with cash, so there is absolutely no excuse for them \nto use OUR LAND to make a profit and not pay for it.\n  Second, the MMS must conduct a thorough review to ensure that \nmetering equipment properly measure what royalties are owed to the \nFederal Government and report those findings to Congress. In addition, \nthey will be required to perform no less than 550 audits of oil and gas \nleases each fiscal year to assure adequate royalties are being \ncollected. There needs to be a real process in place to ensure adequate \ncompensation.\n  Third, they must also have a robust training program for their \nemployees ending with a signed certification that MMS employees \nunderstand ethics laws and regulations. It needs to be abundantly clear \nto all agency employees and officials that no matter who is in the \nWhite House the rules most definitely apply to them.\n  Last, the MMS must create a position for an ombudsman that will \nmonitor the agency's progress in carrying out all these reforms. This \nombudsman must be hired by and report exclusively to the Department of \nInterior Inspector General's office because there must be an objective \noutside source to protect us from this type of corruption happening \nagain. The Inspector General will also be tasked with determining \nwhether the Royalty-In-Kind program is even saving the taxpayers money \nat all.\n  Clearly, some type of reform at MMS is desperately needed. I believe \nthe bill Senator Nelson and I are introducing will go a long way \ntowards addressing these concerns. No matter what, I do not see how we \ncan in good conscience open up thousands of miles of our precious \ncoastlines to the oil industry without being able to trust the agency \ntasked with protecting our interests.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, today Senator Robert Menendez \nand I filed legislation that would address the morass of ethical \nproblems that have besieged the Minerals Management Service, MMS.\n  I have warned publicly that we could not trust the oil companies that \nwant to drill in the waters off our most protected coastlines nor could \nwe trust the Federal watchdogs charged with keeping a watchful eye over \nthem. We have seen proof in report after report detailing \nmismanagement, a lack of control, and inappropriate, even possibly \ncriminal, behavior.\n  I have voiced serious doubts about the integrity and cost \neffectiveness of this Royalty-In-Kind program, where oil companies pay \nthe Federal Government with mineral, oil, or gas they produce on public \nlands, rather than cash. This program was authorized in the 2005 Energy \nbill, which I opposed for many reasons.\n  The bill that we introduced today seeks to restore integrity in \nmanaging our offshore energy resources.\n  Specifically, our bill requires employees of the Minerals Management \nService to adhere to the same ethical guidelines that other Federal \nemployees abide by. This means no gifts from industry, the filing of \nfinancial disclosure forms for some higher level employees, and the \ndivestment of all industry investments before working at MMS.\n  The bill suspends the scandal-plagued Royalty-in-Kind program until \nthese conditions are met. Additionally, MMS must review the accuracy of \nits royalty collection program with an independent watchdog to monitor \nits progress. Finally, MMS is required to conduct extensive audits of \nthe Royalty-In-Kind program to ensure the government is receiving fair \ncompensation for use of public lands.\n  Offshore drilling will not solve our energy crisis nor will it bring \ndown prices at the pump. Instead, it will only serve to further enrich \nthe oil companies and reward the culture of corruption that has been \nfostered, funded, and now exposed at the Department of the Interior. I \nhope the Senate will consider our legislation expeditiously.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK:\n  S. 3546. A bill to establish the National Center for Strategic \nCommunication to advise the President regarding public diplomacy and \ninternational broadcasting to promote democracy and human rights, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, one might conclude from the last 7 \nyears without a successful al Qaeda attack in America either that we \nhave crippled our enemies or that the terrorist threat is overstated. \nUnfortunately, neither is true: violence is rising in Afghanistan, \nPakistan and elsewhere, and the ideas behind this violence continue to \nproliferate from Europe to Asia and across the World Wide Web. But \nwhile we spend a great deal of time discussing tactics and troop \ndeployments, we rarely analyze the broader ideological struggle.\n  Military force may sometimes be necessary in the war on terrorism, \nbut force alone cannot defeat the threat posed by violent Islamist \nextremism. Recognizing this fact, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \nworries about the\n\n[[Page S9284]]\n\nstate of the ``war of ideas'' and rightly points out that it is ``plain \nembarrassing'' that al Qaeda communicates more effectively than we do.\n  The answer to this problem is not more money. We have spent billions \nsince 9/11 on a wide array of public diplomacy initiatives, \ninternational broadcasts and information and exchange programs. Some \nsucceeded, others failed, but none were developed in accordance with a \nnational strategy overseen by an official who is accountable for making \nstrategic communications work.\n  The U.S. Information Agency focused on strategic communications \nduring the Cold War. After the defeat of communism, USIA's mission \nseemed fulfilled, and I supported its dismantlement. Today's \nideological threats, however, demand the same focus on strategic \ncommunications that the USIA provided a generation ago. Today, I am \nintroducing legislation that would establish a new National Center for \nStrategic Communications to correct a number of deficiencies and meet \n21st century challenges.\n  There are several reasons why I believe major reforms are necessary. \nFirst, fundamentally, we are not on offense. Seven years after \nSeptember 11, we have only begun to acknowledge the existence of a war \nof ideas. We need to move from merely informing the world about America \nto countering those who support terrorism and violence. We also need to \nenable moderate voices around the world to help us in opposing violent \nextremism.\n  Second, we need to separate official diplomacy--by which I mean the \nact of communicating with foreign governments--from public diplomacy--\nwhich means talking to foreign publics. When we dismantled USIA, we \nthought the result would be better coordination between official and \npublic diplomacy. We now know that this arrangement has relegated \npublic diplomacy to second-tier status. We need to ensure that such a \ncrucial part of the war on terrorism receives the attention and \npriority level that it deserves.\n  Third, our strategic communications programs lack transparency and \naccountability. Despite spending hundreds of millions per year on \ninternational broadcasting, it is unclear how these broadcasts fit into \na national strategic communications plan or how the Broadcasting Board \nof Governors makes decisions on allocating the resources Congress \nappropriates. The same could be said of the State Department's \nEducational and Cultural Affairs programs. Moreover, it is nearly \nimpossible to determine how much the Department of Defense is spending \non strategic communications activities and how many of those functions \nmight be performed--or at least better supported--by other parts of the \ngovernment.\n  Beyond government programs, it is clear that the U.S. Government does \nnot effectively leverage the resources of the private sector and \nnonprofit groups. We should be able to promote our values and oppose \nviolence and extremism alongside organizations that already work along \nthe same lines. And there is no question that there are times when \nthese outside voices will be more persuasive than the messages linked \nto Washington, DC.\n  These problems call for something beyond a bigger budget or the \ngeneric cry for better coordination among departments and agencies. We \nneed to realign authorities so that the President has a single \nindividual responsible for ensuring that the Nation's strategic \ncommunications goals are being met. We need that individual to be \nresponsible for an agency that has a clear mission to fight and win the \nwar of ideas and the budgetary authority and flexibility to match.\n  My proposal abolishes the existing Undersecretary for Public \nDiplomacy at the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors, transferring their functions to the new National Center for \nStrategic Communications where they would be managed by single \ndirector. The Director would report to the President as the Nation's \ntop strategic communications official and oversee the creation of a new \nnational strategic communications strategy. Just as important, the \nDirector will oversee an interagency panel of representatives from \nother Federal agencies and departments, including the Department of \nDefense, whose missions inherently involve strategic communications \nwith foreign publics.\n  More than providing information about America, the goal of strategic \ncommunications should be nothing less than the ability to persuade \nindividuals all over the world to choose freedom, human rights and the \nrule of law over any challenging ideologies or philosophies. My \nlegislation would correct a number of deficiencies in our current \nstructure in support of this objective.\n  First, the new Center would separate public diplomacy--speaking to \nforeign publics--from official diplomacy--speaking to foreign \ngovernments. We should not let public diplomacy be held hostage to the \nofficial priority of the moment, nor should public diplomacy budgets \ncompete with official diplomatic priorities.\n  Second, the Center would manage U.S. international broadcasts \ndirectly. Too often in the last few years, taxpayer-funded broadcasts \nhave been kept at arms length from government oversight and undermined \nrather than affirmed U.S. policies and values. My legislation makes our \nbroadcasts more transparent and focused on the national mission by \ngiving the Center close oversight of our broadcasts and abolishing \noutdated Smith-Mundt Act provisions that keep the American public from \nknowing what the government is saying abroad.\n  Third, the Center enlists the support of private, non-profit and non-\ngovernmental organizations. There is no reason to believe the U.S. \nGovernment must always deliver key messages, and outside groups may \nhave the best ability to counter ideological support for extremism. My \nproposal enables the new Center to make grants to such groups and \nplaces representatives of the Center in key countries around the globe \nto implement our national strategy on a local level.\n  Our vision of a free, prosperous and peaceful world is under attack \nfrom extremists who propose endless violence and fear. Military force \nmay keep these extremists at bay for a time, but ultimate victory \ndepends on winning the war of ideas. Though some would throw more money \nat our strategic communications problems or settle for smaller, \nmarginal reforms, I believe major reforms are necessary for us to \nsucceed. I look forward to developing this proposal with the next \nadministration and the new Congress. No matter who ends up in power, we \nwill have a share in reforms that can help win the war on terror \nwithout just relying on more bullets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9284-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9284-S9285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 678--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \n                     OVARIAN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mrs. Dole, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Bayh, Mrs. \nClinton, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Collins, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. \nWhitehouse) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. MENENDEZ (for Mrs. Murray (for herself and Mr. Burr)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill S. 2932, to amend the Public Health \nService Act to reauthorize the poison center national toll-free number, \nnational media campaign, and grant program to\n\n[[Page S9325]]\n\nprovide assistance for poison prevention, sustain the funding of poison \ncenters, and enhance the public health of people of the United States; \nas follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Poison Center Support, \n     Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Poison control centers are the primary defense of the \n     United States against injury and deaths from poisoning. \n     Twenty-four hours a day, the general public as well as health \n     care practitioners contact their local poison control centers \n     for help in diagnosing and treating victims of poisoning. In \n     2007, more than 4,000,000 calls were managed by poison \n     control centers providing ready and direct access for all \n     people of the United States, including many underserved \n     populations in the United States, with vital emergency public \n     health information and response.\n       (2) Poisoning is the second most common form of \n     unintentional death in the United States. In any given year, \n     there will be between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 poison \n     exposures. Sixty percent of these exposures will involve \n     children under the age of 6 who are exposed to toxins in \n     their home. Poisoning accounts for 285,000 hospitalizations, \n     1,200,000 days of acute hospital care, and more than 26,000 \n     fatalities in 2005.\n       (3) In 2008, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center \n     reported that poisonings from accidents and unknown \n     circumstances more than tripled in rate since 1990. In 2005, \n     the last year for which data are available, 26,858 people \n     died from accidental or unknown poisonings. This represents \n     an increase of 20,000 since 1990 and an increase of 2,400 \n     between 2004 and 2005. Fatalities from poisoning are \n     increasing in the United States in near epidemic proportions. \n     The funding of programs to reverse this trend is needed now \n     more than ever.\n       (4) In 2004, The Institute of Medicine of the National \n     Academy of Sciences recommended that ``Congress should amend \n     the current Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness \n     Act Amendments of 2003 to provide sufficient funding to \n     support the proposed Poison Prevention and Control System \n     with its national network of poison centers. Support for the \n     core activities at the current level of service is estimated \n     to require more than $100 million annually.''.\n       (5) Sustaining the funding structure and increasing \n     accessibility to poison control centers will promote the \n     utilization of poison control centers and reduce the \n     inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other \n     more costly health care services. The 2004 Institute of \n     Medicine Report to Congress determined that for every $1 \n     invested in the Nation's poison control centers $7 of health \n     care costs are saved. In 2005, direct Federal health care \n     program savings totaled in excess of $525,000,000 as the \n     result of poison control center public health services.\n       (6) More than 30 percent of the cost savings and financial \n     benefits of the Nation's network of poison control centers \n     are realized annually by Federal health care programs \n     (estimated to be more than $1,000,000,000), yet Federal \n     funding support (as demonstrated by the annual authorization \n     of $30,100,000 in Public Law 108-194) comprises less than 11 \n     percent of the annual network expenditures of poison centers.\n       (7) Real-time data collected from the Nation's certified \n     poison control centers can be an important source of \n     information for the detection, monitoring, and response for \n     contamination of the air, water, pharmaceutical, or food \n     supply.\n       (8) In the event of a terrorist event, poison control \n     centers will be relied upon as a critical source for accurate \n     medical information and public health emergency response \n     concerning the treatment of patients who have had an exposure \n     to a chemical, radiological, or biological agent.\n\n     SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF POISON CONTROL CENTERS NATIONAL \n                   TOLL-FREE NUMBER.\n\n       Section 1271 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300d-71) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 1271.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Child pornography is estimated to be a multibillion \n     dollar industry of global proportions, facilitated by the \n     growth of the Internet.\n       (2) Data has shown that 83 percent of child pornography \n     possessors had images of children younger than 12 years old, \n     39 percent had images of children younger than 6 years old, \n     and 19 percent had images of children younger than 3 years \n     old.\n       (3) Child pornography is a permanent record of a child's \n     abuse and the distribution of child pornography images \n     revictimizes the child each time the image is viewed.\n       (4) Child pornography is readily available through \n     virtually every Internet technology, including Web sites, \n     email, instant messaging, Internet Relay Chat, newsgroups, \n     bulletin boards, and peer-to-peer.\n       (5) The technological ease, lack of expense, and anonymity \n     in obtaining and distributing child pornography over the \n     Internet has resulted in an explosion in the \n     multijurisdictional distribution of child pornography.\n       (6) The Internet is well recognized as a method of \n     distributing goods and services across State lines.\n       (7) The transmission of child pornography using the \n     Internet constitutes transportation in interstate commerce.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6984, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6984) to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to extend authorizations for the airport improvement program, \n     to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the \n     funding and expenditure authority of the Airport and Airway \n     Trust Fund, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the FAA's \nDisadvantaged Business Enterprise, DBE, Program and the Airport \nConcessions Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, ACDBE, Program. As we \nare all aware, case law over the past decade has made clear that \nFederal race-conscious programs are subject to strict constitutional \nscrutiny to ensure that programs serve a compelling governmental \ninterest and are narrowly tailored to address that interest. Gender-\nconscious programs must meet heightened scrutiny to ensure that there \nis an exceedingly persuasive justification for the program. Still, \nunder any reading of constitutional law, race- and gender-conscious \nprograms are clearly permitted to remedy current discrimination and the \npresent-day effects of past discrimination where there is a strong \nbasis in evidence that such discrimination exists. As the Commerce \nCommittee is aware, discrimination in business practices continues to \nbe a serious problem. There are countless disparity studies and \nexaminations of this topic and for that reason we have made only minor \nchanges to the DBE and ACDBE program over time. Taken as a whole, the \nquantitative and qualitative evidence clearly suggests that \ndiscrimination remains a serious problem in our Nation.\n  I serve both as a member of the Commerce Committee and as chairman of \nthe Senate Small Business Committee. In these roles, I have the \nopportunity to review enormous amounts of information about \ndiscrimination against women and minority entrepreneurs throughout our \neconomy and across our Nation. While we have made very real progress \nover the time that I have been in the Senate, there is no doubt that a \nlot of work remains to be done. Programs such as the DBE and ACDBE \nprograms are making an important difference by offering real \nopportunities to companies that otherwise might not ever get a chance \nto compete. These programs are critically important in airport-related \nindustries as well as in other areas of Federal contracting.\n  The statistics are telling. On May 22, 2007, I held a hearing in the \nSmall Business Committee addressing the effectiveness of SBA's programs \nfor minority businesses. One economist who testified, Dr. Jon \nWainwright, presented a number of troubling statistics to the \ncommittee. For instance, he explained that according to the most recent \neconomic census data available, while African Americans constitute 12.7 \npercent of the population, they own only 5.3 percent of businesses and \nthose businesses account for only 1 percent of business sales and \nreceipts. Latinos are 13.4 percent of the population, but only 7 \npercent of businesses and 2.5 percent of business sales and receipts. \nDr. Wainwright also noted that Asian and Pacific Islanders own 5 \npercent of businesses but earned only 3.8 percent of business sales and \nreceipts and Native Americans constituted .9 percent of the\n\n[[Page S9339]]\n\nbusiness population but earned only .3 percent of business sales and \nreceipts. For women the numbers are also shocking: women constitute \n50.9 percent of the population but own only 28.9 percent of businesses \nand receive only 10.7 percent of business sales and receipts.\n  Dr. Wainwright went on to explain that these disparities in business \nownership and earnings exist in all 50 States and the District of \nColumbia and that similar outcomes had been evident in all previous \nversions of this same survey over the past 35 years. He also stated \nthat he had conducted further analyses to determine whether the types \nof disparities he had observed were caused by discrimination or some \nother factor. He explained that he had conducted regression analyses to \naccount for geography, industry, labor market status, age, and \neducation among other factors. Even when this regression analysis was \nconducted, the disparities remained large, negative, and statistically \nsignificant for African Americans, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islander \nAmericans, Native Americans, and women suggesting that race and gender \ndiscrimination are the cause.\n  Also troubling were Dr. Wainwright's comments on small business \nfinance issues. We know that credit is the lifeblood of \nentrepreneurship, but it turns out that minority business owners are \nfar more likely to be denied credit than nonminority owners. Dr. \nWainwright explained that these findings held up even when regression \nanalyses were conducted to adjust for a number of balance sheet, credit \nhistory, and other characteristics. And Dr. Wainwright found that women \nwere also likely to face some discrimination in credit markets. Dr. \nWainwright was only one witness at the May 22 hearing and there were \nseveral others whose testimony was equally compelling. The fact is that \ndiscrimination remains a very serious problem in Federal contracting \nmarkets across this country.\n  More recently, on September 11, 2008, our committee held another \nhearing on discrimination against minority- and women-owned businesses \nwhich focused on discrimination in access to capital. During the \nhearing we heard testimony from several witnesses about the serious \nbarriers that minority- and women-owned businesses confront when \nattempting to obtain capital to start up, grow, and flourish. In the \ncontext of the FAA extension bill before us today, I want to \nspecifically highlight the testimony of Don O'Bannon who is the current \nchair of the Airport Minority Advisory Council or AMAC. Mr. O'Bannon \nexplained that, in his experience, access to capital is an enormous \nhurdle for minority- and women-owned businesses in airport-related \nindustries. He gave us specific real-life examples of firms that had \nattempted to obtain both venture capital and more conventional debt \ncapital and encountered extraordinary barriers due to discrimination \nthat compromised their ability to grow and succeed.\n  Of course, there are many other sources of information about \ndiscrimination in contracting. Literally hundreds of disparity studies \nhave been conducted around the country that contain compelling \nstatistical data about discrimination in the public and private \nmarketplaces related to airport-related contracting. Just a few of the \nstudies that have been conducted recently and include airport-related \ndata were put into the record by Mr. O'Bannon during our recent \nhearing. These include: ``Race, Sex and Business Enterprise: Evidence \nfrom Denver, CO,'' NERA Economic Consulting, May 5, 2006; ``Dallas/Fort \nWorth International Airport Board Disparity Study Final Report,'' MGT \nof America, October 17, 2000; ``The City of Phoenix, Minority-, Women-\nOwned and Small Business Enterprise Program Update Study: Final \nReport,'' MGT of America, April 21, 2005; ``Race, Sex and Business \nEnterprise: Evidence from the State of Maryland,'' NERA Economic \nConsulting, March 8, 2006; ``Final Report: Broward County Small \nDisadvantaged Business Enterprise (SDBE) Disparity Study,'' MGT of \nAmerica, Inc., April 3, 2001; and ``Final Report for Development and \nRevision of Small, Minority and Women Business Enterprise Program, \nNashville International Airport, (BNA),'' Griffin and Strong, PC, \nSeptember 19, 2007. There are hundreds of additional studies, including \nmany relevant studies that cover entities other than airports but that \nanalyze the same industries and enterprise populations that do airport-\nrelated work.\n  But the statistics can only tell part of the story. Overlooked \naspects of disparity studies are the sections that address anecdotal \nevidence. These are the accounts that individual business people give \nabout the challenges they confront in doing business. When you read \nthese studies, it quickly becomes clear that discrimination remains a \nproblem at literally every stage of the business process. It is harder \nfor women and minority entrepreneurs to start companies. They often are \ndenied credit even when they have the same creditworthiness of male, \nnonminority entrepreneurs. And because of past discrimination, minority \nentrepreneurs often do not have access to family wealth. As one \nAfrican-American contractor reported in a study about discrimination in \nthe state of Massachusetts:\n\n       Now I go to the bank--again I've been in business for 28 \n     years, I've been very successful at times--I go to the bank \n     and say ``Okay. I need a $250,000 line of credit.'' I walk \n     out of there with $50,000. A [White] gentleman that used to \n     work with me was a former partner of mine, left, went to the \n     same bank, and walked away with $1.2 million. Okay? Now he \n     walked away because his house is not mortgaged. So he has \n     equity that they can touch to go back if he doesn't make \n     payments. They are looking at me and saying, ``He's already \n     leveraged himself. He doesn't have anything that I can \n     touch.'' So they don't want to give me any money. And not \n     that the fact of my business--my business is very solid. It's \n     just they won't give it to me because I started with nothing \n     and I've taken everything I've had and put it into the \n     businesses. They still think I'm worth nothing. That's . . . \n     discrimination . . . which is where minorities and women who \n     start from scratch and build their businesses up, that's \n     where we get hurt. That's where it comes back to backfire, \n     because we don't have that same leverage that somebody who \n     either inherited a business or had family that gave them land \n     or some sort of inheritance that they got some money.\n\n  That is from ``Race, Sex and Business Enterprise: Evidence from the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts,'' Volume 1, NERA Economic Consulting, at \n218-219.\n  Even once minorities and women manage to start up a business they \nface serious discrimination in every stage of the contracting process. \nSometimes that discrimination comes in the form of explicit gender or \nracial harassment. In a study dealing with the State of Texas, one \nHispanic-American woman business owner related the following story:\n\n        Some [of my male colleagues] do not want to work with a \n     woman. They feel they are wasting their time. [On one \n     occasion] a guy took me to check on a project, and when he \n     got out of his truck, he wanted me to touch him. I said, \n     ``Come on, let's get back to work.'' I had to be very strong \n     with him. There are not many women builders in the \n     residential construction industry either.\n\n  That is from ``Update of the State of Texas Disparity Study,'' Mason \nTillman Associates, Ltd., January 2007, at 9-8.\n  Another Hispanic-American woman contractor in Texas explained that \nsometimes the discrimination is not so direct, but it is still \nunmistakable. She stated:\n\n       As a young woman, there have been several occasions where I \n     was told that if I really wanted an award, there were other \n     ways I could get it. This was not said directly to me, it was \n     implied [by] a White male [manager] at a [State] university.\n\n  That is from ``Update of the State of Texas Disparity Study,'' Mason \nTillman Associates, Ltd., January 2007, at 9-8.\n  Sometimes the harassment rises to the level of threats of violence \nagainst a business owner or their property. In the NERA Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts study, one African-American businessman even gave an \naccount of a threat to blow up his truck.\n\n  That is from ``Race, Sex and Business Enterprise: Evidence from the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, Volume 1,'' NERA Economic Consulting, at \n219.\n  Even when discrimination does not involve explicit harassment or \nthreats, it still poses barriers to minority and women business owners. \nUnfortunately, the ``old boy network'' continues to be a problem in \nmany industries. An analysis of the experiences of business owners in a \nstudy of contracting by the airport in Nashville, TN, demonstrates that \ndiscrimination not only hurts minority- and women-owned businesses, but \nit can also drive up the price of doing business:\n\n\n[[Page S9340]]\n\n\n       [One business owner] said his firm has tried to get in on \n     airport work and, in one instance, partnered with a much more \n     experienced firm to get into one particular area of \n     construction only to find that ``a couple of firms had a lock \n     on it''. According to [this firm], it is hard to get jobs \n     because people tend to use the same companies. [The business \n     owner] said he believes that subcontractors tell ``their'' \n     bidders where to come in with their numbers and they tell \n     them where they can make up the difference on the project and \n     how to pursue change orders. By the end of a project, his \n     competitors have been paid more than his original estimate, \n     which was rejected for being too high.\n\n  That is from ``Final Report for Development and Revision of Small, \nMinority and Women Business Enterprise Program, Nashville International \nAirport,'' BNA, Griffin and Strong, PC, September 19, 2007, at 163.\n  Another business owner in Nashville was explicit about the informal \nnetworks that impose barriers on minority businesses and the need for \nprograms like the DBE and ACDBE program to address these impediments. \nThe study stated:\n\n       According to [one business owner], the airport made a \n     mistake in disbanding SMWBE requirements because there are \n     still a lot of ``good old boys'' playing golf and the like. \n     Having a diversity manager helps ``level the playing field'' \n     and provides ``checks and balances''.\n\n  That is from ``Final Report for Development and Revision of Small, \nMinority and Women Business Enterprise Program, Nashville International \nAirport,'' BNA, Griffin and Strong, PC, September 19, 2007, at 164.\n  Another point that these studies make clear is that discrimination \nagainst business owners is something that is experienced by all \nminority groups and women. It is not limited to only some groups. One \nstudy summarized its analysis of anecdotal evidence as follows:\n\n       Nineteen percent of the respondents indicated that they had \n     experienced discrimination because of race, ethnicity, or \n     gender on one or more occasions (three percent very often, 10 \n     percent sometimes, and six percent seldom). Forty percent \n     reported they had not experienced discrimination. The fact \n     that 19 percent of respondents reported experiencing \n     discrimination on at least an occasional basis suggests that \n     discrimination is not confined to isolated incidents. The 19 \n     percent that experienced discrimination account for 63 \n     surveyed respondents categorized as follows: 22 African \n     Americans, 17 Hispanic Americans, 16 non-minority females, \n     two Asian Americans, two non-minority males, and one Native \n     American. Three people reported discriminatory incidents but \n     did not indicate their demographic background.\n\n  That is from ``Final Report: Broward County Small Disadvantaged \nBusiness Enterprise (SDBE) Disparity Study,'' MGT of America, Inc., \nApril 3, 2001, at 6-30.\n  These examples I have given are but a few from the voluminous body of \nresearch about race and gender discrimination in business. The evidence \nis troubling and should cause all of us to redouble our efforts to \nensure that we do everything we can to eliminate the barriers \nconfronted by women and minority business owners. The DBE and ACDBE \nprogram are indispensable tools in this effort.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Poison Center Support, \n     Enhancement, and Awareness Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Poison control centers are the primary defense of the \n     United States against injury and deaths from poisoning. \n     Twenty-four hours a day, the general public as well as health \n     care practitioners contact their local poison control centers \n     for help in diagnosing and treating victims of poisoning. In \n     2007, more than 4,000,000 calls were managed by poison \n     control centers providing ready and direct access for all \n     people of the United States, including many underserved \n     populations in the United States, with vital emergency public \n     health information and response.\n       (2) Poisoning is the second most common form of \n     unintentional death in the United States. In any given year, \n     there will be between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 poison \n     exposures. Sixty percent of these exposures will involve \n     children under the age of 6 who are exposed to toxins in \n     their home. Poisoning accounts for 285,000 hospitalizations, \n     1,200,000 days of acute hospital care, and more than 26,000 \n     fatalities in 2005.\n       (3) In 2008, the Harvard Injury Control Research Center \n     reported that poisonings from accidents and unknown \n     circumstances more than tripled in rate since 1990. In 2005, \n     the last year for which data are available, 26,858 people \n     died from accidental or unknown poisonings. This represents \n     an increase of 20,000 since 1990 and an increase of 2,400 \n     between 2004 and 2005. Fatalities from poisoning are \n     increasing in the United States in near epidemic proportions. \n     The funding of programs to reverse this trend is needed now \n     more than ever.\n       (4) In 2004, The Institute of Medicine of the National \n     Academy of Sciences recommended that ``Congress should amend \n     the current Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness \n     Act Amendments of 2003 to provide sufficient funding to \n     support the proposed Poison Prevention and Control System \n     with its national network of poison centers. Support for the \n     core activities at the current level of service is estimated \n     to require more than $100 million annually.''.\n       (5) Sustaining the funding structure and increasing \n     accessibility to poison control centers will promote the \n     utilization of poison control centers and reduce the \n     inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other \n     more costly health care services. The 2004 Institute of \n     Medicine Report to Congress determined that for every $1 \n     invested in the Nation's poison control centers $7 of health \n     care costs are saved. In 2005, direct Federal\n\n[[Page S9341]]\n\n     health care program savings totaled in excess of $525,000,000 \n     as the result of poison control center public health \n     services.\n       (6) More than 30 percent of the cost savings and financial \n     benefits of the Nation's network of poison control centers \n     are realized annually by Federal health care programs \n     (estimated to be more than $1,000,000,000), yet Federal \n     funding support (as demonstrated by the annual authorization \n     of $30,100,000 in Public Law 108-194) comprises less than 11 \n     percent of the annual network expenditures of poison centers.\n       (7) Real-time data collected from the Nation's certified \n     poison control centers can be an important source of \n     information for the detection, monitoring, and response for \n     contamination of the air, water, pharmaceutical, or food \n     supply.\n       (8) In the event of a terrorist event, poison control \n     centers will be relied upon as a critical source for accurate \n     medical information and public health emergency response \n     concerning the treatment of patients who have had an exposure \n     to a chemical, radiological, or biological agent.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 540\n\n       Whereas, on September 17, 1787, the Constitution of the \n     United States was adopted,\n\n[[Page S9345]]\n\n     and article I, section 9 declared that Congress could \n     prohibit the importation of slaves into the United States in \n     the year 1808;\n       Whereas, in 1794, the United States Congress passed ``An \n     Act to prohibit the carrying on the Slave Trade from the \n     United States to any foreign place or country'', approved \n     March 22, 1794 (1 Stat. 347), thus beginning the efforts of \n     the United States to halt the slave trade;\n       Whereas, on May 10, 1800, Congress enacted a law that \n     outlawed all participation by people in the United States in \n     the international trafficking of slaves and authorized the \n     United States Navy to seize vessels flying the flag of the \n     United States engaged in the slave trade;\n       Whereas, on March 2, 1807, President Thomas Jefferson \n     signed into law ``An Act to prohibit the importation of \n     slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the \n     United States, from and after the first of January, in the \n     year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eight'' (2 \n     Stat. 426);\n       Whereas, on January 1, 1808, the prohibition on the \n     importation of slaves into the United States took effect;\n       Whereas, on March 3, 1819, Congress authorized the Navy to \n     cruise the coast of Africa to suppress the slave trade, \n     declaring that Africans on captured ships be placed under \n     Federal jurisdiction and authorizing the President to appoint \n     an agent in Africa to facilitate the return of captured \n     Africans to the continent;\n       Whereas, in 1819, the Royal Navy of Great Britain \n     established the West Coast of Africa as a separate naval \n     station and actively plied the waters in pursuit of slave \n     ships, and Great Britain negotiated with many other countries \n     to obtain the right to search vessels suspected of engaging \n     in the slave trade;\n       Whereas, on May 15, 1820, Congress declared the trading of \n     slaves to be an act of piracy and that those convicted of \n     trading slaves were subject to the death penalty;\n       Whereas the Webster-Ashburton Treaty between Great Britain \n     and the United States, signed August 9, 1842, provided that \n     both countries would maintain separate naval squadrons on the \n     coast of Africa to enforce their respective laws against the \n     slave trade;\n       Whereas, in 1843, the newly formed United States African \n     Squadron sailed for Africa and remained in operation until \n     the Civil War erupted in 1861;\n       Whereas, in 1859, the USS Constellation, the last all-sail \n     vessel designed and built by the United States Navy, sailed \n     to West Africa as the flagship of the United States African \n     Squadron, which consisted of 8 ships, including 4 steam-\n     powered vessels suitable for chasing down and capturing slave \n     ships;\n       Whereas, on December 21, 1859, the USS Constellation \n     captured the brig Delicia after a 10-hour chase, and although \n     the Delicia had no human cargo on board upon capture, the \n     crew had been preparing the ship to take on slaves;\n       Whereas, on the night of September 25, 1860, the USS \n     Constellation spotted the barque Cora near the mouth of the \n     Congo River and, after a dramatic moonlit chase, captured the \n     slave ship with 705 Africans crammed into her permanent \n     ``slave deck'';\n       Whereas after capturing the Cora, a detachment of the \n     Constellation's crew sailed the surviving Africans to \n     Monrovia, Liberia, a colony founded for the settlement of \n     free African-Americans, which became the destination for all \n     Africans freed on slave ships captured by the United States \n     Navy;\n       Whereas, on May 21, 1861, the USS Constellation captured \n     the brig Triton, and although the Triton did not have \n     Africans captured for slavery on board when intercepted by \n     the Constellation, a search confirmed that the ship had been \n     prepared to take on slaves;\n       Whereas the Triton, registered in Charleston, South \n     Carolina, was one of the first Union naval captures of the \n     Civil War;\n       Whereas, from 1859 to 1861, the USS Constellation and the \n     United States African Squadron captured 14 slave ships and \n     liberated nearly 4,000 Africans destined for a life of \n     servitude in the Americas, a record unsurpassed by the \n     squadron under previous commanders; and\n       Whereas, on September 25, 2008, the USS Constellation \n     Museum will hold a ceremony to commemorate the bicentennial \n     of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade aboard the \n     same ship that, 148 years before, forced the capitulation of \n     the slave ship Cora and freed the 705 Africans confined \n     within: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historical and educational significance \n     of the USS Constellation, a 153-year-old warship berthed in \n     Baltimore, Maryland, as a reminder of both the participation \n     of the United States in the slave trade and the efforts of \n     the United States Government to suppress the inhumane \n     practice;\n       (2) applauds the preservation of the historic vessel and \n     the efforts of the USS Constellation Museum to engage people \n     from all over the world with this vital part of our history;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 661, and \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 661) supporting the goals and ideals \n     of National Spina Bifida Awareness Month.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to support, with Senator \nWicker, a resolution to raise awareness about spina bifida, the most \ncommon, permanently disabling birth defect. This often devastating \nbirth defect occurs during the first month of pregnancy when the spine \nfails to close completely, leaving a permanent opening and resulting in \na multitude of serious medical complications.\n  Thanks to modern medicine and technological advances, most babies \nborn with spina bifida--1,500 to 2,000 a year--survive, and many are \nnow living longer than ever before. It is estimated that in the United \nStates no less than 70,000 people, and possibly as many as 130,000 \npeople, currently live with spina bifida. This is wonderful progress, \nbut there are substantial hurdles that can prevent those with spina \nbifida from reaching their full potential.\n  For a person with spina bifida, the body, mind, and spirit are all \nunder assault. Most children with the worst form of spina bifida must \nundergo a surgery to insert a permanent shunt to drain fluid from the \nbrain for the duration of their lives. People with spina bifida may \nendure any combination of full or partial paralysis, seizures, bladder \nand bowel problems, latex allergies, learning disabilities, depression, \nand other psychosocial issues. The promise of an extended life \nexpectancy for individuals with spina bifida may be dampened by the new \nchallenges they face in education, job training, independent living, \nhealth care for secondary conditions and aging concerns. Far more needs \nto be done to improve the quality of life for those suffering with \nspina bifida.\n  I applaud the groups that labor so diligently to offer support to the \nmany Americans with spina bifida and their families. In particular, I \nextend my gratitude to the Spina Bifida Association, which has been \ndedicated to this important issue for more than three decades. They are \nsteadfast advocates for those whose lives have been touched by spina \nbifida, working across our Nation to improve lives through education, \nresearch, and service.\n  The Spina Bifida Association, together with the National Spina Bifida \nProgram at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other \ngroups, is working hard to spread the word to the 65 million women at \nrisk of having a baby born with spina bifida. On any given day in the \nUnited States, eight births are affected by spina bifida or a similar \nbirth defect of the brain and spine. It is estimated that 70 percent of \nbirth defects such as spina bifida are preventable by consuming an \nadequate amount of folic acid prior to pregnancy. This is a simple step \nthat women can take to reduce their risk, but far more outreach and \neducation is required to reach women with this important message.\n  It is time to renew our efforts to prevent spina bifida and help the \nmany individuals and families living with spina bifida. The resolution \nwe will adopt today calls for a greater commitment to spina bifida \nprevention and to improving the quality of life of those affected by \nit, increased funding for evidence-based spina bifida research, and \nfurther development of the National Spina Bifida Patient Registry. \nTaken together, these efforts will help decrease the incidence of spina \nbifida and improve available treatments and quality of life for those \nliving with it. I wholeheartedly urge my colleagues to join with me in \nsupport of this resolution.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 661) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 661\n\n       Whereas spina bifida is the most common, permanently \n     disabling birth defect;\n       Whereas spina bifida occurs during the first month of \n     pregnancy and leaves a permanent opening in the spinal column \n     that subsequently impacts nearly every organ system;\n       Whereas an estimated 70,000 to 130,000 people in the United \n     States currently live with spina bifida;\n       Whereas all women of childbearing age are at risk of having \n     a spina bifida affected pregnancy;\n       Whereas an estimated 70 percent of neural tube defects such \n     as spina bifida can be prevented if a woman consumes adequate\n\n[[Page S9347]]\n\n     amounts of folic acid, which is found in most over-the-\n     counter multivitamins and foods rich in folate such as \n     spinach, prior to becoming pregnant;\n       Whereas Hispanic women are at the highest risk, between 1.5 \n     and 2 times higher than non-Hispanic whites, of delivering a \n     baby with spina bifida or another neural tube defect, yet are \n     the least likely to consume sufficient amounts of folic acid \n     prior to becoming pregnant;\n       Whereas people with spina bifida face unprecedented medical \n     complications associated with aging because people with spina \n     bifida are living longer than people with spina bifida in \n     previous generations lived and care for spina bifida is \n     complex and involves myriad clinical specialists;\n       Whereas a 2005 nationwide survey of spina bifida clinics \n     revealed that the current system of care serving people with \n     spina bifida does not fully meet current or anticipated needs \n     and physicians have little evidence-based research about \n     spina bifida on which to build neurological, orthopedic, or \n     urologic treatment regimens and interventions;\n       Whereas the National Spina Bifida Program, administered by \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, exists to \n     improve the health, well being, and overall quality of life \n     for the individuals and families affected by spina bifida \n     through numerous programmatic components, including the \n     National Spina Bifida Patient Registry and critical quality \n     of life research in spina bifida;\n       Whereas the National Spina Bifida Patient Registry helps to \n     improve the quality of care, to reduce morbidity and \n     mortality from spina bifida, and to increase the efficiency \n     of, and decrease the cost of, care by supporting the \n     collection of longitudinal treatment data, developing quality \n     measures and treatment standards of care and best practices, \n     identifying centers of excellence in spina bifida, evaluating \n     the clinical and cost effectiveness of the treatment of spina \n     bifida, and exchanging evidence-based information among \n     health care providers across the country; and\n       Whereas October has been designated as ``National Spina \n     Bifida Awareness Month'' to increase awareness of spina \n     bifida, of ways to prevent spina bifida, and of the need for \n     increased funding to support improving evidence-based \n     research and enhancing the quality of life of those living \n     with spina bifida: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Spina Bifida \n     Awareness Month and of national organizations working for \n     people with spina bifida;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of--\n       (A) highlighting the occurrence of spina bifida;\n       (B) recognizing the struggles and successes of people who \n     live with spina bifida; and\n       (C) advancing efforts to decrease the incidence of spina \n     bifida;\n       (3) supports the ongoing development of the National Spina \n     Bifida Patient Registry to improve lives through research and \n     to improve the treatment of spina bifida in both children and \n     adults;\n       (4) recognizes that there is a continued need for a \n     commitment of resources for efforts to reduce and prevent \n     disabling birth defects like spina bifida; and\n       (5) commends the work of national organizations that \n     educate, support, and provide hope for individuals who are \n     affected by spina bifida and their families.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/23/senate-section/article/S9347-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2008\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.
