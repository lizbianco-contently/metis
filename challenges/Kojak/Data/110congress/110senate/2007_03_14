Under the previous order, there\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\nwill now be 1 hour 10 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees prior to the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed on S.J. Res. 9, with the final \n20 minutes for the leaders and the majority leader controlling the \nfinal 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, I have 4 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Chair let me know when I have 30 seconds \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a defining moment. The American \npeople are watching. The world is watching. The issue is clear: Will we \nstand with our soldiers by changing their mission to begin to bring \nthem home or will we stand to keep our soldiers in Iraq's civil war? \nHistory will judge us. We can either continue down the President's \nperilous path or embrace a new direction. If we don't change course, we \nknow what lies ahead: more American casualties, more American death, \nand more destruction. A new strategy that makes the Iraqis less reliant \non our military is the best way forward. More of the same misguided \npolicy will result in more of the same tragedy for our military. Let's \ntry a new course and try it now.\n  We must proceed because Iraq is the overarching issue of our time. We \nare being told we need to be patient. We are being told we have to give \nthe latest escalation a chance to succeed. But we have heard it all \nbefore. We have heard for years that this administration has a plan for \nsuccess. We have heard for years that progress is just a few months \naway. We have heard for years that we have turned a corner. But the \nplans for success keep getting tossed aside for new plans, the \ntimelines for progress keep getting extended, and we have turned so \nmany corners that we have ended up back where we started: trying to \ncontrol Baghdad.\n  It is time to change direction. There are too many parents who have \nburied their children, too many children left without their father or \nmother, and too many soldiers missing arms and legs and eyes and ears. \nIt is time to change course, let the Iraqis step up to the plate and \ntake responsibility for their own future, and begin to redeploy our \ntroops out of Iraq.\n  Those of us who oppose the war are used to the administration's \nattacks. They have questioned our patriotism and called us defeatist. \nWhen we challenged the President's misguided policy, they accused us of \nhaving political motives and being partisan. They were wrong then, and \nthey are wrong now. Our motives have always been clear: to protect the \nlives of our soldiers.\n  The American people are far ahead of the administration. We have an \nobligation to stand up for our troops and stand up to our President \nwhen he stubbornly refuses to change course in Iraq. We are meeting our \nresponsibility by changing the mission of our military, not \nmicromanaging the war.\n  The recent hearings on Walter Reed should instruct us here today. \nThey tell us how little faith we can put in this administration. The \nvery people who hide behind the troops when their policies are \nquestioned have failed to keep faith with our wounded soldiers. But \njust as importantly, the hearings on Walter Reed remind us all of the \nhuman costs of the war. This administration has done all it can to hide \nthem from us. They have forbidden photographs of the coffins flown back \nfrom Iraq. The President has avoided attending the funerals of the \nfallen, and the tours at Walter Reed never included Building 18. But \nthe hearings on Walter Reed swept away all the spin and camouflage and \nput our wounded soldiers back where they belong: at the heart of our \ndebate about the war.\n  At the end of those hearings, everyone agreed that the Army had \nfailed these brave soldiers. But we failed them long before they \narrived at an Army hospital. This administration failed them when it \ntrumped up the intelligence in order to make the case for war.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  It failed them when it sent too few troops with too little armor. It \nfailed them when it turned the reconstruction of Iraq into a political \nscience project.\n  We in the Senate will fail them today if we do not vote to change \ncourse and to bring our soldiers home.\n  At the end of this debate, the American people will know where each \nof us stands. On our side of the aisle, we stand with the American \npeople. The voters told us in November to change course and begin to \nbring our troops home, and that is what we are going to do. We stand \nfor our constitutional system in which the Congress speaks for the \npeople in matters of war and peace and can require that the President \nlisten to them. Finally, we stand with our troops. We alone are \ninsisting on a policy worthy of their courage and worthy of their \nsacrifice.\n  Peace and progress in Iraq must be earned by the Iraqis and their \nneighbors. We must no longer send our brave soldiers into an uncertain \nfate on the streets of Baghdad. Bring them home to the heroes welcome \nthey have earned.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for the first 15 minutes, followed, in the order in which \npeople are recognized, by Senator Martinez for 5 minutes and Senator \nAlexander for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is this \ndividing the hour of debate on the motion to proceed?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I amend my request. Delete Senator \nMartinez; just Senator Alexander for 10 minutes. I believe that would \nleave me or other speakers an additional 5 minutes, according to the \ndivision of time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, no matter we will debate this year is as \nimportant as the future of America's involvement in Iraq. The decisions \nwe make will shape the future of the Middle East, the conduct of \nAmerican foreign relations, the security of our Nation, and the lives \nof our countrymen.\n  Just as each of us will use our best judgment to find answers to the \nproblems we face in this war, so too must we heed the moral \nimplications of our judgments regardless of the political \nramifications. Matters of war and peace impose responsibilities on us \nthat mock our other less solemn obligations in which partisan or \npersonal considerations may be expected to have a less injurious \neffect.\n  I must admit to some bewilderment at the way in which the proponents \nof the resolution authored by the majority leader have chosen to \nproceed. They do not support the President's plan to send additional \ntroops to Iraq as one element of a broader effort to stabilize that \nviolence-torn country. They believe the Senate should be on record as \nopposing the plan to augment our forces. Fair enough. Let's have this \ndebate, and if any Senator believes our Nation is embarking on a \nmisguided approach, he or she has not just the right but the obligation \nto oppose it vigorously. Such is our responsibility as elected \nofficials in a Congress that possesses the constitutional power of the \npurse.\n  Yet we debate today not legislation that would defund the war but, \nrather, a new resolution authorizing again the use of military force in \nIraq. Having authorized the President to use military force in Iraq in \n2002, the sponsors of this new resolution would attempt to legislate \nour troops' mission in midstream. They would not declare war, nor end \nit, as the Constitution provides, but micromanage it. I ask my \ncolleagues: Is such micromanagement of warfare the responsibility of \nthis body? The Supreme Court has said in the past that the conduct of \ncampaigns is the province of our Nation's executive branch, not a task \nfor lawmakers. Yet S.J. Res. 9, by choosing particular\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\nmissions for U.S. forces in Iraq and forbidding others, would attempt \nto exercise the power properly reserved for the Commander in Chief of \nour Armed Forces.\n  When Congress authorized this war, we committed America to a mission \nthat entails the greatest sacrifice a country can make, one that falls \ndisproportionately on those Americans who love their country so much \nthey volunteer to risk their lives to accomplish that mission. When we \nauthorized this war, we accepted the responsibility to make sure they \ncould prevail. When we voted to send them into battle, we asked them to \nuse every ounce of their courage and fortitude on behalf of us.\n  Now it is only right that we, the elected officials entrusted with \noverseeing the future of our soldiers' involvement, exercise a lesser \nmagnitude of courage, our political courage, on behalf of them and the \ncountry they serve. If any Senator believes that our troops' sacrifice \nis truly in vain, the dictates of conscience demand that she or he act \nto prevent it. Those who would cut off all funding for this war, though \nI disagree deeply with their position and dread its consequences, have \nthe courage of their convictions, and I respect them for it. If, on the \nother hand, you believe, as I do, that an increase of U.S. troops in \nIraq, carrying out a counterinsurgency mission and coupled with \ncritical political and economic benchmarks to be met by the Iraqi \nGovernment, provides a better--and perhaps the last--chance for success \nin Iraq, then you should give your support to this new strategy.\n  It may not be popular nor politically expedient, but we are always at \nour best when we put aside the small politics of the day in the \ninterest of our nation and the values upon which they rest.\n  Mr. President, allow me to turn to the substance of this resolution. \nAfter stating, twice, that the conflict in Iraq requires principally a \npolitical solution, it would legislate the withdrawal of U.S. forces in \nIraq. Let me ask the sponsors of this resolution precisely what \nassumption is behind this construction. Is it that all hope is lost in \nIraq, that we have lost the war and thus must bring our troops home? Or \nis it the proponents' contention that by withdrawing troops we will \nactually maximize the chances of success?\n  Can we, by withdrawing our troops from Iraq, actually increase the \nstability in Iraq rather than risk catastrophe, and induce a political \nsolution rather than make it less possible? Is success in Iraq as \nsimple as issuing redeployment orders, a move blocked only by stubborn \ncommanders and civilian authorities?\n  General David Petraeus, for one, believes that it is not. Of course \nthe dire situation in Iraq demands a political solution. That is \nundeniably true. But a political solution among the Iraqis cannot be \nsimply conjured. It is impossible for meaningful political and economic \nactivity to take place in an environment as riddled with violence as \nBaghdad is today. Security is the precondition for political and \neconomic progress, and without security, we will not see the political \nsettlement all of us agree is necessary.\n  Until the government and its coalition allies can protect the \npopulation, the Iraqi people will increasingly turn to extra-\ngovernmental forces, especially Sunni and Shiite militias, for \nprotection. Only when the government has a monopoly on the legitimate \nuse of force will its authority have meaning, and only when its \nauthority has meaning can political activity have the results we seek.\n  The presence of additional forces could allow the Iraqi government to \ndo what it cannot accomplish today on its own--impose its rule \nthroughout the country. Toward that end we have begun executing a \ntraditional counterinsurgency strategy aimed at protecting the \npopulation and controlling the violence. In bringing greater security \nto Iraq, and chiefly to Baghdad, our forces can give the government a \nfighting chance to pursue reconciliation.\n  This does not imply that reconciliation is the inevitable outcome of \na troop surge. On the contrary, there is no guarantee of success. What \nthe situation demands is not a guarantee, but rather a strategy \ndesigned to give us the best possible chance for success. This, I \nbelieve, is what the new plan represents. It gives America and the \nIraqis a better chance to avoid the catastrophic consequences of \nfailure.\n\n  Catastrophic failure is, on the other hand, what many of us fear is \non offer should the proponents of this resolution prevail. They would \nshift the focus of our commanders and troops from establishing security \nin Iraq to three limited objectives: protecting coalition personnel and \ninfrastructure, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting \ntargeted counter-terrorism operations.\n  Let us think about the implications of ordering American soldiers to \ntarget ``terrorists,'' but not those who foment sectarian violence. Was \nthe attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra a terrorist operation or the \nexpression of sectarian violence? When the Madhi Army attacks \ngovernment police stations, are they acting as terrorists or as a \nmilitia? What about when an American soldier comes across some unknown \nassailant burying an IED in the road? The obvious answer is that such \nacts very often constitute terrorism in Iraq and sectarian violence in \nIraq. The two are deeply intertwined, and that is one reason why \nprogress has been so difficult. To say that targeting terrorist \nviolence is allowable while stopping sectarian violence is illegal \nflies in the face of this reality.\n  The three limited missions contained in this resolution would \nprohibit intervention to stop genocide, should that terrible \nconsequence unfold as a result of our withdrawal. Can we really expect \nAmerican soldiers and Marines to turn their backs while ethnic \ncleansing on a Rwanda-like level of violence occurs in Baghdad? I don't \nthink it is realistic or right to expect Americans to observe another \nSrebrenica on a truly epic scale occur, and do nothing to stop it. And \nI don't think it is realistic to think that we can somehow ameliorate \nits catastrophic consequences for the rest of Iraq and the region by \ncontinuing to chase insurgents and al-Qaida terrorists on search and \ndestroy missions or stretching our forces along its borders to prevent \nother nations from intervening more forcefully to support whichever \nside they find their interests aligned with.\n  I've heard some argue that Iraq is already a catastrophe, and we need \nto get our soldiers out of the way of its consequences. To my \ncolleagues who believe this, I say, you have no idea how much worse \nthings could get, indeed, are likely to get, if we simply accede to the \nsectarian violence in Baghdad. It is a city of six million people, two \nmillion of whom are Sunni. Without U.S. forces there to attempt to \nprevent it from descending further into the sectarian warfare, and all \nof its citizens turning to the militias and insurgents to protect them, \nthe bloodshed and destruction we have witnessed to date will be but a \nsuggestion of the humanitarian calamity to come.\n  The President, under this legislation, would have to begin \nredeployments within 120 days, and nearly all troops would have to \nleave Iraq by March 31, 2008. Why were these dates chosen? Why these \nand not others? Why dates for withdrawal, rather than conditions? Such \nmandates are a retreat, not a strategy, and we should be honest about \nthe character of such a proposal.\n  Iraq is not Vietnam. We were able to walk away from Vietnam. If we \nwalk away from Iraq now, we risk a failed state in the heart of the \nMiddle East, a haven for international terrorists, an invitation to \nregional war in this economically vital area, and a humanitarian \ndisaster that could involve millions of people. If we walk away from \nIraq, we will be back--possibly in the context of a wider war in the \nworld's most volatile region.\n  All of us want to bring out troops home, and to do so as soon as \npossible. None of us, no matter how we voted on the resolution \nauthorizing this war, believes the situation that existed until \nrecently is sustainable. None of us can say we have proposed a course \nof action that will achieve certain success. The hour is late. The \nsituation is, indeed, dire.\n  But all of us have a responsibility to withstand despair to make \nsound, informed judgments about how to proceed from here, and to defer \nour own interests and political considerations to considerations of \nwhat is in the best interests of our country. Presidents don't lose \nwars. Political parties don't\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\nlose wars. Nations lose wars and nations suffer the consequences. Those \nconsequences are far graver than a lost election.\n  When a nation goes to war, a million tragedies ensue. None are more \npainful than the loss and injury of a country's finest patriots. It is \na terrible thing, war, but not the worst thing. The men and women we \nhave sent into harm's way understand that. They, not us, have endured \nthe heartache and deprivations of war so that the worst thing would not \nbefall us, so that America might be secure in her freedom, The war in \nwhich they fight has divided Congress and the American people. But it \nhas divided no American in their admiration for them. We all honor \nthem. We are all--those who supported the decision that placed them in \nharm's way and those who opposed it--we are all humbled by their \nexample, and chastened in our prideful conviction that we, too, in our \nown way, have offered our country some good service. It may be true or \nit may not, but no matter how measurable our own contributions to this \nblessed and beautiful country, they are a poor imitation of theirs. I \nknow we all know how little is asked of us compared to their service, \nand the solemn and terrible sacrifice made by those who will never \nreturn to the country they loved so well.\n  In the last few weeks some of those brave men and women have learned \ntheir tour in Iraq will last longer than they were initially told. \nOthers have learned that they will soon return to combat sooner than \nthey had been led to expect. It is a sad and hard thing to ask so much \nmore of Americans who have already given more than their fair share to \nthe defense of our country. Few of them and their families will have \ngreeted the news without feeling greatly disappointed and worried, and \nwithout offering a few well deserved complaints in the direction of \nthose of us who have imposed on them this additional hardship. Then \nthey will shoulder a rifle and risk everything--evetything--to \naccomplish their mission, to protect another people's freedom and our \nown country from harm.\n  May God bless and protect them. And may we, their elected \nrepresentatives, have the political courage to stand by our \nconvictions, and offer something more than doubts, criticism, or no \nconfidence votes to this debate. They deserve more than that.\n  I know that every Member of this body is united in our regard and \nconcern for them. I know every Member of this body is struggling to \nunderstand the best way forward to avoid complete failure in Iraq. But \nwhether this resolution carries or not, these soldiers and marines are \ngoing to deploy to Baghdad. If we are certain that despite their \ncourage and devotion they cannot succeed, then take the action the \nConstitution affords us to prevent their needless sacrifice. If we are \nnot prepared to take that action, then let us do everything in our \npower to help them succeed. Those are the only responsible, the only \nhonorable choices before us. There are no others. I wish there were. \nBut here we are, confronting a political, military and moral dilemma of \nimmense importance, with the country's most vital security interests \nand the lives of the best Americans among us at stake. May God grant us \nthe wisdom and humility to make this difficult judgment in our \ncountry's best interests only, and the courage to accept our \nresponsibility for the consequences which will ensue.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, our troops don't lose wars; bad policy and \nbad leadership lose wars. We should have the courage to stand up and \ntell the administration they have had a God-awful policy. They put our \ntroops in a position that, in fact, has made it virtually impossible \nfor them to succeed at the outset. They deserve a policy, a plan, but \nthere is no plan.\n  We went to war with too few troops, we went to war unnecessarily, and \nwe went to war with men and women who were ill-equipped, and they are \ncoming home ill-served. It is about time we have the courage to stand \nup and say to the President: Mr. President, you have not only put us in \nharm's way, you have harmed us. You have no policy, Mr. President.\n  I am so tired of hearing on this floor about courage. Let's have the \ncourage to tell the administration to stop this ridiculous policy they \nhave.\n  We are taking sides in a civil war. I was there in Srebrenica. I was \nin Tuzla. I was in Sarajevo. I was in Brcko in the Balkans. How did we \nsolve that? We solved that with a policy of separating the parties.\n  This is a cycle of self-sustaining sectarian violence that 20,000, \n30,000, 50,000, 100,000 Americans will not be able to stop. This is \nridiculous. There is no plan. I ask the President and everyone else who \ncomes forward with a plan, whether it is capping or surging or whatever \nthey have: Will it answer the two-word test: Then what? Then what? Then \nwhat? What happens after we surge these women and men?\n  And by the way, he said General Petraeus is one who believes. He may \nbe the only one who believes this is a good idea. Virtually no one else \nthinks it is a good idea. Look, in this story about the Constitution, \nwe gave the President specific authority, which is our responsibility. \nIt was to take down Saddam, if need be, it was to get rid of weapons of \nmass destruction that did not exist, and it was to get compliance with \nthe U.N. resolution. Every one of those have been met. Saddam is dead, \nthere were no weapons, and Iraq is in compliance with the U.N.\n  So if one wants to be literal about it, his mission no longer has the \nforce of law. Everyone I have spoken with, including from the Biden-\nGelb plan straight through to the Iraq Study Group, says: Look, use our \ntroops wisely; use them wisely. What are their missions? We have the \nright and obligation constitutionally, and we should have the courage \nconstitutionally, to exercise our responsibility to say: Why are our \ntroops there?\n  Did anybody on this floor, did anybody count on the utter \nincompetence of this administration when they were getting the \nauthority they were getting? Absolute incompetence. I stood on this \nfloor 3 years ago saying we need another 100,000 troops before the \nsectarian violence became self-sustaining and warned, as others did, \nthat once it did, all the king's horses and all the king's men could \nnot hold that country together.\n  So what is our objective here? Our objective is to leave Iraq \nrelatively stable within its own borders, not a threat to its neighbors \nand not a haven for terror.\n  What is the President and my friend from Arizona and others insisting \non? What can never be: a central government that is a democracy that is \ngoing to be fair to the rest of its citizens. It is not possible, mark \nmy words.\n  So as long as the President keeps us on this ridiculous path, taking \nus off a cliff, I ask my colleagues: Does anybody think they are going \nto be able to sustain keeping American forces in Iraq at 160,000 for \nanother year and a half? What do you think? What do you think is going \nto happen in Tennessee, in Delaware, in Illinois? Are we going to break \nthis man's and woman's Army? What are we going to do here? How many \ntimes do we have to ask those 175,000 marines to rotate, three, four, \nfive, six, seven times?\n  And what is the President's political solution? I love this. Everyone \nsays there is no military solution, only a political solution. Name me \none person who has come up with a political solution--one--other than \nme and Les Gelb.\n  There is a political solution. It is what history teaches us. When \nthere is self-sustaining sectarian violence, there is only one of four \npossibilities:\n  They either, one, expire, kill one another off; two, you impose a \ndictator; three, you have an empire; or, four, you have a Federal \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am tired of hearing about courage. The \nonly courage being evidenced in this country is by those folks out on \nthe battlefields getting shot at, getting killed. Why are they there? \nLet's get on with this. This is the only rational way to move.\n  All this malarkey about cutting off funds--this is about the mission.\n  Mr. President, you are leading us off a cliff. Stop.\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that when we \nallowed the unanimous consent request for the Senator from Arizona, it \ngave 5 additional minutes to the minority. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe majority have 5 additional minutes so we have equal time in this \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who seeks time? The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, next Tuesday will mark the start of the \nfifth year of the war in Iraq. Our Nation has spent almost $400 billion \nnow in Iraq and is spending an average of almost $9 billion in U.S. \ntaxpayers' funds per month. More importantly, we have lost almost 3,200 \nAmerican service men and women and have suffered almost 24,000 wounded.\n  The resolution before us is aimed at turning the responsibility for \nthe future of Iraq over to the Iraqis themselves. Last year, we adopted \na resolution which said that calendar year 2006 was going to be a \nperiod of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty with Iraqi \nsecurity forces taking the lead for the security of a free and \nsovereign Iraq, thereby creating the conditions for a phased \nredeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq. That was over a year ago.\n  We were supposed to be through a year of significant transition by \nnow. It has not happened. The only way it is going to happen is if this \nCongress makes it happen.\n  Many of us have long maintained it was necessary that pressure be \nplaced on the Iraqis to come together politically because only a \npolitical settlement could bring about the end of sectarian violence in \nIraq and the defeat of the insurgents.\n  I have recounted how Ambassador Khalilzad and even President Bush \nhave told me a number of statements that many of us have made--that we \nshould begin to reduce our presence in Iraq--were, indeed, useful \nstatements, useful in an effort to prod the Iraqis to reach a political \nsettlement.\n\n  Those words--the words of President Bush, Ambassador Khalilzad, and \nrecently Secretary Rice--words prodding the Iraqis to take \nresponsibility, telling the Iraqis the open-ended commitment is over, \ntelling the Iraqis we must begin to reduce our presence in 4 to 6 \nmonths are useful words for the Iraqis to hear.\n  The problem is it is not the President who is speaking those words. \nThe problem is the administration has not adopted those words as a \nmatter of policy. Now it is time for Congress to explain to the Iraqis: \nIt is your country. We cannot save you from yourselves. It is time for \nus, the Congress, to tell the Iraqis as a reminder that it is their own \nPrime Minister, Mr. Maliki, who acknowledged the following when he said \na few months ago:\n\n       The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the \n     cycle of aggravation and bloodletting are the [Iraqi] \n     politicians.\n\n  A few weeks ago, Ambassador Khalilzad said in an interview on \ntelevision that the congressional debate is ``useful in one way. It \ndoes send a message to the Iraqis that the patience of the American \npeople is running out, and that is helpful to my diplomacy.''\n  I wish to repeat this because there are a number of Members of this \nbody and there are a number of members of the administration who have \nattacked this debate as somehow or another undermining our troops. It \nis quite the opposite. We support our troops when we give them our best \nthinking as to how to succeed in Iraq. It is good for our troops to \nhave a debate in this democracy about whether a course is failing or \nsucceeding and, if it is not succeeding, to offer our best thoughts as \nto how to make it succeed.\n  Our troops deserve everything we can give them. They haven't gotten \nit. They deserve the best equipment. They didn't get it. They deserve \ntreatment when they come to our hospitals. They didn't get it. They \ndeserve our best thinking, our honest thoughts as to how we can succeed \nin Iraq, how can we change course from a failing course to one which \nsucceeds.\n  We know there is no military solution in Iraq, there is only a \npolitical solution, and that must be achieved by the Iraqis themselves. \nWe cannot save the Iraqis from themselves. It is their country. After 4 \nyears of shedding American blood and American treasure, it is long \noverdue that the Iraqi leaders be told, not just by this Congress, \nalthough we alone apparently will do it, but by the administration that \nthey and they alone have the responsibility, the capability, and the \npower to make Iraq a country instead of a place of civil strife.\n  This resolution we are about to embark upon will end the open-ended \ncommitment of American military forces that is not working. We must \nchange this course. Only the Iraqis can save their country, and we will \nbe helping to force them to do that. It shouldn't be necessary, but it \nis. We will be helping to force the Iraqi leaders to save their country \nif we step up finally and say: We have been there longer than we were \nin World War II. We have been in Iraq longer than we fought the Korean \nwar. Iraqis leaders, only you, and you alone, can decide: Do you want a \ncivil war or do you want a nation? We hope you choose a nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Chair let me know when 2 minutes remain, \nplease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, my purpose today is to say I believe it \nis time for President Bush to take the Iraq Study Group report down off \nthe shelf and use it for something other than a bookend. But first let \nme say something about the resolution that we are about to consider.\n  There is a reason why we don't have 535 commanders in chief or 100 \ncommanding generals each saying: Charge down this street or over that \nhill. The Founders of our country made the President the Commander in \nChief and gave to Congress the power to declare war and pay for it. \nThat is why I will vote against this resolution and any of the \nresolutions that seek to micromanage the war. Once a war is authorized, \nas this one was by a bipartisan vote of 77 to 23 in 2002, it is the \nPresident's job to manage the war.\n  As an example of why we don't need 535 Members of Congress \nmicromanaging the war, consider this: Since last January, the new \nDemocratic majority has offered 17 different bills and resolutions \noutlining what we ought to do in Iraq, and there will be more coming in \nthe next few weeks, I am sure.\n  I am not about to cut off funds for General Petraeus's troops in the \nmiddle of the current military exercise, which clearly Congress has the \npower to do but should not do.\n  I have--and each of us has--the responsibility as a Senator to say \nwhat I believe is the right way forward for our country in Iraq, and my \nbelief is this: The President would be wise to take down off the shelf \nthe recommendations of the bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group \nto develop a strategy based on those recommendations and to ask \nAmericans to accept that strategy as the right way forward in Iraq.\n  I believe the President would have been wise to do that in January \nduring his State of the Union Address. The country was then looking for \na new way forward in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group, after 9 months of \ncareful bipartisan work, offered such a plan. Instead, the day after \nthe report was announced in December, some who wanted another 100,000 \nor 200,000 troops to win the war said the report was a recipe for \ndefeat. On the other side, those who wanted the United States out of \nIraq immediately dismissed the report as more of the same. So the \nreport was put on the shelf. That is, until lately.\n  Lately, the President's National Security Adviser has cited the \nBaker-Hamilton report as authority for the surge of troops in Baghdad, \nwhich, in fact, on page 73, the report did say might be necessary. Over \nthe weekend, the United States participated in meetings with Syria and \nIran, perhaps the most controversial recommendation in the report. The \ntimetable and strategy for reducing our combat strength in Iraq \ncontained in the new Democratic Senate resolution sounds very much like \nthe Iraq Study Group, calling for combat troops to be largely withdrawn \nfrom Iraq by next March. But the Iraq\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\nStudy Group specifically opposed setting timetables or deadlines for \nwithdrawal, noting that its recommendation should be ``subject to \nunexpected developments on the ground.''\n  At the same time, like one of the Republican-sponsored resolutions, \nthe Iraq Study Group recommended the United States work closely with \nIraq's leaders to support the achievement of certain ``milestones.'' In \nshort, if there is any bipartisan consensus emerging about how the \nUnited States should go forward in Iraq, the best blueprint of that \nconsensus can be found in the report of the Iraq Study Group.\n  The membership and process of the Iraq Study Group is as important as \nthe substance of what it said. It included some of America's most \ndistinguished citizens from the Reagan and Carter and the first Bush \nadministrations, from the Congress, and the Supreme Court. One of its \nformer members is today's Secretary of Defense. It was ideologically \nand politically diverse. The group spent 9 months, met 9 times, \nincluding a trip to Baghdad, interviewed 171 individuals, and made 79 \nspecific recommendations.\n  Its assessment of the ``dire'' current conditions in Iraq was honest \nand sober. It didn't shy away from bad news--that 79 percent of Iraqis \nhave a mostly negative view of United States influence in their \ncountry; that 2,900 Americans at that time had been killed, with \nanother 21,000 wounded; that we had spent roughly $400 billion, and \nthat estimates run as high as $2 trillion on this war. The group \nacknowledged its recommendations weren't perfect, but were the best \noptions.\n  As much as America needs a new strategy in Iraq, we also need a \nconsensus in support of that strategy. To put it bluntly, a majority of \nthe American people do not now have confidence in the President's \ncourse in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group offered the President an \nopportunity to say, okay, here is a different approach suggested by a \nbipartisan group of distinguished Americans. It is not my strategy, it \nis theirs. The President could say, I accept it, and for the good of \nour country and the Armed Forces fighting for it, I ask you to accept \nit.\n  Such a statement would not exhibit Presidential weakness. That would \nbe Presidential leadership, recognizing that the President's job is not \nonly to choose the right strategy but to successfully persuade at least \nhalf the people he is right. The President still has this option before \nhim. I respectfully suggest he would be wise to exercise it today, this \nweek. Come back to Congress, report on the progress of the last few \nweeks in Iraq, invite the Iraq Study Group members to sit in the \ngallery, compliment their work, accept their recommendations, and ask \nthe Congress and the country to also accept their recommendations.\n  Now, this course won't satisfy those who want another 100,000 or \n200,000 more troops to win the war in Iraq. Neither will it satisfy \nthose who want all troops out on a specific timetable. But it will get \nUnited States troops quickly out of the combat business in Iraq and \ninto the support business. It will reduce the number of American forces \nin Iraq over the next year. It will leave American special forces in \nIraq to go after al-Qaida and the troops to help guard the borders, \nbecause there would still be a limited United States military presence. \nIt will send a signal to the rest of the Middle East to stay out of \nIraq. It will give support to General Petraeus and his troops, who are \nin the midst of a surge to make Baghdad safer. It will expand \ndiplomatic efforts to build support for Iraqi national reconciliation \nand sovereignty, including with Iraq's neighbors. And it will \nrecognize, or at least begin to recognize, that America has done most \nof what it can do to help Iraq. As Prime Minister Tony Blair has said, \nit is time for the next chapters in Iraq's history to largely be \nwritten by the Iraqis themselves.\n  Finally, this course will recognize that while the United States can \nand should be a shining example of democracy, and while the United \nStates does have the mightiest military force in the world, a \nconservative view of human nature and our own national interest places \nlimits on what we can do to make it possible for others to adopt our \ndemocracy and to adopt our way of life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \nUnited States policy in Iraq Resolution of 2007. I think it represents \na sound policy and strategy that will help us achieve our objectives \nnot only in Iraq but in the region, and not only in the region but \nacross the globe.\n  Let me first begin by saying I have heard many of the opponents \nsuggest this Senate has but one choice: either to cut off funding or to \nallow the President to continue to pursue any policy he feels is \nappropriate. That is a false choice, similar to the false choice the \nPresident presented to this Senate in 2002 and 2003. That choice was \nthat we could either invade Iraq or step back and watch them morph into \na much more serious threat. In fact, there were diplomatic options. \nThere was the possibility of effectively using U.N. inspectors. So I \ndon't think we should engage in discussions of false choices. We have \nthe authority constitutionally to adopt policies, to shape what the \nPresident does, and that is the essence of this resolution.\n  Just today, the New York Times' Walter Dellinger and Christopher \nSchroeder wrote an op-ed piece which bears on this point. They say the \nSupreme Court has long recognized Congress's authority to set limits on \nthe President's military power, as in 1799, when it accepted Congress's \npower to authorize the seizure of ships going to but not coming from \nFrench ports. Talk about micromanagement; that is micromanagement.\n  That is not what our Iraq resolution does. We are laying out policy \nobjectives, a changed mission, which I think will enhance the ability \nof military forces in the United States to do their job and to protect \nour country.\n  The Dellinger piece goes on to say, ``More important, the legal \nadvisers of presidents have themselves repeatedly recognized this \ncongressional power. When former Chief Justice William Rehnquist was \nPresident Reagan's chief legal adviser in 1970, he flatly rejected the \nall-or-nothing claim.'' In Rehnquist's words, ``It is both utterly \nillogical and unsupported by precedent to think Congress may not \ndelegate a lesser amount of authority to conduct military operations.''\n  That is essentially what we are talking about today. We are trying to \nredefine the mission so that it is consistent with the highest purposes \nof American national strategy. This mission would, first, recognize we \nhave to protect our forces, giving the Commander in Chief broad \ndiscretion in protecting those forces; second, that we have an ongoing \nobligation to help train Iraqi security forces, which is absolutely \ncritical; and, third, that we have the ongoing obligation to go after \nthe terrorists wherever they may be. We did this in Somalia a few weeks \nago when we had information of al-Qaida operatives. We had much \ncooperation on the ground and we went in there. That is the same option \nwe must pursue in Iraq and every place else. These are the three \nmissions that are most consistent and most important to our national \nstrategy.\n  Also, this resolution begins a phased redeployment; not a rigid, \ninflexible timetable, but starting a date where we begin to pull out \ncombat forces, leaving, of course, forces to carry on this mission of \ntraining Iraqi security forces, going after the terrorists, and \nprotecting our own forces. Our goal, and it is strictly a goal, is that \nthese combat brigades should be out of the country, we hope, by March \nof 2008.\n  This is a policy that I think will work, a policy that will be \nsupported by the American people, and a policy that will encourage, I \nthink, the political solution that is necessary. As everyone has noted, \nthe answer to Iraq is not going to be achieved by military means. It \nwill be achieved by political means. General Petraeus has said that. \nThese are his words: ``There is no military solution to a problem like \nthat in Iraq, to the insurgency of Iraq.''\n  We have to have, and this resolution calls for, the application of \ndiplomatic power, support for the creation of functioning institutions \nin Iraq that can provide both the kind of political progress and \neconomic progress these people demand, tangible signs that their \nGovernment will function. That is what we are encouraging and directing \nin this policy.\n  This policy makes sense and it is well within not only the obligation \nof this\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\nCongress but the constitutional power of this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I request an additional 1 minute to be yielded from \nthe time of the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, what the President is suggesting to us, his \npolicy, is more of the same for a much longer period of time. As we all \nknow, recently General Odierno suggested this surge is probably going \nto last not until the end of this year but into next year, and probably \ninto the following year. That is putting a huge strain on our troops.\n  I think also we have to recognize our focus in Iraq, our \npreoccupation with Iraq, is inhibiting our strategic flexibility across \nthe globe. It has enhanced the relative power of Iran, ironically, and \nit has caused us, belatedly, to begin serious negotiations with North \nKorea, which might be a profitable and progressive thing to do, but the \nfocus on Iraq is serious.\n  Let me tell you, one of the most interesting comments that I have \nheard is when I asked Admiral McConnell, the head of our intelligence \nestablishment, where is the most likely threat coming from, engaging in \nan attack on the United States, Pakistan or Iraq? He answered quite \nquickly: Pakistan.\n  We have to change our policy. This resolution will do that, and I \nurge its support.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask that you notify me when there are \n2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the question is: What is our duty? We know \nwhat the duty of our soldiers will be when they raise their hand and \ntake an oath to serve our country. They agree to risk their lives for \nAmerica. They follow orders. They follow the lead of their commanders. \nThey march into battle. Some come home and some do not. But what is the \nduty of the Congress? What is our responsibility when it comes to war?\n  First, of course, was the authorization for the use of force. \nPresident Bush came to us and said, I want to have the authority to \ninvade Iraq for three reasons: No. 1, to get rid of the dictator Saddam \nHussein; No. 2, to destroy weapons of mass destruction; and No. 3, to \nmake sure the country lives up to the requirements of the United \nNations resolutions.\n  Many of us felt at the time that America was being misled about the \nreal danger in Iraq. Some of us, some 23 Senators, voted against the \nauthorization of force back in October of 2002. But as we take a look \nat that scene in Iraq today, we realize that all three of those things \nhave been accomplished. Saddam Hussein no longer exists, weapons of \nmass destruction never existed, and there is no question about \ncomplying with the United Nations resolutions.\n  So the obvious question is: By what authority is America still there? \nBy what authority do 150,000 Americans now risk their lives while we \nstand in the safety of this Chamber?\n  This resolution seeks to define our mission today in realistic terms. \nIf the President had come to Congress 4 years ago and said, I want the \nauthority to send American troops into the middle of a civil war in \nIraq, a war that has been brewing for 14 centuries between warring \nIslamic factions; I want American soldiers on the street risking their \nlives every day until the Iraqis resolve this age-old dispute, do you \nthink we would have approved that authorization of the use of American \nforce? Of course not. It would have been pure folly.\n  Sadly, the situation today has no clear mission, and that is the \nreason for this resolution. This resolution makes it clear the Iraq \nStudy Group, Democrats and Republicans, men and women who served our \ncountry so well in public service, would have a chance to step forward \nand come up with a plan that makes sense for America to start coming \nhome, and that is what this resolution says.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Who wants America to come home at this point? The \nAmerican people do. The Iraqi people want us to leave. In fact, the \nIraqi leadership has said it is time for us to start withdrawing our \ntroops. The resistance to bringing our troops home comes from the other \nside of the aisle and from the White House. They believe we need more \ntroops.\n  How often will America respond when the Iraqis pick up the phone and \ndial 9-1-1 to send another 20,000 of our best and bravest to go into \nbattle? It is time for the Iraqis to stand and defend their own \ncountry. It is time for the American forces to start to come home. It \nis time for us to acknowledge that they have done their job and done it \nwell. We have lost almost 3,200 American lives; 24,000 have been \ninjured. We know among those injured many have not been greeted as they \nshould have been. They have been sent to flophouse rooms at Walter \nReed's Building 18. They have been pushed through the bureaucracy of \nthe Veterans' Administration. For those who say they support our \ntroops, they will have a chance to prove it soon, as we start trying to \nput the resources we need into the military and VA, to help our troops \nas they return.\n  This resolution is an opportunity for this Congress to speak to the \nreality of what is going on in Iraq today, and the reality suggests \nthat it is time for American forces to start to come home; not more \nforces in harm's way but more forces coming home to be greeted by us, \nas Americans, for the fine job they have done. We cannot blame them if \nthe mission has been lost over the last 4 years. They had nothing to do \nwith that. But we can make it clear that our future mission is going to \nbe one we can define precisely: to stop terrorism, to train the Iraqis \nso they can defend themselves, and to protect our own troops. Those are \nclear missions.\n  For those who resist this resolution, the obvious question is this: \nWhat do you think our mission is today? Is it simply to send more and \nmore troops into harm's way, that they would risk their lives? I think \nnot.\n  For those who argue that we are micromanaging the war, I guess my \nquestion for them is, isn't it time that somebody managed this war? \nIsn't it time, when it came to troops and mission and equipment, that \nwe clearly had a management plan that our troops deserve?\n  For those who argue that we are cutting off funding, they have not \nread the resolution. We are not cutting a penny from the troops and the \nmoney that they need to come home safely. But we are saying that our \nmission has to be clear and our troops have to come home.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support what the \nAmerican people want, the redeployment of our fine troops back to \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nRepublican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today Senate Republicans will agree to \nmove to debate on an important question, and that question is this: \nShould a majority of Senators direct activities in the war in Iraq? \nRepublicans are eager to engage in this debate on the Reid resolution \nbecause it is different in kind from any of the previous Democratic \nproposals--very, very different.\n  It is unprecedented in the powers it would arrogate to Congress in a \ntime of war. It is a clear statement of retreat--a clear statement of \nretreat from the support that the Senate only recently gave to GEN \nDavid Petraeus, and its passage would be absolutely fatal to our \nmission in Iraq.\n  Previous resolutions proposed by the Democrats were a mere statement \nof opinion or of sentiment. This one has a binding quality. It would \ninterfere with the President and General Petraeus's operational \nauthority to conduct the war in Iraq as he and his commanders see fit. \nIt would substitute for their judgment the judgment of 535 Members of \nCongress.\n  The judgment they have made in this, that Iraq is simply a \ndistraction on the Global War on terror and that U.S. troops should \nbegin to withdraw in months, with all combat forces leaving within a \nyear--that is the judgment that the Reid proposal makes. This is the \nmemo that our enemies have been waiting for. Osama bin Laden and his \nfollowers have repeatedly said that the United States does\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\nnot have the stomach for a long fight with the terrorists. Passage of \nthe Reid joint resolution will be the first concrete sign since \nSeptember 11, 2001, that he was right on target.\n  Timetables are bad, but don't just take my word for it. Speaking at \nthe National Press Club in 2005, my good friend, the majority leader \nhimself, said this:\n\n       As for setting a timeline, as we learned in the Balkans, \n     that's not a wise decision, because it only empowers those \n     who don't want us there, and it doesn't work well to do that.\n\n  Six months after the majority leader made that observation, the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden, said this:\n\n       A deadline for pulling out . . . will only encourage our \n     enemies to wait us out. . . . [It would be] a Lebanon in \n     1985, and God knows where it would go from there.\n\n  That was our friend, Joe Biden, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  Shortly after Senator Biden's observation, Senator Clinton made the \nsame point, just 3 months after that:\n\n       I don't believe it's smart to set a date for withdrawal.\n\n  Said Senator Clinton:\n\n       I don't think you should ever telegraph your intentions to \n     the enemy so they can await you.\n\n  That is the majority leader, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and a prominent Democratic candidate for President, all on \nthe wisdom of what this Reid proposal proposes to do, just a short time \nback.\n  Surely Senators Reid, Biden, and Clinton have not changed their minds \nabout who would benefit the most--who would benefit the most if we set \na date certain for withdrawal. They know just as well as I do that this \nis just what the terrorists have been waiting for and just what our \nallies in Iraq and the entire region of the world have feared.\n  Setting a date certain for withdrawal will send a chill up the spine \nof every Iraqi who has dared to stand with America. Millions of good \nmen and women have helped us in this fight. Since we arrived in Iraq, \nnearly 120,000 Iraqis have volunteered to serve in their Army. More \nthan 8,000 Iraqis have died in uniform to defend the fledgling \ndemocracy over there. And, recently, in Anbar Province, we are told \nthat roughly 1,000 Sunnis volunteered for a police force over a couple \nof weeks.\n  These brave men and women are watching what we do. They know, as we \ndo, that chaos will engulf Iraq and the rest of the region on that day. \nThey know they and their families will likely face a firing squad soon \nafter we leave. The message we send them with this resolution is this: \nGood luck.\n  General Petraeus understands the importance of the mission in Iraq \nand his new mission to secure Baghdad. In a recent letter to the \nsoldiers under his command, he wrote as follows--General Petraeus said:\n\n       The enemies of Iraq will shrink at no act, however \n     barbaric. They will do all they can to shake the confidence \n     of the people and to convince the world that this effort is \n     doomed. We must not underestimate them. Together with our \n     Iraqi partners, we must defeat those who oppose the new Iraq. \n     We cannot allow mass murderers to hold the initiative. We \n     must strike them relentlessly. We and our Iraqi partners must \n     set the terms of the struggle, not our enemies. And together, \n     we must prevail.\n\n  That is General Petraeus just recently. These are the words of the \nman this body sent to Iraq unanimously. They are the words of a \nmilitary commander, confident yet realistic and committed above all to \nvictory. This is the voice of courage and resolve in the face of \ndanger. We do best to listen to voices such as this, which speak of \nvictory rather than defeat and withdrawal. We owe it to him, his \nsoldiers, our allies and the world.\n  Republicans are ready for this debate.\n  I have some more time, I gather?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a little over 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL I yield back that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in life you can't stand still. You either go \nforward or backward. If it were not such a serious matter--and it is a \nserious matter--to have the Republican leader go back to a statement \nthat I made 5 years ago is what is wrong with the Republicans in this \ndebate. Things have to change. Things change. You can't stand still. \nYou either go forward or backward. To take a statement that I made 5 \nyears ago and think that things haven't changed in 5 years is without \nany degree of sensibility.\n  In just a few days our country will mark a solemn anniversary: the \nbeginning of the fifth year of a war that has raged in faraway Iraq. \nFor the fifth year, this war has taken a tremendous toll on our \ncountry, our troops, their families, and our standing in the world. Mr. \nPresident, 3,200 Americans, soldiers, airmen, sailors, and marines have \nbeen killed in Iraq. We have seen tens of thousands of our best \nwounded--men and women who have come home to a health care system \nunprepared and ill-equipped to take care of them.\n  Our Army has been stretched dangerously thin. Our Treasury has been \nspending, week after bloody week, $2 billion, each week; $2 billion \neach week.\n  Despite these tremendous costs, despite these great sacrifices, \ndespite the opposition to this war, Iraq continues to spiral out of \ncontrol. In February, attacks in Iraq increased dramatically. Three \nAmerican soldiers and 100 Iraqis died every day--every day in February. \nIn March it seems it is going to be just as bad. Our overburdened \ntroops, including hundreds of Nevadans, have done everything asked of \nthem and more. It is their political leaders at home who have failed--\nwho failed our troops and the American people. President Bush did not \ngo to war with enough military on the ground. We all know that. \nPresident Bush didn't have a plan to win the peace, much less the war. \nPresident Bush surrounded himself with yes-men, who told him what he \nwanted to hear, what he needed to hear. To this day, President Bush \nlacks a plan to complete the mission so our troops can come home. His \ncurrent strategy of more of the same is not working.\n  Five years into the war in Iraq the mission has changed but the Bush \npolicy has not changed. Saddam is gone, long gone. There are no weapons \nof mass destruction; there never were. Iraq is in chaos. There is no \nstability in Iraq. U.S. troops are policing a protracted civil war, not \nhunting and killing terrorists who attacked us on September 11, 2001.\n  The original mission no longer exists. Yet President Bush wants to \nstay the same--the same--failed course, to surge toward more of the \nsame, to sustain more failure.\n  Today, the Senate must finally send a clear message to the Commander \nin Chief, President Bush. That message is: It is time for a new way \nforward. Change course, Mr. President. The way to succeed in Iraq is \nnot more of the same; it is to change the mission and change the \ncourse. Our country must have a surge, but that surge must not be a \nmilitary surge. There must be escalation in our diplomacy.\n  This is the message the American people delivered to Congress on \nNovember 7, 2006. This is the message we must send President Bush again \ntoday.\n  In just a few moments, we will have another cloture vote. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote to allow the debate to proceed and then vote to \nchange the course. Vote for the resolution. Voting no today is voting \nto greenlight the same failed course in Iraq. Voting no today is an \nendorsement of 5 years of failed policy. Voting no today is an \nendorsement of America's continuing occupation of Iraq. Voting no today \nis a vote to support President Bush maintaining an open-ended \ncommitment to keep U.S. troops in the middle of an Iraqi civil war.\n  But a ``yes'' vote on cloture and on the resolution--and a vote for \nthe resolution--is a vote of hope, hope that after 4 years in this war \nwe can finally begin to have the Iraqis control their own destiny, \ntheir own future. We can tell President Bush to change course, redeploy \nour troops, bring in Iraq's neighbors, and revitalize reconstruction \nefforts that have failed, that have fallen woefully short.\n  Five years into the war, is it not the time for a new direction? The \nanswer is yes, and that direction starts by voting yes on this next \nvote.\n  I yield back my time.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 89, the nays are 9. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate has voted to \nallow debate on the Iraq war to go forward. It is far past time we had \nthis important debate. It is far past time we brought our involvement \nin this misguided war to a close.\n  Under the strong leadership of Senator Reid, the Democratic caucus \nhas produced a joint resolution that takes a significant step toward \nending our involvement in the war in Iraq. I support the resolution, \nand I hope my colleagues will do the same.\n  The resolution does not go as far as I would like. I continue to \nbelieve the only way we are ultimately going to end the President's \nfailed policies in Iraq is by exercising Congress's power of the purse \nto safely bring our troops out of Iraq. I have introduced legislation \nthat would do that, and I will continue to look for every opportunity \nto bring up my bill for a vote.\n  I will support this resolution because it avoids the mistakes of \nprevious proposals to address Iraq. It does not allow the President's \nmisguided policies to continue. It does not tacitly reauthorize the \nwar. It does not focus solely on the so-called surge. This is binding \nlegislation that would bring to an end our involvement in perhaps the \ngreatest foreign policy mistake in our country's history.\n  Some of my colleagues continue to argue that Congress should defer to \nthe Commander in Chief when it comes to Iraq, that we should give him \nthe opportunity to change course in Iraq or that we should allow his \nescalation plan a chance to succeed. Those arguments ignore our \ncongressional responsibilities.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, at the conclusion of my remarks, I \nwould be happy to yield.\n  Congress authorized this war, and it is in our power to bring it to a \nclose. More importantly, we have not just the power but the \nresponsibility to end a war that is draining vital national security \nresources in pursuit of a goal that cannot be achieved militarily.\n  The political problems that are driving much of the insurgency and \nsectarian strife in Iraq are tragic and important. They require the \nattention of U.S. policymakers. They do not require--in fact, they \ncannot be solved by--a massive and indefinite U.S. military presence in \nIraq.\n  Some of my colleagues raise the specter of dire consequences if we \nredeploy U.S. forces from Iraq. That is precisely why we need a \nstrategic approach to redeployment, one that addresses ongoing \ninstability and other threats, with our intelligence, diplomatic, \neconomic and, in a limited manner, military capabilities. Not only is \nthe continuation of this war not going to end sectarian and insurgent \nviolence, it puts off the day when we develop a comprehensive strategy \nfor Iraq that is sustainable, and that fits squarely within the larger \nstruggle of fighting al-Qaida.\n\n  As long as the President's policies continue, our troops will \ncontinue to put their lives on the line, our constituents will continue \nputting billions of their dollars into this war, our military readiness \nwill continue to erode, our Guard and Reserve members will continue to \nface heavy burdens, and our ability to respond to an array of national \nsecurity challenges will continue to suffer a great deal. From Somalia \nto Afghanistan to the ongoing fight against al-Qaida, we face threats \nand challenges that require serious attention and resources. Right now, \nfar too much of both are being spent on a single country. It is this \nsingleminded and self-defeating policy that needs to end, and it is up \nto Congress to do so.\n  Time and again, the President has made it clear that nothing--not the \nwishes of the American people, not the advice of military and foreign \npolicy experts, not the concerns of Members of both parties--will \ndissuade him from pursuing policies in Iraq that are not working. Faced \nwith a clear mandate from the voters last November, the President just \nstalled for time, and then he announced not just a continuation but an \nescalation of his policy. So Congress cannot wait for the President to \nchange course. We need to change the course ourselves.\n  This resolution recognizes, and acts on, that reality. It would \neffectively terminate the misguided resolution authorizing force in \nIraq, while allowing a minimal number of troops to remain to perform \nvery limited functions: protecting personnel and infrastructure, \ntraining and equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting certain targeted \ncounterterrorism operations. The latter provision is a particular \npriority of mine, which is why my original legislation includes exactly \nthe same language.\n  Clearly, the United States has an ongoing role to play in addressing \nthe terrorist threat in Iraq. While Iraq was not a hotbed of terrorism \nbefore the President led us to war in that country, al-Qaida and its \nallies are trying to use the anger and frustrations unleashed by that \nwar to their advantage. Like Afghanistan and Somalia, Iraq will need to \nbe closely monitored to ensure that it does not become a failed state \nand a breeding ground for terrorism, and we must be prepared to pursue \ntargeted missions to take out terrorists.\n  But maintaining 140,000 U.S. troops in Iraq is not the way to defeat \nal-Qaida. Military operations of any size will only succeed if they are \ncombined with other measures--including diplomatic, economic, and \nintelligence measures--as part of a comprehensive strategy for \ndefeating the terrorists who threaten our country. Al-Qaida is\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\nnot a one-country franchise; it is a global threat that requires a \nglobal response.\n  The Reid resolution would require the President to begin redeploying \ncombat forces not essential to the three limited functions I just \nmentioned within 120 days, with a goal of finishing redeployment by the \nend of March 2008. While I support a faster redeployment with a firm \ndeadline, these provisions are, in fact, binding and would make clear \nthat the President's commitment to an open-ended, massive military \nmission in Iraq is over. That is what the American people want, and \nthat is what this Congress should ensure.\n  Regardless of what happens this week, I believe the introduction of \nthis resolution, with the cosponsorship of some 41 Senators, represents \na significant step toward ending the war. The overwhelming majority of \nDemocrats are saying that the war must come to a close and that they \nare prepared to take binding steps to do just that. The question each \nof us will face as this debate continues is how to best end our \ninvolvement in the war and redeploy our troops.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to offer an amendment to the \nupcoming supplemental that would actually use Congress's appropriations \npower to require the safe redeployment of our troops. While I do not \nagree with much of what has been said by those in this body who \ncontinue to defend a disastrous war, they are right about one point: If \nwe are serious about opposing the war, we must be serious about ending \nfunding for the war.\n  I am pleased the Senate has voted to allow debate on the Reid \nresolution to go forward. Unfortunately, however, some in this body \ncontinue to make arguments that undermine the ability of Congress to \nhave a serious discussion about the Iraq war. They fail to recognize \nthat this body has an obligation to address the most pressing issue \nfacing the country today and respond to the overwhelming sentiment of \nour constituents. They purport to defend the President's prerogatives \nand the morale and well-being of our troops, but their rhetoric has the \neffect of trying to stifle open and honest debate.\n  While I cannot speak for the President, I am confident our troops, \nand our constituents, are ready for this debate. They know that in a \ndemocracy such as ours, discussion of major foreign policy issues can \nand should be conducted openly. So I am glad the Senate is beginning \nsuch a discussion today, and I will continue pushing this body to \nfinally bring to a close our involvement in a war that has been a \ndisaster on so many fronts.\n  Madam President, I am now happy to yield for a question to the \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I was just going to ask the \ndistinguished Senator if he would yield. While I can't associate myself \nwith all of his remarks and, as I note, the press gallery and the world \nwill little note nor long remember our colloquy, perhaps, I wish to \ncongratulate him for his forthrightness and his candor and his \nconviction.\n  The Senator and I have talked about the situation and about the need \nfor full debate in regard to our national security and the war in Iraq, \nand I had hoped his resolution would be agreed to during the last--or \nthe previous attempt when we only had one resolution and that was it. I \nhad asked at that particular time, in a very similar situation--I was \nmaking a speech, and the Chamber was empty, and so I can empathize with \nthat. But my comments were that we should consider the McCain amendment \nwith the benchmarks, the Gregg amendment, and Senator Feingold's, \nbecause his is very forthright. It is very clear and very \nunderstandable. Now, I would not vote for it, but I respect the \nSenator's opinion, and I respect his candor.\n  The Senator has been a member, a valuable member of the Intelligence \nCommittee. I had the privilege of being the chairman of that committee. \nI think I am the longest serving Senator on the Intelligence Committee \nup to this point--10 years. It is tough work. There are a lot of times \nI disagreed with the Senator, but the Senator is an extremely valuable \nmember of the Intelligence Committee. Upon learning all of the \nintelligence from the 19 different agencies that comprise the \ncommunity, he has developed a very strong opinion. I respect that. That \nis what we should be doing. We should be having a full debate. I hope \nin voting to proceed that we at least get that full debate.\n  I would say to the Senator, one of my best friends is General \nPetraeus, who used to be the commanding general at Fort Leavenworth, at \nthe Intellectual Center of the Army, and he wrote the counterterrorism \nmanual for the Army. He just finished it. We talked a lot about the \nBritish experience in regards to what happened at that particular time \nin Iraq. It is unique, it seems to me, because what the Senator wants \nto do follows the same time period General Petraeus wants to inform us \nas to whether we are making any progress and if we can achieve \nstability in Iraq, and that is a mighty big ``if.''\n  I think by the summer at least, if we are not making progress, at \nthat particular time we are going to have to go to a policy of \ncontainment as opposed to intervention, as the Senator has suggested. \nHow we do that, I am not quite sure. We haven't had that debate on the \nSenate floor.\n  Now, this Senator, Mr. Feingold, has called for that debate, and that \nis what we should be debating. It calls for a lot of different \nopinions.\n  So I congratulate the Senator. I thank him for his candor. I thank \nhim for being forthright. I wish we could vote on the Senator's \nresolution this time around. Does the Senator think that is even \npossible?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nKansas, first of all, for his kind words and for listening to my speech \nand for being present to do so. He has endangered himself politically \nby saying kind words about me and my resolution in front of some groups \nwho may find that a little strange. But I do enjoy working with him, \nand I especially enjoyed working with him when he was the chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee.\n  I, of course, want to do exactly what the Senator from Kansas has \nsaid. I want to have a debate and a vote on the approach I have \nsuggested. As I just indicated in my remarks, I believe that is the \nnext thing which needs to happen after we have this debate.\n  Just so the record is clear, though, the Democrats have agreed to \nvote on S.J. Res. 9 and the McCain amendment and the Gregg amendment \nand the Warner resolution, as well as the Reid resolution. So the \nRepublicans objected to that.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Why not the Feingold resolution?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like to do that, but I think probably the \nappropriate place to do that is the supplemental.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, if the Senator would continue to yield, \nwhat if I ask unanimous consent that the Senator's amendment be made in \norder?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would object on behalf of the leadership because I \nagreed that this should be the next step and we should take up this \nresolution.\n  I say to the Senator from Kansas, this resolution before us, the Reid \nresolution, makes perfect sense. What it does is it says: Look, we no \nlonger believe the authorization that was given in 2002 makes sense, \nand it severely limits that resolution and moves us in the right \ndirection. So I think that is the proper step. The supplemental bill is \nabout to come up. I think that is the right place, given that it has to \ndo with funding, for the type of amendment I have suggested. So I would \nobject on behalf of the leadership.\n  But I do look forward very much to the day not only when we debate \nthis but when I persuade you that it is a good idea that we cut off the \nfunding in order to bring the troops safely home--which, by the way, is \nwhat we did--and I assume Senator Roberts was involved in this as \nwell--with Somalia. The Senator remembers ``Black Hawk Down.'' He knows \nit well. We lost 18 people. We decided: This isn't working out. This \nisn't a good idea. What did the Senate do? It passed legislation that \nsaid by a certain date we will no longer fund this military mission, \nbut it gave plenty of time to get the troops out, and they got out \nsuccessfully. That is the nature of what I propose to do with an \namendment on the supplemental.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will continue to yield for a question, \nyou are talking about step 2. Step 1 is being considered, and your \nspecific resolution would be step 2 on the supplemental.\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Step 1 was our vote here in this body and in the House \nto say that the surge was unwise, and a majority did vote for that \nhere, as well as in the House. This is step 2. This says that the \nfundamental underpinnings of this mistake should be reversed, that the \nresolution authorizing force in Iraq should be reversed. Yes, step 3, \nin my view, would be saying--to enforce it. Since the President won't \nlisten to us, we need to turn to the ultimate power, the one the \nSenator from Kansas and I both agree is the appropriate power in this \nsituation; that is, whether to use the power of the purse to remove \nfunding.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. So if the Senator will continue to yield, we are on step \n3 until we get to your resolution?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. We are on step 2.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It would be step 3 before you would think it would be \nappropriate to consider your resolution?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I think we would be best to do it on the supplemental. \nThat seems to be the appropriate vehicle.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have got it. I just want to make clear, \nunderstandably, I would probably vote no--well, not probably--I would \nvote no on the resolution. But again, the thing that disturbs me is \nwhen we get to the what-ifs. What if we pass your resolution? What if \nwe pass somebody else's resolution? What happens if we get the troops \nout? Hopefully they would not be in a situation where we have to send \nthem back. The what-ifs on what happens to us, which you have discussed \nin a rare discussion on the floor, we haven't talked about that.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. We need to get to that.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. We have an honest difference of opinion, but we have not \ntalked about that. That is the whole point I am trying to make, that at \nleast the Senator is trying to force the issue in making his point, and \nlet nobody say that they challenge your patriotism or your intent or \nwhatever. I know there is a lot of rhetoric flying around. I don't \nagree with that at all. I think this debate ought to take place, and \nthis debate is not taking place. So thank you to the Senator. And I \ndon't think I have endangered--well, maybe I have--my reputation just a \nlittle.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I think the Senator from Kansas is on shaky ground with \nsome people now. But I think the Senator from Kansas should know that \nwe are essentially in the heat of agreement here; the only question is \nthe order in which it should happen. The exact questions the Senator \nhas discussed should be debated in the Senate. I hope they are debated \nsoon. Guess what. We just had a debate, so we are having a debate, and \nthis is the beginning, and we will continue it.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Kansas, and I thank the Chair. \nI yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Latin America\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to talk about Latin \nAmerica. I think this has been highlighted by the President's trip \nthere and the focus the President is putting on Latin America.\n  It is so important that we not forget our own hemisphere and some of \nthe problems we are facing in our hemisphere.\n  President Bush, of course, is in Mexico right now. He is holding \ndiscussions with Mexican President Calderone. Immigration, reducing \npoverty, fighting drugs, and strengthening our economic relationship \nare all items on the agenda. This is the President's final stop on a \nfive-nation trip that included Brazil, Uruguay, Columbia, and \nGuatemala.\n  But the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, has been conducting his \nown tour, deliberately instigating protests and riots to disrupt the \nPresident's peaceful mission.\n  It is very important that we focus on Mr. Chavez and what is \nhappening in South America because it will affect the stability of our \nwhole hemisphere.\n  The problem starts in Venezuela, a nation which once enjoyed 50 years \nof democratic traditions but now is in the early stages of a \ndictatorship. Last month, elected representatives in Venezuela \nabdicated their responsibility and gave the Venezuelan leader sweeping \npower to rule for 18 months to be able to impose economic, social, and \npolitical change. These dictatorial powers would be alarming in \nanyone's hands but particularly dangerous in the hands of Hugo Chavez.\n  This strong man rules an oil-rich nation that exports 1.1 million \nbarrels of oil to the United States per day, roughly equivalent to what \nwe import from Saudi Arabia. President Chavez has already colluded with \nother OPEC nations to raise oil prices, and when he nationalizes \nmultibillion dollar crude oil projects, that is going to make the \nprices rise again. This could have a severe impact on the pocketbooks \nof American families. According to some economists, every time oil \nprices rise by 10 percent, 150,000 Americans lose their jobs.\n  Mr. Chavez has used his nation's windfall oil profits to buy \npolitical support at home and to stir trouble abroad. He says Venezuela \nhas a ``strong oil card to play on the geopolitical stage'' and ``it is \na card that we are going to play with toughness against the toughest \ncountry in the world, the United States.''\n  In his struggle against U.S. imperialism, President Chavez has found \na useful ally in the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the \nGovernment of Iran. He is one of the few leaders in the world to \npublicly support Iran's nuclear weapons program. The Iranian mullahs \nhave rewarded Mr. Chavez's friendship with lucrative contracts, \nincluding the transfer of Iranian professionals and technologies to \nVenezuela.\n  Last month, President Chavez and Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadi-\nNejad revealed plans for a $2 billion joint fund--$2 billion--part of \nwhich they say will be used as a ``mechanism for liberation'' against \nAmerican allies.\n  This could help achieve the vision that Mr. Chavez has stated:\n\n       Let's save the human race; let's finish off the U.S. \n     empire.\n\n  Mr. Chavez has grown bolder by interfering in the elections of \nseveral Latin American countries and his own brand of politics has made \nsome gains.\n  Bolivia's newly elected President, Evo Morales, has nationalized the \nenergy industry, rewritten the Constitution, and promised to work with \nMr. Chavez and Fidel Castro to perform an ``axis of good'' to oppose \nthe United States.\n  The former Soviet client, Daniel Ortega, has returned to the \nPresidency of Nicaragua. During the 1980s, Mr. Ortega ruled his country \nwith an iron fist until U.S.-backed freedom fighters ousted him from \npower. Nicaragua's democracy prospered for the next 16 years, but now \nhe's back.\n  In response to the Ortega victory, Hugo Chavez said:\n\n       Long live the Sandinista revolution.\n\n  Then, in his first week as President, Mr. Ortega met with President \nAhmadi-Nejad from Iran and told the press that Nicaragua and Iran share \ncommon interests and have common enemies.\n  Left unchecked, Presidents Ahmadi-Nejad and Chavez could be the \nKhrushchev-Castro tandem of the early 21st century, funneling arms, \nmoney, and propaganda to Latin America, endangering that region's \nfragile democracies and volatile economies. If these two succeed, the \nnext terrorist training camp could shift from the Middle East to \nAmerica's doorstep. We need to face reality. We need to confront this \nthreat head on.\n  At the pinnacle of the Cold War, President Reagan seized the \ninitiative and repulsed Soviet efforts to set up camp, in our \nhemisphere, with Cuba. We should follow that lead. We should dust off \nthe Cold War play book and become active in helping our friends to the \nsouth.\n  Specifically, we should adopt a three-pronged approach: Energy \nindependence would be No. 1. We should confront the Chavez threat head \non by reducing imports to the United States from Venezuela. How can we \ndo that? We can do it by increasing our domestic energy supply and \nproduction and\n\n[[Page S3088]]\n\naccelerate innovation for renewable fuels--wind power, solar power, \nethanol, biodiesel, even wave energy. Using the currents in the sea can \nalways produce energy, and research is going on in that effort.\n\n  There is so much we can do to make our country independent from \npeople such as Mr. Chavez and Mr. Ahmadi-Nejad and others who would try \nto affect our economy by raising the price of oil or cutting off the \nsupply.\n  No. 2, free trade. We should try to reduce heartbreaking poverty by \napproving free trade agreements with friendly Latin American countries, \nthose Latin American countries that have democracies, that want to \nincrease their economic prosperity.\n  We need to reauthorize the President's trade promotion authority \nwhich expires on July 1. Free trade and working for economic prosperity \nin these countries is the best way to keep them free.\n  And No. 3, debt relief. We should help stabilize Latin America's \nfragile democracies by reducing their crushing debt burdens. This would \nempower their newly elected governments, or their elected governments \nthat have been elected many times before, to use their revenue on \neducation and health care for their people, strengthening their \ndemocracies.\n  Energy independence, free trade, and debt relief would go a long way \ntoward helping us strengthen our whole hemisphere.\n  As we are looking at so much volatility around the world, it is \nimportant we remember that if we strengthen our hemisphere, if we \nincrease the prosperity and the living standards of people throughout \nour hemisphere, it will not only help us have stronger economic ties, \nwhich will be good for our country and other countries, we create \nexport markets for our goods as well as importing the goods from \noverseas, from Latin America, but it also is a security issue for our \ncountry. The idea that we would have terrorist training camps set up in \ncountries that are hostile to America in South America is one I don't \neven want to anticipate. It would be very harmful for the security of \nAmerica to have more of these dictatorships setting themselves up as an \n``axis of good'' to thwart American freedom and democracy.\n  I am glad our President has gone to Latin America. The President of \nMexico acknowledged that the President of the United States, after 9/\n11, had security threats that had to be addressed and, therefore, he \nwas not able to do the innovations working with South America he had \nhoped he would be able to do in his first term as President.\n  But now the President is trying to renew that promise and go to South \nAmerica and Mexico and talk about what binds us together. Land binds us \ntogether. Borders bind us together. We need good relations with Mexico \nand Central and South America. We want friendly borders. It is \nimportant for our security.\n  I hope the President's efforts are not for nought. I hope we can \nenhance what he has started by promoting free trade, by giving him the \nability to negotiate free trade agreements with more of the South \nAmerican countries that are friendly to America, by promoting \nindependence in energy supply for our country so we don't have to \ndepend on any foreign source for energy to make sure our economy stays \nstrong, and to try to help them be relieved of debt that would allow \ntheir countries to invest more in education and health care for their \npeople and their children.\n  This is an initiative whose time has come. Maybe it is an initiative \nwhose time has long since come but is now beginning to become a viable \noption for our country. I hope the President's efforts are rewarded \nwith Congress stepping up to the plate and helping America become more \nenergy independent, helping America have more free trade agreements to \nbuild up economies in these foreign countries. That would be a huge \nstep in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will you state the parliamentary \nsituation in front of the Senate at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is postcloture on the motion to \nproceed to S.J. Res. 9.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So, Madam President, we are now debating whether to \nproceed to S.J. Res. 9. I am glad the Chair clarified that. I am here \nto speak briefly, to say I hope our colleagues will say yes and will \nproceed to S.J. Res. 9. I will go into why I think that would be an \nexcellent vote for this Chamber to take. I wish to speak briefly as to \nwhere we are procedurally.\n  Our Democratic leader, Senator Reid, has presented to the Senate S.J. \nRes. 9. Its purpose is to revise the policy of the United States in \nIraq, and if ever we needed to revise the policy of the United States \nin Iraq, it is certainly now. In my belief, it was certainly a year ago \nand the year before.\n  As someone who did not vote to give the President the authorization \nto go to war in the first place, I and a number of my colleagues have \nwatched with horror as we have seen take place what we predicted.\n  We said the President did not consider what would happen if our \ntroops were not greeted as liberators and, in fact, were greeted as \noccupiers. We asked questions about the possibility of sectarian \nviolence among the Sunni, Shia, and others. We said it was a mistake to \ntake our eye off capturing bin Laden and finishing our work in \nAfghanistan, which is crucial. We wondered why the President was doing \nthis when the whole world was with us after the tragedy of 9/11. He \nturned around and went after Saddam Hussein, told us he was going to \nget nuclear weapons, told us he was harboring al-Qaida, and I will tell \nyou, Madam President, all of that proved to be false.\n  So he took the country to war on false pretenses, and who has paid \nthe price for that? The military families. The dead. These families \nhave lost over 3,000 of their nearest and dearest, and they will never, \never--ever--be the same.\n  The wounded are suffering the worst kind of wounds. These are the \nfolks who have paid the heavy price and who continue to pay the heavy \nprice.\n  I am proud of Senator Reid and the Democratic leadership. We promised \nthe people we would make this our No. 1 priority, and we are. We tried \nto debate Iraq before. The Republicans stopped us. Now we are trying to \ndo it again.\n  We have a resolution I wish to share with you, Madam President. I \nsaid it was called a Joint Resolution to Revise United States Policy in \nIraq. It says, and I am going to truncate this:\n\n  Whereas, Congress and the American people will continue to support \nand protect the troops who are serving or have served bravely and \nhonorably in Iraq; and whereas the circumstances referred to in the \nauthorization in 2002 have changed substantially; and whereas U.S. \ntroops should not be policing a civil war, and the current conflict in \nIraq requires principally a political solution; and whereas U.S. policy \nin Iraq must change to emphasize the need for a political solution by \nIraqi leaders in order to maximize the chance of success and to more \neffectively fight the war on terror; therefore be it resolved that we \ntransition this mission away from being in the middle of a civil war \ntoward being supportive of the Iraqi troops and training them; that we \nshall begin the phased redeployment of the U.S. Forces from Iraq not \nlater than 120 days after enactment of the resolution; that we then \nmove forward with a comprehensive strategy so that we finally resolve \nthis Iraq quagmire--it means that it has to be diplomatic and political \nand economic--and that there be a report every 60 days so we know how \nthis redeployment is going.\n  This is a breath of fresh air. This resolution is a breath of fresh \nair into a situation where you can't even breathe you are so suffocated \nfrom the tragedy, from the deaths, from the wounded, from the \nexplosions every single day. So, yes, we are debating whether we should \nproceed to S.J. Res. 9, and I hope we will.\n  In closing, let me say this. There is a lot of talk about loving the \ntroops, and I think every one of us in this Chamber loves the troops, \nso I have a rhetorical point here. If you love the troops, and I \nbelieve we all do, why put them in the middle of a civil war where they \ncan't tell who is shooting at them? If you love the troops, why do you \ngive them a mission they can't accomplish? They can't solve the civil \nwar. That has to be done diplomatically, politically. If you love the \ntroops, why would you lower the standards for their future colleagues \nin arms? We are stunned to see that convicted violent felons are\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\nnow being taken into the military, that is how desperately stretched \nthe military is.\n  If you love the troops, why would you put them in a place such as \nWalter Reed, where you have mold on the walls and vermin, and not give \nthem the access when they leave Washington and go back home, not give \nthem definitive access to the help they need?\n  Why would you send them, if you loved the troops, out to battle again \nand again and again? I met a man yesterday whose son is on his third \ntour. I have the charts in front of my office with the names of the \nCalifornia dead. He looked at that, and I saw the look on his face, and \nI said, what is wrong? He said, I have a son in Iraq, third tour of \nduty, no rest.\n  So why do you have a rule that says they have to have rest; they have \nto be properly trained; they have to have the proper equipment?\n  If you love the troops, why would you continue to send them over in \nthat fashion, without being properly equipped or trained? Why would you \nsend them out on the battlefield with post-traumatic stress and a \nbottle of antidepressants, if you loved the troops?\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of S.J. Res. 9. This is a comprehensive \nsolution. The other side of this debate keeps saying, well, where is \nyour solution? Here it is. It is right there. We transform the mission \nto a mission that can be accomplished, not mission impossible. That \nmission will be to protect United States and coalition personnel and \ninfrastructure, training and equipping Iraqi forces, and conducting \ntargeted counterterrorism operations. Now that is a mission we can \naccomplish.\n  As for sending our troops into the middle of a civil war, that is \nwrong, and I don't believe anyone who voted for that resolution--and I \nam so proud and so glad I didn't vote for that resolution to take this \ncountry into this ill-fated war, but if you voted for it, you didn't \nvote to put troops in the middle of a civil war. So if that is where we \nare right now, we need to change it.\n  You know, Martin Luther King--and I read this recently--who is one of \nmy heroes in life, said during the Vietnam war that what can happen to \nyou when you are faced with these horrible options, these horrible \nchoices--and by the way, the worst kind of leadership, no matter where \nit comes from, is a leadership that gives you no good choices, okay? \nBut Martin Luther King said, when you are faced with that \ncircumstance--and he was talking about Vietnam, where it was tragic, \nthere were no good choices, what could we do--said, paralysis sets in \nand people can't change. What happens is the status quo prevails and it \nbecomes a new reality: dead, dead, dead soldiers every day, suicide \nbombs, and we can't get out of it.\n  The surge isn't a new strategy. It has been tried before. We know \nwhat is happening. The enemy tells us what is happening. They are \nleaving, going someplace else to cause trouble; waiting it out. We know \nthey will adjust to this.\n  There is only one solution, and that is why S.J. Res. 9 is so \nimportant. What is the solution? We spell it out. A comprehensive \nstrategy shall be implemented as part of a comprehensive diplomatic, \npolitical, and economic strategy that includes sustained engagement \nwith Iraq's neighbors and the international community for the purpose \nof working collectively to bring stability to Iraq.\n  There is no more coalition of the willing. They are all leaving, \nwhether it is Great Britain--which now is going to have only a few \nthousand troops there--Italy, Spain, Portugal. I could go through the \nlist. They are all leaving. We need to redeploy our troops and we need \na comprehensive strategy. I am proud to support S.J. Res. 9, and I hope \nwhen we have this vote we will vote to proceed to this very important \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have a lot of respect for the Senator \nfrom California, but I couldn't disagree with her more on this topic, \nand I will explain why.\n  This resolution that is currently before the Senate calls for the \nPresident to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq within 120 days. It \ncalls for withdrawing all combat forces from Iraq--all combat forces \nfrom Iraq--by March 31, 2008, and it calls for limiting the flexibility \nof our military commanders to go after the enemy.\n  None of these provisions strikes me as wise or a good idea. And it is \nnot just me. Let me quote from January 31, 2005, a speech made by one \nof our distinguished Members at the National Press Club. This \ndistinguished Senator said: ``As far as setting a timeline, that is not \na wise decision, because it only empowers those who don't want us \nthere.'' Who was that speaker? Well, none other than our majority \nleader, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat from Nevada, who said, ``It is not \na wise decision to set a timeline, because it only empowers those who \ndon't want us there.''\n  Senator Reid was not the only one. Senator Clinton said, ``I don't \nbelieve it's smart to set a date for withdrawal. I don't think you \nshould ever telegraph your intentions to the enemy so they can await \nyou.'' That was a comment she made on February 13, 2007.\n  Senator Joe Biden, Democrat from Delaware, said: ``A deadline for \npulling out will only encourage our enemies to wait us out.'' He said \nthat on June 21, 2005, in a speech at the Brookings Institution in \nWashington, DC.\n  I think we find ourselves in a time warp, but it is hard to know \nwhether the distinguished majority leader's position is what he says \ntoday, when he says we ought to set a timeline for the withdrawal of \ntroops, or whether we ought to credit his remarks made in 2005, when he \nsaid it is not a wise decision because it only empowers the enemy.\n  I think we know where the differences come down. There are those, as \nthe distinguished Senator from California said a few moments, who \nregard what we are doing in Iraq, and she used these words, as \n``mission impossible.'' In other words, there are those who simply have \ngiven up, who believe all is lost and there is nothing we can possibly \ndo to reverse the tide in Iraq and in the global war on terror, what \nZarqawi, the former head of al-Qaida in Iraq, called the central front \nin al-Qaida's war against the rest of the civilized world.\n  What I would suggest is that this resolution, which calls for \nwithdrawing troops beginning in the next 120 days, sets a hard deadline \nof March 31, 2008, to withdraw all troops and which limits the \nflexibility of our military commanders to go after the enemy. This is \nnot a plan to succeed. This is a plan destined to fail. Because, in \nfact, to give the critics some credit, they have given up, so they \nbelieve all that is left is retreat, to admit defeat. But this Senator \nis not prepared to give up on either the mission or the members of our \nmilitary who are carrying out that mission in Iraq.\n  Arbitrary deadlines for withdrawal and micromanaging our military \ncommanders on the ground is not a military strategy, it is a recipe for \ndefeat. The problem is the new majority and the Democrat strategy can \nbest be characterized as one of slow bleed, micromanage, and say nice \nthings about supporting the troops but don't support the mission we \nsent them on. I have said before, and I will say it again, if you \nbelieve all is lost and there is no possibility of success in the war \nin Iraq, to me, the logical conclusion is you would defund the effort \nto support that mission there. In other words, you would use the tool \nthat is available to Members of Congress, the power of the purse, to \ncut off the funds.\n  I disagree with that. I don't think we should. But Senator Dodd and \nSenator Feingold have been the ones who have said, you know what, \npassing nonbinding resolutions is simply not worthy of the Senate. \nNowhere else in life can you pass a nonbinding resolution, make a \n``no'' decision and be credited for doing anything. Only here in \nWashington, only in the Senate can you pass a nonbinding resolution and \nsomebody says, you know what, we have done something. Well, the fact \nis, the only thing we would have done is to lend encouragement to those \nwho want to see us fail in Iraq and to possibly undermine the morale \nand support given for our troops who are in harm's way.\n  Giving the enemy a timetable when American troops should withdraw \nfrom Iraq only helps the enemy plan on how to accomplish their goals, \nnot ours. \n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\nOur focus should be, how can we succeed in Iraq. The irony of this \nproposal--the best I can tell, the 17th proposal that has come from the \nmajority since we began talking about Iraq resolutions--is it comes at \na time when the new Baghdad security plan appears to be making some \nhopeful signs toward success. One of those signs is Muqtada al-Sadr, \nthe radical Shiite cleric who is in charge of the Shiite militias in \nIraq, has fled the country because he knows the American military and \nour Iraqi allies are beginning to enter areas such as Sadr City, which \nhave been in his sole province and domain. He has left to go to Tehran, \nto Iran. Similarly, he has instructed the Mahdi armies, the Shiite \nmilitias, not to confront the American soldiers or Iraqi allies as they \ngo in to clear, hold, and build in some of the previously most \ndangerous areas of Iraq, that of Sadr City.\n\n  Democrats have offered 17 proposals on how to lose in Iraq but not a \nsingle proposal on how to succeed. The chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Levin, recently conceded that there are \nbetween 5,000 and 6,000 members of al-Qaida in Iraq--specifically in Al \nAnbar Province. To pass legislation that sets an arbitrary deadline for \nwithdrawing our combat forces without defeating al-Qaida in Iraq makes \nno sense. Rather, it would provide potentially a safe haven, a power \nvacuum into which al-Qaida could reestablish itself, gain a foothold, \nand use that platform as a place to launch terrorist attacks against \nthe United States and other countries.\n  The Iraqis know our commitment to Iraq is not open-ended, so it is \nsimply not accurate to say that is the position of either the \nadministration or anyone in this body. No one has made an open-ended \ncommitment to Iraq. The Iraqis understand that the future of Iraq is in \nthe hands of Iraqis, and that is exactly where it should be.\n  But to pass legislation that micromanages how our troops should fight \nand to try to make tactical decisions on how to handle those 130,000 or \nso troops on the ground from Washington, DC, is simply crazy. We \nunanimously confirmed GEN David Petraeus, who essentially is the \narchitect of the counterinsurgency plan now being carried out in \nBaghdad. General Petraeus will lead our operations in Iraq and, \nfrankly, he doesn't need armchair generals here in Washington, DC, \ntrying to tell him what to do. General Petraeus knows what to do, and \nthat is the reason the Senate unanimously confirmed him to carry out \nthis new Baghdad security plan.\n  If Members of this body really support our troops, then they will \nprovide our troops with the resources they need to accomplish their \nmission and not engage in a slow-bleed strategy of cutting off \nresources or reinforcements. We all want our troops to come home as \nsoon as possible. But any decision to withdraw from Iraq should be \nbased strictly upon national security considerations and not on \npolitical expediency.\n  We find that even our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nconflicted internally about the best strategy as reflected by this now \n17th iteration of their resolution strategy. A Washington Post \neditorial dated March 13 labels the restrictions on Iraq war funding \ndrawn up by House Democrats--and the 17th proposal on Iraq, by the \nway--this is the Washington Post. They called it ``something of a \ntrick,'' and is merely ``an inflexible timetable, conforming to the \nneed to capture votes in Congress or at the 2008 polls.''\n  Then an article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday quotes House \nAppropriations Committee chairman, Democrat of Wisconsin, David Obey, \nsaying this about the language contained in the wartime spending bill \npassed or being considered in the House--specifically regarding the \nbenchmarks laid out for Iraq. Mr. Obey is quoted as saying:\n\n       I don't know if these are the right benchmarks or right \n     conditions or right timetable.\n\n  Mr. Obey said:\n\n       It's a huge mistake for people to look at this word and \n     that word. . . . This language will change 10 minutes after \n     it passes the House.\n\n  The Vice President was quoted as saying this on March 12, and I \ncouldn't agree with him more in this regard. He said:\n\n       The second myth is the most transparent. And that is the \n     notion that one can support the troops without giving them \n     the tools and reinforcements necessary to carry out their \n     mission. . . . When members of Congress pursue an anti-war \n     strategy that's been called slow bleed, they're not \n     supporting the troops, they are undermining them. And when \n     members of Congress speak not of victory, but of time \n     limits--when members speak not of victory but of time limits, \n     deadlines or other arbitrary measures, they're telling the \n     enemy simply to watch the clock and wait us out. . . . Anyone \n     can say they support the troops and we should take them at \n     their word. But the proof will come when it's time to provide \n     the money. We expect the House and Senate to meet the needs \n     of our military and the generals leading the troops in battle \n     on time and in full measure.\n\n  I couldn't agree with the Vice President any more than in those \nquoted remarks. We have now had 17 different proposals from Democrats \nin the Senate to date. Maybe there are more to come but 17 so far. For \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle to propose this ever-\nshifting plan of how to deal with Iraq is simply not constructive.\n  I must say that it is simply absurd that we would tell our enemy when \nwe plan to leave Iraq. I am joined in that belief by Senator Clinton \nand Senator Reid, from the statements I quoted earlier.\n  This Senator is not prepared to give up on our men and women in \nuniform, and I am not prepared to agree to arbitrary timetables or \nstrings on the money that we appropriate that will limit their ability \nto be successful. I hope all of us, Republican or Democrat alike--all \nAmericans would hope that our American soldiers, sailors, marines, and \nairmen will come back home safely but after they have accomplished the \nmission we have asked them to take on, and that is to leave Iraq in a \ncondition where it is stabilized, where it is able to govern itself and \ndefend itself. Only then will we have eliminated another safe haven for \nal-Qaida and terrorist activities. Only then will we have reduced to \nthe barest possible minimum the likelihood that we will have to return \nfollowing a regional conflagration, following a vast humanitarian \ncrisis and ethnic cleansing that is likely to occur if we do not take \nevery possible step to see this Baghdad security plan succeed.\n  Yes, we all want our troops to come home as soon as possible. Some of \nus are not willing to set arbitrary deadlines or to bring our troops \nback home based on some calendar that bears no relationship to \nconditions on the ground. We want them to come home as soon as \npossible, but after they have accomplished the mission that they so \nbravely have taken on and in which they are so nobly led by GEN David \nPetraeus.\n  I believe S. Res. 9 is misguided. It should be defeated, and I will \ndo everything within my power to urge my colleagues to so vote.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, after 4 years of fighting and the loss of \nalmost 3,200 American lives, 24,000 wounded, $350 billion spent on this \nwar, it is long past time for a new approach in Iraq. Everybody who \nparticipates in this debate wants to maximize our chances of success in \nIraq. Even those of us who voted against going to war and those of us \nwho have disagreed with how this war has been conducted want to see a \nstable Iraq which enhances our own national security.\n  But continuing the current course and surging along the current \ncourse does not do that. The President's current course of action, of \nputting more U.S. military personnel in the middle of a growing civil \nwar in Iraq, does not enhance our security and it does not maximize the \nchances of success.\n  The President's plan has a fundamental flaw because what is needed in \nIraq is a political solution among the Iraqi leaders, not a military \nsolution. Our troops perform bravely and brilliantly, but American \nmilitary firepower will not end the civil war in Iraq. It has been \napparent for a long time that there is no military solution in Iraq, \nthat an Iraqi political solution is necessary to end the violence. GEN \nPeter Chiarelli, commanding general of\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\nthe multinational force in Iraq, said the following in December:\n\n       We need a commitment by all Iraqis, of all of the ethno-\n     sectarian groups to commit first to nonviolence and to \n     resolving their differences through the political process . . \n     .\n\n  And he continued:\n\n       I happen to believe that we have done everything militarily \n     that we possibly can.\n\n  At his confirmation hearing in December, I asked our new Secretary of \nDefense, Bob Gates:\n\n       Do you believe that the end to violence in Iraq requires a \n     political settlement, and that we need to communicate a sense \n     of urgency to the Iraqis to pressure them to reach a \n     settlement that only their politicians can reach?\n\n  Dr. Gates replied:\n\n       Yes, I do.\n\n  The Iraq Study Group stated that:\n\n       The violence in Iraq cannot be stopped or even contained if \n     there is no underlying political agreement among Iraqis about \n     the future of their country.\n\n  Perhaps most telling was Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki's acknowledgment \nrecently on this essential point. This is what Iraq's own Prime \nMinister said:\n\n       The crisis is political. And the ones who can stop the \n     cycle of aggravation and blood-letting of innocents are the \n     Iraqi politicians.\n\n  The real battle for Baghdad is not a military battle, it is a \npolitical one, and that battle can be resolved only by Iraqi \npoliticians and not by our military.\n  So how do we pressure the Iraqi leaders to reach the political \nsettlement that is essential? We can start by ending our open-ended \ncommitment to Iraq. The President has changed his rhetoric about ending \nour open-ended commitment, but he has not changed his policy. In fact, \nhe sent the opposite message when he sent more troops to Baghdad.\n  Our objective in Iraq, and the objective of this resolution, must be \nto shift responsibility to the Iraqis, both politically and militarily, \nfor their future. For that to happen, we must end the open-ended \ncommitment that has been made by this administration to Iraq of the \npresence--without decision by us, leaving it up to the Iraqis for how \nlong and how many--of American troops.\n  We must make clear to the Iraqis that their future is in their hands, \nnot ours. We must make it clear to the Iraqis they must reach a \npolitical settlement among themselves and, if they do not, we cannot \nsave them from themselves.\n  As General Abizaid said in November:\n\n       It's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  General Casey made the same point in early January when he said:\n\n       The longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main \n     burden of Iraq's security, it lengthens the time that the \n     government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about \n     reconciliation and dealing with the militias. And the other \n     thing is that they can continue to blame us for all of Iraq's \n     problems, which are at base their problems.\n\n  The Iraq Study Group specifically drew the connection between the \nimportance of ending the open-ended commitment of American troops and \npersuading the Iraqis to make political compromises. There is a \nconnection between the two, the Iraq Study Group said, between ending \nthe open-ended commitment and getting the Iraqis to resolve their \npolitical differences. Here is the way they put it in the Iraq Study \nGroup's report:\n\n       An open-ended commitment of American forces would not \n     provide the Iraqi government the incentive it needs to take \n     the political actions that give Iraq the best chance of \n     quelling sectarian violence. In the absence of such an \n     incentive, the Iraqi government might continue to delay \n     taking those difficult actions.\n\n  That is the Iraq Study Group.\n  Columnist Tom Friedman put it succinctly recently in the New York \nTimes:\n\n       Right now everyone in Iraq is having their cake and eating \n     it--at our expense. We have to change that.\n\n  But instead of putting pressure on the Iraqis, the President is \nputting his faith in the Iraqis to meet certain benchmarks they have \nset for themselves. But look at the track record of the Iraqi \nGovernment in meeting some of the benchmarks and promises it has set \nfor itself and it has made.\n  Iraqi President Talibani said in August of 2006 that Iraqi forces \nwould ``take over security in all Iraqi provinces by the end of 2006.'' \nThat pledge surely has not been kept.\n  Prime Minister Maliki said last June he would disband the militias \nand illegal armed groups as part of his national reconciliation plan, \nand in October he set the timetable for disbanding the militias as the \nend of 2006. That commitment has not been kept.\n  The Iraqi Constitutional Review Commission was to present its \nrecommendations for changes in the constitution to the Council of \nRepresentatives within 4 months of the formation of the Iraqi \nGovernment last May. Well, the commission has yet to formulate any \nrecommendations.\n  Prime Minister Maliki put forward a series of reconciliation \nmilestones to be completed by the end of 2006 or early 2007, including \napproval of the provincial election law, approval of a new de-\nbaathification law, and approval of a new militia law. Not one of those \nlaws has been enacted.\n  On January 30, Secretary Rice wrote to me about these benchmarks. She \nsaid the Iraqi Government had adopted a lot of benchmarks, and she \nattached those benchmarks to her letter called ``Notional Political \nTimeline.''\n  Here is what she said about the benchmarks attached to her letter:\n\n        . . . Iraq's Policy Committee on National Security agreed \n     upon a set of political, security, and economic benchmarks \n     and an associated timeline in September 2006.\n\n  Then she said:\n\n       These were reaffirmed by the Presidency Council on October \n     16, 2006, and referenced by the Iraq Study Group; the \n     relevant document (enclosed) was posted at that time on the \n     President of Iraq's website.\n\n  The posted document shows one benchmark after another, starting in \nSeptember 2006, going through March of 2007, and I am going to read \nthem off.\n  By September 2006:\n\n       Form a Constitutional Review Committee;\n       Approve the law and procedures to form regions;\n       Agree on political timetable;\n       Approve the law for Independent High Electoral Commission \n     (IHEC);\n       Approve the Investment Law.\n\n  By October 2006:\n\n       Approve provincial elections law and set date for \n     provincial elections;\n       Approve a hydrocarbon law.\n\n  By November 2006:\n\n       Approve a de-Ba'athification law;\n       Approve provincial council authorities law;\n       Approve a flag, emblem and national anthem law.\n\n  By December 2006:\n\n       Approve Coalition Provisional Authority . . . concerning \n     armed forces and militias;\n       Council of Representatives to address amnesty, militias and \n     other armed formations;\n       Approve amnesty, militias and other armed formations law.\n\n  By January 2007--this was the timeline--\n\n       Constitutional Review Committee completes its work.\n\n  By February 2007:\n\n       Form independent commissions in accordance with the \n     Constitution.\n\n  By March:\n\n       Constitutional amendments referendum (if required).\n\n  Now, there may have been one or two of those guidelines met. If so, I \nam not sure what they are, but I want to at least allow the possibility \nthat a flag, emblem, and national anthem law was adopted. But of those \nperhaps 15 milestones--and a timeline for them--to be adopted by the \nIraqi Presidency, not more than one--but maybe two--of the 15 have been \nadopted. And none of the important ones have been adopted.\n  We are told by Secretary Rice, that was on the Web site of the \nPresident of Iraq. Then suddenly and mysteriously it disappeared from \nthat Web site a few months ago.\n  When I asked Secretary Rice--I wrote her a letter asking: You said, \nMadam Secretary, this was on the Web site, but it disappeared from the \nWeb site. Can you find out why? We have not heard back from the \nSecretary of State about that problem.\n  So much for the promises and commitments and milestones of the Iraqi \nleadership. They post them on a Web site month by month what these \npromises and commitments and milestones and benchmarks are, and then--\npoof--they disappear from the Web site, just as though they were not \nmade. That is the problem with milestones, benchmarks which have no \nconsequences when they are not met.\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\n  The President talks about benchmarks, and yet he has not outlined any \nconsequences for the Iraqis if they fail to meet these new benchmarks. \nI have little hope they will meet benchmarks they lay out unless they \nsee no alternative. It is time to go beyond the toothless benchmarks \nand to make clear to the Iraqi leaders their dawdling must end and that \ntheir nation is in their hands, and we cannot decide for them how to \nbuild a nation, whether to build a nation, or whether they prefer to \nhave a civil war.\n  The administration says our debate on this bill would embolden the \nenemy. But what that shows is a serious lack of understanding of the \nsituation we face. Congressional debate over Iraq policy does not \nembolden the enemy. The enemy is already emboldened. The enemy is \nemboldened by an open-ended presence of western troops in a Muslim \ncountry's capital, which serves as a magnet for extremists and gives a \npropaganda club to our enemies.\n  The enemy is emboldened by an invasion of Iraq without the support of \nthe international community, and with no plan for a violent aftermath. \nThe enemy is emboldened by a million and a half Iraqi refugees, with \nthousands more being added each day. The enemy is emboldened by a surge \nof American troops into a civil war that postpones the day when Iraqi \nleaders will take responsibility for their own future.\n  And now our responsibility as a Congress. What is our responsibility? \nWhat this resolution does is implement our responsibility by working to \nmake the day when Iraqi leaders take responsibility for their own \nnation come sooner rather than later. The most recent intelligence \nestimate says ``the current security and political trends in Iraq are \nmoving in a negative direction.''\n  Our resolution is the best way to stop the Iraqi leaders from \ncontinuing to fiddle while Baghdad burns. It would seek to pressure the \nIraqi leaders to achieve a political solution by requiring our \nPresident to promptly transition the mission of American forces in Iraq \nto protecting United States and coalition personnel and infrastructure, \nto training and equipping Iraqi forces, and to conducting targeted \ncounterterrorism operations.\n  Our resolution would require the President to begin the phased \nredeployment of United States forces from Iraq not later than 120 days \nafter enactment, with the goal--I emphasize ``goal''--of redeploying \nall United States combat forces by March 31, 2008, except for--except \nfor--those that are needed to carry out the three missions which are \ndescribed in the resolution, and which I have just outlined. That goal \nand the three limited missions are the same as the goal and the limited \nmissions recommended by the Iraq Study Group.\n  Passing this resolution would deliver a cold dose of reality to the \nIraqi leaders and would tell them we are not going to be their security \nblanket without end. When they finally understand our military presence \nin Iraq is neither permanent nor unconditional, then--and only then--\nare they likely to take the political steps necessary to deal with \nsectarian violence and to defeat the insurgency.\n  By shifting responsibility to the Iraqis for their own future and \ntheir own country, this resolution does what is needed the most--it \nputs pressure on the Iraqis to reach a political settlement.\n  As we consider the future of our involvement in Iraq, we must always \nbe mindful of the price our military and their families are paying as a \nresult of multiple deployments of units and people to Iraq. We must be \nmindful that the lack of attention to Afghanistan and Pakistan has \nallowed al-Qaida and the Taliban to regroup and strengthen. We must \nalso be mindful that our nondeployed forces lack the equipment and \nother resources needed to maintain an acceptable level of readiness, \nand, as a result, the risk our Nation faces has substantially \nincreased.\n  We must be tragically mindful, always, that the pledge to take care \nof those courageous soldiers and marines, who have sustained serious \nphysical and mental injuries in combat, has been broken by this \nadministration.\n  In recent days, there have been statements suggesting a debate in \nCongress on the war in Iraq is undermining the troops. Just last \nMonday, Vice President Cheney said, among other things, that:\n\n       When Members of Congress pursue an antiwar strategy . . . \n     they are not supporting the troops, they are undermining \n     them.\n\n  Contrast the Vice President's statement with statements Secretary of \nDefense Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Pace \nmade recently on February 7 before the House Armed Services Committee.\n  Here is what Secretary Gates said:\n\n       I would tell you that I think that our troops do understand \n     that everybody involved in this debate is looking to do the \n     right thing for our country and for our troops, and that \n     everybody is looking for the best way to avoid an outcome \n     that leaves Iraq in chaos. And I think our troops are \n     sophisticated enough to understand that that's what the \n     debate's really about. It's about the path forward in Iraq.\n\n  Here is what General Pace said, and contrast this to what Vice \nPresident Cheney said--how worthy Secretary Gates' statement is--and \nlisten to how worthy General Pace's statement is compared to the stale \nand unworthy comments of the Vice President of the United States about \nwhat this debate signifies.\n  General Pace:\n\n       There is no doubt in my mind that the dialogue here in \n     Washington strengthens our democracy. Period.\n\n  And then he added:\n\n       From the standpoint of the troops, I believe that they \n     understand how our legislature works and they understand that \n     there is going to be this kind of debate.\n\n  When I listened to the Vice President and his unworthy remarks, it \nreminded me of not only how worthy our troops are and how they are \nprofessional enough to understand what their duty is, but also that \nthey are loyal Americans to know and understand that it is our duty to \ndebate this war. For those of us who think it is leading in the wrong \ndirection and going nowhere, it is on a road to failure, it is our duty \nto try to change that course.\n  Contrast our troops and their honor and their loyalty to the \nprinciples upon which this Nation was founded, reflected, interestingly \nenough, in a poll taken of our military by the Military Times. This \npoll was printed in the Army Times a few months ago. The question that \nwas asked of our troops was whether they approve of the President's \nhandling of the war in Iraq. Forty-two percent of our troops \ndisapproved of the President's handling of the war in Iraq. Thirty-five \npercent of our troops approved of the handling of the war by their \nCommander in Chief. They are divided as Americans are divided. We \nshould not only respect their bravery, we should respect their \nintelligence and their commitment to this debate in the Congress. That \nis what they are fighting for: that we can debate a mission and we can \ndebate how to best secure this country so that we can debate how to \nbest succeed in Iraq.\n  That is what our troops believe in. That is what they are fighting \nfor. It is insulting to them. It is insulting to them to say, as the \nVice President of the United States said, that a debate in the United \nStates Congress as to how best to succeed in Iraq, how best to change \nthe course in Iraq, somehow or other undermines the troops.\n  So we have before us an opportunity, an opportunity which can only be \nachieved if this debate can advance beyond the motion to proceed. We \nwill be voting on that motion later on today or tomorrow. I hope that \nSenators, regardless of our views on this war, will allow this Senate \nto once again debate the direction in Iraq. The last real vote we had \nwas one that denied us this opportunity to proceed. I hope there will \nbe enough of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who will \nrecognize the importance of this debate to this future--the future of \nthis country, to the future of this world, perhaps; to the lives of so \nmany of our gallant, brave troops and their families, and perhaps, \nindeed, to the future well-being of this institution because this \ninstitution surely should be about debating issues as transcendently \nimportant as our future in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that some correspondence \nbetween myself and Secretary Rice, and Senator McCain and myself with \nSecretary Rice be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\n\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     United States Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your recent letters \n     regarding the way forward in Iraq and the role of benchmarks \n     for political issues Iraq must solve. The President has also \n     asked that I reply on his behalf to your December 12, 2006, \n     letter to him concerning the importance of announcing a \n     deadline for beginning a phased redeployment from Iraq.\n       I share your view that the Iraqi Government must meet the \n     goal it has set for itself--establishing a democratic, \n     unified, and secure Iraq. We believe the Iraqi Government \n     understands very well the consequences of failing to make the \n     tough decisions necessary to allow all Iraqis to live in \n     peace and security. President Bush has been clear with Prime \n     Minister Maliki on this score, as have I and other senior \n     officials in discussions with our counterparts. We expect the \n     Prime Minister to follow through on his pledges to the \n     President that he would take difficult decisions.\n       In his January 10 address, the President stated that after \n     careful consideration he had decided that announcing a phased \n     withdrawal of our combat forces at this time would open the \n     door to a collapse of the Iraqi Government and the country \n     being torn apart. The New Way Forward in Iraq that the \n     President announced on January 10 is designed to help the \n     Government of Iraq to succeed. This strategy has the strong \n     support of General Petraeus and his commanders, and we must \n     give the strategy time to succeed.\n       On your point about a political solution being critical to \n     long-term success, I also agree. However, with violence in \n     the capital at the levels we have seen since the Samarra \n     attack on February 22, 2006, extremists and terrorists have \n     been able to hold the political process hostage. The \n     President's strategy is designed to dampen the present level \n     of violence in Baghdad and ensure that Iraq's political \n     center has the security and stability it needs to negotiate \n     lasting political accommodations through Iraq's new \n     democratic institutions.\n       At the same time, the President has made clear to the Prime \n     Minister and other Iraqi leaders that America's commitment is \n     not open-ended. It is essential that the Government of Iraq--\n     with our help, but its lead--set out measurable, achievable \n     goals and objectives on each of three critical, strategic \n     tracks: political, security, and economic. In this regard, \n     Iraq's Policy Committee on National Security agreed upon a \n     set of political, security, and economic benchmarks and an \n     associated timeline in September 2006. These were reaffirmed \n     by the Presidency Council on October 16, 2006, and referenced \n     by the Iraq Study Group; the relevant document (enclosed) was \n     posted at that time on the President of Iraq's website.\n       Beyond that, as the President said, Prime Minister Maliki \n     made a number of additional commitments including:\n       Non-interference in operations of the Iraqi Security \n     Forces;\n       Prosecution of all who violate the law, regardless of sect \n     or religion;\n       Deployment of three additional Iraqi army brigades to \n     Baghdad; and\n       Use of $10 billion for reconstruction.\n       We will continually assess Iraq's progress in meeting these \n     commitments as well as other initiatives critical to Iraq's \n     development.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Condoleezza Rice.\n\n                         Unofficial Translation\n\n\n                      National Political Timeline\n\n     September 2006\n       Form Constitutional Review Committee\n       Approve law on procedures to form regions\n       Agree on political timetable\n       Approve the law for Independent High Electoral Commission \n     (IHEC)\n       Approve the Investment Law\n     October 2006\n       Approve provincial elections law and set date for \n     provincial elections\n       Approve a hydrocarbon law\n     November 2006\n       Approve de-Ba'athification law\n       Approve provincial council authorities law\n       Approve a flag, emblem and national anthem law\n     December 2006\n       Approve Coalition Provisional Authority Order 91 concerning \n     armed forces and militias\n       Council of Representatives to address amnesty, militias and \n     other armed formations\n       Approve amnesty, militias and other armed formations law\n     January 2007\n       Constitutional Review Committee completes its work\n     February 2007\n       Form independent commissions in accordance with the \n     Constitution\n     March 2007\n       Constitutional amendments referendum (if required)\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2007.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: On November 14, 2006 Senator Levin \n     sent you a letter (attached) asking that you provide the \n     agreed timeline and benchmarks (or the U.S. proposal for \n     such) of political issues to be resolved by the Iraqi \n     Government in the coming months. At that time he also \n     requested the same from Secretary Rumsfeld. On December 4, he \n     heard from Under Secretary of Defense Edelman that the State \n     Department had received his letter and had agreed to respond \n     on behalf of the Administration. Having not heard from the \n     State Department for two months, Senator Levin again wrote to \n     you (attached) on January 16, 2007 reiterating his request \n     and noting his expectation that you would be courteous enough \n     to respond by the end of last week. Unfortunately, you have \n     not done so, which necessitates yet another request.\n       In his January 10 address to the nation on his new strategy \n     for Iraq, President Bush said that ``America will hold the \n     Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.'' It is \n     essential that Congress have the information on those \n     benchmarks to comprehensively consider as it addresses the \n     way ahead in Iraq. It is both baffling and disturbing that \n     the Administration will not provide the timeline and \n     benchmarks, and it is our joint expectation that you will do \n     so promptly, and by the end of this week at the latest. If \n     the benchmarks to which the President referred include \n     additional commitments beyond those initially agreed to by \n     the Iraqi government, then our expectation is that you will \n     make that clear in your response, and will clearly indicate \n     which are new commitments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     U.S. Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: On November 14, 2006 I sent you a \n     letter (attached) asking that you provide the agreed timeline \n     and benchmarks (or the U.s. proposal for such) of political \n     issues to be resolved by the Iraqi Government in the coming \n     months. At that time I requested the same from Secretary \n     Rumsfeld. On December 4, I heard from Under Secretary of \n     Defense Edelman that the State Department had received my \n     letter and had agreed to respond on behalf of the \n     Administration. I have yet to hear from the State Department \n     in this regard.\n       As I stated in my first letter, this information will be \n     essential to the Congress' consideration of a way ahead on \n     Iraq. Now that the President has announced his new strategy \n     for Iraq, this information is even more vital. I am very \n     disappointed that two months have gone by and you have not \n     responded to my initial request. In view of the passage of \n     time and the importance of this issue, I expect to receive \n     the timeline and benchmarks by the end of this week.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2006.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     U.S. Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: The top priority for the coming \n     months must be finding a way forward to change course in \n     Iraq. U.S. policy must include urging the Iraqis to make the \n     necessary political compromises, which only they can make, to \n     preserve Iraq as a nation. Our military commanders have made \n     clear there is no military solution; only a political \n     solution can restore security in Iraq.\n       The Administration announced last month that Iraqi leaders \n     had agreed to a timeline and benchmarks for a political \n     process over the coming months. On October 25, 2006, \n     President Bush stated that the Administration and the Iraqi \n     Government were developing benchmarks for determining whether \n     the ``hard decisions necessary to achieve peace'' were being \n     made. Earlier, on October 24, 2006, Ambassador Zalmay \n     Khalilzad stated that Iraqi leaders had agreed to a timeline \n     for making the hard decisions on outstanding issues and that \n     President Talibani had made those commitments public. \n     According to Ambassador Khalilzad and General Casey, these \n     included enactment of an oil law for sharing resources; a \n     constitutional amendment on powersharing that would guarantee \n     democratic rights and equality to all Iraqis; reforming the \n     de-Ba'athification Commission; and increasing the credibility \n     and capability of Iraqi forces. However, on October 25, 2006, \n     Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki stated publicly that no timetable \n     has been set.\n       Please provide the agreed timeline and benchmarks (or the \n     U.S. proposal for such) of political issues to be resolved by \n     the Iraqi Government in the coming months. This information \n     will be essential to the Congress' consideration of a way \n     ahead on Iraq.\n       Thank you for your assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Senator from Rhode Island yield?\n  Mr. REED. I yield for the purpose of a question, yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was wondering if we could determine the timing for \ndebate, and I was wondering who is arranging debate on this side of the \naisle.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Rhode Island \nwould yield.\n  Mr. REED. I will yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is no order that has been established, No. 1. I \nwould like very much to establish an order for the convenience of all \nSenators, but I would have to know more about the other side in terms \nof what their wishes are. I know Senator Schumer wanted to begin at \nabout 1:45, and then I know Senator Dorgan was in the queue--it is an \ninformal queue. I believe, if my memory is correct, although I don't \nhave the sheet of paper in front of me, Senator Dorgan wanted to come \nout between 3:00 and 4:00.\n  We will do everything we can to accommodate Senators, and if Senators \ncould let me know, for those who want to speak in favor of the motion \nto proceed, when they would like to be here and about how long they \nneed, I would be most appreciative, and I will try to put together an \norder.\n  Can we put in an order now that Senator Reed has the floor, and we \nwould be happy to alternate if a Republican shows up. Let me ask \nSenator Dorgan. I did tell Senator Schumer that we would try to fit him \nin at 1:45. Can we put Senator Specter in immediately after Senator \nSchumer? Could we put the Senator from Pennsylvania in immediately \nafter Senator Schumer because I have not specified with him the amount \nof time he needs. But I would prevail upon him to see if he could end \nclose to 1:55. Let me raise that with Senator Schumer.\n  Could I ask the Senator from Rhode Island about how much time he \nneeds?\n  Mr. REED. Apparently, approximately 10 minutes or until Senator \nSchumer arrives.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As always, he is most accommodating. The Presiding Officer \napparently also wishes to have time. Could we put the Senator from New \nJersey in after the Senator from Pennsylvania? Why don't we set up the \nnext three Senators on this side to be Senator Reed, Senator Schumer, \nand then Senator Specter, and then Senator Menendez.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I could be added following the last \nDemocratic speaker who was mentioned, I would appreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are engaged in a debate that will be \ncritical to the future of this country. We have now for many years been \nengaged in Iraq. We have seen substantial casualties of our military \nmen and women, not only those who have given the ultimate sacrifice but \nthose who have been seriously wounded. We have seen our position in the \nworld, particularly in that region, seriously eroded. We have a \nsituation where, unwittingly perhaps but actually, Iran has become a \nmore powerful agent in that area of the world because of the policy of \nthis administration. I think we have the opportunity at this juncture \nto change this flawed strategy; also, to improve the operational skill \nof this administration because not only was the strategy flawed, but \nthe implementation was absolutely horrid.\n  The Iraq Study Group made many useful suggestions, and key to those \nsuggestions was to begin a phased redeployment of our forces. This was \nsimilar to language Senator Levin and I proposed last June, which \ntalked about a phased redeployment of our combat forces, leaving \nresidual missions for other forces, and also talked about an ambitious \ndiplomatic effort to try to adjust politically the various forces and \nthe various tensions in the country of Iraq and in the region. It was \ninteresting to note that many months after the Levin-Reed proposal, the \nadministration finally participated in a regional conference last week \ninvolving both Iran and Syria and the other neighboring countries. That \nis a step forward--a timid step but, indeed, a step forward.\n  The President, however--after the Iraq Study Group recommendations \nand after our debates last year--in January, when he was able to \npresent and willing to present his new strategy, he made another \nmistake in several respects. First, the surging or escalating of forces \nis, I think at best, a temporary stopgap. The real solution to the \ndilemmas and the details that engulf Iraq are political in nature. That \nhas been vouched for by every military commander and most commentators.\n  Rather than embracing the Iraq Study Group's recommendations, he \ndistanced himself from them. Rather than talking about a phased \nredeployment, he talked about an indefinite escalation. In doing so, he \njeopardized one of the fundamental foundations of any national policy, \nand that is public support. I believe the American people were \nlistening closely, waiting for a sign that the President finally got it \nand that he was going to begin to conduct an orderly phased withdrawal \nand concentrate on the other critical missions of training Iraqi forces \nand going after terrorists who are much more important to our long-term \nsecurity. They did not hear that in his speech. It is no surprise to me \nthat their continuing lack of confidence in the administration has been \ntranslated into a lack of confidence in our prospects in Iraq.\n  I think the American people are looking for a policy they can \nsupport, one they can sustain, and one we can sustain. In my view, that \npolicy is laid out very explicitly in the proposal that we are debating \ntoday authored by Senator Harry Reid. It focuses on defining critical \nmissions so that our soldiers know precisely why they are in that \ncountry and that we can give them all the resources necessary for those \nmissions to go after terrorists who have infiltrated the country.\n  The existence of terrorists before the invasion was one of highly \nspeculative debate, and it turned out there was more speculation than \nfact. But the reality is terrorists have infiltrated Iraq in the \nintervening several years, and we have to go after them just as we did \nin Somalia, just as we are doing in Afghanistan, and just as we hope \nthe Pakistanis are doing in Pakistan. After all, that is where bin \nLaden and Zawahiri are residing, reorganizing, and contemplating \nattempts to attack us again.\n\n  That effort of preemption of terrorists has to go on, and we have to \nmaintain a presence in Iraq to do that. We also have to train the Iraqi \nsecurity forces because, frankly, they are ultimately the decisive \npoint in terms of security for Iraq. It is not American soldiers. We \ndon't have the cultural affinity, as best we try; we don't have the \nvested interests. We are trying to help, but it is not our country, it \nis their country, and to prevail, they must carry the burden of war. We \nhave to help them, we understand that. We have to continue to train \nthem. Of course, we have to protect our forces.\n  There was some discussion today about how these missions are going to \ncause our soldiers, as they go through Iraq, to say: Well, I can't go \nafter that fellow because he might be a sectarian militiaman and not a \nterrorist.\n  If those forces pose a threat to American troops in the field, they \nare fair game. That is what this resolution says. But it is made, these \nmissions are, in the context of a policy of redeployment, of getting \nour combat forces out of Iraq. We hope we can do that within a year, \nbut much depends upon what happens in other arenas: political mentoring \nand economic support. Frankly, this administration has done a dreadful \njob of that.\n  I have been to Iraq a number of times, as my colleagues have. You \narrive there and they proudly announce they are going to have \nprovisional reconstruction teams all over the country. Suddenly you \ndiscover months later that their goal of 20 was really 10, and now they \nhave just about 10 but not fully staffed and not fully functional.\n  They are still trying to get it right. Again, any military officer \nwill tell you that military forces in a counterinsurgency buys time. \nThe decisive action is by political and economic progress, to give the \ncitizens, the people of Iraq, tangible proof that their future lies \nwith a legitimate government and not those who seek to undermine.\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\nYet, repeatedly, when you strip away the President's proposal, it is \njust more troops, without the real enablers, the real decisive factors \nof economic, political, reconstruction and reconciliation.\n  So, again, I think this is exactly the right course to pursue. It is \na course that we must pursue. I have a great deal more to say about \nthis issue. I notice my colleague from New York has arrived. Under the \narrangement worked out with Senator Levin, I will yield the floor so he \nmay speak in the order established. There is much more to be said, and \nI hope I have the opportunity to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleagues from Rhode \nIsland and Michigan for yielding me some time. I appreciate it. Their \nexpertise in this area has been invaluable not only to the Senate but \nto all Americans. I could not think of two people who have shown light \nmore on this issue than the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Where are we now, Mr. President? Somehow--and there will be many \ndebates as to how--what we are doing in Iraq has largely evolved into \nfighting a civil war, into patrolling a civil war, into policing a \ncivil war, and, yes, into fighting it at times. The age-old enmity \nbetween the Sunnis and Shiites, of course, has exploded. Once Saddam \nHussein was gone, it was perhaps inevitable that it would occur, \nparticularly without any real authority in large parts of the country.\n  Most of what our soldiers are doing, and most of those who come back \nfrom making the ultimate sacrifice, dying or making a large sacrifice \nby being wounded, are doing is not fighting terrorism but, rather, \npolicing, patrolling, and even fighting in a civil war. That is not \nwhat the American people bargained for. That is not what President Bush \nstated when we began going into Iraq. In fact, he has never stated \nthat.\n  Now they say we need to bring order to allow their government to \nwork, but that is a fallacious argument for two reasons. First, we may \nbring temporary order to Iraq but, make no mistake about it--you don't \nhave to be a Ph.D. in middle eastern studies to realize that the minute \nour troops leave, whether it is 3 months or 3 years, the fighting \nbetween the Sunnis and the Shiites will continue. We will have lost \nlives, and men and women will have lost limbs, but not much will have \nchanged--even in the medium term.\n  Second, the absurdity of what we are doing is shown by this: We are \nsending more troops to create a temporary peace to bolster a government \nthat we don't trust, like, or believe in. Prime Minister Maliki is \nalmost universally regarded poorly, not just at this end of \nPennsylvania Avenue but at the other end as well. Their government \nseems incompetent. The government seems unable to accomplish the most \nbasic things. The government, of course, created a terrible drama, \nalmost, when they could not complete the execution of Saddam Hussein in \na way that would have conformed to how it should have been done. So \ntheir government is incompetent. It is also controlled, in large part, \nby someone we do not like, Sadr. The Sadr party is the Prime Minister's \nbase. He cannot do anything, even should he want to, in terms of \nactually bringing peace and creating a government that is friendly to \nAmerica.\n  So here we are with this escalation, a surge to bolster a government \nwe don't like or trust. Here we are, instead of fighting terrorism, \npolicing a civil war. The American people know that. We have seen all \nof the data and all of the polls. The overwhelming majority does not \nsupport the President in Iraq. So we need a change in strategy. \nSubstance dictates it, people see it, and our job in the Senate is to \ndo that. That is what we are attempting to do in this debate.\n  The proposal that most of us on this side of the aisle are behind is \na very simple one. We require the President to change strategy. Instead \nof policing a civil war, fighting a civil war, our troops should have \nthe far more limited mission of protecting us in America from \nterrorism. That means that if al-Qaida sets up a base anywhere in Iraq, \nwe should take it out--do what it takes to take it out. But it doesn't \nmean that our soldiers should be patrolling the streets of Baghdad \nsimply because the Sunnis and Shiites are fighting with each other. \nThat will require a change in mission and will require fewer troops, \nand those troops need not be in harm's way. It makes eminent sense.\n  We set a deadline of a little more than a year from now, during which \ntime the mission will have changed. The number of troops will be \ngreatly reduced. We don't set a number. That is up to the President. It \nis our job in the Congress to debate missions and the broad context of \nforeign policy and then, should we pass a law, have the President carry \nout the details.\n  Now, some on the other side have said that any debate means you are \nnot supporting the troops. Well, I have talked to the troops--to \ngenerals and enlisted men and women. They want debate, Mr. President. \nThe more demagogic the other side is, saying if there is a debate, you \nare not supporting the troops--frankly, that is not the American way. \nOf course, we debate issues. In fact, their view is that basically the \nonly way to support the troops is to rubberstamp the President's \npolicy. We don't agree with that. We are supporting the troops. We are \nsupporting the troops when they are in the field by trying to get them \nthe body armor and humvees and blood-clotting bandages they have not \nhad. We are supporting them when they come home by trying to fully fund \nthe Veterans' Administration. Don't talk to us about supporting the \ntroops. We are walking the walk and putting our money where our mouth \nis.\n\n  So, sadly, our colleagues on the other side, instead of joining us in \nthis debate, often seek to thwart it, as they did last time. I hope \nthey will not do that again because America is demanding debate. We \nhope they will come together with us, as we did last year in the Levin-\nReid resolution, in a bipartisan change of mission. That is what the \npeople are asking for.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side are in an uncomfortable \nposition. They are torn between the policy of our President, their \nparty leader, and what their constituencies want. By the way, the \nconstituencies across America want this. I have seen the polling data. \nIt is not just in places such as Rhode Island, New York, and \nPennsylvania where the people are asking for a real change in strategy; \nit is also in places such as Kentucky, North Carolina, and Mississippi. \nIt is throughout America. They are not doing it because they don't \nsupport the troops or for some nefarious reason. They are doing it for \na reason that is as plain as the noses on our faces: what we are doing \nnow is not working--whether it be with 140,000 or 150,000, 160,000, or \n200,000 troops.\n  So we are here in the hallowed tradition of our Constitution to \ndebate what we are doing in foreign policy and war policy and whether \nit is right. We will stand together on this side of the aisle and state \nthat, as patriots who support our troops, we desperately need a change \nin strategy and in mission. We will bring up this issue on the floor of \nthe Senate again and again and again, until our colleagues on the other \nside join us, until our colleagues on the other side understand that \nthe wishes of their constituencies are for a change in strategy, until \nour colleagues on the other side have the courage to tell the President \nthat on this issue he simply is wrong. That is part of the hallowed \ntradition of this country. We are proud to do what we are doing.\n  Mr. President, I hope and pray that our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle will allow this debate to go forward, that they will put \nforward their ideas, and we will put forward ours. Debate it we will \nand debate it we must. I hope and pray that debate starts to yield the \nchange in strategy that our troops in Iraq, our people in America, the \nIraqi people, and the people of the world so desperately need.\n  With that, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senate has now commenced the debate \non an issue of great importance, really of historic importance, which \nchallenges us on the issue of what course of action we should take in \nIraq, in a very complex factual situation, and challenges us on what \nour authority is under the Constitution, contrasted\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\nwith the President's authority as Commander in Chief.\n  On the factual issue, when we look at the resolution, which calls for \nthe phased redeployment of the U.S. forces from Iraq not later than 120 \ndays after enactment of this joint resolution, with the goal of \ndeploying by March 31, 2008, all U.S. combat forces, except for three \npurposes: one, to protect the U.S. and coalition personnel and \ninfrastructure; second, training and equipping Iraqi forces; third, \nconducting targeted counterterrorism operations.\n  We are setting a deadline and our opponents simply have to wait us \nout. They know if they can hold on until March 31, 2008, a little more \nthan a year from now, we will be leaving, except for those stated \nlimited purposes. That is not a very desirable course of conduct.\n  It is equally undesirable, however, to view the current situation in \nIraq, which looks like an endless tunnel--a tunnel without a light at \nthe end. You cannot see the end of the tunnel and, certainly, there is \nno light at the end of the tunnel in terms of what we can do.\n  Last month, the House of Representatives passed a nonbinding \nresolution expressing displeasure, objecting to the President's course \nof action in Iraq. Last November, in the election, the American people \nspoke in a resounding manner, in a way that could only rationally be \ninterpreted as rejecting the conduct of the war in Iraq. We are faced \nwith very considerable discomfort in this body. How it will resolve \nitself remains to be seen. I think it is very important that we debate \nthis matter, that we exchange our views, that we stimulate discussions \nthat will go beyond this Chamber and will resound throughout the \ncountry, resound throughout the editorial pages and the television and \nradio talk shows, and by our colleagues in the corridors and in the \ncloakroom so that we can try to work our way through an extraordinarily \ndifficult situation where, as I see it, there is no good answer between \nthe two intractable alternatives to set a timetable where our opponents \nsimply have to wait us out or to keep proceeding down a tunnel which, \nat least at this juncture, appears to be endless and has no light. We \ndon't know where the end is, let alone to have a light at the end of \nthe tunnel.\n\n  What I am trying to do at the moment is to get from the \nadministration, from the Department of Defense, and the Department of \nState an evaluation of what has happened since General Petraeus briefed \nus on what he intended to do before he returned to Iraq several weeks \nago. There have been some preliminary reports that the strategy \nemployed by General Petraeus is producing results. There have been some \ncommentaries.\n  The Washington Post last Sunday in an op-ed suggested things are \nimproving. Reports by NBC's Brian Williams suggest that matters are \nimproving, not sufficiently definitive to come to any conclusion, but \nif there was a sign on the military side that we could see improvement \nand see a path to victory, that would have a material bearing on what \nthis body would do or at least on the thinking of this Senator.\n  The resolution calls for a comprehensive strategy, and it defines it \nas ``diplomatic, political, and economic strategy that includes \nsustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors and the international \ncommunity for the purpose of working collectively to bring stability to \nIraq.''\n  I was pleased to hear the testimony of Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice, when she appeared before the Appropriations Committee on which I \nsit on February 27, 2007, announcing the initiative of an international \nconference to be held in Baghdad and announcing for the first time that \nthere would be negotiations by the United States in a conference which \nincluded Iran and Syria, which I think is a very important and sensible \nchange in the foreign policy of the United States.\n  We saw the results in North Korea where we faced a very difficult \nsituation with North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and the various \ntests they had undertaken. We saw the multilateral discussions and \nthen, more importantly, saw bilateral talks between the United States \nand North Korea, which Secretary of State Rice obtained the authority \nof the President to engage in those direct bilateral talks so when she \nwas traveling overseas, she did not go through the normal vetting and \nanalytical processes in Washington which might well have stopped that \ndirect bilateral discussion. It did occur, and it appears to have been \ninstrumental in working out what may well be a diplomatic answer. It \nappears that way at the present time, although no one can ever be sure \nin dealing with North Korea.\n  I would like to have an up-to-date evaluation--and I am seeking one--\nfrom the Department of State as to what is happening with those \nnegotiations. Candidly, it is pretty hard when we have one of our \nsessions in room 407 upstairs, which is the secret room where we are \nbriefed. We very seldom get much information there. I think it would be \nvery useful if we could find information to bring us up to date as to \nwhat progress, if any, the administration is making. I know, to repeat, \nit would be very influential on my thinking as to what course I will \ntake when the roll is called on these resolutions.\n  Beyond the evaluation of the factual situation, there are very \ncomplex legal questions involved in what is the authority of Congress. \nThe resolution does not call upon the congressional constitutional \nauthority on appropriations or the so-called power of the purse. We \nknow there is authority in the Congress to cut off funding. I think \nthere is unanimous agreement that we should not even broach the issue \ncutting off funding if in any way it would jeopardize the troops who \nare serving in Iraq.\n  The President's powers as Commander in Chief have been the subject of \njudicial interpretation. In the case of Fleming v. Page--it goes back a \nlong way to 1850--but the Supreme Court said:\n\n       As commander-in-chief, he is authorized to direct the \n     movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at \n     his command, and to employ them in the manner he may deem \n     most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy.\n\n  On the face of that statement by the Nation's highest Court, there is \na real question as to whether Congress has the constitutional authority \nto order the ``phased redeployment of the United States forces from \nIraq.''\n  The Supreme Court dealt with the issue on the power of the purse in \nthe case of United States v. Lovett in 1946, holding that Congress \ncannot use its appropriations power indirectly to accomplish an \nunconstitutional objective.\n  So that brings into play squarely what is the constitutional \nauthority of the President as Commander in Chief.\n  I think it is most unwise for Congress to even broach the subject of \nmicromanagement of the war. When Congressman Murtha suggested some time \nago that funding be conditioned on a whole series of requirements, it \nbore all the earmarks of micromanagement of the war.\n  The resolution at hand calling for a redeployment may well cross that \nline of micromanagement of the war. It is unclear. But there remains \nthe very deep concern in the country, expressed by the electorate last \nNovember, expressed by citizens across the country that reflected in \nthe resolution passed by the House of Representatives last month \nobjecting to the administration's conduct of the war and considerable \nsentiment in this body so that we are searching for a way to approach \nthis issue rationally.\n  We have to face up to the consequence that if we acknowledge defeat \nin Iraq, there are very disastrous consequences which will flow from \nthat, disastrous consequences in the region, the issue of whether the \nterrorists will come at least in part from the Mideast to threaten us \non the homeland. But, at the same time, we have to recognize that when \nthe President laid down two markers in his State of the Union speech \nearlier this year, that the Iraqis accomplish two objectives: One, to \nstabilize Baghdad, and, two, to end sectarian violence. The Iraqis have \nnot shown either the capacity or the will to accomplish those two \nprerequisites which the President set down as minimal markers.\n  My thinking is we ought to deliberate on this subject. We ought to \nhear each other out, and we ought to seek updated information from the \nadministration to see whether there are any signs, in the several weeks \nsince General Petraeus has undertaken the new\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\nstrategy, whether there are any indications of what may lie ahead on \nthe negotiations, now that there have been contacts by the United \nStates with Iranian officials and presumably also with Syrian \nofficials.\n  I would like to see this Chamber filled with Senators when we \nundertake this debate. I recollect the debate we had back in 1991, \nwhich was classified as historic, when we decided to pass a resolution \nauthorizing the use of force. I know we are all very busy. I am about \nto go to a hearing of a subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services, \nand Education. This issue warrants the close attention of the Senate. \nWe have been called the world's greatest deliberative body, and this \nissue now will give us a chance to see if we are entitled to that lofty \ntitle.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I sent to the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, outlining underlying legal issues \nin the debate we are now undertaking, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   U.S. Senate\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 20, 2007.\n     Chairman Patrick Leahy,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: I write to ask you to hold additional hearings \n     into the constitutional authority of the Congress to place \n     restrictions on the President's power as Commander-in-Chief \n     to prosecute the war in Iraq. Since there is considerable \n     public discussion on the scope of Congress's constitutional \n     authority to limit the President's conduct in the war in \n     Iraq, and the Attorney General has not responded to our joint \n     letter of January 30, asking for the Administration's legal \n     authority for the President's actions in Iraq, I write to \n     request early additional Judiciary Committee hearings on \n     these issues. Time is of the essence because these matters \n     are coming to a head and there may soon be floor action on \n     legislation, especially in the House.\n       As you will note, this letter goes into some detail on \n     legislative precedents, judicial decisions and commentaries \n     by constitutional experts to put into public discourse some \n     background on these complex matters in advance of the \n     purposed hearings. Many people have called upon the Congress \n     to set time tables for bringing the troops home or to cut \n     funding for the anned forces as a means of preventing the \n     President from deploying an additional 21,500 troops in Iraq. \n     Last Friday the House of Representatives recently adopted a \n     non-binding resolution indicating that body's disapproval of \n     the President's military strategy in Iraq. Others have \n     pressed for more direct action, proposing legislation to \n     reduce military appropriations until the President agrees to \n     change course.\n       Representative John Murtha outlined a plan to halt the so-\n     called surge by proposing to insert conditions in the \n     forthcoming supplemental appropriations bill to prevent the \n     President from (1) deploying troops, until they have meet \n     certain readiness standards; (2) redeploying troops, until \n     they have been at home for at least one year; and (3) \n     extending tours beyond one year. (Movecongress.org, Feb. 15, \n     2007, http://www.movecongress.org/content/index.php). While \n     these proposals may differ in substance, they represent \n     Congressional proposals for the President to change course.\n       A difficulty the Congress faces is understanding precisely \n     the contours of our power to limit the President's \n     constitutional authority as Commander-in-Chief. As we know, \n     the Congress' war powers are articulated in Article I, 10-16. \n     Chief among those powers is the Congress' exclusive authority \n     to declare war. James Madison wrote: ``In no part of the \n     constitution more wisdom to be found, than in the clause \n     which confides the question of war or peace to the \n     legislature, and not to the executive department.'' \n     Alexander Hamilton & James Madison, Letters of Pacificus \n     and Helvidius on the Proclamation of Neutrality of 1793, \n     at 89 (James Madison) (Washington, D.C., J. Gideon & G.S. \n     Gideon 1845). Originally, the Constitution's Framers \n     proposed that Congress enjoy the power to ``make'' war. \n     The word ``make'' was changed to ``declare,'' however, \n     because it was argued that the term ``make'' might be \n     understood to mean ``conduct,'' and a war's conduct was \n     determined to be an exclusively executive function. While \n     the declaration and funding of war was consigned to the \n     Congress, the actual conduct of the war on the battlefield \n     was left to the President, acting as Commander-in-Chief.\n       The Congress is not necessarily sidelined once a war \n     begins, however. The Congress can also exercise control over \n     military ventures through its power of the purse, captured in \n     Article I, Sec. 8, cl. 1 and Article I, Sec. 9, cl. 7, and in \n     its exercise of the Necessary and Proper clause. The \n     Constitutional provisions outlining Congress' and the \n     President's war powers reflect a structural system of checks \n     and balances.\n       Nevertheless, there is considerable division over the \n     extent the Congress can exercise control over the President's \n     war powers authority. Some prominent academics argue that \n     there are a number of war powers conferred on Congress that \n     allow ongoing regulatory authority with respect to the \n     conduct of war. This view advocates that Congress' authority \n     to control military policy is plenary, extending to the \n     deployment of troops, the battlefields to choose, and the \n     training and regulation of soldiers.\n       Other commentators, however, believe that the only \n     congressional control over wartime policy is the \n     appropriations power and that it remains constitutional to \n     use the appropriations power to limit the breadth and scope \n     of military deployment so long as such limitation does not \n     impede constitutional presidential war powers. Any effort to \n     tell the President how many troops to send to Iraq or how to \n     fight the war, they would argue, amounts to an \n     unconstitutional usurpation of the President's authority.\n       The question remains as to where the President's authority \n     to conduct an already engaged war ends, and Congress' \n     supervisory authority begins. It is asserted that the Framers \n     intended, by vesting the Commander-in-Chief power in the \n     President, to give him the sole authority to conduct war. \n     Conducting war arguably includes the power to direct the \n     movement of troops and to employ them as he determines \n     necessary to conduct war. Chief Justice Taney in Fleming v. \n     Page stated ``As commander-in-chief, he is authorized to \n     direct the movements of the naval and military forces placed \n     by law at his command, and to employ them in the manner he \n     may deem most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the \n     enemy.'' (50 U.S. 603, (1850)). I question whether, absent \n     use of the appropriations power, the only choice for the \n     Congress is a total repeal of the authorization to use \n     military force in Iraq.\n       If Congress acts to repeal the authorization to use force \n     in Iraq, the question may arise whether the President may \n     veto that action requiring a two-thirds override. It may be \n     relevant that the President does not have to approve a \n     Congressional Declaration of war.\n       History demonstrates that the Congress has previously acted \n     to restrain the President through threats to cut funding or \n     proposed budgetary requirements. In Federalist No. 58, James \n     Madison explained that the power of the purse represents the \n     ``most complete and effectual weapon with which any \n     constitution can arm the immediate representative of the \n     people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.'' \n     Madison explained that the Congress would ``hold the purse--\n     that powerful instrument by which we behold, in the history \n     of the British Constitution, an infant and humble \n     representation of the people gradually enlarging the sphere \n     of its activities and importance, and finally reducing, as \n     far as it seems to have wished, all the overgrown \n     prerogatives of the other branches of government.''\n       As early as Teddy Roosevelt's administration, ``Congress \n     conditioned appropriations on a minimum of eight percent of \n     detachments aboard naval vessels being marines.'' Charles \n     Tiefer, Can Appropriation Riders Speed Our Exit From Iraq?, \n     42 Stan. J. Int'l L. 291, 302 (2006). This represents a \n     specific action by the Congress to control a quite specific \n     aspect of warfare; namely, the composition of the troop on a \n     naval vessel.\n       Perhaps the most compelling precedent to illustrate \n     Congress' authority to place legislative conditions and \n     withdraw funds to effectuate the end of a war are the actions \n     taken by the Congress during the later half of the Vietnam \n     War. The Congress successfully exercised its spending power \n     to restrict action in Vietnam on at least three separate \n     other occasions. The Special Foreign Assistance Act of 1971, \n     P.L. 91-652, prohibited the use of funds authorized or \n     appropriated by it or any other Act ``to finance the \n     introduction of United States ground combat troops into \n     Cambodia or to provide U.S. advisors to or for Cambodian \n     military forces in Cambodia.'' The second Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1973, P.L. 93-50 cut off \n     funding for combat activities in Indochina after August 15, \n     1973. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution for fiscal \n     year 1974, P.L. 93-52, specifically disallowed the use of \n     appropriated funds to finance U.S. combat activities in or \n     from North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia.\n       Finally, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974 all but \n     eliminated the U.S. personnel presence at the close of the \n     Vietnam War. Section 38(f)(1) set a ceiling for the total \n     number of U.S. personnel in Vietnam, ordering a drop to 4,000 \n     within six months and 3,000 within a year. Although \n     President Ford expressed his reservations in a December \n     30, 1974 signing statement, he nevertheless signed the Act \n     into law.\n       More recently, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act \n     for fiscal year 1994, P.L. 103-139, approved the use of U.S. \n     troops to protect U.N. units in Somalia, but specifically cut \n     off funding after March 31, 1994. Similarly, the Defense \n     Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1995, P.L. 103-335, \n     provided that, with a narrow exception ``None of the funds \n     appropriated by this Act may be used for the continuous \n     presence in Somalia. . . after September 30, 1994.''\n       Nevertheless, I understand that congressional power of the \n     purse is not unlimited and the Congress cannot exercise its \n     authority in contravention of the Constitution. What remains \n     unclear, however, is what types of conditions the Congress \n     may impose are unconstitutional. In United States v. Lovett, \n     328 U.S. 303 (1946), for example, the Supreme Court held that \n     Congress cannot\n\n[[Page S3098]]\n\n     use its appropriations power indirectly to accomplish an \n     unconstitutional objective. It remains unclear as to how far \n     Congress can go in controlling the President through its \n     exercise of the power of purse. One scholar stated during her \n     testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that \n     ``[r]eliance on the power of the purse alone as a check on \n     executive war power. . . can be an overly blunt and sometimes \n     ineffective tool for expressing the will of Congress. \n     Limiting or cutting off funds after forces have already been \n     committed is problematic because it undercuts both troops in \n     the field and America's credibility with her \n     allies.''(Testimony by Ms. Jane Stromseth, Professor of Law, \n     Georgetown University, before the Senate Judiciary \n     Subcommittee on Constitutional, Federalism, and Property, \n     titled ``Application of War Powers Act to War on Terrorism'', \n     April 17, 2002).\n       As a consequence, Congress may turn to other means to \n     regulate the conduct of war. Article I, Section 8 of the \n     Constitution grants Congress the authority to raise and to \n     regulate armies and navies. Although this has traditionally \n     been understood as the power to create rules governing the \n     armed forces, Alexander Hamilton suggests in Federalist 69 \n     that the Congress may possess the authority to dispatch those \n     forces. Essentially, the President is ``raising'' an \n     additional twenty thousand troops to go to Iraq. Arguably, \n     Congress could pass a law, pursuant to its authority to raise \n     and to regulate the services, that would forbid the President \n     from ``raising'' those forces and dispatching them overseas.\n       For example, at the end of the 18th Century, Congress \n     passed a number of statutes authorizing limited military \n     engagement with France in the so-called ``Quasi War.'' See \n     Louis Fisher, Presidential War Power 24 (2d ed. 2004). In \n     1798, the Congress authorized the President ``to instruct and \n     direct the commanders of the armed vessels belonging to the \n     United States'' to seize French vessels that were disrupting \n     United States commerce. 1 Stat. 561 (May 28, 1798). The \n     Congress limited both the kind of force the President could \n     use (the navy only) and the areas where he could use it (our \n     coastal waters, at first, and then the high seas).'' The \n     Constitution Project, Deciding to Use Force Abroad: War \n     Powers in a System of Checks and Balances 15 (2005). In fact, \n     the Supreme Court found that Congress had only authorized \n     seizure of vessels traveling to French ports, not from French \n     ports. Little v. Barreme, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 170, 179 (1804).\n       Similarly, during the reconstruction following the Civil \n     War, Congress attached a rider on an 1867 military \n     appropriations bill providing that the ``orders of the \n     president and secretary of war to the army should only be \n     given through the general of the army (Gen. Grant); [and] \n     that the latter should not be relieved, removed or \n     transferred from Washington without the previous approval of \n     the senate.'' Alexander Johnston, Riders (in U.S. History), \n     in III Cyclopedia of Political Science, Political Economy, \n     and of the Political History of the United States By the Best \n     American and European Authors, 147.7 (John J. Lalor ed., \n     1899), available at http://oll.libertyfund.org/ToC/0216-\n03.php. And, in 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus \n     Act, ch. 263, Sec. 15, 20 Stat 145, 152 (codified at 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1385), which restricted the President's ability \n     to use the military for police actions in the United States \n     by imposing criminal penalties on the troops themselves.\n       Even with respect to the present conflict, the Congress \n     placed restrictions on the President's use of force in Iraq, \n     requiring him to certify that diplomatic means are \n     insufficient and that the use of force will not impede the \n     war on terrorism, and limiting the use of force ``to. . . (1) \n     defend the national security of the United States against the \n     continuing threat posed by Iraq; and (2) enforce all relevant \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.'' \n     Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, Pub. L. \n     107-243, Sec. 3(a), 116 Stat. 1498 (Oct. 16, 2002).\n       The debate over the Congress' wartime authority runs deep. \n     Walter Dellinger, former Assistant Attorney General for the \n     Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel offered a legal \n     opinion to the President explaining: ``[t]rue, Congress has \n     the power to lay down general rules creating and regulating \n     ``the framework of the Military Establishment; but such \n     framework rules may not unduly constrain or inhibit the \n     President's authority to make and to implement the decisions \n     that he deems necessary or advisable for the successful \n     conduct of military missions in the field, including the \n     choice of particular persons to perform specific command \n     functions in those missions.'' (Citations omitted).\n       The memorandum was written in response to questions on \n     whether Congress could bar President Clinton from putting \n     American forces under foreign (specifically the \n     United Nations) command and ban appropriated funds for \n     such purposes. Dellinger determined that this was an \n     infringement on the Commander-in-Chief clause. He wrote, \n     ``The proposed [House] amendment unconstitutionally \n     constrains the President's exercise of his constitutional \n     authority as Commander-in-Chief. Further, it undermines \n     his constitutional role as the United States' \n     representative in foreign relations. While `[t]he \n     constitutional power of Congress to raise and support \n     armies and to make all laws necessary and proper to that \n     end is broad and sweeping,'' Congress may not deploy that \n     power so as to exercise functions constitutionally \n     committed to the Executive alone, for that would ``pose a \n     `danger of congressional usurpation of Executive Branch \n     functions.' ''\n       Nor may Congress legislate in a manner that `` \n     `impermissibly undermine[s]' the powers of the Executive \n     Branch, or `disrupts the proper balance between the \n     coordinate branches [by] prevent[ing] the Executive Branch \n     from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.'. \n     Even though there are areas in which both Congress and the \n     President have a constitutional voice, and in which Congress, \n     therefore, may rely on its own constitutional authority to \n     seek to guide and constrain presidential choices, it may not \n     impose constraints in the areas that the Constitution commits \n     exclusively to the President.'' (Citations omitted).\n       More recently, Professor Dellinger joined a letter signed \n     by 23 law professors to the Congress distinguishing the \n     arguments made in his earlier memorandum with his position \n     today that Congress is well within its constitutional powers \n     to limit the scope and duration of the war in Iraq. He wrote: \n     ``Congress may by legislation determine the objective for \n     which military force may be used, define the geographic scope \n     of the military conflict and determine whether to end the \n     authorization to use military force . . . I believe that the \n     President has extensive inherent powers to protect and defend \n     the United States. In the absence of any congressional \n     legislation on point, I would often presume that the \n     President can act of his own authority and pursuant to his \n     own judgment in matters of national security. Once Congress \n     has acted, however, the issue is fundamentally different. The \n     question then becomes whether the Act of Congress is itself \n     unconstitutional.''\n       The debate over the Iraq war is the most important issue \n     confronting the American people today. The Congress cannot be \n     pushed to the sidelines as the President commits more troops \n     and ever increasing funds to an engagement that commands \n     uncertain support. We have an obligation to determine how, \n     within appropriate constitutional constraints, we may engage \n     the President and ensure that the will of the American people \n     regarding this conflict is heard. To this end, it would be in \n     the public interest for the Judiciary Committee to conduct a \n     series of hearings to determine the constitutional authority \n     of the Congress to limit conduct of the war.\n       At the same time, we must be unwavering in our support of \n     the men and women in the field who are so honorably seeking \n     to carry the torch of freedom throughout the world. Even as \n     some may doubt the efficacy of the President's conduct of the \n     war, no one doubts the professionalism, integrity, and \n     dedication of our troops in the field.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to support the resolution \non which I hope we will have an opportunity to vote. As we hear this \ndebate, it is a good debate that should move forward. I hope we will \nactually get to vote on the resolution.\n  I am amazed at some of our colleagues who would suggest that this \ndebate shouldn't even take place. The Senate, the greatest marketplace \nof ideas, the clash of ideas, should be the place in which one of the \nmost momentous issues facing the Nation should have the opportunity for \nthose 100 Senators, elected by their constituencies across the country, \nto come and not only debate but cast a vote so that the American people \nknow which way the Senate intends to lead on this question of changing \nthe course in Iraq.\n  What we seek to do is put forward a new direction and a clear plan \nfor Iraq--a clear plan that is very different than the President's \ncurrent plans to escalate the war in Iraq. We have a plan that, if \neffectuated, would end the war in Iraq.\n  Our plan is relatively straightforward and says: One, our troops \nshould leave Iraq by March 31, 2008, with a small number remaining to \nhelp with security and counterterrorism.\n  Those who say we shouldn't have any date because the enemy will \noutwait us, we see that Sadr's militias have already retracted, that \nthey are already willing to spend the time to wait until it is \npropitious to strike.\n  Two, we should start the process of leaving within 120 days.\n  Three, our troops' mission should immediately change to the priority \nof training--priority of training--Iraqi security forces, focusing on \ncounterterrorism.\n  I heard some of our colleagues talk about that element of al-Qaida in \nAnbar Province. Well, that is 5,000 or so. We have roughly 140,000 \ntroops, and 140,000 U.S. troops could certainly take\n\n[[Page S3099]]\n\ncare of 5,000 elements of al-Qaida in Iraq and protecting U.S. \npersonnel in Iraq. Or we should take all these steps as part of a \ncomprehensive diplomatic plan, working with Iraq's neighbors and our \nallies to bring stability to Iraq.\n\n  I support this plan. I would like to see it be much more than a goal. \nI would like to see it move more along the lines of a mandate. I \nsupport the plan because it matches the goals of the Iraq Study Group, \na bipartisan group that met unanimously, agreed upon all of its \nrecommendations, and who said that U.S. combat forces should leave Iraq \nby the end of March 2008.\n  I know some of my colleagues have mentioned comments made by \nDemocrats in previous statements. Well, I would point out that this was \na bipartisan group and it had prominent Republicans on it, such as \nformer Secretary of State James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, Ed Meese, \nSandra Day O'Connor, and Alan Simpson. They all came to the conclusion, \nas we have in this resolution, that, in fact, our goal should be to \nhave our troops out by March of 2008.\n  I support the plan because it transitions the mission for our troops, \ninstead of keeping them fighting in the middle of a civil war. I \nsupport the plan because it sets a clear timeframe for our troops to \nleave Iraq. In my mind, unlike the way in which our opponents in this \nregard pass a negative light on a timeframe, I think a timeframe is the \nmost powerful element to achieve success in Iraq. It is only by setting \na clear timeframe for our troops to leave that Iraqis will have to take \nthe responsibility for security in their country and to work out their \npolitical power struggles.\n  Some of these hearings that I have been part of in the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, you hear how so much of the struggle \namong Iraqis is about political power. Is it the mission of the U.S. \ntroops, the sons and daughters of America, to sit in the crossfire as \npeople are pursuing political power? I think not.\n  Unless we have the Iraqis understand this is not an open-ended \ncommitment, they will never make the hard choices, compromises, and \nnegotiations necessary for a government of national unity, if that is \npossible. They will never get there so long as they believe we will \nshed the blood and our national treasure in an unlimited fashion. It is \nonly by setting a clear timeframe for our troops to leave that Iraq's \nneighbors will start to take responsibility for ending the chaos inside \nof Iraq.\n  Right now, that violence hasn't reached the tipping point for them to \nget Iraq's neighbors involved. Ultimately, it is not in their national \nsecurity interest to have the conflict spill across their borders and \nhave Iraq disintegrate, but they do not yet feel the pressure to do \nthis. By setting a date certain to leave, we create a new incentive for \nIraq's neighbors to help quell the violence.\n  It is only by setting a clear timeframe for our troops to leave that \nthe international community will take its responsible and necessary \nrole in Iraq. Right now, the international community sees this as \nAmerica's war. Once we make it clear we will not be there permanently \nor indefinitely, they, too, will have an incentive in getting involved \nto help preserve security in a region that is incredibly important to \nthem, much closer to Europe than the United States. By setting a clear \ntimeframe for our troops to leave, we actually motivate Iraq's \nneighbors and the international community to take the steps necessary \nto stabilize Iraq.\n  Let me be clear, for my friends who are saying we shouldn't vote for \nthis resolution. They say we shouldn't try to micromanage the war. No \none is trying to micromanage a war. There is a constitutional \nresponsibility by Members of the Senate to act as a legislative body. I \nsay the era of blank checks, both in lives and national treasure, is \nover. They say don't micromanage the war. Well, you have had a blank \ncheck under this administration. You have rubberstamped everything they \nhave wanted, with virtually no oversight, until this new Congress \nstarted. That is not the responsible exercise of the Senate. They say \nslow bleed. How about the endless bleeding going on now?\n  Let me take a moment to talk about the President's plan to escalate \nthe war and stay there without any timeframes that bind. First, let's \nbe frank. I simply don't believe the recent escalation of troops in \nIraq is a temporary surge. I believe it is a long-term escalation. Even \nGeneral Petraeus has said we are in it for the long haul, and that, to \nme, is undefined.\n  I wish this administration would be honest with the American people \nand the Congress about the total cost of the escalation and the total \nnumber of troops needed for the escalation. I sit as a member of the \nBudget Committee, and we had the Deputy Secretary of the Department of \nDefense, Mr. England, testifying in a hearing. I said to him: If the \nchairman would put you under oath, would you say that the $5.6 billion \nthat you want in addition for the escalation of the war would be the \ntotal amount; the total cost? He told me: Yes, even if I was under oath \nit would be roughly that amount. Of course, depending on the needs of \nthe commanders. And then that weekend--that weekend, after the \nhearing--the administration said they needed another $2 billion. They \nneeded $2 billion more over a weekend? That is not a small amount of \nmoney that he didn't know about. We are also told the administration \nwill need more troops, and there may be additional billions added to \nthe supplemental. Each time we ask, we get a different answer. I, for \none, would like a clear and honest answer for the total number of \ntroops and the total cost of the troop escalation.\n\n  Staying indefinitely in Iraq isn't in the national interest or the \nnational security interest of the United States. Our troops are caught \nin the middle of a civil war they can't solve. Adding more troops will \nonly put them more directly in the middle of an Iraqi fight. Keeping \nour troops there or adding more troops is trying to solve a political \nproblem with a military solution.\n  I have heard General Pace and others in the past say: You know, we \nhave to get the Iraqis to love their children more than they hate their \nneighbors. That is a powerful truism. We have to get the Iraqis to love \ntheir children more than they hate their neighbors. That, however, \ncannot be accomplished by military might. That is accomplished by \nreconciliation measures. That is accomplished by confidence- building \nmeasures. That is accomplished by revenue sharing. That is accomplished \nby power sharing. It cannot be accomplished at the point of a gun. It \ncannot be accomplished at the point of a gun.\n  Staying there would only continue to empower and embolden Iran, a \ncountry that has turned out to be, by many experts who have testified \nbefore the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, one of the biggest \nwinners in our war with Iraq. Staying in Iraq actually keeps the Iraqis \nfrom making the hard choices, compromises, and negotiations necessary \nto achieve a government of national unity.\n  Frankly, what we hear from the other side doesn't make sense to me. \nThey talk about victory. What is the definition of victory? Is it when \nthe President landed on the aircraft carrier, fully decked out, and \nsaid, ``Mission accomplished''? Is it the many times we have heard the \nadministration say, victory is right around the corner? How many lives, \nhow much national treasure, what victory are we talking about? They \ntalk about benchmarks for the Iraqis, but they set no consequences. \nBenchmarks without consequences are simply aspirations, nothing more.\n  Victory. How many lives must we lose? How much more money must we \nspend? How long will we be in this war under a plan without end of the \nPresident? I believe it is long past time to change the course in Iraq. \nThat is why this vote to allow us to move forward, to allow us to have \na final vote on changing the course in Iraq and laying out a plan that \ncan create the best possibility for victory in Iraq is essential, and \nthat is what I hope we will do between today and tomorrow.\n  Finally, in the time it takes me to finish my remarks this afternoon, \nthe United States will have spent over $2 million on the Iraq war \ntoday. Our Nation spends over $8 billion a month in Iraq. We spend $2 \nbillion a week in Iraq. We spend $280 million every day. And the loss \nin money pales, pales in comparison to our Nation's loss of our best \nand our brightest, with almost 3,200 lives lost in the conflict and \nover 24,000 who have been wounded.\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\n  I visited them again this past weekend in New Jersey at the Veterans \nHospital at Fort Dix. I listen to the stories they tell me, especially \nnow as they face challenges in this part of their life. I know that may \nbe another subject matter, but it is something for which we have to be \nresponsible. A grateful Nation does not just say they are grateful, a \ngrateful Nation takes care of those who serve their country, in how we \ntreat them in their health care, how we treat them in their disability, \nand how we treat their families, for those who commit the ultimate \nsacrifice on behalf of the Nation. The stories I heard from those \nsoldiers do not indicate a grateful Nation.\n  I didn't vote for the Iraq war when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. I believe that was one of the most important votes I \never cast. I don't support the President's escalation of the war. I was \nin the minority when I voted against the war in 2002, and there were \nthose who said voting against the war would be political suicide. Even \nwith that knowledge, I put my seat in the Congress on the line because \nmy conscience told me this was simply not the right thing to do.\n  In a speech about the war, the President said the following:\n\n       In speaking of the consequences of a precipitous \n     withdrawal, I mentioned that our allies would lose confidence \n     in America. Far more dangerous, we would lose confidence in \n     ourselves. Oh, the immediate reaction would be a sense of \n     relief that our men were coming home. But as we saw the \n     consequences of what we had done, inevitable remorse and \n     divisive recrimination would scar our spirit as a people.\n\n  The President added:\n\n       I recognize that some of my fellow citizens disagree with \n     the plan for peace I have chosen. Honest and patriotic \n     Americans have reached different conclusions as to how peace \n     should be achieved. I share your concern for peace. I want \n     peace as much as you do. I have chosen a plan for peace. I \n     believe it will succeed.\n\n  That plan did not succeed. The man speaking wasn't President Bush but \nPresident Richard Nixon, and the war he spoke of was not the war in \nIraq but the war in Vietnam. It is painful to hear the similarities \nbetween what was said by the President of the United States in that \nconflict and the one in which our Nation is currently ensnared. It is \neven more painful to see an administration and a President similarly \ndisconnected from the American people.\n  In soaring speeches, President Bush, the Vice President, and \nRepublican allies invoke the ``will and courage'' of the American \npeople. They say, if the American people would have the ``will and the \ncourage'' to persevere in Iraq, then we can succeed militarily. This \nadministration fails to understand this war is not just about will and \ncourage, it is also about wisdom and clarity of judgment, traits that \nhave been sorely lacking in this administration.\n  No one should doubt the will of the American people. In fact, they \nexpressed their will last November, a point that seems to elude many \nMembers of this Chamber. The American people have the will, they have \nthe nerve. What they no longer have is patience with this \nadministration and the continued failed policy in Iraq, and they are \nlosing patience with Members of this body.\n  It is time for the Senate to take a stand against the President's \nfailed plan in Iraq and to vote for a new plan, a new plan and a new \ncourse to end the war in Iraq.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the ability to move ahead, to have a \nfinal vote, and then I urge them to support the resolution that would \nlead us out of the war in Iraq, that could give us the greatest \nopportunity for victory, that would give the greatest opportunity for \nthe Iraqis to make the hard choices, compromises, negotiations for a \ngovernment of national unity, and in doing so would honor those who \nhave served their country with courage, with valor, and with \ndistinction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bill \nNelson be recognized next and Senator Graham be recognized after \nSenator Nelson, and then we return to Senator Dorgan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues in the \nSenate that I support this motion to proceed and want us to get on to \nthe resolution so we can have a full and thorough debate on this issue \nof what to do in Iraq. Without a doubt, this issue is the No. 1 issue, \nforemost in the minds of the American people. My State of Florida, \nbeing a microcosm of the entire country, is certainly reflective of \nthat. People are unsettled over the course of the war. They are \nunsettled over the fact that none of our leadership will indicate we \nare winning this war and, indeed, at the same time they recognize the \nstakes are so very high in that part of the world if we are \nunsuccessful. Therefore, because this issue naturally is at the \nforefront of Americans' minds now, and what to do about it, we need to \nget it out here and get it thoroughly discussed and debated.\n  It seems to me one of the fundamental mistakes at first of going into \nIraq was not to understand the world of Islam and the schism that has \nbeen there for 1,327 years, ever since the battle of Karbala, in 680 \nA.D., when the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed was killed in the \nbattle. That led to a division of those new worshipers who had followed \nthe Prophet Mohammed into the primary sect, Sunnis, and those who were \nrebelling, the Shiites.\n  That schism has lasted ever since. We see attempts at bringing those \ntwo groups together, but we always see--just in the demonstrations in \nthe religious holidays recently reenacting that battle, establishing \nthe Shiite sect as one that is separated from the Sunnis--they have \nbeen at it ever since. So, when you have a country that has those two \nsects, they have been at each other's throats and you find that order \nhas been maintained, in the case of Iraq, by a brutal dictator who \nfavored one sect over the other. Now that that dictator has been \noverthrown and is no more, in an attempt to bring about democracy, you \nsee the majority in that country of Iraq, the Shiites, suddenly feeling \nthey have control and maybe it is not quite so bad that they let out--\nin their mind, they say it is not so bad--to let out their frustrations \non the ones who had kept them down for years and years, their rivals, \nthe Sunnis. In the process, you get this sectarian warfare which is, by \nanybody's definition, very close to civil war.\n  How do we stabilize Iraq? For us just going in and thinking it is \ngoing to be a democracy and that the Shiites are going to play the \ndemocratic game and the Sunnis are--and not even to speak of the branch \nof the Sunnis, the Baathists, who had been the ruling party--to think \nthey are all going to play the game of democracy and majority rules, \nyou have seen, now, after going on 4 years, what has happened.\n  So what do we do? We have a suggestion by a unanimous decision by a \nbipartisan group of extremely well thought of people called the Iraq \nStudy Commission, led by former Secretary of State, former Chief of \nStaff of the White House, Jim Baker, and led by Congressman Lee \nHamilton, former Member of the House, former head of the International \nRelations Committee in the House of Representatives. Unanimously, 10 \npeople--5 Democrats and 5 Republicans--came up with a plan. How do you \nstabilize Iraq, given the conditions we find ourselves in there today? \nThey said, clearly, what you have to do is stop having the mentality of \nan American occupying force. Let the Iraqis start to work it out for \nthemselves. Realize there is probably going to have to be a separation \nof the sects until they can get them stabilized, and in the meantime do \na very aggressive, diplomatic effort throughout the region to get all \nof the countries in the region to buy into what is ultimately the \npolitical solution.\n  This Senator thinks, given all of this chaos and tumult and sectarian \nwarfare, that political solution is going to have to be some kind of \ndivision. Clearly Kurds in the north basically have their own \nautonomous government. Shiites are concentrated in the south. Sunnis \nare concentrated in the center. They made an important first step \nrecently in the establishment of a new law distributing the oil \nproduction--which is not distributed geographically throughout the \ncountry but is concentrated in the north and in the south.\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\n  So if all the elements are there to make this possible for local \ncontrol, of Kurds in the north, Sunnis in the middle, Shiites in the \nsouth, distributing the oil wealth proportionally according to the \npopulation, having a national government for the common defense, let's \nsee if that political situation will work.\n  People say you can't do that because you have all these neighborhoods \nwhere Sunnis and Shiites are all living together. But the fact is the \nseparation is already occurring because of the sectarian violence and \nthe killing that is going on. You are seeing that separation.\n  If that is a likely political outcome that has the best chance to \nstabilize Iraq, then what should be the position of the United States \nand its forces, and what should be the policy of the United States to \nbring that about? Go back to the Iraq Study Commission. People say \nthere is not a plan. There is. There is a plan. It is printed. It has \nabout 75 recommendations. What it says is the American force should \nwithdraw from the midst of that sectarian warfare, withdraw more to the \nperimeter, start lessening the forces and therefore the casualties to \nour American men and women, and use that force to train the Iraqi \nArmy--to continue to train them--to provide force protection and very \nlikely border control, since the neighbors in the region have not been \nexactly good on that--that is something we ought to be diplomatically \ninsisting on, with the neighbors in the region--and to continue to \nprosecute the war against the terrorists by going after the terrorists \nthere, particularly al-Qaida, who are trying to undermine the whole \nprocess.\n  What I have outlined, which came from the basics of the Iraq Study \nCommission Report and Recommendations, is the essence of the Reid \nresolution that is before the Senate. That is why I think we ought to \nget it out here, get it debated and, barring some unforeseen turn, it \nis this Senator's intention that he will support the Reid resolution. \nThis does not say withdraw. It says redeployment. It doesn't say get \nout of Iraq, it says get out of the cities in the middle of the \ncrossfire of a civil war. It says utilize the American forces for \ntraining, going after al-Qaida, and for the purpose of force \nprotection. That makes common sense in the overlay of a very \ncomplicated part of the world.\n  As I close, I say that the United States, back in the 1980s, thought \nby the introduction of troops we could suddenly help bring about peace \nin another very troubled part of the Middle East, the country of \nLebanon. Suddenly, it was as if scales fell from our eyes, that we saw \nit was an either/or. But it was multiple choice of all the factions \nthat were there, each with a stake in the outcome. It became very \ndifficult, particularly when the Americans became perceived to be \nsupporting one particular part of those factions. Watch out for that \nhappening today in Iraq. Let us understand something from the mistakes \nthat were made in the past in places such as Lebanon as to how you \nultimately stabilize an area and what is in the interests of the United \nStates.\n  I think part of that wisdom is what came to bear by those 10 people \nunanimously agreeing, in the Iraq Study Commission, whose work product \nboiled down is, in essence, the resolution before us here in the \nSenate.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity to share these thoughts with \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to share some \nthoughts on what is probably the most important decision the Senate \nwill make in the war on terror for decades to come, not just for the \nnext election. I have a framework in my mind about what is going on in \nIraq and how it fits into a global struggle. Quite frankly, I think it \nis unshakeable. I am not pursuadable on this issue. I will put my bias \nright up front. The outcome of what happens in Iraq is part of an \noverall global struggle called the war on terror. That is not just my \nview; it is the view of the al-Qaida members who have gone to Iraq to \ndestabilize this infant democracy.\n  It is being billed all over the Mideast as the struggle between \nmoderation and extremism. We have Sunni extremists trying to get back \nin power. They reigned during the Saddam era, and some of them do not \nwant to give up power. They want to destroy this democracy so they can \nrule again as a minority within Iraq because they had a taste of it \nbefore--that power--and they do not want to give that up. The Shia \nextremists, who are a minority of the Shia community, have a hope to \ncreate a theocracy in Iraq, not be the dominant political party in a \ndemocracy. They have a religious agenda for Iraq very similar to Iran. \nThen you have foreign fighters, including al-Qaida, who see a democracy \nin Iraq as the biggest threat to their overall agenda.\n  What we are talking about is withdrawing from a central battlefront \nin the war on terror. What would be the consequences of redeploying--\nwhatever word you would like to use--in the overall effort called the \nwar on terrorism?\n  I think it would be the worst signal you could possibly send to the \ninsurgents, to the extremists, and to al-Qaida members who are involved \nin this fight, who are watching this fight. Redeployment means \nsurrender. If you think we are in the middle of a civil war that is a \nhopeless endeavor, cut off funding and get the hell out.\n  This idea of trying to go somewhere where it is safe for Americans is \nfolly. If you are in uniform in Iraq, there is no safe place for you. \nWherever we move to, they are coming after us. We have this illusion \nthat there is a place we can go inside of Iraq or some other country in \nthe Mideast that will provide safety. I can assure you our enemy is \nintent on proving to us there is no safe place for us in the Mideast. \nWhen I say ``us,'' I mean those men and women wearing the uniform.\n  The goal of the extremists in Iraq--some are limited to the country \nof Iraq. Other extremist groups within Iraq have a wider goal. Their \ngoal is to drive American forces out of the Mideast. So there is no \nplace, in my opinion, you can redeploy within Iraq that would not be a \nsignal to the people we are fighting that we are surrendering and \nretreating.\n  This war is about not killing terrorists from an American point of \nview alone, it is about empowering moderates. The Bush administration \nhas made plenty of mistakes. The biggest mistake we made after the fall \nof Baghdad was not appreciating how much Saddam Hussein had raped his \nown country, how hard it would be to build a democracy out of ashes of \na dictatorship, doing this on the cheap, assuming the best, never \nplanning for the worst, and not having enough troops on the ground to \nprovide security, which is essential to democracy.\n  It is so easy to beat on the Iraqi political leadership. They deserve \nto be pushed, and they deserve to be challenged. But one thing I can \ntell my colleagues, they represent a better Mideast than the groups \ntrying to literally kill them. Our goal is not to just destroy \nterrorist organizations; it is to empower moderates.\n  The Democratic Congress is about to trump any mistake Bush has made \nby a factor of many. If they, as a Democratic Congress, set in motion a \nresolution that would undercut General Petraeus's ability to reinforce \nIraq in a way that makes sense, then they have made a much bigger \nmistake than President Bush has ever made. If my colleagues are trying \nto pass a resolution that would make it impossible for moderates to \nreach political consensus because security is no longer certain, then \nmy colleagues have made a much greater mistake than President Bush.\n  Now why not cut off funding? I guess the only reason we are not \ncutting off funds is because the American people, through polling, say \nthat is a bad idea. But I know there are many on the other side who \nwant to cut funding. To be honest, I respect them immensely; I just \ndisagree with this idea of taking a middle position that has as its \nbasis that there is a safe way to redeploy and not affect the outcome \nof Iraq. That, to me, is just folly. It is unconstitutionally sound. It \ndestroys the ability of the commander on the ground, General Petraeus, \nto do the job we sent him over there to do. It will be a sign of \nweakness to those we are fighting. Moderates will start hedging their \nbets. My belief is that the stronger we are in Iraq, the bolder the \nmoderates\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\nwill be. The weaker we become, the more uncertain they will be.\n  It took us from 1776 to 1789 to write our own Constitution. When the \nproduct was written, women could not vote, and African Americans had no \nstanding in the law. So I know there are religious problems in Iraq of \na longstanding nature. I know this: Before al-Qaida bombed the Samarra \nmosque, the third most holy Shia holy site in Samarra, there had been \ngenerations of Iraqis, Sunnis and Shias, living together, \nintermarrying. I do not believe Sunnis and Shias are born to kill each \nother.\n  I do believe, like other places in history, other times in history, \nand other places on the planet, people are divided--sometimes by race, \nsometimes by religion--and our country needs to come to the aid of \nthose who want to live together and reject religious bigotry.\n  The idea of dividing the country based on race, not many people in \nthis body would say: Yes, that is a good idea, that will bring about \npeace, because it is giving in to bigotry. The idea of trying to give \nin to religious differences is insurmountable, is giving in to \nreligious prejudice. I do believe the Iraqis can overcome their \ndifferences because it is in their best interest. But I do believe, if \nwe do not reinforce this infant democracy at a critical time in its \nformation, we are going to lose in Iraq and the war just begins, it \ndoes not end. If you think withdrawing or redeploying ends this war, \nthen I think you are going to be proven wrong in history.\n  I know what awaits those who are involved in the surge: more risk, \nmore blood, and more treasure. On the other end of this surge, my hope \nis that we will provide enough security--holding areas previously \ncleared--and the Iraqi Government will step to the plate and start \nsharing the oil, doing the things politically they need to do to \nreconcile their country.\n\n  No one believes 21,500 troops are going to solve the problems of \nIraq. Military power has its limitations, but we need to reinforce Iraq \npolitically, economically, and militarily. The general we have sent to \ndo the job has told us what he needs. He has a plan to accomplish his \nmission. The Congress is undercutting him at every turn.\n  This is the 17th resolution. I do not know what the magic number is \nto find the resolution that fits the political moment, but I can tell \nyou this: The resolution in Iraq is not about the political moment; it \nis about decades to come in the Mideast if we can empower the moderates \nwho are fighting and dying for their own freedom.\n  I say firmly and boldly to these Iraqis who have joined the military, \nwho have joined the police, who are wanting to be judges, to those \npolitical leaders trying to find common ground between the three \nfactions: You have my admiration and support because I know what it is \nlike to be challenged in politics, when special interest groups try to \ntake your job away from you because you will not do what they tell you. \nI cannot imagine what it is like to make political decisions knowing \nthey are trying to kill your family.\n  I do believe the outcome in Iraq is part of a global struggle and \nthat we need to reinforce Iraq on all fronts to have a chance, our last \nbest chance to get this country up and running under democratic \nprinciples.\n  Talking to the neighbors is a wonderful thing. Somebody needs to be \ntalking to Iran about their nuclear program and deal with this nut who \nis the President of Iran, who goes into the United Nations and says \nopenly: I would like to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth, and who \nis challenging the world openly today that he will not give up his \nnuclear ambitions. It is clear to me, and I think anyone else who has \nlooked at Iran, they are trying to develop a nuclear weapon to change \nthe balance of power in the Mideast, and they are involved deeply in \nIraq because their biggest nightmare, from the Iranian point of view, \nis a stable, functioning democracy. The theocracy in Iran does not have \na shared interest with the United States or the Iraqi people when it \ncomes to forming a democracy. If we can get them involved to help us \nprovide security, let's give it a whirl. Let's give it a try. I do not \nbelieve they really have that as their goal.\n  Syria is trying to undercut this infant democracy called Lebanon. \nThey are playing hard in Iraq because they are a police state.\n  I believe that the neighbors, Syria and Iran, are part of a global \nchallenge to freedom-loving people. They are not the solution; they are \nthe problem.\n  Where we find moderates in the Mideast, we need to stand boldly with \nthem and give them the ability, the best we can, to change the course \nof the Mideast. This effort to withdraw and redeploy is the worst \npossible signal you could send to moderates or extremists. This is a \nwar which has religious components to it.\n  There is one group who has proven they can live together in Iraq in \npeace, willing to live with us in peace. There are plenty of moderate \nforces throughout the Mideast who want to live on the planet with the \nrest of us and have a desire to do so. There is a minority who have \nhijacked a great religion, who have no place for us--moderate Muslims, \nJews, or anybody else who is different. They want to destroy Israel \neventually. They are not kidding.\n  I wish we could go back in time--not just to Lebanon, but I wish we \ncould go back into the 1930s and take Hitler for what he was. I wish we \nwould understand who our enemy is and take them for what they are. They \nare barbarians who kill without conscience. They have an agenda in \nwriting. They are hell-bent on achieving that agenda. That agenda goes \nlike this: Destroy anything or anybody that embraces a concept called \ndemocracy or is sympathetic to the West, to moderate governments where \nthey exist in the Mideast; turn your attention toward America, drive us \nout of the Mideast; establish a religious-dominated Mideast with a view \nof religion that is harsh to everything and everybody; and destroy \nIsrael. I am not making this up. This is not my theory of what they \nwant to do; this is what they said they will do.\n  Iraq is the chance to turn it around. Iraq is a great opportunity for \nus, the Iraqi people, and the world at large to stand up to the \nextremists and beat them politically, militarily, and economically.\n  This resolution we are about to consider or may consider sends the \nworst possible signal at the most important time in the war on \nterrorism. Whatever mistakes President Bush has made in his \nadministration--I think they are well documented--the biggest mistake \nis yet to come, and that would be passing this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCardin be recognized for 5 minutes and then Senator Kennedy be \nrecognized immediately after the remarks by the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I urge us to move forward and consider the \nIraq resolution so that every Member of this body can speak on this \nissue, we can debate it, and we can cast our votes on what we believe \nthe policy should be for the United States in Iraq.\n  I would like to take us back to October of 2002. I was in the other \nbody in October 2002. I voted against the resolution that gave the \nPresident the right to use force in Iraq. Let's remember the basis on \nwhich that resolution was passed. We were told that Iraq was in \nviolation of U.N. resolutions concerning weapons of mass destruction \nand we needed to have the option to use military force in order to \nenforce that resolution and get rid of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The United States was also concerned about the war against terror, \nand there were statements made about the war on terror. I might tell \nyou, there was no evidence that Iraq was involved in the attacks on our \ncountry on September 11. And, yes, there was a desire by many to get \nrid of the regime of Saddam Hussein.\n\n  What has happened since then? Our American troops have been in Iraq. \nWe found no weapons of mass destruction. There are serious questions as \nto the intelligence information we had and how that was relayed to all \nof us. Saddam Hussein is gone. He has been removed. The Iraqi \nGovernment is now in place. A constitution was adopted. A government \nwas elected. The Maliki government is now responsible for the affairs \nof Iraq. Times have changed.\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\n  But the most significant change that has occurred in Iraq during the \nlast year has been the increased sectarian violence--a civil war. That \nis what is taking place in Iraq today. It is clear the presence of the \nU.S. military will not end the civil war. Iraqis need to end the civil \nwar through diplomacy and negotiations and the confidence of the people \nin Iraq.\n  Something else has changed in the last year. We had national \nelections in our country, midterm elections. The people asked for \nchange. Now there is a change in the Congress, and during the first few \nmonths of this Congress, we have held over 40 oversight hearings on \nwhat is happening in Iraq. I do not recall these hearings taking place \nin the last Congress.\n  Those hearings have pointed out--with expert after expert; military \nexpert, foreign policy expert--we are not going to end the sectarian \nviolence in Iraq by increasing American troops. We cannot win it on the \nbattlefield. We have to deal with it and negotiate a settlement in \nIraq.\n  We have before us the Reid resolution. We also have before us the \nPresident's current policies in Iraq. Do we want more of the same--an \nescalation of troops, a continuation of U.S. military presence in Iraq \nin the midst of a civil war--or do we want a change in direction? The \nReid resolution represents a change in direction. It is a change in \ndirection as it relates to U.S. troop levels.\n  We have lost almost 3,200 American troops, 68 from my own State of \nMaryland. There is a civil war in which American troops are not adding \nto ending that civil war. We need to look at whether we want to \nincrease our troops, as the President wants, or to start redeploying \nour troops so the Iraqis can stand up and defend their own country so \nwe can look for a political solution to what is happening in Iraq. We \ncan remove the big target on Americans. Public opinion in Iraq says it \nis OK to kill Americans. We have to remove the American presence so we \ncan move forward.\n  The Reid resolution gives us a well-defined mission which we can \nachieve, which is in the interest of the United States, that the Iraqis \nwould take responsibility for their own country, would have well-\ntrained security forces.\n  The resolution speaks to what we need to do as far as a surge in \ndiplomacy, to urge more countries to get involved so the Sunnis and \nShiites can live together and have confidence in their own government \nthat represents a change, that represents a direction that is in the \ninterest of the United States.\n  I urge us to be willing to debate this resolution and to vote on this \nresolution. That is our responsibility. It is our responsibility as \nMembers of this body. It is our responsibility to our men and women who \nare serving our Nation, our Armed Forces. It is a responsibility we owe \nto our Nation. I urge my colleagues to move forward so we can go on \nrecord and change the direction of America's participation in Iraq so \nwe can achieve the objectives that are in the interests of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, is there a time allocation or are we \nwithout a time allocation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have a time limit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. I do not intend to be long, and I am \nglad to yield at any time to the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, this is a defining moment for our country. The \nAmerican people are watching. The world is watching. The issue is \nclear. Will we stand with our soldiers by changing their mission and \nbeginning to bring them home, or will we stand with the President and \nkeep our soldiers trapped in Iraq's civil war?\n  History will judge us. We can either continue down the President's \nperilous path or insist on a new direction. If we do not change course, \nwe know what lies ahead--more American casualties, more wounded, more \ndestruction.\n  A new strategy that makes Iraqis less reliant on our military is the \nbest way forward.\n  More of the same misguided policy will result in more of the same \ntragedy for our military. Let's try a new course and let's try it now \nbecause Iraq is the overarching issue of our time and because we need \nto protect our national security.\n  We are told we need to be patient. We are told we have to give the \nlatest escalation a chance to succeed. But we have heard all of that \nbefore.\n  We have heard for years that this administration has a plan for \nsuccess. We have heard for years that progress is just a few months \naway. We have heard for years that we have turned the corner.\n\n  But the plans for success keep getting tossed aside for new plans. \nThe administration has benchmarks to measure success, but there are no \nconsequences when the benchmarks are not met.\n  The timelines for progress keep getting extended. We have turned so \nmany corners that we have ended up back where we started--trying to \ncontrol Baghdad. It is time for a new direction.\n  Mr. President, I reference this document. It is: ``Measuring \nStability and Security in Iraq.'' It is a report to Congress by the \nDepartment of Defense, embargoed until 3 o'clock this afternoon. It is \nnow after that hour. Here is what this document, which has just been \nreleased by the Department of Defense, has to say on stability and \nsecurity in Iraq:\n\n       The last two months of 2006, however, saw little progress \n     on the reconciliation front. The first two of four planned \n     reconciliation conferences were described in the last report \n     (November 2006). These conferences laid solid groundwork for \n     subsequent conferences, but there has been little progress \n     since then and the conferences had no effect on quelling \n     violence. On December 16-17, 2006, the Political Parties \n     Conference was held in Baghdad. Speeches given by the Prime \n     Minister and other Iraqi officials focused on political \n     participation and national unity, and welcomed former \n     Ba'athists into the political process, so long as they showed \n     loyalty to the new national government. The Sadrist bloc, top \n     Ba'athists, and many Sunni factions did not participate. A \n     fourth conference of religious leaders has not yet been \n     scheduled due to lack of financial support and attendance \n     challenges.\n\n  Mr. President, too many parents have had to bury their sons and \ndaughters. Too many children have been left without their father or \ntheir mother. Too many soldiers are missing arms or legs. Nearly 3,200 \nof our forces have been killed. More than 24,000 have been wounded. The \ncasualties keep mounting. The violence in Iraq continues to spiral as \nwell. Our troops are in the impossible position of trying to stabilize \na country at war with itself.\n  The recent National Intelligence Estimate confirms the nightmare \nscenario unfolding for our troops. Iraq is sliding deeper into the \nabyss of civil war, and our brave men and women are caught in the \nmiddle of it. Prospects for halting the sectarian violence are bleak. \nGreater chaos and anarchy are looming ahead. Needless additional U.S. \ncasualties are inevitable.\n  The intelligence community has finally determined what everyone but \nthe Bush administration has been willing to admit for some time. As the \nIntelligence Estimate stated:\n\n       [T]he term ``civil war'' accurately describes key elements \n     of the Iraqi conflict, including the hardening of ethno-\n     sectarian identities, a sea change in the character of the \n     violence, ethno-sectarian mobilization, and population \n     displacements.\n\n  Those are the words of the intelligence community. Secretary Powell \nagrees. Former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan agrees. Only President \nBush continues to stubbornly deny that our troops are policing a civil \nwar.\n  The facts speak for themselves. According to the United Nations, \nnearly 35,000 civilians were violently killed in Iraq last year. In \nNovember and December of last year, more than 6,000 civilians were \nkilled. Most were killed in Baghdad, where ``unidentified bodies killed \nexecution-style are found in large numbers daily.'' More than 2 million \nrefugees have fled the violence in Iraq, and another 1.8 million have \nbeen displaced internally.\n  Our military should not be caught in the middle of this quagmire. \nOnly a political solution can solve Iraq's problems.\n\n[[Page S3104]]\n\n  General Casey, in his June 2005 testimony to the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, called out for a political solution. He said:\n\n       If you look back historically at how insurgencies have been \n     defeated, they have been defeated when the insurgents saw \n     their options as better protected in the political process \n     and their prospects for economic advancement can be better \n     protected by the political process than fighting for them. \n     And that's the essential element here.\n  Last August, General Abizaid spoke about the need for a political \nsolution. He said:\n\n       Our troops are the best equipped, the best trained, the \n     best led in the world. And I am enormously proud of them, and \n     I have the utmost confidence in their ability to handle any \n     mission. Yet, sectarian violence is worse than ever in \n     Baghdad in particular. And I wonder about the validity of a \n     strategy that says that less capable troops that are not as \n     well equipped, trained or led as the best troops in the world \n     can handle the security of this country if the upswing in \n     violence has occurred despite the presence of the best troops \n     in the world. It doesn't give me a lot of confidence in our \n     underlying strategy. And it suggests to me--\n\n  This is General Abizaid--\n\n     it suggests to me that what we need is a political rather \n     than a military solution.\n\n  Last week, General Petraeus, the new commander of our forces in Iraq, \nstated that there is ``no military solution'' in Iraq. But no one in \nthe administration has been able to clearly articulate a political \nsolution or how it can take hold in the midst of this chaos. Instead of \ngiving the Iraqis a necessary incentive to get their political house in \norder by beginning an orderly redeployment of our troops out of Iraq, \nthe President stubbornly insists on sending more and more troops into \nIraq's civil war. Escalation didn't work in Vietnam and it will not \nwork in Iraq either.\n  The President's latest proposal--to increase the number of our troops \nin Iraq--makes no sense at all. Sending more troops into the cauldron \nof Iraq's civil war is not the solution.\n  In addition to the fact that we know a military solution is not the \nanswer, the administration still has not leveled with us on the number \nof troops the President plans to send to Iraq for the surge.\n  On January 10, the President announced he had committed more than \n20,000 additional troops to Iraq. Within a few days, this number had \nbeen revised to 21,500.\n  The CBO estimated that it would be far higher--as much as 35,000 to \n48,000 troops when support troops are included.\n  On February 6, I asked General Pace and Secretary Gates for the best \nmilitary estimates of the actual size of the escalation, and their \nanswer was an additional 10 to 15 percent. General Pace said:\n\n       You're going to need no more than another 2,000, 2,500 \n     troops on the ground.\n\n  By February 15, the number had more than doubled. General Schoomaker \ntold the Armed Services Committee his estimate was somewhere between \n5,000 and 6,000 troops when you included imbedded trainers.\n  Then, on March 6, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England told a \nHouse committee: ``About 4,000, maybe as many as 7,000.''\n  Last week, at the request of General Petraeus, Secretary Gates \nauthorized an additional 2,200 military police troops.\n  We still don't have an accurate total for the size of this \nescalation. The administration refuses to speak with clarity and \ncandor. Since the current surge began, Shiite militias in Baghdad may \nbe lying low, but violence has increased elsewhere in Iraq. In Diyala \nProvince, in 3 months, American casualties have exceeded the number for \nthe entire year of 2006. In January this year, 83 American soldiers \nwere killed, compared to 62 in the same month a year ago. Eighty more \nAmericans were killed in February of this year. In the same month last \nyear, we lost 55 soldiers. Already, in 2 weeks this March, we have lost \nmore than 31 soldiers, the same number killed in the entire month of \nMarch of 2006.\n  This is what today's report from the Defense Department points out on \npage 18, under the section ``Attack Trends and Violence'':\n\n       The total number of attacks on and casualties suffered by \n     coalition forces, the ISF, and Iraqi civilians for the \n     October-December reporting period were the highest of any 3-\n     month period since 2003.\n\n  It continues:\n\n       Coalition forces continued to attract the majority of \n     attacks, while ISF and Iraqi civilians continued to suffer \n     the majority of the casualties.\n\n  That is today's report.\n  Continuing our open-ended commitment to stay in Iraq will not bring \nvictory, it will not stop the violence, and it will not protect our \nnational security.\n  The administration has outlined military, economic, and political \nbenchmarks to measure success, but it has not given any timeline to \nachieve them, and it has not stated any consequences if the benchmarks \nare not met. This same administration supported timelines for every \nIraqi election and for drafting the Constitution. Yet it remains \nemphatically opposed for any timeline for the redeployment of our \nmilitary.\n  The American people have been patient. But America now has been in \nIraq longer than it took us to win World War II. Instead of progress, \nwe continue to see unacceptably high levels of violence, death, and \ndestruction. We are putting too much strain on our Army, especially the \nArmy National Guard. The Army is overextended. Many soldiers are now on \ntheir third rotation. To deal with the recruitment shortages, we have \neased the standards and increased the bonuses. The Department of \nDefense is formalizing a policy to redeploy reservists more often and \nfor longer. But in the long run, we can't protect our Army if we don't \nend the war.\n  Our troops have done their part. They have served with great courage. \nWe are proud of their service, and we are ready to welcome them home.\n  It is time to change course. It is time to ask the Iraqis to step to \nthe plate and take the responsibility for their own future, and it is \ntime to begin to redeploy our troops out of Iraq. It is time to put the \nIraqis on notice that our military will no longer be a permanent crutch \nfor them to lean on. As General Abizaid told the Armed Services \nCommittee last November:\n\n       I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  It is time for American combat troops to begin to come home.\n  Those of us who opposed the war are used to the administration's \nattacks when we disagree with their wrong-headed policy. We have come \nto expect that. They have questioned our patriotism and call us \ndefeatists. When we challenged the President's misguided policy, he \naccused us of having political motives and being partisan.\n  Before the war, Vice President Cheney said we hadn't seen all the \nintelligence he had seen. But after the war, when things were going \nbadly, the President said more than 100 times that we had seen the same \nintelligence.\n  More than 2 years ago, I called on the administration to focus on the \ntraining of the Iraqi security forces and to begin to redeploy our \ntroops out of Iraq. I said the Iraqis need to take responsibility and \nthat we should set a goal of about a year for the redeployment of most \nof our forces out of Iraq. Rather than debating the merits of the \npolicy, the Republican spin machine went into overdrive. A year ago, on \nthe third anniversary of the war, Vice President Cheney went on \nnational television and said:\n\n       I would not look to Ted Kennedy for guidance and leadership \n     in how we ought to manage national security.\n\n  Well, the American people certainly know we cannot look to the Vice \nPresident and this administration for national security. The \nadministration has been consistently wrong about the war in Iraq. Year \nafter year, they insist on a dangerously incompetent strategy. They \nwere wrong about the link between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein. They \nwere wrong about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. They \nwere wrong about America being greeted as liberators. They were wrong \nabout the insurgency being in its last throes, and they are wrong to \ndeny that Iraq is a civil war.\n  The American people are far ahead of the administration. For all of \nus who oppose this misguided war, our goals have always been clear: \nprotect the lives of our soldiers and protect our national security.\n  We have an obligation to stand up for our troops and stand up to the \nPresident when he stubbornly refuses to\n\n[[Page S3105]]\n\nchange course in Iraq. Our legislation will do that. It will change the \nmission of our military away from combat and require the President to \nbegin to redeploy American combat troops out of Iraq in 4 months. The \ntarget date for the completion of the redeployment is March 2008--1 \nyear from now. A limited number of troops would remain in Iraq after \nthat to train and equip the Iraqi security forces, to conduct \ncounterterrorism, and to guarantee the safety of our soldiers.\n  Our proposal is consistent with the bipartisan Iraq Study Group's \nfinding. It recommended that:\n\n       The primary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq should evolve to \n     one of supporting the Iraqi Army, which would take over \n     primary responsibility for combat operations. By the first \n     quarter of 2008, subject to unexpected developments in the \n     security situation on the ground, all combat brigades not \n     necessary for force protection could be out of Iraq.\n\n  Those are the words of the Iraq Study Group.\n  Legislation is clearly necessary to give the Iraq Government enough \nof an incentive to step up to the plate, work out its political \ndifferences, and take responsibility for Iraq's future. It is also \nconsistent with the wishes of the American people, who want most of our \ntroops home within a year. How much clearer does it have to be before \nRepublicans in Congress and the President finally respond to the voices \nof the American people?\n  We are meeting our responsibilities by changing the mission of our \nmilitary. We are not micromanaging the war. Many of us oppose the war, \nbut all of us support our troops. We don't want to keep sending more \nand more of them into the middle of a civil war. Under no circumstances \ndo we want them to go to war without proper armor and equipment. Our \ntroops deserve better. Their families and loved ones deserve better.\n  For the good of our men and women in uniform and the American people, \nit is time for us to take a stand. We need to adopt a new strategy. We \nneed to make clear to the Iraqi Government that the mission of our \ntroops must change and that we have a clear timeframe for their \ndeparture from Iraq.\n  The recent hearings on Walter Reed should inform our debate as well. \nThey tell us how little faith we can put in this administration. The \nvery people who hide behind the troops when we question their policies \nhave failed to keep faith with our wounded soldiers. As importantly, \nthe hearings on Walter Reed remind all of us of the human costs of the \nwar. This administration has done all it can to conceal them from us. \nThey have forbidden photographs of the coffins flown back from Iraq. \nThe President has avoided attending the funerals of the fallen. The \ntours of Walter Reed never included Building 18.\n  But the hearings on Walter Reed swept away all the spin and \ncamouflage. They put our wounded soldiers back where they belong: at \nthe heart of our debates about the war.\n  At the end of those hearings, everyone agreed that the administration \nfailed these brave soldiers, but we failed them long before they \narrived at Walter Reed. The administration failed them when it trumped \nup the intelligence in order to make the case for war. It failed them \nwhen it sent too few troops with too little armor into battle. We in \nthe Senate will fail them today unless we vote to change course and \nbegin to bring our soldiers home. At the end of this debate, the \nAmerican people will know where each of us stands. On our side of the \naisle, we stand with the American people. The voters told us in \nNovember to change course and to begin to bring our troops home, and \nthat is what we are going to do.\n  We stand for our Constitution, in which the Congress speaks for the \npeople in matters of war and peace and can require the President to \nlisten.\n  We stand with our troops. We, and we alone, are the ones insisting on \na policy worthy of their courage and sacrifice.\n  We stand for protecting America's national security. The war in Iraq \nhas been a disaster from the start. It has made America more hated in \nthe world. It has made it harder to win the war against terrorism. It \nhas made it harder to work with other nations on every issue.\n  Peace and progress in Iraq must be earned by Iraqis and their \nneighbors. We must no longer send our brave soldiers to an uncertain \nfate on the streets of Baghdad. We must begin to bring them home to the \nhero's welcome they have surely earned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Utah is finished with his remarks, on this side, the order \nthen be Senator Dodd, Senator Brown, and Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one thing I can say for the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts is that he has been against this war from \nthe beginning. He has taken what he considers to be a principled \nposition, that we should never have gone into Iraq to begin with. \nHowever, much of what he said does not resolve the problems that we are \nconfronting in the War on Terrorism. We hear lots of comments about \npulling out of Iraq but not very much in the way of how to defeat the \nterrorists who are dedicated to destroying almost everything we hold \ndear and sacred.\n  The fact of the matter is this resolution is an illustration of \nwishful thinking. No matter what you call it: pulling our troops out, a \nphased withdrawal, or redeployment, those who support this seem to \nthink everything is going to be hunky-dory and by taking this course we \ncan resolve all our difficulties. Of course, they provide the usual \nlanguage of diplomacy and some of the other things.\n  Look at what this resolution says. It says: Whereas, U.S. troops \nshould not be policing a civil war; and the current conflict in Iraq \nrequires principally a political solution.\n  The fact of the matter is we have three distinct areas in Iraq: The \nKurds in the north, the Sunnis in the center, and the Shias everywhere \nelse, including in the center.\n  There is a long history of animosity between these groups. But look \nat the progress that has been made: women now have the right to vote; \nyoung girls are able to go to school.\n  Eighty percent of the people voted for the representative form of \ngovernment that they enjoy today. Remember, it took us 10 years to \nimplement our Constitution.\n  What I have not heard from those who oppose the war is, how do we \nsolve the problem of terrorism?\n  Let's be honest. Terrorism is something we have confronted \nsporadically throughout the years, though not at the same level of \nintensity as the last couple of years. When the Bader-Meinhof gang \nparalyzed Europe, a lot of people felt we should back away. But we \nsupported our allies and, today, you don't hear about them. Similar \nthings can be said about the fate of the Red Brigade. However, I fully \nrecognize that these groups were minor compared to the terrorists in \nthe Islamic world.\n  The fact is we are in a different war than we have ever been in \nbefore. We are fighting terrorists who don't wear uniforms, who don't \nrepresent a country; they represent an ideology. They are Salafi \njihadists who, going back to the seventh century, when the Islamic \npeople controlled much of the Mediterranean world, used force freely to \nachieve their objectives and, if you disagreed with them, they killed \nyou.\n  We lost 3,000 people in 1 day in this country. As the author of the \n1996-1997 Antiterrorism Effective Death Penalty Act, I recognized that \nwe did not give law enforcement the tools to be able to prevent \nterrorism in this country. One reason was we naively thought that we \nwould never suffer from the type of terrorism that occurred on 9/11/\n2001. The PATRIOT Act brought the antiterrorism laws that were \ndeficient up to the level of the anti-Mafia laws.\n  Can you imagine what will happen if we don't take these people on and \ndo what we can to stop them. What happens if one of them--and they are \ndedicated to doing this--gets a weapon of mass destruction and comes to \nNew York, Washington, DC, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, or any \nnumber of other cities, and blows up the city and causes the deaths of \nhundreds of thousands of people?\n  They are dedicated to this. They don't value human life as we do. \nThey believe they are going to be blessed for having killed the \ninfidels.\n\n[[Page S3106]]\n\n  The fact of the matter is that is what we are faced with--radical \nextremists who would harm our country if they could. The reason they \ncannot is because we have been taking it to them in Afghanistan and \nIraq. It is not pleasant, there is no question. There are sacrifices \nbeing made--our soldiers are being deployed and redeployed. There is no \nquestion there are mistakes that have been made--everything from \nthrowing the Baathists out of the military, many of whom were not \nSaddam Hussein loyalists, to thinking this operation would initially be \ntreated by the Iraqi as a liberation.\n  There were lots of mistakes, but there are a lot of things that are \ngood too.\n  The fact of the matter is, there are hospitals up and running, girls \nare going to school, women have some rights in Iraq--more than ever \nbefore--and upward of 80 percent of the people voted for a \nrepresentative form of government. We should never lose track of that. \nNone of this would have happened had it not been for our soldiers and \nothers in the coalition who were willing to fight, the fact is that \nWhen we get into documents such as this, basically what we are doing is \nmaking it very difficult for our young men and women serving in combat. \nMany of whom are risking their lives for us that they might be able to \nprevent terrorism from taking over the world and especially the USA.\n  We know there are terrorist supporters in our country. If we didn't \nhave a PATRIOT Act, we would not be able to monitor them.\n  This resolution says:\n\n       The President shall promptly transition the mission of the \n     United States forces in Iraq to the limited purposes set \n     forth in subsection (b).\n       (B) Commencement of Phased Redeployment From Iraq--The \n     President shall commence the phased redeployment of United \n     States forces from Iraq not later than 120 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this joint resolution, with the goal \n     of redeploying, by March 31, 2008, all United States combat \n     forces from Iraq except for a limited number that are \n     essential for the following purposes:\n\n  I like that word ``essential.''\n\n       (1) Protecting United States and coalition personnel and \n     infrastructure.\n\n  My gosh, can you imagine if we pull out? The terrorists will come in \nand try to capture that oil wealth to use against the rest of the \nworld, especially us.\n\n       (2) Training and equipping Iraqi forces.\n\n  How are we going to do that if we redeploy our forces out? We know \nthat by training and equipping them, we may be able to help them \nbolster their representative form of government. Keep in mind, I made \nthe point earlier, it took us 10 years to develop our Constitution and \ntheir's is functioning after 2 years. It took us years to solidify the \nstrength of our country so we have this great representative form of \ngovernment that we have in America today.\n  If we leave who is going to train and equip those Iraqi forces? Are \nwe going to leave a small contingent of our people there to be murdered \nor are we going to be able to protect them and train and equip the \nIraqi forces? Will anyone have any confidence in us if we leave?\n  It is interesting to me that as we have started this so-called surge, \nal-Sadr and others have left their bases. True, they are probably going \naway and hoping to come back; but if we can establish--and General \nPetraeus says we can--ourselves and the Iraqi Government in Baghdad so \nthat they know they can take care of it themselves, it is going to \nbe much more difficult for al-Sadr and the other brigades to come back \nand cause the havoc they have been causing.\n\n  Who is going to train and equip these forces? Oddly enough, it is \ninteresting to me that this body voted 100 to 0 to back General \nPetraeus, and ever since we have done that, some here have done nothing \nbut undermine the very thing he said we have to do. It should also be \nnoted that this new strategy appears to be working.\n  We ought to give General Petraeus the opportunity to do it. He has \nsaid he will shoot straight with us. If he finds that the strategy is \nnot working, he said he will let us know. He has been a straight \nshooter from the beginning. He was been a breath of fresh air. He \nunderstands counterinsurgency warfare. He has written the Army's Manual \non this subject. We ought to give him a chance to do what he says he \ncan do.\n\n       (3) Conducting targeted counterterrorism operations.\n\n  How does this small, ``limited number,'' to use the terms of this \nparticular S.J. Res. 9, target counterterrorism operations? I guess we \nwill have to do it through intelligence gathering. I happen to be on \nthe Intelligence Committee, and I know all too well it is very \ndifficult to establish human intelligence networks.\n  Think about that. Bring them all out, redeploy them by March 31, \n2008--all U.S. combat forces from Iraq, except for a limited number \nthat are, again, essential for the following purposes:\n\n       (1) Protecting United States and coalition personnel and \n     infrastructure.\n       How does that small contingency do that?\n       (2) Training and equipping Iraqi forces.\n       (3) Conducting targeted counterterrorism operations.\n\n  My gosh, every one of them would be murdered on the spot if we didn't \nhave enough people there to provide security.\n  This is ridiculous.\n\n       (C) Comprehensive Strategy.\n\n  This is to make it look good, like they are trying to do something \ngood. Here is what it says:\n\n       Subsection (b) shall be implemented as part of a \n     comprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy . \n     . .\n\n  In other words, pulling out all our people except for this ``limited \nnumber,'' to use their language--\n\n       Subsection (b) shall be implemented as part of a \n     comprehensive diplomatic, political, and economic strategy.\n\n  Diplomatic? I know one thing. If you want to make sure diplomacy \nworks, make sure it is backed up by force. We are not backing it up by \npulling all of our troops out, except for that ``limited number.''\n  OK. How is that diplomacy going to work if they don't realize we are \nthere to accomplish our mission? OK. Again, it says:\n\n       Subsection (b) shall be implemented as part of a \n     comprehensive diplomatic, political . . .\n\n  What do you think we are trying to do? Maliki, is pulling out the \nstops to help us.\n\n       . . . as part of a comprehensive diplomatic, political, and \n     economic strategy . . .\n\n  What happens if we pull our troops out of there and, all of a sudden, \nwe have a renewed effort by terrorists to assault us on our mainland \nbecause we are not keeping them at bay over there? Can you imagine the \ncost to our society? Can you imagine if we pull out of there and there \nis widespread civil war and genocide that will occur, just like in \nSoutheast Asia when we pulled out there? Millions of people died. I am \nnot so sure we should have been in Southeast Asia, but I feel confident \nwe should be here. It says:\n\n       . . . that includes sustained engagement with Iraq's \n     neighbors and the international community for the purpose of \n     working collectively to bring stability to Iraq.\n\n  Those are nice, high-flying words. If our diplomacy is not backed up \nby our willingness to take these people on, I suspect we are going to \nhave more than a 9/11, 3,000-person loss in this country. When we have \nmany more people killed as a result of terrorism in our country because \nthey will be emboldened by this type of resolution, then it seems to me \nthat we are going to pay a price that will be much higher than what we \nare paying now. We have to take these people on. We cannot walk away. \nThere are too many people who have relied on us.\n  Admittedly, we at least need to give General Petraeus and the current \nforces there a chance to make this work. He says he believes he can do \nit. But he also is a straight shooter and has said: If we cannot do it, \nI will tell you we cannot. That may be the time when we will have to \nsay there is not much more we can do there. I know one thing. The \nmoderate Arabs are very concerned about what is going on over there. \nThey know that if the United States doesn't have its full influence in \nthe Middle East, there is going to be chaos. They know that these \nWahhabi, Salafi jihadists will make mincemeat of the Middle East, and \nthey will be emboldened if we walk out of there and act like we can \nwork diplomatically on some of these problems. I think diplomacy is \nvery important. But it needs\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\nto be backed up by a strong military plan, so they know we are not \ngoing to put up with a lot of foolery.\n  Look, I think there are sincere people on both sides of this debate. \nBut I challenge the other side, who believes in this type of a \nresolution, to show us how you prevent the terrorists from coming here. \nShow us how you are going to win this war against terrorism. Show us \nhow you are going to make a difference in the lives of all those who \nhave lost loved ones thus far, not only on 9/11 but those who have \ngiven their lives for us over in Iraq.\n  Show us how pulling the troops out is going to defeat the terrorists. \nTell us what happens after this resolution becomes law. Their plan \noffers only one option: making the United States look like it lost to \nthe terrorists in the Middle East. That would be one of the worst \nthings that could happen to our Nation and one of the worst messages we \ncould send to the world.\n  I don't find fault with anybody who sincerely believes in a \nresolution such as this, but I question whether they have thought it \nthrough. Have they looked at the intelligence? Have they listened to \nour Armed Forces, who know they are fighting for something worthwhile, \nwho know they are fighting for freedom, and who know they are fighting \nfor the Iraqi people. Our military fully realizes they are not only \nfighting, as they had to, to overturn a vicious, cruel dictator, but to \ncreate stability in a place that needs stability almost more than \nanything else. Our servicemembers also know that we have moderate Arab \nfriends who are pulling for us. Allies, in the region, who hope we will \nsucceed because they know they will be next. And if we fail, we will \npay a price like nothing we have paid before.\n  As I said, everyone in this body is a friend of mine. However, I \nstrongly disagree with those who think this is a good resolution. I do \nnot question their integrity or their desire to try and find some \nsolution. But this certainly is no solution. This is a walk away that \nwill cause us greater problems in the future. If that happens, we are \nall going to reap the whirlwind.\n  I have no doubt, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, that \nthere are terrorists who would love to destroy our country. There are \nsome, who if set free, would do everything in their power to destroy \nour nation.\n  Frankly, we cannot walk away until we give General Petraeus and our \nservicemembers an opportunity to win this war.\n  We have never fought a war such as this. I do not blame anybody who \nis concerned that we are paying too high a price. But I ask people to \nthink about the higher price we will pay if we don't win this war. I \nask my fellow citizens to understand that we are fighting people who \nare dedicated to destroying those who disagree with them and there will \nbe a heavy price to be paid if we walk away from our responsibilities.\n  There is a good reason why we have not had a major terrorist incident \nsince 9/11/2001. We have shown the will to take these people on, and to \ndisrupt their plans. We have captured or killed a large number of these \nterrorists, including members of al-Qaida leadership. We have bottled \nup Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri.\n  If we walk away because of this resolution, it seems to me we will \npay a much heavier price later, and I am very concerned about that.\n  My family lost my only living brother in World War II. He flew on one \nof the air raids that helped destroy Hitler's oilfields. It was a price \nour family paid. I am very proud of my brother Jesse. He was fighting \nfor freedom, and he did not walk away from the threat Hitler posed. \nToday, we once again live in dangerous times, possibly even more \ndangerous. We cannot leave Iraq until we give General Petraeus and our \ntroops the opportunity to accomplish their mission. We should not \nundermine their efforts with this resolution.\n  Though I respect my colleagues differing opinions I believe this \nresolution undermines their efforts--the efforts of those young men and \nwomen who are sacrificing for us overseas.\n  We should not decide these matters based on polls. Unfortunately, I \nthink we have far too many people who are paying attention to the \npolls. I look at some of the candidates for President today, how they \nhave changed their positions gradually because they think the polls \nrequire it. We are not here to respond to polls. We are here to do what \nwe believe is in the best interest of our country. Some sincerely \ndisagree with me and I understand that. But I believe it is their \nsolemn duty to explain what we are going to do if we pull out of Iraq. \nWill we not create a myriad of other problems? Will not the entire \nMiddle East become a war zone? Under such conditions, Israel itself \nwill be threatened as well as moderate Arab countries. We cannot walk \naway, and we cannot allow the whole Middle East to descend into the \nSalafis jihadist arms.\n  I hope our colleagues will think these matters through. I certainly \nhope they will vote against this joint resolution.\n  Many of my colleagues voted to bring forth this debate. I understand \ntheir reasoning. However, I could not vote for this debate because the \nresolution is faulty on its face.\n  I don't know anybody who worries more about our young men and women \nwho are sacrificing over there than I do because our family has lived \nthrough it. Not only did we lose a brother in the Second World War, but \nwe lost a brother-in-law in Vietnam. Just a few years ago, my family \nburied another brother-in-law who served with the Marines in Vietnam \nand rose to the rank of First Sergeant. I feel deeply about these \nmatters, but if we don't stand up and do what is right, we will reap \nthe whirlwind. It will cost us more than it is costing us right now, \nand today's cost is significant.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to say these few words. I hope we will defeat \nthis resolution. I think it will be in the best interest of the country \nand in the best interest of the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, after Senator Dodd is recognized, we had \npreviously indicated that Senator Brown and then Senator Dorgan would \nbe recognized. We are trying to see whether it might be possible to \nsubstitute Senator Kerry for Senator Brown, leaving Senator Dorgan in \nthe same position. We are trying to determine that right now. For the \ntime being, it will be Senator Dodd, then Senator Brown or Senator \nKerry, and then Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Michigan. I \ncommend him, along with Senator Biden, my chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and our majority leader, Senator Reid, and \nothers for the tremendous effort they have put into these matters over \nthe last number of weeks. I haven't always agreed with my leaders in \nthe majority on the course of action, but I have respect for their \nefforts to try and build consensus. I admire that. I always doubted \nwhether consensus is something we ought to try and get on an issue such \nas this. Clarity, accountability, real proposals that require up-or-\ndown votes that result in action I think in the long term may be \nnecessary here. I respect immensely the efforts they have made to bring \nas many people as is possible under the same umbrella in dealing with \nthis issue.\n  Once again, we find ourselves debating the same basic issue with \nrespect to United States policy in Iraq, namely, when is the President \ngoing to admit his policy is a failure? From how many different places \ndo you have to hear that--from the Baker-Hamilton report, to the \nanalysis by military leaders. Over and over, the conclusion has been \nthe same. This is not a conclusion I have arrived at myself, it is one \nthat has been arrived at by almost every group of people or individuals \nwho know anything about this matter. This policy must be fundamentally \nchanged. The course must be changed to empower the Iraqis to take \nresponsibility for their collective future. If they do that, there is a \nchance that stability and a better future for them can emerge. If they \ndon't, there is not a treasury deep enough or an army big enough to do \nthat for them.\n  How many debates, how many reports, how many more of our young men \nand women are going to be killed or wounded until the President and his \nadvisers acknowledge the President's policy has been a failure, \nunfortunately, from almost the outset?\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\n  How long will it be before the administration begins a true \ndiplomatic offensive to help the Iraqis and their neighbors secure a \npolitical solution that everyone has concluded is the only possible way \nthis matter can have an outcome that offers some hope to the people of \nthat country?\n  How many times can the administration and some of our colleagues here \nclaim that any debate, any dissent, any action that departs one iota \nfrom the President's policy is somehow unpatriotic, words we have heard \ntoo often in this Chamber and elsewhere to describe those who have a \ndifferent point of view--I emphasize ``a point of view''--that has been \nembraced by people without any adherence to a political party or \nideology who have reached the same conclusion that this policy is not \nworking at all.\n  Jingoism and facile claims about ``support the troops,'' about ``good \nversus evil,'' about ``victory versus defeat'' can no longer, I think, \nbe tolerated--in fact, they should never have been tolerated in the \nfirst place.\n  Let's stop invoking the inverted logic, as our colleague from \nVirginia, Senator Webb, so aptly described it, of claiming that because \nthere are troops are in harm's way, we, therefore, have to stay the \ncourse.\n  We all know we have troops in the field. We all honor the sacrifices \nthey have made. They are a remarkable group of people. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I have been there on several occasions over the past couple \nof years. Regardless of one's view on policy, the admiration for the \njob these individuals are doing ought to be very high. In my case, it \nis. It is rather remarkable the service they are providing. It is the \npolicy that needs changing.\n  No one is suggesting our troops don't deserve all the support they \ncan get, but supporting our troops and opposing a policy ought not to \nrequire the kind of gymnastics that some of our colleagues who oppose \nany changes suggest.\n  Having troops deployed overseas should not prevent us from debating \ncritically important issues relating to the wisdom of staying the \nfailed course the President has charted. In fact, we do a grave \ndisservice to our troops by not having a public debate to shed light on \nthe many questions and concerns that arise from our current involvement \nin Iraq.\n  I have publicly stated many times over recent months that this body \nshould urgently take strong, binding action to force the President to \nchange his Iraq policy. While this resolution before us does not \nrepresent as forceful an approach to accomplishing that goal as I would \npropose, it does take the United States one step closer to ending U.S. \ncombat involvement in Iraq, and for that reason I am going to support \nit as a first step in what I think is the right direction.\n  This resolution goes beyond simply expressing disagreement with the \nPresident, which is the problem I had with earlier resolutions. It puts \nthis Congress on record as authorizing a ``prompt commencement of \nphased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq.'' It spells out \nthe transition of the mission for the limited forces that would remain \nafter the phased redeployment of combat forces have been completed.\n  This resolution unequivocally states that the United States should \nbegin a phased redeployment of U.S. combat forces from Iraq. It states \nthat the American forces remaining in Iraq should have a very different \nand more restricted mission: training, equipping Iraqi security forces, \nforce protection, and targeted counterterrorism operations.\n  Crucially, this resolution also states that the redeployment of U.S. \nforces shall be part of a comprehensive, diplomatic, political, and \neconomic strategy, and it requires the President to develop such a \nstrategy, a strategy that has been seemingly nonexistent and that is \ncritical to the stabilization of Iraq.\n  I am concerned, however, that the resolution allows for as many as \n120 days from the date of enactment to pass before the President must \ncommence the redeployment of U.S. combat forces. I firmly believe this \nredeployment can and must begin far sooner, and that we should set a \nhard target date for the completion of this phased redeployment rather \nthan a soft goal of the end of March 2008, as stated in the resolution.\n  We face a region-wide crisis of credibility, a crisis that was caused \nby very bad policy choices rather than fate, as some would suggest. \nWhile the United States may still remain an enormous military power, \nand we are, our power to influence has been greatly diminished, \nunfortunately. It is this power to influence that is critical, I think, \nto America's interest in the region and to the future of Iraq and its \nneighbors.\n  It is my strong hope that the passage of this resolution will bring \nthe United States one step closer to ending our intervention in Iraq's \ncivil war and one step closer to developing and employing critical, \ncomprehensive, diplomatic, political, and economic strategies in Iraq \nand in the wider region.\n  Based on past experience, however, I have no confidence whatsoever \nthat this President will pay any attention to this resolution or this \ncongressional debate. That has been the history of the administration \nover the past many months. So I say to my colleagues, if you are truly \nsincere in your support, as I believe you are, for the policies \nexpressed in this legislation, then I think we must be prepared to do \nfar more in the coming days, I hope in the short days, to bring an end \nto this destructive and futile policy, including the exercise of the \ncongressional powers of the purse. We need to stop financing the \nadministration's reckless strategy and put critical resources into \nrebuilding our military. Our troops deserve no less from this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, we have been discussing this topic now \nfor some time, and it seems that there are a succession of ways in \nwhich to fail.\n  The Democratic leadership in the Senate is looking to persuade the \nAmerican people that our national security would improve if we \nimmediately withdrew U.S. forces from Iraq and provided our enemies \nwith a timetable and roadmap for our withdrawal. This is exactly what \nS. Res. 9 would do. It would require the beginning of the withdrawal of \nU.S. troops from Iraq within 120 days.\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut said he didn't even think \nthat was acceptable; that it should be even less than 120 days. So the \nunderlying goal is to remove all U.S. combat forces by March 31, 2008. \nThere will be exceptions for those who will stay to protect personnel \nand to do the training of Iraqi forces, but the overall premise is to \ndiminish the U.S. presence in Iraq. To that end, I ask: What is the \ngoal, just withdrawal or success? If all we are about is withdrawing, \nthere are many ways to do that. This timetable might be appropriate, if \nthat were the only goal. But if the goal is success, if the goal is the \nopportunity for Iraq to succeed in its effort at democracy, a different \nplan must be followed.\n  Setting artificial, arbitrary timelines for withdrawal has been \nopposed by Republicans, Democrats, our military leaders, and the Iraq \nStudy Group. In the words of the Democratic leader on January 31, 2005:\n\n       As far as setting a timeline, as we learned in the Balkans, \n     that is not a wise decision, because it only empowers those \n     who don't want us there, and it doesn't work well to do that.\n\n  In the words of the current chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, in June of 2005:\n\n       A deadline for pulling out will only encourage our enemies \n     to wait us out.\n\n  Let me repeat that: It will only encourage our enemies to wait us out \nif we give a deadline.\n  Democrats are trying to bring before us the 17th version of how we \nwould manage the war in Iraq. Seventeen plans in less than 2 months and \nnone lead to victory. Can you imagine if the commanders on the ground \nactually had to take orders from the Senate? Thankfully, in our scheme \nof Government and the way our Government was set up, we only have one \nCommander in Chief, one person giving the orders to our armed services \nso that they might succeed at our endeavors.\n  This attempt to micromanage the war at every level by Senate \nresolutions is not what our Government should do at a time of war. The \nPresident put together a new plan and a new team. General Petraeus is \non the ground as the Iraq allied commander, and Admiral Fallon with the \nCentral\n\n[[Page S3109]]\n\nCommand. Both of these distinguished military leaders testified they \nsupported the current plan, and this Senate confirmed General Petraeus \nby a vote of 81 to 0.\n  So now what is our message? We send you to war but we don't want you \nto execute your plan?\n  We are so fond of this whole atmosphere of anti-Bush and the \nPresident that we forget that this is a plan that General Petraeus, our \nmilitary leader on the ground in Iraq, has said he believed was a plan \nthat had a reasonable chance for success. So I say give General \nPetraeus and his plan a chance for success on the field.\n\n  Our forces have not suffered a single military defeat in this entire \nepisode. Obviously, we have had some losses, and a high cost in lives \nand injuries and treasure, but we have not had a single military \ndefeat. The sacrifice of our troops, their sacrifice, must be for a \npurpose: a state of Iraq that is not a failed state.\n  In hearing after hearing in the Armed Services Committee, I have \nlistened to our military leaders, as well as intelligence experts, give \nus the same message, and their message is clear: A precipitous \nwithdrawal from Iraq would almost surely result in a failed state, and \na failed Iraqi state would be a disaster for the Middle East and our \nown national security.\n  I would suggest a rapid exit from Iraq is not in America's best \nnational interest. I urge my Democratic colleagues to articulate how \nexiting Iraq, allowing chaos to reign, allowing thugs to rule the \nstreets, and fear to rule the hearts of the Iraqi people will make \nAmerica safer.\n  For years, my Democratic colleagues have been calling for a change of \ncourse. Well, President Bush provided one, a way forward politically, \neconomically, and militarily. The new team, a new commander, and our \ncommanders in the field, have said we need more troops, and the \nPresident provided them.\n  By the way, early indications are that things are a little \nencouraging. American and Iraqi forces, side by side, are walking in \nthe streets of Sadr City as we speak. It is too soon to tell, but so \nfar, I, for one, am encouraged. This may just work. Why not give it a \nchance?\n  The Democrats have provided 17 plans. None will give Iraq a chance to \nsucceed. I have a plan. Let's support our troops by providing them the \nfunding they need and allowing those responsible for executing the war \nto do their job. Let the generals on the field run the war.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle try every day to equate \nthis global war on terror to Vietnam. I do not believe there are many \nsimilarities, but I believe there is one. That war, Vietnam, was lost \nin Washington, and this one can be, too. Let's not do that.\n  The distinguished junior Senator from New York said it best on \nSeptember of 2005:\n\n       I don't believe it is smart to set a date for withdrawal. I \n     don't think you should ever telegraph your intentions to the \n     enemy so they can await you.\n\n  That statement was true then, and I believe it to be true today.\n  During this debate, I want to hear how nonbinding resolutions, \ndragged out over several weeks, Saturdays included, resolutions with \nthe sole purpose to undermine our Commander in Chief, will do anything \nbut confuse our troops, embolden our enemy, and complicate our efforts \nto combat terrorism and support this young democracy in the heart of \nthe Middle East.\n  I oppose S. Res. 9. It is wrong for Iraq, it is wrong for the Iraqi \npeople, it is wrong for the stability of the Middle East, and it is \nwrong for the national security of the United States.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, 4 years ago the President of the United \nStates told the Nation that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. The \nPresident told us that Saddam Hussein was aiding and abetting al-Qaida. \nNow he is telling us that sending more troops into Iraq will lead to \nsome kind of victory in a country torn by civil war and rife with \ninsurgents. The President did not make a credible case in 2002. He has \nfailed to do so again.\n  Before the President sent our troops into battle in 2003, I asked him \na series of questions in a letter to the President and in a House \nresolution, questions about strategy, about reconstruction, and about \ntroop safety. He did not answer those questions then. He still has not \nanswered them. We do not know his definition of victory. We do not know \nhis plan for an exit strategy. We still do not have an answer as to \nwhen our troops will have all the body armor they need. We are supposed \nto take it on trust that sending more of our troops into this chaos \nwill somehow produce stability. Trust needs to be earned.\n  In November, voters in my State of Ohio and voters in Missouri and \nacross the country spoke loudly and clearly that they do not support \nmore of the same when the same simply has not worked. Clearly, the \nPresident has not listened to them. It is up to Congress to work \ntogether and up to Congress to work on a new direction for Iraq. We are \nwell served to remember that we stand in this room today at the will of \nthe American people. We have a duty to stand up to the President now as \nwe failed to do in sufficient numbers 4 years ago.\n  The same people who chose to start this war, who recklessly started \nthis war without the necessary resources, without the necessary \nplanning, without the necessary body armor--those people who ignored \nthe sage advice of military experts are the same people, with their \nsame tired advice, who want to escalate this war today. If we choose to \nignore history, we will be repeating a grave mistake.\n  This resolution does four important things.\n  First, this resolution reaffirms our continuous support of our men \nand women in uniform. Any official in our Government who says anything \nother than that is playing to the crowd, is disingenuous at best. Our \ntroops have done everything we have asked of them in Iraq. They have \nacted heroically. They have done their job. Some have said that if we \ndo not support the President's plans, we are unpatriotic. They say we \ndon't support the troops. Every Member of this body supports the brave \nmen and women fighting in Iraq. Every Member of the Senate who stands \nup and speaks out in this war is demonstrating patriotism. Patriotism \nisn't a yes-man; it is love for our country. Fighting against more of \nthe same in Iraq when more of the same is not working is what \npatriotism looks like.\n  Second, this resolution answers the demand of the American people to \nredeploy our troops out of Iraq. The President's original plan for Iraq \nhas not worked, and his most current plan for escalation is neither new \nnor different. We must have a timetable for redeployment of U.S. forces \nor, at the very least, a plan for it--something the administration has \nsimply failed to do.\n  Third, this resolution calls for a comprehensive strategy using \ndiplomacy--something else the administration has failed to do.\n  Fourth, and perhaps most important, this resolution calls for \noversight. The abdication of oversight and accountability in past \nCongresses is nothing short of shameful. The administration says the \ncurrent plan for escalation will require 20,000 troops and will cost \n$5.6 billion. The Congressional Budget Office tells a different story. \nIn the past, the President could put those numbers out there and nobody \nwould call him on that--nobody in this body who had any ability to do \noversight. Instead of the 20,000 troops and the $5.6 billion this \nPresident claims it costs, the Congressional Budget Office said the \nrequirement will be 48,000 troops and the price tag will be $27 \nbillion. Again, more of the same is not the answer.\n  We have the duty to heed the call of those who sent us to Congress, \nand with this resolution we have the opportunity to heed that call. If \nthe President will not listen to the voters, if the President will not \nlisten to his generals, if the President will not listen to the Iraq \nStudy Group, if the President\n\n[[Page S3110]]\n\nwill not listen to his own National Intelligence estimate, then we must \nmake him listen to us as the people's representatives.\n  Let us work today toward sending a clear message to the President and \nto the world that the era of congressional willful ignorance is over. \nWe will hold the President accountable, and we will start today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this has been an interesting debate. I \nhave had the opportunity to watch some of it and listen to more of it. \nI think we are finally debating a very important subject.\n  From time to time, there is a tendency to treat the serious too \nlightly and the light too seriously here on the floor of the Senate. \nThis is a serious matter being treated seriously. Our country is at \nwar. Today, we have young men and women in America's military uniforms \nwalking down alleyways and streets in Baghdad and other dangerous \nplaces in Iraq, risking their lives. Some, perhaps today, will give \ntheir lives. War is a serious subject, the most serious subject for our \ncountry.\n  I wish to talk a little about the history of how we have gotten to \nthis place and what I think we should do.\n  I recall Memorial Day, shortly after 9/11. I believe it was the first \nMemorial Day after 9/11--perhaps the second--when a young man whom I \nhad previously appointed to West Point came back. He was missing an \narm, from combat.\n  We had, of course, gone to Afghanistan, waging a war against the \nTaliban that had housed and harbored al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, and \nthen shortly thereafter we went to the country of Iraq.\n  This young man, who came from a small town in North Dakota and whom I \nwas privileged to send to the West Point Academy, came back missing an \narm but enormously proud of having served his country. I recall \nspeaking at the outdoor event at the veterans cemetery. He was there. \nHe spoke. I was enormously proud of him. He was proud of serving his \ncountry.\n  I guess I described a verse I heard some long while ago--I don't even \nknow the author--that:\n\n       When the drums are heard and the lightning is seen and the \n     knives are out,\n       The patriots are always there, ready to fight and die for \n     their country if necessary.\n\n  We can name many patriots in this country who serve today and who \nhave served this country--in world wars, conflicts--who serve today \nbecause our country asks them to serve. It is always the case that old \nmen send young men and women to war. Wars might be different if the \nages were reversed, but they are not.\n  The question for me today is, What are our goals? My guess is every \nperson serving in this Chamber, every man and woman, every Republican \nand Democrat, every conservative and liberal, wants the same thing for \nthis country. We want our country to succeed. We are on our side, we \nare on the side of right, we are on the side supporting the greatest \ncountry that exists on this Earth.\n  We made some serious mistakes. We went to Afghanistan. That was the \nright thing to do. It was, after all, Afghanistan that housed Osama bin \nLaden, who boasted about committing the terrorist acts of 9/11, \nmurdering thousands of innocent Americans. They boasted about that. \nThey said, ``We did it.'' Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, al-Zarqawi--``We \ndid it,'' they said. They were in Afghanistan, so we went to \nAfghanistan and toppled the Taliban government of Afghanistan, and the \nleadership of al-Qaida escaped. The leadership of al-Qaida went, \napparently, to the hills in northern Pakistan.\n  Then, with President Bush's direction, went to Iraq.\n  A great deal of top-secret information was disclosed to those of us \nin Congress and some to the American people. The Secretary of State \nmade a lengthy presentation with charts and slides to the United \nNations, a presentation to the world. It turns out much of the \nintelligence upon which that was based was fundamentally wrong, some of \nit embarrassingly inaccurate.\n  One single source, someone who we now know the Germans thought to \nhave been a drunk and a fabricator, was used by the administration to \nsuggest that Iraq threatened our country because it had mobile chemical \nweapons labs. This source, called ``Curveball,'' whom we now know to \nhave been a single source and a source who lied, was the basis for \nsubstantial allegations to the Congress and the American people about \nevidence of a weapon of mass destruction program in Iraq. The source \nfor yellow cake from Niger turns out to have been forged papers. \nEquipment to recreate a nuclear weapons program in the form of aluminum \ntubes--the Secretary of State and others gave us information about \nthat, information that is now public but was imparted to us in top-\nsecret sessions without disclosing something she was responsible to \ndisclose: There were other parts of the Government that said no, these \nare not aluminum tubes to reconstitute a nuclear program, they are not \nthat at all. They are thought to be for use in rocketry, and that is \nexactly what we found out later to be the case. Very substantial \nmistakes were made but, nonetheless, we cannot turn back the clock. \nAmerican soldiers were committed.\n  As a result of that, a number of things have happened in the country \nof Iraq. While the terrorists fled to Pakistan and Osama bin Laden and \nal-Zarqawi and the other leadership of the al-Qaida organization hid in \nnorthern Pakistan, now some over 2,000 days since they boasted about \nmurdering thousands of Americans--while that was the case, we went to \nIraq.\n  Saddam Hussein was deposed. This man was a butcher. We have unearthed \nmass graves in Iraq that housed hundreds of thousands of skeletons of \npeople murdered by the Saddam Hussein regime. Is it a worthy thing to \nhave deposed a leader of Iraq with that kind of record? Yes. Saddam \nHussein is gone. He was executed. The Iraqi people have now voted for \ntheir own Constitution. They wrote it and supported it. The Iraqi \npeople have now elected their own government by their own hand. So \nthere is no dictator, they have a Constitution, and they have a new \ngovernment.\n  The problem at the moment is they are not able to provide for their \nown security. In fact, there is a civil war occurring in the country of \nIraq. We have just received the latest National Intelligence Estimate--\nthe latest National Intelligence Estimate, which is a compilation of \nwhatever is said by the best minds that exist in the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  This is unclassified:\n\n       Iraq has become a self-sustaining intersectarian struggle.\n\n  If you take those words as part of what the National Intelligence \nEstimate says, this is a civil war. Now we end up with American \nsoldiers right smack dab in the middle of a civil war in Iraq while \nOsama bin Laden and the al-Qaida leadership exists in northern Pakistan \ndirecting al-Qaida's terrorist activities.\n  Now why does this matter? Let me describe why that is important. On \nJanuary 11, 2007, Mr. Negroponte who was then the Director of National \nIntelligence testified before Congress. He said:\n\n       Al Qaeda is the terrorist organization that possesses the \n     greatest threat to U.S. interests, including to our Homeland.\n\n  Let me say that again. What is the greatest threat to our country's \ninterests? Al-Qaida. That is not me; that is the head of American \nintelligence, Mr. Negroponte. This was reaffirmed 3 weeks ago by the \ncurrent head of U.S. intelligence. The greatest threat to our country, \nthe greatest terrorist threat to our country, is al-Qaida. They pose \nthe greatest threat to our interests and to our homeland.\n  Now an additional statement by Mr. Negroponte says this:\n\n       [Al Qaeda] continues to plot attacks against our homeland \n     and other targets with the objective of inflicting mass \n     casualties. And they continue to maintain active connections \n     and relationships that radiate outward from their leaders' \n     secure hideout in Pakistan to affiliates throughout the \n     Middle East, northern Africa and Europe.\n\n  All of this is a direct quote from the unclassified testimony of the \nhead of intelligence in our country. Al-Qaida is the greatest terrorist \nthreat to our country, No. 1; No. 2, they continue to plot attacks \nagainst our homeland from their leaders' secure hideout in Pakistan.\n  Now let me ask the question: What is the goal here? What is the goal \nfor this country? We were attacked on 9/11. Thousands of Americans were \nmurdered by airplanes full of fuel, used as\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\nguided missiles to fly into office buildings, to the Pentagon. We were \nattacked on 9/11 by al-Qaida. They boasted about it. They said: We did \nit. Give us credit. We murdered innocent Americans.\n  Where are they now, over 2,000 days later? They are, according to our \ntop intelligence experts, in a secure hideout in Pakistan with the \nobjective of inflicting mass casualties by continuing to plot attacks \nagainst our homeland.\n  So what are we doing today? We are in Iraq going house to house, in \nBaghdad, in the middle of a civil war.\n  What is the goal? Is our goal to fight terrorism? To take on the \nterrorists? To eliminate the terrorists? To eliminate the leadership of \nal-Qaida? Is it our goal to go after those who attacked our country and \nmurdered thousands of innocent Americans?\n  If that is our goal, let me ask this question: Why are they in a \nsecure hideaway in northern Pakistan and our soldiers are going house \nto house in a civil war in Iraq, in Baghdad? Why? Maybe it is not our \ngoal to fight the terrorists. Is it not our goal to take them on where \nthey are? Yes, there are some al-Qaida in Anbar Province in Iraq. This \nresolution, by the way, will allow us to redeploy in Iraq to make an \neven greater effort against that al-Qaida organization that exists in \nAnbar Province. But our National Intelligence Estimate is quite clear: \nWhat is happening in Iraq, in the main, outside of Anbar Province has \nvery little to do with al-Qaida and with terrorism. It has everything \nto do with a civil war and sectarian violence.\n  So the question is: What should be our goal? I very strongly believe \nwe should redeploy our troops and understand that our obligation is to \ntake on those interests that want to attack us in our homeland, those \ninterests that attacked us previously, those interests that represent \nthe greatest threat to our country as described by the head of U.S. \nintelligence.\n  Why on Earth on this day, Wednesday--2,010 days, nearly, following 9/\n11, after Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida boasted about launching attacks \nin our homeland and murdering the American people, murdering thousands \nof Americans--why on Earth would we not be in a full-court press to \nprosecute the war against terrorists? No, this situation in Iraq is not \na proxy against the war on terrorism. It is not. It cannot be described \nthat way.\n  The National Intelligence Estimate tells us it is sectarian violence, \nby and large. The head of national intelligence tells us where the head \nof the greatest threat to our country is in northern Pakistan, the \nleadership of al-Qaida. We are going door to door in Baghdad in the \nmiddle of a civil war, and they are in northern Pakistan promoting \ncontinued attacks against our homeland.\n  Is that a disconnect? It seems to me it is. Anybody in this Chamber \nwho stands up and has a strong passion and opinion about these issues, \nI respect. The last thing I would ever do is suggest they are not \npatriotic, they don't love their country, they do not support soldiers. \nAll nonsense. Every man and woman who aspires to come and serve, who is \nhere in this Chamber, I know loves this country, supports our soldiers, \nand wants our country to succeed. That is a fact. This is not about \nanybody having bad motives. It is about our country trying to make a \ndecision: Are we on the right path or the wrong path? Do we think the \nexperience we have had in Iraq--now that this has become a civil war, \nin which we have made very little progress but seen many Americans \nkilled and far more wounded--do we think that kind of situation can and \nshould continue, or should we say to the Iraqi people the following: We \nwant what is best for you as well. We have, with the blood and treasury \nof American soldiers and the American people, given you the following \nopportunities: You were able to get rid of Saddam Hussein. He does not \nexist anymore. He has been executed. You were able to write yourself a \nnew constitution and you were able to cast your votes for a new \ngovernment.\n\n  The question now is this: This is your country, not ours. Do you have \nthe will and the capability to provide for your own security? Iraq \nbelongs to you, not us. If you cannot provide for your own security, \nthe American taxpayer and the American soldiers cannot do that for a \nlong period of time and should not be asked to do that year after year \nafter year.\n  We ought to redeploy, and that redeployment ought to be so our \ncountry can wage war against terrorists. We know where they are. Our \nNational Intelligence Estimate and the head of the national \nintelligence organizations have told us. They are the greatest threat. \nWe know where they are. Yet my guess is they do not feel terribly \nthreatened today.\n  What is the goal? What is our goal here? I would hope our goal as a \ncountry is to decide to go after and eliminate those terrorists who \nplot attacks against our country.\n  Now there are many ways for us to manifest our love of country and \nour passion about these issues. But I think there is one other issue \nmost of us would agree upon. One of the concerns I have had about what \nis happening these days with respect to the Iraq war is we have sent \nsoldiers to war, but we have not asked our country to make a similar \ncommitment. Just this morning I asked the Chief of Staff of the Army at \na hearing, an Appropriations hearing, about a new personnel carrier we \nhave developed. They say it will reduce deaths from improvised \nexplosive devices by two-thirds in a country such as Iraq--new design, \nstronger, more capable. I asked: Were we ordering a lot of them? No, \nnot really. At today's pace it will take about 6 years to replace the \nexisting vehicles.\n  I chaired a democratic policy committee hearing last year, and \nretired Marine Colonel Hammes came to the hearing. He said: You know, \nin the Second World War, at the end we were producing 50,000 warplanes \na year.\n  Do you know why? Because our country, by God, decided the whole \ncountry was going to make an effort to go to war, to commit and to \nproduce and do everything there was to give our soldiers the \nopportunity to fight and win. We have not done that.\n  The Army has ordered 2,500 of those new armored personnel carriers \nsome estimate will save two-thirds of the lives that are now being lost \nto IEDs. Our country is told we are at war, you go ahead and go to the \nmall, go shopping. The soldiers will go to war. In fact, we won't ask \nyou to pay for anything either. We have now spent $450 billion, plus or \nminus. We are on the way to spending over $650 billion in Afghanistan \nand Iraq and the war on terrorism without asking the taxpayer to pay \none cent; add it to the debt. The country has not been asked to go with \nthe soldiers. There is no sacrifice. It is just the soldiers.\n  We have a resolution on the floor of the Senate. The resolution is \nS.J. Res. 9. I heard some of the debate a bit earlier. Some have \nsuggested this resolution is about cutting and running. People will \nthink we have left. I think most of the people in this world would take \na look at us and say this is the strongest country in the world. It has \ngot the biggest military in the world. We spend more money than any \nother country, any other series of countries, on defense. We spend more \nmoney than the top 30 countries combined on defense. Unbelievable.\n  We were attacked by the leadership of al-Qaida and their operatives \non \n9/11/2001. It is now 2007. They are still alive. Our national \nintelligence chief tells us where they are. They are still the greatest \nthreat to this country. They are still plotting attacks against our \ncountry. And we are this behemoth military Nation that has such \ncapability. Why are we not using that capability for the goal I think \nis preeminent, and that is the goal of protecting our country and \neliminating those who are plotting attacks against our country, the \nleadership of al-Qaida? The way to do that will not be to wait for \nPresident Bush to decide he wants to change course. He does not want to \nchange course. He wants to keep doing what we have been doing. But the \nway to change course is to pass the piece of legislation that says: Let \nus redeploy our troops.\n  Speaking only for me, I believe the redeployment ought to be to go \nafter the greatest threat that exists to this country's future, the \ngreatest threat described by our National Intelligence Estimate and the \nnational intelligence chief. It is not a surprise, not a secret. We all \nunderstand where that threat is. And yet we reduced our forces in \nAfghanistan early so we could invade\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\nIraq. Now we have got problems in Afghanistan. We have got bogged down \nin Iraq. We are now in the middle of a civil war in Iraq.\n  The greatest threat to our country's interests is in a secure \nhideaway in Pakistan; a secure hideaway. That ought never happen. The \nhead of intelligence in this country ought never be telling us there is \na secure hideaway for the organization that wants to destroy our \ncountry, to launch attacks against innocent Americans. There ought not \nbe a place that is secure on this planet for people who are doing that.\n  What is the goal? Is not the goal to fight terrorism, to take on the \nterrorists? If that is the case, then let's heed the words of the head \nof intelligence, to know where they are, what they are doing, who they \nare, and find a way to bring them to justice. The sooner the better. \nAfter nearly 5\\1/2\\ years, it is past time, long past time for us to \nset our sights on those who represent the greatest threat to our \ncountry. That is the reason I will support this resolution. This is \nabout redeployment. This is about establishing the goals we ought to \nhave as a country.\n  Finally, let me say this: I have enormous respect for the men and \nwomen serving in the military. They are an unbelievable bunch of young \nmen and women. I recall speaking to a helicopter crew in Afghanistan. \nThey were young men and women, average age 19, 20, 21, 22 years of age \nwho were keeping those helicopters in the air.\n  The officer said these are kids, but they are highly trained kids, \nhighly motivated kids, these young people. You go in the field and \nwatch what they do, and it is unbelievable. They love their country. \nWhen their country asks them to serve, they serve. But their country, \nit seems to me, owes them something too. Their country owes them the \nresponsibility of clear, thoughtful policies, the ability to address \nwhat is important to our country.\n  When we use military force, we ought to use military force not in the \nmiddle of a civil war some place, but instead use military force to \nconfront the terrorists who threaten America. That is what military \nforce ought to be used for at this point. We understand terrorism is \nawful. Most of us have never before understood there are plenty of \npeople out there who are willing to die themselves if they can kill a \nfew innocent people in order to make their point. That is something we \nhave never before understood very well. That is modern terrorism. We \nhave to confront that. We owe it to our soldiers to have a set of goals \nthat represent the best interests of this country.\n\n  So my hope, in short, is for us to be able to tell the Iraqis: This \nis your country, not ours. You need to provide for your own security. \nWe are going to give you a sufficient time to do that, but we cannot \nkeep American soldiers in the middle of a civil war for a great length \nof time. We intend to turn our attention to where it should have been \nall along; and that is, to confront the greatest threat that exists to \nour country, which is al-Qaida, its network around the world, and its \nplans to try to create terrorist acts in our homeland.\n  That ought to be our goal. The way to achieve that goal is through \nthe redeployment that would come with this legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I understand Senator Feinstein is on her \nway. As soon as she arrives, I will yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Fuel Efficiency Energy Act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to comment very briefly on \nlegislation that Senator Larry Craig of Idaho and I are introducing \ntoday. It is a bipartisan piece of energy legislation. I wish to \ndescribe it briefly.\n  We are in the process, this year, of trying to put together another \nEnergy bill. I am on the authorizing committee. So with the leadership \nof Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici and others of us on the \nauthorizing committee, we will try to write a new Energy bill. That \nbill has a lot to do with security--oil security, energy security but \nthe security of our country as well.\n  If we woke up some morning and terrorists had interrupted the supply \nof oil to our country, we would be in a desperate condition. On this \nEarth of ours, this planet, we stick straws in the planet and suck out \noil--about 84 million barrels of oil a day. Of the 84 million barrels a \nday that is taken out of this planet, 21 million barrels is used in the \nUnited States. One-fourth of all the oil is used in this little patch \nof ground called the United States.\n  Nearly 65 percent comes from outside our country, much of it from \nvery troubled parts of the world--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, \nVenezuela. We are desperately dependent on oil from other countries--\nagain, in many areas, troubled countries in the world.\n  We have to find a way to move toward energy independence. Senator \nCraig, a Republican, and I, a Democrat, have worked on a bipartisan \nbasis to introduce legislation that has been put together for nearly 2 \nyears now by an organization of retired business executives, retired \nmilitary officers, to talk about reducing the oil intensity in this \ncountry, especially dealing with transportation.\n  Nearly 70 percent of all the oil we use is used in transportation. We \nrun it right through our vehicles, by and large, and 70 percent of it \nis used in the transportation sector; and that line is going up, up--\nway up. We need to find ways to address this issue of our unbelievable \ndependence on foreign oil and the substantial increase in oil intensity \nin the transportation sector.\n  So we are introducing a piece of legislation that does a lot of \nthings. A, it demands that vehicles be more efficient. And we are not \nleaving out any vehicles. This includes big trucks. Get a car these \ndays and compare it to a car you would have purchased 10 years ago--\nidentical models--and what you will find, I bet, is there has not been \none bit of progress in fuel efficiency in 10 years.\n  Oh, the car company will say: That is not true. This is much more \nefficient. It is heavier, but you get the same gas mileage, even though \nyou are actually pulling more weight. That is all baloney. The fact is, \nin terms of how much oil we use, we are not making any progress on \nefficiency. As a result of that, I believe, finally, it is long past \nthe time when we ought to demand increases in the efficiency in our \nvehicle fleet.\n  Second, we believe we are going to have to find additional oil. I \nunderstand that digging and drilling, which I call ``yesterday \nforever'' as an energy strategy, is not the only strategy, but we do \nhave to find some additional oil. We believe we should open up \nadditional lands in the Gulf of Mexico, where the substantial quantity \nexists. We would do it by protecting beaches and protecting the \nviewshed, but there is substantial energy there we ought to be able to \nget.\n  Third: a dramatic increase in renewable energy. Yes, cellulosic \nethanol, biodiesel, and a whole series of areas of achieving \nsubstantial additional renewable energy--all of that is achievable if \nwe decide as a country to establish that as a goal.\n  We believe doing a number of things, some of which are very \ncontroversial, to both increase production and decrease use--that is \nthrough conservation and efficiency--can move us to a much less oil-\nintensive economy.\n  Now, there is more to do. The larger, comprehensive bill will have to \ninclude the issues of electrogeneration and transmission, and all these \nother issues. We are dealing, in the legislation Senator Craig and I \nare introducing today, with the question of oil intensity in the \ntransportation sector, which is a very substantial part of our oil \nusage.\n  Now, we do not believe necessarily that somebody is going to say: \nWell, do you know what? Let's take this entire bill as it has been \nwritten and have a vote tomorrow. We understand that is not the way it \nworks. But we do believe it is important for us to take a hard look at \nthese energy issues from a security standpoint.\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\n  We talk about energy in many ways too casually. Our country runs on \nenergy. Especially the issue of oil is a very important issue because \nso much of it comes from off our shores. So much of it comes in \ncircumstances that we have very little control over.\n  From an energy standpoint, I was thinking the other day about a visit \nI had with our former colleague, John Glenn, who described to me, late \none night on an airplane as we were flying over the Pacific on our way \nto Asia--I was pumping him with questions because I was a young boy as \nI listened on the radio about his space flight. I was asking John about \nall of this, and I had read about the time when the city of Perth, \nAustralia, I think it was, decided to light every light bulb in the \ncity as a signal to this astronaut flying up there alone circling the \nEarth.\n  John Glenn told me, when I asked him the question: As you reached the \ndark side and looked, did you ever see Perth, Australia, because they \nlit all the lights of the town to signal you?--and he said he did. He \nlooked down.\n  The only evidence of life on Earth on the dark side was to see a \nshining light that was then Perth, Australia. But that light was, of \ncourse, a product of energy--energy produced by human beings to make \nlife better on this Earth. So now we come to the year 2007, living in \nthe greatest country on Earth--but an unbelievable, prodigious consumer \nof energy--in a situation where we do not have a secure energy supply, \nwith 60 to 65 percent of our oil coming from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, \nIraq, Venezuela, and other parts of the world where there is great \nturbulence.\n  So the question for this Congress is what to do about that. The \nanswer is, as is the case in all areas of security, we need to be \nconcerned and we need to take action to become less dependent and more \nindependent, to the extent we can, on foreign oil.\n  So working with a wide group of interests, with an organization that \nhas been working now for several years to put this plan together, \nSenator Craig and I are introducing this legislation today in the \nSenate. I wish to take a brief moment to comment about what that plan \nis.\n  We take--pretty much all of us take--energy for granted. We live a \ngreat life. For light, we simply turn on a switch. To move someplace, \nwe turn a key and gasoline flows from the tank, through the carburetor, \nthe fuel injector, and we do not think much about that. But it has \ngiven us a pretty unbelievable life. Through it all, we have never had \nto be very conscious about saving, economizing, efficiency, \nconservation, and we have not had to be as conscious as we should be \nnow about where oil comes from.\n  For that reason, we have introduced a piece of legislation that I \nthink has substantial merit. We will work with Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Domenici and others on the authorizing committee to incorporate \nthe provisions and the ideas that are represented in this plan as a new \napproach to energy in our country's future.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  I withhold the suggestion of an absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to particularly commend \nthe leader, Senator Reid, and the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Levin, for the work that has been done in putting \ntogether a resolution which, as much as possible, can meet some of the \nobjectives of the Democratic majority of this body at the present time. \nThat is not an easy task.\n  I think Members who participated in this effort took into \nconsideration that in less than a week our Nation will mark 4 years in \nIraq. We have spent nearly $400 billion. We have lost more than 3,000 \nAmericans. More than 140,000 of our own brave men and women find \nthemselves trying to salvage a situation that simply cannot be solved \nthrough military force.\n  If I believed there was any chance the military could solve the \nproblem of hundreds of years of hatred between Sunni and Shia by \nresolving what is effectively a civil war, I would believe this surge \nand more troops might solve this situation. But I do not.\n  The only solution rests with the Iraqi Government and the Shia \nmajority. The Iraq of today is embroiled in four different wars--a \nterribly complex civil conflict that even General Petraeus, our \ncommander in Iraq, says requires a political solution.\n  Simply put, there is no end in sight. Yet the President insists on \nescalating our troop presence there. None of this makes sense to me \nbecause I deeply believe we must change our course in Iraq. That is why \nI support the joint resolution before us today.\n  Where the administration expands our involvement in Iraq, this \nresolution sets a time limit. Where the administration sees a military \nsolution, this resolution recognizes that the solution must be \npolitical. Where the administration calls for more money and more \ntroops, this resolution says: Enough is enough. Where the \nadministration fails to put demands on the Iraqi Government, this \nresolution tells them: You must take responsibility for your own \nfuture.\n  The Iraqis must realize our commitment is not open-ended and they \nmust stand on their own. How can we ever expect that Iraqis will be \nable to stand up and make the political choices if we keep such a \nlarge, sustained American troop presence in Iraq? We become the buffer, \nthen, that prevents the solution. Only the Iraqis can choose to end \nthis civil war. Only the Iraqis can unify their country if, in fact, \nthe Shia majority want a unified Iraq. Yet this will never happen until \nwe begin to draw down our troop levels. This resolution does exactly \nthat. It is a vehicle for the Congress to show leadership, to tell the \nPresident that he has put us on the wrong course and that a political \nsolution is the key to this conflict.\n\n  This resolution sets us on that path. It spells out clear deadlines: \nThe phased redeployment of our combat forces must begin within 120 days \nof the resolution's passage. A goal of March 31, 2008, would be \nestablished for the redeployment of our combat forces out of Iraq. This \nresolution also redefines the mission. A smaller force could remain in \nIraq. The mission would be limited to force protection, training and \nequipping Iraqi troops, and targeted counterterrorism operations.\n  It is, in a way, similar to the resolution I introduced last month \nwhich set an expiration date for the 2002 authorization for the use of \nmilitary force in Iraq.\n  This resolution fills a void. It puts a long-term political, \ndiplomatic, and economic strategy for Iraq at the center of our \nnational policy. That is where I believe it should have been a long \ntime ago. It is consistent with the views of the American people, whose \nopposition to this war and this escalation or surge remains strong and \nsustained to this very day. But instead of following the will of the \nAmerican people, this administration is pursuing a surge in forces \nwhich appears to be growing. The administration has not set any limits \non the number of troops needed or on the duration of the mission or the \ncost to the American people.\n  In January, the President said he would send an additional 21,500 \ntroops to Iraq at a projected cost of $5.6 billion. Yet just this week \nthe White House asked the Congress for another $2.5 billion to pay for \nan additional 4,700 support troops for the surge in Iraq. The costs \nkeep rising.\n  The Pentagon initially said it would be only a matter of months \nbefore we could assess whether the surge was a success. I believe the \nnew Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, said we should know within 4 \nmonths whether this surge is successful. But the commanders on the \nground now suggest we may have to sustain the escalation until well \ninto next year. Yet it is clear our military is under such strain that \nthe only way to maintain those 20 brigades is by extending the \ndeployment of many of our soldiers in Iraq, and by making many more \ndeploy overseas much earlier than planned.\n  We are breaking our own military in Iraq, even as it becomes \nincreasingly evident that success cannot be achieved militarily.\n  Just consider these facts. More than 420,000 troops have been \ndeployed at least twice; 420,000 men and women have been deployed \ntwice. More than 50,000 troops have had their tours extended through \n``stop-loss'' orders. Troops are being rushed into the field without \nproper training and without\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\nenough armor. We are leaning more and more heavily on the National \nGuard. Yet 90 percent of the Guard units in the United States are rated \n``not ready.''\n  I understand why the President may wish to talk about ``encouraging \nsigns'' in Iraq. But the facts show otherwise. Even while the violence \nin Baghdad has decreased, violence outside the capital has increased. \nTwo hundred Shia pilgrims have been killed in just the past week alone. \nAs insurgents have left Baghdad to avoid the ongoing military \ncrackdown, they have simply melted away into outlying regions, waiting \nfor the pressure to ease.\n  What makes anybody think this will be any different by the end of \nthis year, the middle of next year, or the end of next year, or any \nother time? While more American soldiers deploy to Baghdad, the Iraqis \nhave yet to provide all the troops they promised.\n  There is no end in sight. This joint resolution changes that. It \nchanges course. It redefines the mission. I urge the Senate to vote for \nit.\n  I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to everyone, especially those \nwho were planning on going to visit with the President of Mexico with \nme on Friday. I have had a longstanding appointment with the President \nto talk about issues important to our country, but we are now in the \nmidst of this debate dealing with Iraq and, following that, the U.S. \nattorneys. I have told everyone that we weren't going to have votes on \nFriday, and that was really my intention because I was going to be out \nof the country with five of my colleagues. I haven't had a chance to \nspeak to any of the five Senators who are traveling with me. But I \nthink it is only fair at this time that I cancel my trip, and that is \nthe reason I am addressing the Senate now. My trip is canceled as of \nnow.\n  I don't hold any ill will toward anyone. Senator McConnell has worked \nwith me every half hour today trying to work something out, so this is \nnot any finger pointing in any way. I just want the Record to reflect \nthat I think we will work something out so we will not have to be in \nsession on Friday, but I don't want anyone thinking that any of my work \ntoward completing everything we need to do here by tomorrow is based \nupon my trip because that is not it. I want to make sure that everyone \nis free. I will be talking to my colleagues independently and telling \nthem that we will try to do this some other time. But I think I would \nbe judged very poorly if during the midst of this debate on the most \nimportant issue facing the American people--Iraq and then the issue we \nare also trying to resolve, and that is the U.S. attorneys problem--\nthat my trip got in the way of that at all.\n\n  Again, I want the Record to reflect that the Republican leader has \nbeen a gentleman throughout. It is not his fault in any way. I hold no \none to blame. I just want to make sure that as negotiations go forward \nfrom this minute, they are based on what is best for the Senate and has \nnothing to do with my trip. I will continue to work, I tell all my \ncolleagues, both on the majority and the minority side, with the \ndistinguished Republican leader to do everything we can so that we \ndon't have votes on Friday, but we may not be able to do that. I think \nwe can, but we may not be able to. If we can't work something out on a \nconsent to finish this Iraq debate in some positive manner, then we \nwould have to have--I would have to move to cloture tomorrow night some \ntime, at 6 or 7 o'clock. But I will continue to work on this, and I \napologize. Even though I had one of my staff a few minutes ago call the \nMexican Ambassador to say that we would likely not be able to do that \ntrip, and now we are not going to be able to do the trip, I will call \nthe President of Mexico and tell him there will be other times to do \nthis trip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just echo the remarks of the \nmajority leader. I see that Senator Warner is now on the Senate floor. \nHe and I had a conversation at noon about a proposal he hoped to offer. \nIt is my understanding, I would say to my friend, the majority leader, \nthat his proposal has just been handed to us. That was the reason for \nthe delay this afternoon, with all due respect to the Senator from \nVirginia. I know he was working on drafting it, but that is the reason \nwe have not been able to hopefully get to the point of having an \nagreement, which the majority leader and I both would like to have.\n  We are ready for this debate, and now that Senator Warner is on the \nSenate floor and has his proposal, we will give a copy to the majority, \nand I will be able to see it myself, and hopefully, shortly, we will be \nable to enter into an agreement that will be satisfactory to both \nsides. Certainly, that is my hope and my expectation.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I say the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky is exactly right. I am doing my very best, in consultation \nwith Senator Nelson and other Members, to try to prepare this document. \nIt is now in draft form. I would hope it could be concluded very \nshortly. So I plead guilty to the facts, and I apologize to the \ndistinguished leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Predatory Lending\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to address one of the largest \nproblems plaguing our home buyers today; that is, predatory lending. \nOver the past few days, the Wall Street Journal has written a number of \narticles about abuses in the subprime lending industry prompting a much \nneeded crackdown on dishonest practices and deceitful lending. In \naddition, on Tuesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that \nthe number of new foreclosures reported during the fourth quarter of \n2006 reached the highest level in 40 years. Not surprisingly, \nforeclosure and delinquency rates were highest among subprime lenders.\n  Mr. President, enough is enough. The recent scandal at the New \nCentury Financial Corporation, one of the largest subprime lenders, is \na final straw. As the Wall Street Journal describes in one instance, an \nelderly woman was struggling to make her $952 monthly mortgage payments \nwhen a mortgage broker called and offered her a ``senior citizen's \nloan'' from New Century Financial. They told her she wouldn't need to \nmake payments for years. Well, she didn't get years. Instead, her \nmonthly payment skyrocketed to $2,200 per month, more than double her \nincome. With the assistance of a lawyer, she escaped foreclosure, but \nmany others are not as fortunate. This is a prime example of the \nconsumer exploitation occurring in subprime lending, and it is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Unfortunately, there are many more examples. Unscrupulous predatory \nlenders prey upon the innocent and unsuspecting. We know these lenders \nare more likely to target women, racial minorities, and the elderly. In \nfact, a recent academic study by the University of Denver found that \nmore than 130 million Americans without prime credit scores--the type \nyou need to get a low-cost loan--are disproportionately African \nAmerican and Hispanic. How can we sit by while these groups are not \nonly being robbed of their savings but robbed of their dream? For many, \nhome ownership is the key to making the American dream a reality.\n  I have been a longtime advocate for increasing home ownership in \nunderserved and minority communities. More and more Hispanics, for \nexample, are realizing their dream of home ownership, with more than 50 \npercent of all Hispanics in the country owning homes. But when an \naverage of 63 percent of Hispanic household wealth comes from ownership \nequity alone--the highest percentage of any group--it becomes clear the \npower that home ownership has to bring more families out of poverty, \nincrease safety in our\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\nneighborhoods, and help make the American dream a reality for all.\n  I have worked to create innovative mortgage products to help more \npeople achieve their dream of home ownership, and I strongly believe we \nshould not act in such a way that we dry up access to capital and \nmortgage options for those who are legitimately prepared to take on the \nresponsibilities of home ownership. There are legitimate lenders who \nfill that need, and we should continue to work with them to preserve \nsafe and secure loan options for consumers.\n  Unfortunately, predatory lending is making a mockery of the home-\nownership dream for far too many individuals. Ironically, however, \ndeceitful subprime lenders are living the dream. They are making \nenormous amounts, often making millions in profits. They do that by \nundermining the very essence of that dream for so many in our country. \nLast year, subprime loans totaled about $605 billion, which is one-\nfifth of the total overall market for U.S. home loans. We simply cannot \nignore this segment of the market which serves some of the most \nvulnerable populations, including women, seniors, and minorities.\n  Many Americans listening probably think they could never be a victim \nof these predatory lenders. Judging from their financial success and \nthe significant impact their practices are having on the stock market \nand the economy as a whole, it is clear that far too many Americans are \nfalling victim, in many instances through no fault of their own. In \ncommunities across America, people are losing their homes and their \ninvestments because of predatory lenders. Let me take a moment to list \ntheir tactics.\n  Deceptive subprime lenders encourage borrowers to lie about their \nincome, expenses, or cash available for downpayments in order to get a \nloan. They approve loan applications in which the income fields have \nbeen left blank. They knowingly lend more money than a borrower could \npossibly afford to repay. Furthermore, these lenders tell borrowers \nthey have no other chance of getting a loan or owning a home. For many \nwho dream of home ownership, it is hard to ignore. Home buyers are \nasked to sign sales contracts or loan documents that are blank or that \ncontain information which isn't true. They sign forms where the cost-\nof-loan terms at closing are not what they agreed to.\n  The lenders' tactics are deceptive, and their words are convincing. \nIt is no wonder many Americans have fallen into the trap. That is why I \nbelieve those who engage in predatory lending practices must be held \naccountable. We should no longer sit by while our communities are being \ntargeted by these individuals and companies. We must address predatory \nlending through vigorous enforcement of safety and soundness standards, \nconsumer protection, financial education programs, and credit \ncounseling. Well-informed consumers are less likely to be the victims \nof predatory lenders and more likely to make better choices. However, \nat the same time, there are market forces that absolutely, without a \ndoubt, prey upon the innocent and unsuspecting.\n  I would have preferred to have the industry fix this situation, but I \npersonally am no longer willing to wait. This has been going on far too \nlong. Time has run out, and I believe we need a legislative solution. \nAs a member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, I \nlook forward to working with the chairman of the committee, Senator \nDodd, to address predatory lending and to develop a solution that will \nprotect the Nation's home buyers.\n  I wish to assure the American people, those who are currently \nstruggling to pay their mortgage and those who are looking to own a \nhome, that I will not rest until they are protected against the claws \nof predatory lenders. Enough is enough. American consumers deserve safe \nand secure mortgage options and new protections against predatory \nlending.\n  Finally, for those across the country who believe this is an issue \nwhich affects just homeowners or minority communities or those who \nshould know better, I say ``think again.'' As today's Wall Street \nJournal reports, this issue has a chilling rippling effect across our \nNation's economy, leading to sharp declines in the stock market and a \nsense that we are ``kind of back to panic mode,'' according to one \neconomist quoted in the article. So don't be fooled. This is a serious \nissue which has far-reaching effects across our economy. Without prompt \naction, we put not only more individuals at risk of deceitful predatory \nlending practices but we put our financial markets and our economy at \nrisk as well. The time to act is now, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to do just that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak against S.J. Res. 9.\n  Today, the Senate gathers once again to debate the war in Iraq. This \nis a debate which has been at the center of our national politics--\nindeed, of our national consciousness--for 4 years now. As everyone \nhere knows, we are now in the thick of the battle for Baghdad, a \ncritical battle where the outcome hangs in the balance.\n  A new commander, GEN David Petraeus, has taken command, having been \nconfirmed by the Senate 81 to 0 just a few weeks ago. A new strategy is \nbeing put into action, with new troops being deployed into Baghdad. The \nquestion we in the Senate now confront is simple: Will Congress give \nGeneral Petraeus and his troops a chance to succeed?\n  This joint resolution before us would deny them that chance, forcing \nour troops to break off the battle of Baghdad in 120 days without \nregard to how they are doing. Instead of providing General Petraeus \nwith the necessary reinforcements he has requested, the reinforcements \nhe is, indeed, counting on, this resolution would strip troops away \nfrom him in the middle of the battle. That makes no sense. It is why \nEisenhower famously once said: ``Anyone who sets a deadline in war \ndoesn't understand war.''\n  We need to be clear with ourselves and with the Nation. The joint \nresolution we are debating would impose a fixed date for the beginning \nof a withdrawal from Iraq. In just 120 days after this legislation \nwould be passed, American forces would be required by law to begin \nredeploying out of Iraq. This would happen regardless of conditions on \nthe ground, regardless of the recommendations of General Petraeus, \nregardless of the opinions of our allies in Iraq and throughout the \nregion, and regardless of whether security is then improving or \ndeteriorating. It would bind the hands of General Petraeus, \nsubstituting the judgment of Congress today for the judgment of our \nmilitary commanders, our diplomats, and our friends in the region 120 \ndays from now.\n\n  Congress has been given many great responsibilities by our \nConstitution, but the daily micromanagement of war is not one of them. \nIn fact, the proponents of this resolution, as I listen to them, make \nno attempt to justify why 120 days from now is exactly the right time \nto commence a withdrawal. Perhaps that is because there is no military \nor strategic logic at work. This is a deadline which is as arbitrary as \nit is inflexible. It specifically denies a great American general, \nDavid Petraeus, the room for decisive leadership, which history tells \nus any successful commander must have. Surely we know better than this. \nSurely we cannot think this is a path to success or security.\n  I have heard opponents of the current strategy insist that our troops \nshould not be there ``policing a civil war.'' Well, that position, that \nstatement would come as a surprise to the soldiers who have been \nserving in Bosnia and Kosovo over the past decade, first stopping and \nnow policing a civil war--in fact, two of them. They were correctly, \nwisely dispatched there by a Democratic President, with the support of \nDemocrats in Congress, the support of many of the same colleagues of \nmine who are today calling for this withdrawal.\n  I ask you, my friends, what has changed? Has security worsened in \nIraq since the new strategy began? Has the political situation \ndeteriorated? Have you lost confidence in General Petraeus, whom we \nconfirmed just a few weeks ago? I think the answer to all those \nquestions is no.\n  So I would ask: If we were to stop our legislative debating and \nmaneuvering for a moment and actually look at what is happening in \nBaghdad right now, what would we see? We would see that sectarian \nfighting between Sunnis and Shiites is down in districts in Baghdad \nwhere American and Iraqi\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\nforces have entered. That is according to General Petraeus' senior \ncounterinsurgency adviser. We would see that Muqtada al-Sadr has \ndisappeared, that many of his top lieutenants have been arrested, and \nthat his mighty army, which terrorized much of Baghdad for the last \nyear, has gone to ground. We would also see signs of political \nprogress, including the passage of the new oil law by the Iraqi \nCabinet, renewed talks by Sunni insurgent leaders about reconciliation, \nand even word of an impending Government shakeup involving the removal \nof some Ministers in the current Government. Finally, if we stopped and \nstepped back from the debate here in Washington and looked at what is \nhappening on the ground in Baghdad and in Iraq, in Anbar, right now, we \nwould see that the military surge has made possible a critically \nimportant diplomatic surge, as representatives from neighboring \ncountries gathered in Baghdad last weekend in the first of a series of \nsuch regional conferences.\n  I don't know if this progress will lead to ultimate success in Iraq, \nto victory over extremism and terrorism there, to a victory for \ndemocracy and hope for an alternative path in the Arab world to the \ndeath and suicide and hatred al-Qaida offers, but I can tell you that \nwhat is happening in Iraq today certainly does not look like failure to \nme. In fact, it looks like some progress is being made as a result of \nthis new strategy in Baghdad and in Anbar--preliminary but encouraging \nprogress.\n  So why, in the face of these developments, would the Senate possibly \nadopt a resolution such as this? Why, in the face of these encouraging \ndevelopments that suggest this new plan might well be working, would \nthis Chamber demand that it end? Why, just weeks after confirming \nGeneral Petraeus, would this Chamber block him from carrying out the \nstrategy he shaped and is now successfully implementing?\n  There is only one understandable reason for Congress to impose this \nkind of deadline to begin a withdrawal, and that is if we were \nabsolutely convinced the Petraeus strategy is doomed to failure. The \nonly way a timetable for withdrawal makes sense is if there is no \nglimmer of hope that General Petraeus and the troops serving under him \ncan succeed. I submit that is simply not a conclusion justified by the \nfacts on the ground in Iraq today.\n  We are in a long and difficult war. We know that. The price paid by \nour heroic soldiers and their families has been heavy. I recognize that \nit is a war in which we have made mistakes, some of them serious, and \nin which we have experienced exacerbating, heartbreaking, infuriating \nsetbacks. It is a war that has stirred the anger and frustration of the \nAmerican people, feelings that are justified. What is not justified, \nhowever, is for Congress to let the passions and politics of the moment \nblind us to what is happening on the ground in Iraq today and what is \non the line for our security tomorrow.\n  Our decisionmaking should be driven by the real-world conditions in \nBaghdad, not by the political mindset here in Washington. This joint \nresolution before this Chamber fails that test, and that is why it \nshould fail to pass the Senate. General Petraeus has said he will be \nable to advise us, the President, the Nation, whether his plan is \nsucceeding by the end of this summer. Until then, let me suggest an \nalternative course for Congress. Let me suggest we declare a truce in \nthe Washington wars over the war in Iraq. For the next 6 months, let's \nlet our troops and the Iraqi forces fight with our support and without \nus sending them mixed messages. Let us, instead, across party lines, in \nthis Senate and in the House, come together around a constructive \nlegislative agenda for our security in the world, including in Iraq, \nauthorizing an increase in the size of the Army and Marines; funding \nthe equipment and protection for our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \nworldwide; monitoring progress on the ground in Iraq with oversight \nhearings, investigating contract procedures being followed in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and guaranteeing Iraq war veterans receive the first-class \ntreatment and care they deserve when they come home.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to think hard about what we are doing and what \nthis resolution asks us to do. I ask you to look carefully, not at the \npublic opinion polls in Washington or throughout America, but at the \nrealities on the ground in Iraq and to think about the consequences of \na forced withdrawal and failure there. I ask you to step back from this \npath and to vote against this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, recently in my home State of Vermont, the \nVermont State Senate, with a very strong vote, passed a resolution in \nopposition to the war in Iraq and demanding that our troops come home \nas soon as possible. It is appropriate our legislature has done that \nbecause in Vermont we have paid a very high price for this war. In \nfact, in terms of per capita loss, the State of Vermont is higher, \ntragically, than any other State in this country.\n  In my home State of Vermont, and I believe all across this country, \nthe American people are deeply concerned about the war. They want real \ndebate here in Washington on the issue and, most importantly, they want \nreaction. That is why I will vote for cloture on S.J. Res. 9 and why I \nwill then proceed, if I am allowed to, if the Republicans allow us to \ncast that vote, to vote for this resolution.\n  Let me say a word about the resolution itself, which is very clear \nand to my mind directly addresses the central concerns of the majority \nof Americans who, in the elections last November, made it as clear as \nthey could that they want a new course in Iraq. They do not want more \nof the same, they want a new direction.\n  The joint resolution we are debating backs our troops, it fully \nsupports our troops, but recognizes that circumstances in Iraq have \nchanged dramatically and most importantly establishes a goal of \nremoving U.S. combat troops by March 2008.\n  It requires the troop redeployment out of Iraq begin no later than 4 \nmonths after the legislation is enacted. The goal it sets of \nredeploying most of our troops out of Iraq, March 31, 2008, happens to \nbe the very same date proposed by the bipartisan and well-respected \nBaker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group. So this follows very closely the line \nof thought of the Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group.\n  It allows troops to remain in Iraq for three purposes: to protect \nAmericans still working on Iraqi reconstruction, to train the Iraqi \npolice and their military, and to engage in counterterrorism \noperations.\n  In my view, President Bush's war in Iraq has been an unmitigated \ndisaster. It is a war many of us understood we should never have gotten \ninto in the first place. It is a war this administration was totally \nunprepared to fight, where some people in the administration were \ntalking about how the Iraqis would be throwing flowers at our troops--\nnot roadside bombs but flowers--and that our troops would be coming \nhome after a ``cakewalk,'' in a couple of months.\n  That was what they were talking about. It is a war that unfortunately \nand tragically has cost us terribly in terms of American blood. As of \ntoday, we have lost almost 3,200 brave American soldiers, almost 24,000 \nmore have been wounded. Let me tell you very clearly that the evidence \nis overwhelming that tens of thousands more of these brave soldiers \nfighting in Iraq are going to be coming home with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder or coming back home with traumatic brain injury. That is the \nreality of what this war has cost us up to now.\n  This at a time when we do not have the funding to adequately take \ncare of our veterans, as we have seen at Walter Reed, at a time when \nmiddle-class families cannot afford to send their kids to college, at a \ntime when this Nation has the highest rate of childhood poverty in the \nindustrialized world, at a time when hunger in America is substantially \nincreasing. This war, with the President's proposed increase, will cost \nus some $500 billion and that price tag is going up by $8 billion every \nmonth.\n  This cost is not only going to take money away from the pressing \nneeds of the middle-class and working families of this country, but it \nis going to add to the $8.5 trillion national debt which this country \ncurrently has.\n  This is a war that has caused unspeakable horror for the people of \nIraq--not just for our families who have suffered losses but for the \npeople of Iraq. People who had suffered so long\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\nunder the horrendous brutality of the Saddam Hussein dictatorship are \nsuffering even more today. We are looking at a nation in the process of \ndisintegration. That is Iraq today. There are estimates that hundreds \nof thousands of Iraqis have been killed--some estimates go as high as \n500,000--and almost 2 million Iraqis have fled their own country. In \nfact, anyone in Iraq who has any money at all, anyone who is part of \nthe middle class, is trying to get out of that country as quickly as \npossible, and about 8 percent of Iraqis have had to flee their own \ncountry.\n  As I speak, President Bush is returning from a trip to Latin America. \nWherever he spoke, he encountered massive protests. In country after \ncountry he discovered that people in Latin America hold our Nation in \nextremely low esteem, largely because of his ill-advised decision to \ninvade Iraq and the disastrous way in which the Iraq occupation has \nbeen managed. That is certainly true not just in Latin America, it is \ntrue all over the world. How are we, as the most powerful military \nforce in the world, going to be able to lead the world in the very \nimportant fight against international terrorism and Islamic extremism \nwhen in country after country leaders do not want to identify with us \nbecause of the policies of the President of the United States.\n\n  In the days immediately following\n9/11, the world rallied around the United States when we were \ngrievously attacked; not just leaders but the huge majority of people \nin nations all over the world expressed their support and expressed \ntheir concern for the United States. They were on our side, not just \nfor reasons of compassion but understanding that we had to work \ntogether as a planet, as a civilized world in addressing the attacks of \nextremists and fundamentalists and terrorists. We had to work together \nand the United States was prepared to play a leadership role.\n  Tragically, that reality is no longer the case. We are now held in \nlower esteem internationally than ever before in the modern history of \nAmerica. That is not just a bad thing in the sense of our young people \ngoing to Europe and finding out they are not respected or that our \ncountry is not respected, it is a bad thing if we are serious about \ntrying to develop an international consensus to fight the very serious \nproblem of international terrorism.\n  Tragically, the Bush administration has refused to listen to the \nAmerican people who, in the national election this past November, made \nit very clear they want a new direction in Iraq and they want this war \nwound down. They did not vote for an escalation in this war, they voted \nto wind down the war. This administration has not only not listened to \nthe American people, they have refused to listen to the thoughtful \nsuggestions of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. This administration has \nrefused to listen to the advice of our military leaders in Iraq who \nhave told us that increasing troops from the United States would make \nit easier for the Iraqi Government and military to avoid their \npolitical and military responsibilities: Why make the hard political \ndecisions? Why make the hard financial decisions? You don't have to do \nthat. Uncle Sam is there to provide you with the troops. The American \ntaxpayer is there to provide you with the money. You don't have to make \nthose choices.\n  This administration has not only refused to listen to the American \npeople, to our military, to the Iraq Study Group, perhaps most \nimportantly they have refused to listen to the Iraqi people themselves \nwho, according to a number of polls, tell us very strongly they believe \nthat in the midst of all of the chaos, all of the horror that is taking \nplace in their country, they would be more safe, they would be more \nsecure if our troops left their country.\n  If President Bush will not listen to anybody, including the American \npeople, including former generals, including the Iraq Study Group, \nincluding international public opinion, then it is up to Congress to \ntell him it is time to move in a new direction in Iraq. In the 2006 \nelections, in my view, the people of Vermont and of this Nation told us \nthey wanted Congress to begin asserting its constitutional authority \nover this war and that they wanted us to rein in this administration. \nMost important, they told us they wanted us to begin the process of \nbringing our troops home as soon as possible. As a Vermont Senator, \nthat is exactly the effort I intend to make. We must bring our troops \nhome instead of leaving them to be embattled referees of a civil war \nthat only the Iraqis--not our brave soldiers--can stop.\n  Iraq's Government and its military must step up and accept their \npolitical and military responsibilities. As the Baker-Hamilton \ncommission said, that will only happen when we insist that the Iraqis \nand not American troops are responsible for the future of Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Charles Curtis \nJohnson, or ``CC'' as he is known to friends, on his retirement from \nthe U.S. Capitol Police after nearly 32 years of dedicated service.\n  Sergeant Johnson started his career with the Capitol Police in 1974. \nFor more than 14 years, he performed a variety of law enforcement \nduties as a member of the Capitol Division. In 1992, Mr. Johnson was \nnamed administrative sergeant and started working with the First \nResponder Unit that protects the Capitol grounds. By 1998, Mr. Johnson \nwas promoted to sergeant and supervised the officers that protect the \nHouse and Senate Chambers.\n  In 2004, Sergeant Johnson earned a post as one of the supervisors of \nthe Horse Mounted Unit. This elite unit is well known for its rigorous \ntraining requirements, and Sergeant Johnson passed these tests with \nease. After his work on the Horse Mounted Unit, Sergeant Johnson was \npromoted to the Patrol/Mobile Response Division. He served there until \nhis retirement, marking a long career of dedication to the Capitol \nPolice Force.\n  Sergeant Johnson is also the devoted husband of a fellow Capitol \nPolice officer, Captain Shirley Jo Johnson. Together, they have raised \nfour children, and are the proud grandparents of four grandchildren. \nThere is no doubt that his family can be proud of his example of \nprofessionalism and sense of duty to others.\n  As Senate majority leader, and a former Capitol Police officer, I \nhave the greatest respect for the fine men and women of the Capitol \nPolice Force. Sergeant Johnson embodies all of the qualities that make \nthe Capitol Police one of the best law enforcement divisions in the \nNation. I am pleased to recognize Sergeant Johnson today before the \nSenate, and I wish him the best as he embarks on this new chapter of \nhis life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3117-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3117-S3118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n               U.S. ARMY SPECIALIST JUSTIN ALLAN ROLLINS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to U.S. \nArmy SPC Justin Allan Rollins, of Newport, NH. Tragically, on March 5, \n2007, this courageous 22-year-old soldier, along with five of his \nsoldier comrades, gave their last full measure for our Nation when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated near their unit during combat \noperations in Samarra, Iraq. At the time of this hostile action, \nSpecialist Rollins, the gunner on his HMMWV, was assigned to the 2nd \nBattalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, \n82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, NC, and was serving in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. He had recently reenlisted in the Army for an \nadditional 4 years.\n  Justin, the son of Mitchel ``Skip'' and Rhonda Rollins, was born on \nNovember 10, 1984, and had resided in Newport, NH, all of his life. He \nwas a 2003 graduate of Newport High School\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\nwhere he played center on the football team and threw shot put and \ndiscus for the track and field team. Those close to him describe him as \na wonderful young man with a nice smile and a hearty laugh, a loyal \nfriend, and a patriot with a strong desire to serve his country. Family \nand friends say he had a zest for life and loved to hunt and drive fast \ncars.\n  Sensing a call to duty, and in response to the September 11 terrorist \nattack on our Nation, he joined the U.S. Army in 2004. Justin reported \nto Fort Benning, GA, where he completed basic training, infantry \ntraining, and Army Airborne School. Upon completion of his training in \nAugust 2004, he was assigned and reported to the 2nd Battalion, 505th \nParachute Infantry Regiment at Fort Bragg. In August 2006, he deployed \nwith his unit to Iraq. He said he went to Iraq so that the Iraqi \nchildren could have the same opportunities as U.S. children and he was \nextremely proud of what he was doing. The awards and decorations that \nSpecialist Rollins received over his years of service are a testament \nto his strong character. They include the Bronze Star with Valor, two \nPurple Heart medals, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service \nMedal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army \nService Ribbon, Army Overseas Service Ribbon, Combat Infantry Badge, \nand Airborne Wings.\n  Patriots from the State of New Hampshire have served our Nation with \nhonor and distinction from the first conflict at Fort William and Mary, \nNew Castle, NH, to the current conflict in Samarra, Iraq, and U.S. Army \nSPC Justin Allan Rollins served and fought in that same fine tradition. \nDuring our country's difficult Revolutionary War, Thomas Paine wrote, \n``These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the \nsunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their \ncountry; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man \nand woman.'' In these turbulent times Justin stood with the country he \nloved, served it with distinction and honor, and earned and deserves \nour love and thanks.\n  My sympathy, condolences, and prayers go out to Justin's parents Skip \nand Rhonda, older brother Jonathan, grandparents, longtime girlfriend \nBrittney Murray, and to his other family members and many friends who \nhave suffered this most grievous loss. Family, friends, and fellow \nsoldiers will no longer be able to enjoy his company. Strangers will \nnever have the opportunity to know his friendship. Yet memories of this \nyoung patriot will last forever with those who were fortunate enough to \nhave had the opportunity to know him. Justin had said that there is no \nhigher honor than to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery, and now \nhe joins many of our country's heroes in that sacred place. Because of \nhis devotion and sense of duty, the safety and liberty of each and \nevery American is more secure. In the words of Daniel Webster, may his \nremembrance be as long lasting as the land he honored. God bless Justin \nAllan Rollins.\n\n\n                   private first class jason d. johns\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I have a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Frankton. Jason \nJohns, 19 years old, died on February 21 while deployed in Afghanistan. \nWith his entire life before him, Jason risked everything to fight for \nthe values Americans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around \nthe world.\n  Although Jason moved to Florida when he was young, his valor over the \ncourse of his service in Afghanistan makes us proud to count him as a \nHoosier, too. According to his father, Jason had known that he had \nwanted to be a soldier for as long as his friends and family could \nremember. He fulfilled that dream when he joined the Army in 2005, \nshortly after receiving his GED. Jason enjoyed the military, and he \nintended to make it his career, hoping to someday reach the rank of \ngeneral. His father, along with friends of the family, described him as \nserious about his career and a selfless man who wanted to serve his \ncountry.\n  Jason died while serving his country in Operation Enduring Freedom. \nHe was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 82nd General Support Aviation \nBattalion, 82nd Airborne Division out of Fort Bragg, NC. This brave \nyoung soldier leaves behind his mother and father, Kim and Jeffrey \nJohns, and two older brothers, Jack and Jeremiah.\n  Today, I join Jason's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of Jason, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  Jason was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, Jason will be remembered by family members, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Jason's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of Jason's actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jason D. Johns in the official \nRecord of the United States Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like Jason's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Jason.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3118-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3118-S3120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IMPROVING AMERICA'S SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, over 5 years ago, on September 11, \nterrorists murdered nearly 3,000 people in the single deadliest attack \non American soil in our history.\n  What all Americans witnessed and what too many families experienced \npersonally and tragically was the dawn of a new era. We knew it then. \nNational Guard patrolled Federal buildings and airports. The military \npatrolled the skies over New York and Washington, DC. The United States \nhad been attacked by a new kind of enemy in a new and more dangerous \nworld. We faced tough questions as a nation: How do we defeat this \nenemy? How do we fight terror abroad and protect America at home?\n  What was clear that day and remains so today is that the threat posed \nto us by terrorism requires a great mobilization of American might, \nmuscle, resources, and ingenuity.\n  Armed with this mandate, many of us fought alongside those who lost \nloved ones on September 11 to compel an unwilling Bush administration \nto create the 9/11 Commission. The determination and steadfastness \ndemonstrated by the families hardest hit by the September 11 tragedy \nmade the 9/11 Commission a reality. We applauded when the bipartisan \nCommission concluded its investigation and released its thorough report \ndetailing recommendations to protect this Nation from another attack, \nconfident that the Congress and the administration would in short order \nimplement their recommendations.\n  Shamefully, for some in our Federal Government, the sense of urgency \nand resolve faded in the months and years that followed. Some of the \nCommission's most commonsense recommendations went ignored. Even in the \nface of dangerous incompetence in our emergency preparedness and \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina, we received tough rhetoric instead of \nmuch needed reform. Five years after the 9/11\n\n[[Page S3119]]\n\nattacks and 2\\1/2\\ years after the 9/11 Commission released its initial \nreport, much of the work of properly securing our homeland has gone \nundone. That is why this legislation to implement many of the remaining \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission is long overdue.\n  I have long supported the Commission's recommendation that ``homeland \nsecurity assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks \nand vulnerabilities.'' With our homeland security resources limited, we \nneed to be smart about how we distribute funding to guard against \nterrorism. Sadly, all too often, funding decisions have been made based \non politics in Washington instead of the reality in our cities and \nneighborhoods. It is why I introduced the Homeland Security Block Grant \nAct as well as the Domestic Defense Fund Act, both of which would \nprovide direct and threat-based homeland security funding to our \ncommunities and first responders to help them improve our homeland \ndefense. But even funds supposedly distributed based on risk have been \nadministered incompetently.\n  Last spring, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, announced its \n2006 homeland security grants. Cities and States across the country \nfacing high terrorist threats suffered considerable funding cuts, a \ndecision which can be largely attributed to a series of highly \nquestionable risk assessments. New York City and Washington, DC, both \nalready the targets of attacks, were slated for drastic reductions. \nFunding under the Urban Area Security Initiative, UASI, alone was \nslashed in New York City by more than 40 percent and in Washington, DC \nby 43 percent.\n  We clearly need to get smarter about how we assess risk. It would \nsurprise most people to learn that until now, the process of assessing \nrisk has been done on an ad hoc basis within DHS, with several \ndifferent offices tasked with contributing to the analysis. This \nseemingly haphazard process has led to constantly changing grant \nguidance and formulas, wide fluctuations in yearly grant awards, and a \nfailure to develop a long-term strategy for risk assessment. What we \nneed is a full-time staff of methodologists whose sole responsibility \nit is to assess risk. That is why I offered an amendment to bill that \nwould create a Risk Assessment Center within DHS.\n  While the funding proposal contained within Improving America's \nSecurity Act moves us closer toward a threat-based funding model, it \nstill falls shorts of what the 9/11 Commission recommended. \nSpecifically, the State minimum funding requirements contained within \nthe bill are still too high and there is still too much reliance on \npopulation-based formulas that bear little relation to risk. My hope is \nthat during conference committee negotiations to reconcile the House \nand Senate bills, efforts will be made to ensure that our limited \nhomeland security funds are directed toward mitigating our most \nsignificant vulnerabilities and that political formulas are abandoned.\n  As we discuss the importance of homeland security and how critical it \nis to provide adequate funding for our first responders, we cannot \nleave the 43,000 transportation security officers, TSOs, in this \ncountry out of the conversation. Every day, TSOs are on the national \nsecurity frontlines, keeping our airports safe and protecting countless \ncitizens as they travel. Despite the significant training, experience, \nand patience required to execute these duties, TSOs have lacked the \nbasic workers rights and protections for over 5 years, including \nwhistleblower protections and the right to collectively bargain. As a \nresult, the officers we task with protecting our airplanes from another \nterrorist attack now have the highest injury rate of any Federal \nagency, a high attrition rate of almost 30 percent, and, according to a \nrecent report, the lowest morale of any agency in the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  It is why I supported Senator McCaskill's amendment that would \nguarantee to TSOs collective bargaining and other basic labor rights \nthat other Federal law enforcement officers already enjoy. This \namendment would promote our Nation's security by providing a stable \nworkplace structure for the resolution of disputes and the reduction of \nturnover, as well as allow TSOs to expose threats to aviation security \nwithout fear of retaliation. The amendment also includes provisions \nthat make explicit that TSOs would not enjoy the right to strike, the \nright to bargain for higher pay, or the right to reveal classified \ninformation, and that the TSOs must follow all orders during an \nemergency. This was a smart and carefully tailored amendment that \ncorrectly recognizes that we will not be able to effectively safeguard \nour Nation's security if we do not stand with and support its security \nworkers.\n  It is also past time to secure our ports and transportation systems. \nUnscanned cargo containers that pass through our ports pose a \nsubstantial risk to our homeland security, threatening not only the \ngateways to our national economy but also the larger American public. \nWe learned the painful lesson on September 11 that those intent on \ndestroying our American way of life are keenly focused on exposing our \nvulnerabilities. Because our ports serve as the gateway to our country \nand its economy, they remain attractive targets susceptible to \nterrorist attack.\n  In 2005, more than 84 million tons of cargo with a value greater than \n$132 billion passed through the Port of New York and New Jersey alone. \nThe sheer scope of commerce at our ports means the threat carries grave \nconsequences--and will take a great deal of hard work and our smartest \nstrategies to meet. And while we took important steps toward addressing \nthese concerns last year with the passage of the SAFE Ports Act, we \nstill need to act with more urgency. It is why I supported efforts to \nexpedite the implementation of new scanning requirements during \nconsideration of the Improving America's Security Act.\n  I am encouraged that the bill does take steps to secure our rail and \nmass transit systems. Given the lessons of London, Madrid, and Mumbai, \nit is unbelievable that not more has been done to secure our mass \ntransit. Passenger rail systems--primarily subway systems--here in the \nUnited States carry about 5 times as many passengers each day as do \nairlines. Instead of forcing an impossible decision, between protecting \none form of transportation over another, we should invest in the \nresources and tools necessary to secure our entire transportation \ninfrastructure--before terrorists strike our rail systems here at home.\n  Importantly, the bill provides grants through TSA to Amtrak, freight \nrailraods, and others to upgrade security across the entire freight and \nintercity passenger railroad system. Additionally, the bill provides \nfunding through the Department of Transportation, DOT, to upgrade and \nto fortify Amtrak railroad tunnels in New York, Washington, and \nBaltimore.\n  Furthermore, the legislation requires the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration, FMCSA, to provide recommendations to both motor \ncarriers and States on how to coordinate hazardous materials routing. \nThe bill also requires DHS to develop a program to encourage equipping \ntrucks that carry hazardous materials with communications and tracking \ntechnology. These steps are in addition to those in the bill that \nbolster aviation security standards. Importantly, the bill requires the \nTransportation Security Administration, TSA, to develop and implement a \nsystem, within 3 years of the date of enactment, to provide for the \nscreening of all cargo being carried on passenger aircraft, a security \nmeasure that is long overdue.\n  The bill also takes several important steps to address our emergency \ncommunications systems before we face another crisis. Chaotic, real-\nworld disasters, whether manmade or natural, do not obey borders. They \nrequire close coordination of Federal, State and local agencies, \nfirefighters, police officers and EMTs, and others. Yet often these \ndifferent entities use different communications devices, frequencies, \neven languages. On September 11, police officers could not effectively \ntalk to firefighters at Ground Zero; at the Pentagon, first responders \nfrom Virginia and Washington, DC faced the same problem. After Katrina, \nwe had responders exchanging business cards at the site of the disaster \nalong the gulf.\n  That is why the 9/11 Commission recognized our crucial need to have \ninteroperable communications, so that all\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\nof our first responders can communicate with each other at the scene of \nan emergency. It is why I introduced legislation last year that would \ngive our first responders an interoperable emergency communications \nsystem coordinated under Federal leadership. I am pleased that the bill \nprovides funds to improve interoperable emergency communications and \ngives the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, \nNTIA, greater direction regarding how to distribute these funds.\n  This bill also contains a provision offered by Senator Stevens and me \nwhich will provide immediate and critical funding to help upgrade and \nimprove our Nation's 9-1-1 call centers. This funding will help ensure \nthat 9-1-1 call centers can be an effective part of an emergency \nresponse plan and will make certain they have the technological \nupgrades to handle and process all the emergency calls that come into \nthem so that our first responders know where to go and what situation \nthey are walking into.\n  Nearly 5 years ago, America suffered a brutal terrorist attack that \nstole nearly 3,000 lives and changed America forever. What was required \nhere in Washington was leadership. Leadership to inspire Americans to \nmeet the threat head on. Leadership to mobilize our resources and \nrespond effectively. Leadership to keep our country safe in a new and \nmore dangerous world.\n  Sadly, the Bush administration failed to match the urgency and \nresolve of the American people in this great struggle to secure our \nhomeland. Today, with passage of this important legislation, we will \ndemonstrate the leadership that we have been sorely missing for too \nlong in the fight to safeguard our Nation and its citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3120-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

ROBERT SOCOLOW\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on Tuesday, February 27, 2007, the Finance \nCommittee held a hearing on energy-tax issues titled: America's Energy \nFuture: Bold Ideas, Practical Solutions. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe following testimony from that hearing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   The Challenge of Managing U.S. Coal in a Climate-Constrained World\n\n\n             Testimony before the Senate Finance Committee\n\n    (Professor Robert Socolow, Princeton University, Feb. 27, 2007)\n\n       Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, and members of the \n     Committee: Thank you for inviting me to testify today. I am \n     pleased to be here in my capacity as co-director of Princeton \n     University's Carbon Mitigation Initiative; as a Professor of \n     Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton; and as an \n     individual concerned about the future of U.S. and global \n     energy policy. I commend you for these hearings.\n       In 2004 Stephen Pacala and I published a paper in Science \n     magazine called ``Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate \n     Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies.'' We \n     argued for a portfolio of climate-change mitigation \n     strategies. Among these strategies are the deepening of \n     energy efficiency in buildings, transport, and industry; the \n     deployment of renewable energy, nuclear power and biofuels; \n     and the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide produced \n     at coal power plants and coal-to-liquids plants.\n       Today, I will focus my testimony on the strategy that has \n     moved to near the top of the list from the perspective of \n     urgency: carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS for short.\n\n\n                          Collision avoidance\n\n       Mr. Chairman, this really is a time of Bad News and Good \n     News. The Bad News is that two trains are on a collision \n     course. The Good News is that there is still time to switch \n     one of the trains onto a different track.\n       Train Number One is the rush to coal power in the U.S., a \n     consequence of changed expectations about the future natural \n     gas price. Train Number Two is the urgency of dealing with \n     climate change. In my view, none too soon, climate change is \n     high on the agenda for U.S. policy.\n       A collision is imminent because burning coal as we have \n     burned it in the past sends more carbon dioxide into the \n     atmosphere for each unit of useful energy produced than any \n     other energy source. So, the rush to coal makes the already \n     difficult challenge of climate change even more challenging.\n       The switch is carbon dioxide capture and sequestration, or \n     CCS. Using CCS, when coal is burned its carbon does not end \n     up in the atmosphere.\n\n\n                               Readiness\n\n       CCS is commercially mature; it uses proven technologies in \n     new combinations. Carbon dioxide has long been captured at \n     natural gas power plants and coal power plants for use by the \n     food industry. A 500-mile carbon dioxide pipeline built 20 \n     years ago has brought carbon dioxide from across New Mexico \n     from southwest Colorado to oil fields in west Texas. There \n     are no technological reasons to delay full-scale deployment \n     of CCS.\n       The best evidence I know for the readiness of CCS for full-\n     scale deployment is the 500-megawatt CCS project at BP's \n     Carson refinery, near Long Beach, California. This project of \n     BP and Edison Mission Group received investment tax credits \n     under Section 48B of the tax code, per the 2005 Energy Policy \n     Act. The project will gasify 4500 tons per day of petcoke, \n     the bottom of the barrel at a refinery, a negative-cost fuel. \n     Four million tons of carbon dioxide will be sent off-site \n     each year for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).\n       Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration is likely to \n     become a favorable economic strategy for a coal utility at a \n     price of about $30 per U.S. ton of carbon dioxide. Prices on \n     emissions in the same range should also enable other \n     ``upstream'' carbon-saving strategies, ending flaring at the \n     oil field and bringing new investments at oil refineries. \n     Carbon dioxide policy should reach far upstream, because the \n     low-hanging fruit is upstream.\n       Efficiency in energy use is where the other low-hanging \n     fruit are to be found. A low-tech air-conditioner cooling a \n     poorly designed and poorly instrumented office building is as \n     out of place in a climate-constrained world as a coal \n     plant without carbon dioxide capture and sequestration.\n\n\n                    EOR and national energy security\n\n       Carbon dioxide is the mischief molecule in the atmosphere, \n     but the miracle molecule below ground. Used for enhanced oil \n     recovery (EOR), carbon dioxide injects new life into old oil \n     fields. Quantitatively, a new one-thousand-megawatt coal \n     plant will produce about six million tons per year of carbon \n     dioxide. If captured and used for enhanced oil recovery, this \n     carbon dioxide should increase oil production at mature \n     fields by between 30,000 and 80,000 barrels a day. Any carbon \n     dioxide heading for the sky is domestic oil not produced--and \n     more imported oil.\n\n\n                           No CTL without CCS\n\n       Your committee is considering subsidizing synthetic fuel \n     from domestic coal. From a climate change perspective, unless \n     synfuels production is accompanied by carbon dioxide capture \n     and sequestration, this is a big step backward. Burning coal-\n     based synthetic fuel in a car engine, instead of burning \n     gasoline made from crude oil, sends approximately twice as \n     much carbon dioxide to the atmosphere when driving the same \n     distance--unless CCS is incorporated into the synfuels \n     production process, in which case CTL fuel is no worse for \n     climate than petroleum fuel.\n       ``No CTL without CCS'' isn't the world's most exciting \n     bumper sticker, but it carries a vitally important message.\n\n\n                           Carbon Price, Plus\n\n       Mr. Chairman, The sulfur trading you helped launch in the \n     early 1990s has been a spectacular success and the template \n     for every cap-and-trade proposal since then. But the \n     launching of CCS will require ``a carbon dioxide trading \n     system, plus.'' I strongly recommend that your committee \n     restrict the next investment tax credits only to coal power \n     plants and coal synfuels plants that capture and sequester \n     carbon dioxide.\n       Moreover, I recommend that policies specify only that \n     carbon dioxide must be sequestered, with penalties for \n     failure, but then leave it to the market to choose the \n     specific capture and sequestration strategy for each \n     circumstance.\n\n\n     Policy must distinguish industrial from natural carbon dioxide\n\n       Several federal and state energy policies in the 1980s that \n     subsidized enhanced oil recovery resulted in the extraction \n     of carbon dioxide from large geological formations--carbon \n     dioxide that otherwise would have stayed below ground for \n     millions of years. This adverse impact on climate was \n     inadvertent; but now we know better. All legislation \n     henceforth must distinguish industrial carbon dioxide from \n     natural carbon dioxide.\n\n\n                Policies that penalize early bad action\n\n       Urgently needed for the current period are policies that \n     give clear and persuasive signals that any new coal plants \n     without CCS\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\n     will be penalized, not rewarded, in whatever U.S. climate-\n     change mitigation policy emerges after the current planning \n     period. No one should expect the grandfathering of the \n     newborn.\n       I was one of many who were delighted by the news this past \n     weekend that eight new coal plants with conventional \n     technology proposed for rapid construction in Texas will not \n     be built. I can't prove it, of course, but it seems likely to \n     me that the op ed in the Dallas News last month from Senators \n     Bingaman and Boxer, warning investors and the TXU leadership \n     that, in effect, there would be no grandfathering of the \n     newborn, was instrumental in derailing the construction of \n     these eight backward-looking plants.\n       Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for \n     your attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3121-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF JIM SOURWINE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a statement I wish I did not have \nto make. Jim Sourwine, who has almost 40 years of Federal service, \nincluding more than 30 on the staff of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, will retire this month. He not only served the committee but \nthe entire Senate as a professional staff member. And when I say \n``professional,'' I really mean it with Jim. Always courteous, always \nhelpful, he is an appropriator's appropriator. He worked for \nRepublicans and he worked for Democrats, with equal diligence. He \ntreated every Senator with respect, and we respected him as well.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I don't know if the Senator from Iowa knows this, but \nJim Sourwine has served almost 100 different members of the \nAppropriations Committee during his time in the Senate. Imagine each of \nthe desks in this Chamber filled with U.S. Senators, and you will have \na sense of the number of committee members Jim served.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And we all benefited from that service. He understands \nthe appropriations process better than anyone. New staff could always \nlook to Jim for institutional knowledge, and count on him to be a \npatient teacher of many on both substantive issues an the \nappropriations process.\n  The Senate depended on this expertise. Jim is a master craftsman, the \nperson we relied on to compile all the spending figures and technical \nlanguage and mould it into an appropriations bill. Whether it was \ndrafting an amendment to the budget resolution; finding a creative \noffset to meet an important priority; or organizing and staffing a \nhearing on an important labor issue, such as those that we held on the \novertime regulation, Jim Sourwine was the staffer we wanted and needed \nby our side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Jim came to the Senate in 1972 when he was first \ndetailed to the committee from the Department of Labor. He found his \nplace quickly and began responding to what were known as \n``Harleygrams''--daily instructions from Harley Dirks, who was Senator \nMagnuson's clerk of the Labor, HEW and Related Agencies Subcommittee, \nas it was called then.\n  After Senator Magnuson, Jim served under Senator Schmitt in the 97th \nCongress, and then Senator Weicker and Senator Chiles. Since the 101st \nCongress, the Senator from Iowa and I have exchanged the gavel on \nseveral occasions. I never miss a chance to mention that I always \nprefer to have the gavel in my hand. On this occasion, I should also \nsay that I prefer to have Jim Sourwine's services on staff as well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Jim is the undisputed master at identifying creative \nsolutions to funding problems. However, we can never forget that the \nwork he did to support this institution ultimately benefited the \nAmerican people, through increased educational and job training \nopportunities, greater protections for the Nation's workers or more \naffordable and improved health care.\n  For example, when Jim came to the committee, title I education grants \nwere funded at $1.6 billion; this year's level is $12.8 billion. Think \nof the millions of disadvantaged students who have benefited over the \nyears from this funding. In 1972, Congress created the basic \neducational opportunity grant to provide grant aid that would help low-\nincome students earn a postsecondary education. The grant program, now \nknown as Pell grants, provides a maximum award of $4,310 to more than 5 \nmillion low- and middle-income students. Millions of students have been \nable to earn a postsecondary education because of the extra assistance \nthey were provided. Jim should feel proud of the role he has played in \neach of these programs and so much more.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would like to add several other accomplishments of \nCongress for which Jim should feel a great sense of pride. In 2002, \nCongress completed a doubling of the NIH budget over a 5-year period. \nJim's thorough knowledge of the bill and the budget was instrumental in \nsecuring the doubling. If there was a way to write bill language that \nwould save money or change a date to free up some cash, Jim knew how to \ndo it.\n  When Jim started working at the Department of Labor in 1967, the Job \nCorps program was in its infancy, just 3 years old. Today, it is a $1.6 \nbillion enterprise widely touted for its performance standards and \nstudent outcomes, helping more than 60,000 youths each year. After the \nQuecreek coal mine accident, I held a hearing in Pennsylvania to look \ninto the mine safety issues related to that situation. We have held two \nmine safety hearings since the Sago and Alma disasters in early 2006. \nJim organized and staffed those hearings. What's more, he helped craft \nlegislation that I introduced last year which contributed to the \ndevelopment of the MINER Act. This act passed last year and is now the \nlaw of the land. It is the most significant piece of mine safety \nlegislation passed in more than 30 years and its effective implantation \nwill save lives. Jim should feel very good about the work he did to \nsupport that legislation, as well as other worker protection programs.\n  I believe the Senator from Iowa and I could go on for some time on \nall that Jim Sourwine has meant to the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nthe Senate and the American people. For me, I want him to remember \nalways what the long hours have done for so many. Jim, best wishes to \nyou on your retirement. You will be missed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Jim, I understand that the round-the-clock hours and \nweekend work have made it difficult to catch up on some projects around \nthe house and get on the golf course. While you might prefer one over \nthe other, I hope you know that your long and distinguished service to \nthe Senate has more than earned for you the right to do just that or \nnothing at all. I will miss you and your sage counsel. The Senate will \nmiss you. I wish you all the best on your retirement and thank you for \nyour service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3121-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3121-S3122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               INDIANA WOMEN'S STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish today to pay tribute to the \nOregon-Davis Women's High School basketball team for their \nextraordinary State championship victory. The Bobcats historic 54-46 \ndefeat of Wood Memorial for the Class A State Championship was the \nfirst statewide championship for the Bobcats and a proud moment for our \nState.\n  In reading of their victory, I was reminded of what people say about \nteamwork: that at the end of the day we are only as strong as the \nshoulders we lean on. The talent of the Bobcats was apparent throughout \ntheir stellar season, but it was their extraordinary teamwork that \nbrought the championship trophy to the O-D gymnasium for the first time \nin school history. The young women of the Oregon-Davis basketball team \nare a testament to what student athletes should be, and they should be \ncommended for winning with class, courage, and character.\n  Two years ago the team lost a dear friend in a tragic automobile \naccident. Jessica McMullen was the daughter of Tim McMullen, a coach in \nFlorida and a close friend of Terry Minix, the Bobcats' head coach. \nJessica, a hard-nosed basketball player, used to help her dad at camps \nat O-D and was only 16 years old when she died. The day after their \nchampionship win, the team was honored in the Oregon-Davis gym, and \neach team member wore a T-shirt commemorating Jessica's contribution to \nthe Bobcats. At the ceremony, Aubrey Minix, a lead player on the team, \nspoke about the championship saying, ``It means even more to us because \nwe did want to do it for Jess; it brought us even closer together.''\n  While the young women on the O-D team put in countless hours \npracticing\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\nand developing their skills, the parents and coaching staff dedicated \njust as much time supporting the team. As a father of two young boys \nwho love to play sports, I know how rewarding it can be to watch my \nsons' games. I also know how dedicated parents must be to drive their \nkids to practice every day, make it to the games, and cheer the whole \ngame through. It is this kind of dedication that builds a support \nnetwork worthy of a State championship.\n  Once the playoffs started, the Bobcats' true character shined even \nbrighter as they never lost faith in themselves and prevailed as a \nteam. Their conduct this season should be an example for all other \nstudent athletes to follow. I congratulate the Oregon-Davis Bobcats on \ntheir State championship and commend them for the example they set for \nall student athletes who I hope are inspired by their example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3122-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATIONS TO STEPHEN JOEL TRACHTENBERG\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as an alumnus of the George \nWashington University, GW, I wish to take a few minutes to pay tribute \nto president Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, who is retiring in July after \n19 years of dedicated service to GW.\n  President Trachtenberg became the 15th president of GW on August 1, \n1988. A native of Brooklyn, NY, President Trachtenberg came to GW from \nthe University of Hartford, CT, where he had been president for 11 \nyears. Before assuming the presidency of Hartford, he served for 8 \nyears at Boston University as vice president for academic services and \nacademic dean of the College of Liberal Arts. Previously, he was a \nspecial assistant for 2 years to the U.S. Education Commissioner, \nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare. He was also an attorney \nwith the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and a legislative aide to former \nIndiana Congressman John Brademas.\n  President Trachtenberg has shown a strong commitment to public, \ncivic, and personal service. He worked tirelessly to honor and enhance \nthe relationship between the University and the District of Columbia, \nsupporting and mentoring students, and leading and advocating for \nreinvention, change and civic engagement.\n  In 1989, President Trachtenberg created the 21st Century DC Scholars \nProgram--now the Stephen Joel Trachtenberg Scholars--which has granted \nalmost 100 full scholarships to students from the DC Public Schools to \nattend GW. Under his leadership, GW's Multicultural Student Services \nCenter has become a strong center for cultural awareness and \ncelebrations, student development, and diversity training. His \ndedication to civic service is reflected throughout the University, its \nfaculty, and its students.\n  GW has experienced great changes and improvements under President \nTrachtenberg's leadership. During his tenure, the university has seen \nthe number of undergraduate applications triple. Financial aid to \nstudents, research funding, and campus infrastructure investment have \nalso significantly increased.\n  President Trachtenberg has received numerous accolades from across \nthe Nation and abroad for his service, vision, intellect, wit and \ncompassion. His passion and demonstrated commitment to GW and its \nstudents, the city of Washington, DC, and the pursuit of lifelong \nlearning are to be commended. I congratulate him on his record of \nservice and outstanding leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3122-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING SENATOR ANITA BOWSER\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life of a \ndistinguished public servant, community leader, and friend, Senator \nAnita Bowser, who passed away at the age of 86 on March 4. Senator \nBowser's dedication to the State of Indiana kept her involved in public \nservice throughout her life, and I know that she will be greatly \nmissed.\n  Senator Bowser was a good and decent woman who dedicated her life to \nserving others. From her work as a constitutional scholar to her role \nas a State representative, her career was filled with acts of \nconscientious service on behalf of friends, family members, and \nHoosiers across Indiana.\n  In 1980, Senator Bowser retired from teaching political science at \nPurdue University, North Central, and started her career in the Indiana \nHouse of Representatives. In 1992 she was elected to the state senate \nrepresenting LaPorte and St. Joseph Counties. Throughout her career as \nan elected official, Senator Bowser addressed issues such as \nprescription drug assistance, the protection of Indiana's telephone \nprivacy list, support for agricultural development, assistance for \nvictims of sexual assault, and tax amnesty for small businesses.\n  As Governor of Indiana, I had the privilege of seeing firsthand the \ndifference Senator Bowser's efforts have made in our State. The \ncontributions she made through her leadership and philanthropy touched \ncountless lives, and her dedication and strong will made her a role \nmodel for a generation of Hoosiers.\n  Senator Bowser's many accomplishments include being the first woman \nto act as house speaker, deputy speaker pro-tempore, in the history of \nthe State. In addition, she received numerous honors based on her \npublic service, including the Louis Ingelhart Award for Freedom of \nExpression, the Amnesty International Abolitionist of the Year Award, \nand the Robert Dale Owen Legislator Award from the Indiana Civil \nLiberties Union. She was also a founding member and the first woman to \nbe hired to teach at Purdue University, North Central, in Westville. A \nveteran lawmaker, Senator Bowser was widely respected as the conscience \nof the Indiana State Senate.\n  Before she died, Senator Bowser was the ranking Democrat on the \nSenate Pensions and Labor Committee and was a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Corrections, Criminal and Civil Matters Committee, the \nEthics Committee, and Education and Career Development Committee. It is \na rare person who can make such an impact on so many people over the \ncourse of one life. Hoosiers will miss Senator Bowser as a friend, a \ncommunity leader, and a committed advocate for our State.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Senator Anita Bowser in the \nofficial Record of the United States Senate for her service to the \nState of Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3122-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WAYNE TIPPETS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on March 2, 2007, the Boise Veterans \nAdministration Medical Center bade farewell to its director of 14 \nyears, Wayne Tippets. After a dedicated career with the VA spanning 37 \nyears, Wayne retired with plans to travel and spend time with his \nfamily. I also understand that his retirement will likely include \ngolfing.\n  Wayne served with the VA across the Nation, in places such as Iowa, \nTennessee and California, before coming back to Idaho in 1993. He \nrecognizes the importance of honesty, a strong work ethic, and the \ncritical importance of competent, compassionate staff, and volunteers \nto the hospital's success. Wayne has handled the almost doubling of \nhospital patients over the past 14 years with a sense of pragmatism and \ndrive to continue a history of responsible service to Idaho's veterans. \nUnder his leadership, the Boise VAMC rebuilt and modernized the \nmedical/surgical ward; constructed a behavioral health center, \noutpatient care building, and specialty care clinic; opened a larger \nand modernized emergency room; opened a new building in Twin Falls; \nopened a new administration building; opened a community-based \noutpatient clinic in Caldwell; and established a patient care access \npoint in Salmon, ID, offering social worker and telepsychiatry \nservices.\n  Wayne was instrumental in these and other improvements and expansion \nof VA patient services throughout his tenure in Idaho. I wish him well \nin retirement and thank him for his long years of service to our \nNation's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3122-4", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3122-S3123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:48 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 429.

The risk of catastrophes \n     must be addressed through a public-private partnership \n     involving individuals, private industry, local and state \n     governments, and the Federal Government. A national \n     catastrophe insurance program is necessary to promote \n     personal responsibility among policyholders; support \n     strong building codes, development plans, and other \n     mitigation tools; maximize the risk-bearing capacity of \n     the private markets; and provide quantifiable risk \n     management through the Federal Government. The program \n     should encompass:\n       (a) Providing consumers with a private market residential \n     insurance program that provides all-perils protection.\n       (b) Promoting personal responsibility through mitigation; \n     promoting the retrofitting of existing housing stock; \n     providing individuals with the ability to manage their own \n     disaster savings accounts that, similar to health savings \n     accounts, accumulate on a tax-advantaged basis for the \n     purpose of paying for mitigation enhancements and \n     catastrophic losses; and providing personal income tax \n     deductions for mitigation expenses.\n       (c) Creating tax-deferred insurance company catastrophe \n     reserves to benefit policyholders. These tax-deferred \n     reserves would build up over time and only be eligible to be \n     used to pay for future catastrophic losses.\n       (d) Enhancing local and state government's role in \n     establishing and maintaining effective building codes, \n     mitigation education, and land use management; promoting \n     state emergency management, preparedness, and response; and \n     creating state or multistate regional catastrophic risk \n     financing mechanisms such as the Florida Hurricane \n     Catastrophe Fund.\n       (e) Creating a national catastrophe financing mechanism \n     that would provide a quantifiable level of risk management \n     and financing for mega-catastrophes; maximizing the risk-\n     bearing capacity of the private markets; and allowing for \n     aggregate risk pooling of natural disasters funded through \n     sound risk-based premiums paid in correct proportion by all \n     policyholders in the United States.\n       (2) That the Legislature urges the Congress to participate \n     in a federal/state issues summit in this state to discuss and \n     develop policy positions on current and emerging issues of \n     state importance that are likely to be considered by Congress \n     to build better working relationships in order to mutually \n     accomplish goals of benefit to Floridians.\n       (3) That the Legislature urges Congress to provide federal \n     tax exemptions for:\n       (a) Catastrophe premium equalization deductions charged and \n     held by the state in a segregated account for the benefit of \n     insurers for use in the event of a catastrophe.\n       (b) The Florida Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting \n     Association.\n       (4) That the Legislature urges Congress to provide a \n     federal income tax deduction for residential property \n     insurance premiums paid by consumers to offset the dramatic \n     cost of property insurance.\n       (5) That the Legislature urges Congress to support the \n     National Hurricane Research Initiative, which is intended to \n     foster a better understanding of hurricane prediction, \n     intensity, and mitigation on coastal populations, \n     infrastructure, and the natural environment.\n       Be it further resolved, That copies of this memorial be \n     dispatched to the President of the United States, to the \n     President of the United States Senate, to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and to each member of \n     the Florida delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-19.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax incentive to individuals teaching in elementary and secondary \nschools located in rural or high employment areas and to to individuals \nwho achieve certification from the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, one of the key components to success \nin our classrooms is a qualified teacher. One of the provisions of the \nNo Child Left Behind Act mandates the hiring of qualified teachers by \nevery school in every district.\n  But what are the incentives to keep qualified teachers in the \nclassroom? I believe we need more targeted incentives to reward \nteachers willing to stay in the classroom, especially in rural schools \nand high poverty schools.\n  Unfortunately, without our help, America's poor and rural schools may \nnot be able to attract the qualified teachers this legislation mandates \nand our children deserve. Isolated, struggling and competing against \nhigher paying well-funded school districts for scarce classroom talent, \nsuch school faces a shortage of qualified teachers. As pressure to hire \nqualified teachers increases, this shortage will become a crisis, and \nchildren already at a disadvantage in relation to their more affluent \nand less isolated peers will be the ones who suffer most.\n  Today, I propose a bill that will help bring dedicated and qualified \nteaching professionals to West Virginia's and America's poor and rural \nschools, and help give their students the opportunity to learn and \nflourish that every child deserves. The Incentives To Educate American \nChildren Act--or ``I Teach'' Act--will provide teachers a refundable \ntax credit every year they practice their profession in the public \nschools where they are needed most. And it will give every public \nschool teacher--whichever school they choose--a refundable tax credit \nfor earning certification by the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards. Together, these two tax credits will give \neconomically depressed areas a better ability to recruit and retain \nskilled teachers.\n  One-fourth of America's children attend public schools in rural \nareas, and of the 250 poorest counties in the United States, 244 are \nrural. West Virginia has rural schools scattered through 36 of its 55 \ncounties, and these schools face real challenges in recruiting and \nretaining teachers, as well as dealing with other issues related to \ntheir rural location.\n  Attracting teachers to these schools is difficult in large part due \nto the vast gap between what rural districts are able to offer and the \nsalaries paid by more affluent school districts--as wide as $20,000 a \nyear, according to one study. Disadvantaged schools must overcome \nsimilar difficulties. It is often a challenge for these schools to \nattract and keep qualified teachers. Yet according to the 2001 No Child \nLeft Behind Act, every school must have qualified teachers by the end \nof the 2005-2006 school year.\n  My ``I Teach'' Act will reward teachers willing to work in rural or \nhigh poverty schools with an annual $1,000 refundable tax credit. If a \nteacher obtains certification by the National Board for Professional \nTeaching Standards, they will receive an additional annual $1,000 \nrefundable tax credit.\n  Every teacher willing to work in underserved schools will earn a tax \ncredit. Every teacher who gets certified will earn a tax credit. \nTeachers who work in rural or disadvantaged schools and get certified \nwill earn both. Schools that desperately need help attracting teachers \nwill get a boost. And children educated in poor and rural schools will \nbenefit most.\n  In my State of West Virginia, as in over 30 other States, there is \nalready a State fiscal incentive for teachers who earn national board \ncertification. There are over 55,000 teachers with a national board \ncertificate, and 290 are West Virginia teachers. West Virginia offers \nour national board teachers a $2500 bonus. My legislation builds upon \nthe West Virginia program; together, they add up to a powerful tax \nincentive for teachers to remain in the classroom and to use their \nskills where they are most needed.\n  I have spent a great deal of time in West Virginia classrooms this \nyear,\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nand it has become obvious to me that our education agenda suffers \ngreatly from inadequate funding on a number of fronts. That is why I \nTeach is part of my education agenda. I also want to promote school \nconstruction bonds to improve our schools and renovate aging \nclassrooms. For a decade, I have fought for the E-Rate program to \nprovide $2.25 billion in discounts to connect our schools and libraries \nto modern technology.\n  Education must be among our top national priorities, essential for \nevery family with a child and vital for our economic and national \nsecurity. I supported the bold goals and higher standards of the 2001 \nNo Child Left Behind Act, but they won't be met unless our schools have \nthe teachers and resources they need. I am committed to working closely \nwith my Senate colleagues this year to secure as much funding as \npossible for our children's education.\n  As important as school construction and technology are in the \nclassroom, neither can replace a qualified and motivated teacher; \ntherefore making it easier for underserved schools to attract the \nteachers they need remains one of my most important objectives. I hope \neach of my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation which takes a great stride toward providing better \neducation for every child in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 875. A bill to improve energ security of the United States through \na 50 percent reduction in the oil intensity of the economy of the \nUnited States by 2030 and the prudent expansion of secure oil supplies, \nto be achieved by raising the fuel efficiency of the vehicular \ntransportation fleet, increasing the availability of alternative fuel \nsources, fostering responsible oil exploration and production, and \nimproving international arrangements to secure the global oil supply, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nCraig to introduce legislation called the Security and Fuel Efficiency \nAct of 2007 or SAFE Energy Act. This legislation is a balanced plan \nwith the overall goal to improve the energy security of the U.S. \nthrough a 50 percent reduction in the oil intensity of the economy by \n2030.\n  What that means, plainly, is that if we used more than 4 barrels of \noil in 1973 for every one unit of GDP and are using just over 2 barrels \nof oil per unit of GDP today, then under the provisions of the SAFE \nEnergy Act we are striving to get down to 1 barrel of oil per GDP by \n2030. This is important to me because the United States remains \ndangerously dependent on foreign sources of oil. Today we import over \n60 percent of our oil from Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other \nunstable regions of the world. This is very troubling to me.\n  In the United States, we use about 67 percent of our oil to power our \nvehicles. This is the area where we are least secure and increasingly \ndependent. I am proposing along with my colleague, Senator Craig, a \nbipartisan, balanced approach to securing our future energy through \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Our proposal is grounded in four cornerstone principles. The first \nprinciple is achievable, stepped increases in fuel efficiency of the \ntransportation fleet. The second principle promotes increased \navailability of alternative fuel sources and infrastructure. The third \nprinciple calls for expanded production and enhanced exploration of \ndomestic and other secure oil and natural gas resources. Finally, the \nfourth principle improves the management of alliances to better secure \nglobal energy supplies.\n  Senator Craig and I came together on this legislation because we \nbelieve that bolder energy security measures must be taken now to \naddress our long-term security, economic growth and environmental \nprotection. Producing much of our energy at home will also address \nother major challenges.\n  There is no silver bullet to solving our energy dependence. Digging \nand drilling is a strategy I call yesterday forever. Conservation alone \nis not the answer. Renewable fuels hold promise, but we need to do much \nmore here. We believe the combination of steps in the SAFE Energy Act \nsets the right pathway to U.S. energy security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Security and Fuel \nEfficiency Energy Act of 2007 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 875\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prevent anti-competitive mergers and acquisitions \nin the oil and gas industry; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Oil Industry \nMerger Antitrust Enforcement Act. This legislation will significantly \nstrengthen the antitrust laws to prevent anti-competitive mergers and \nacquisitions in the oil and gas industry.\n  We have all seen the suffering felt by consumers and our national \neconomy resulting from rising energy prices. Last year, gasoline prices \nshattered the once unthinkable $3.00 a gallon level, before receding in \nthe fall. Prices are on the move upward once again, having increased by \n15 percent in the last month alone. And prices for other crucial energy \nproducts--such as natural gas and home heating oil--have undergone \nsimilar sharp increases in the last year.\n  Industry experts debate the causes of these extraordinarily high \nprices. Possible culprits are growing worldwide demand, supply \ndisruptions, the actions of the OPEC oil cartel and limits on refinery \ncapacity in the United States. But we cannot overlook one important \nfactor--the substantial rise in concentration and consolidation in the \noil industry. Since 1990, the Government Accountability Office has \ncounted over 2,600 mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures in the oil \nindustry. Led by gigantic mergers such as Exxon/Mobil, BP/Arco, Conoco/\nPhillips and Chevron/Texaco, by 2004, the five largest U.S. oil \nrefining companies controlled over 56 percent of domestic refining \ncapacity, a greater market share than that controlled by the top ten \ncompanies a decade earlier.\n  This merger wave has led to substantially less competition in the oil \nindustry. In 2004, the GAO concluded that these mergers have directly \ncaused increases in the price of gasoline. A study by the independent \nconsumer watchdog Public Citizen found that in the five years between \n1999 and 2004, U.S. oil refiners increased their average profits on \nevery gallon of gasoline refined from 22.8 cents to 40.8 cents, a 79 \npercent jump. And the grossly inflated profit numbers of the major oil \ncompanies--led by Exxon Mobil's $8.4 billion profit in the first \nquarter of 2006, which followed its $36 billion profit in 2005, the \nhighest corporate profits ever achieved in U.S. history, are conclusive \nevidence--if any more was needed--of the lack of competition in the \nU.S. oil industry. While it is true that the world price of crude oil \nhas substantially increased, the fact that the oil companies can so \neasily pass along all of these price increases to consumers of gasoline \nand other refined products--and greatly compound their profits along \nthe way--confirms that that there is a failure of competition in our \noil and gas markets.\n  More than 90 years ago, one of our Nation's basic antitrust laws--the \nClayton Act--was written to prevent just such industry concentration \nharming competition. It makes illegal any merger or acquisition the \neffect of which ``may be substantially to lessen competition.'' Despite \nthe plain command of this law, the Federal Trade Commission the Federal \nagency with responsibility for enforcing antitrust law in the oil and \ngas industry has failed to take any effective action to prevent undue \nconcentration in this industry. Instead, it permitted almost all of \nthese 2,600 oil mergers and acquisitions to proceed without challenge. \nAnd where the FTC has ordered divestitures, they have been wholly \nineffective to restore competition. Consumers have been at the mercy of \nan increasingly powerful oligopoly of a few giant oil companies, \npassing along price increases without remorse as the market becomes \nincreasingly concentrated and competition diminishes. It is past time \nfor us in Congress to take action to strengthen our antitrust law so \nthat it will, as intended, stand as a bulwark to protect consumers and \nprevent any further loss of competition in this essential industry.\n  Our bill will strengthen merger enforcement under the antitrust law \nin two respects. First, it will direct that the FTC, in conjunction \nwith the Justice Department, revise its Merger Guidelines to take into \naccount the special conditions prevailing in the oil industry. In \nreviewing a pending merger or acquisition to determine whether to \napprove it or take legal action to block it, the FTC follows what are \nknown as ``Merger Guidelines.'' The Merger Guidelines set forth the \nfactors that the agency must examine to determine if a merger or \nacquisition lessens competition, and sets forth the legal tests the FTC \nis to follow in deciding whether to approve or challenge a merger. As \npresently written, the Merger Guidelines fail to direct the FTC, when \nreviewing an oil industry merger, to pay any heed at all to the special \neconomic conditions prevailing in that industry.\n  Our bill will correct this deficiency. Many special conditions \nprevail in the oil and gas marketplace that warrant scrutiny, \nconditions that do not occur in other industries, and the Merger \nGuidelines should reflect these conditions. In most industries, when \ndemand rises and existing producers earn ever-increasing profits, new \nproducers enter the market and new supply expands, reducing the \npressure on price. However, in the oil industry, there are severe \nlimitations on supply and environmental and regulatory difficulty in \nopening new refineries, so this normal market mechanism cannot work. \nAdditionally, in most industries, consumers shift to alternative \nproducts in the face of sharp price increases, leading to a reduction \nin demand and a corresponding reduction in the pressure to increase \nprices. But for such an essential commodity as gasoline, consumers have \nno such option they must continue to consume gasoline to get to work, \nto go to school, and to shop. These factors all mean that antitrust \nenforcers should be especially cautious about permitting increases in \nconcentration in the oil industry.\n  Accordingly, our bill directs the FTC and Justice Department to \nrevise their Merger Guidelines to take into account the special \nconditions prevailing in the oil industry--including the high \ninelasticity of demand for oil and petroleum-related products; the ease \nof gaining market power; supply and refining capacity limits; \ndifficulties of market entry; and unique regulatory requirements \napplying to the oil industry. This revision of the Merger Guidelines \nmust be completed within six months of enactment of this legislation.\n  The second manner in which this legislation will strengthen antitrust \nenforcement will be to shift the burden of proof in Clayton Act \nchallenges to oil industry mergers and acquisitions. In such cases, the \nburden will be placed on the merging parties to establish, by a \npreponderance of evidence, that their transaction does not \nsubstantially lessen competition. This provision would reverse the \nusual rule that the government or private plaintiff challenging the \nmerger must prove that the transaction harms competition. As the \nparties seeking to effect a merger with a competitor in an already \nconcentrated industry, and possessing all the relevant data regarding \nthe transaction,\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\nit is entirely appropriate that the merging parties bear this burden. \nThis provision does not forbid all mergers in the oil industry--if the \nmerging parties can establish that their merger does not substantially \nharm competition, it may proceed. However, shifting the burden of proof \nin this manner will undoubtedly make it more difficult for oil mergers \nand acquisition to survive court challenge, thereby enhancing the law's \nability to block truly anti-competitive transactions and deterring \ncompanies from even attempting such transactions. In today's \nconcentrated oil industry and with consumers suffering record high \nprices, mergers and acquisitions that even the merging parties cannot \njustify should not be tolerated.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee, I believe that this \nbill is a crucial step to ending this unprecedented move towards \nindustry concentration and to begin to restore competitive balance to \nthe oil and gas industry.\n  Since the days of the break-up of the Standard Oil trust one hundred \nyears ago, antitrust enforcement has been essential to prevent undue \nconcentration in this industry. This bill is an essential step to \nensure that our antitrust laws are sufficiently strong to ensure a \ncompetitive oil industry in the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Oil Industry Merger Antitrust Enforcement Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 878\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Oil Industry Merger \n     Antitrust Enforcement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) American consumers are suffering from excessively high \n     prices for gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, and other \n     energy products.\n       (2) These excessively high energy prices have been caused, \n     at least in substantial part, by undue concentration among \n     companies involved in the production, refining, distribution, \n     and retail sale of oil, gasoline, natural gas, heating oil, \n     and other petroleum-related products.\n       (3) There has been a sharp consolidation caused by mergers \n     and acquisitions among oil companies over the last decade, \n     and the antitrust enforcement agencies (the Federal Trade \n     Commission and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division) \n     have failed to employ the antitrust laws to prevent this \n     consolidation, to the detriment of consumers and competition. \n     This consolidation has caused substantial injury to \n     competition and has enabled the remaining oil companies to \n     gain market power over the sale, refining, and distribution \n     of petroleum-related products.\n       (4) The demand for oil, gasoline, and other petroleum-based \n     products is highly inelastic so that oil companies can easily \n     utilize market power to raise prices.\n       (5) Maintaining competitive markets for oil, gasoline, \n     natural gas, and other petroleum-related products is in the \n     highest national interest.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) ensure vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws in \n     the oil industry;\n       (2) restore competition to the oil industry and to the \n     production, refining, distribution, and marketing of gasoline \n     and other petroleum-related products; and\n       (3) prevent the accumulation and exercise of market power \n     by oil companies.\n\n     SEC. 3. BURDEN OF PROOF.\n\n       Section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``In any civil action brought against any person for \n     violating this section in which the plaintiff--\n       ``(1) alleges that the effect of a merger, acquisition, or \n     other transaction affecting commerce may be to substantially \n     lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, in the \n     business of exploring for, producing, refining, or otherwise \n     processing, storing, marketing, selling, or otherwise making \n     available petroleum, oil, or natural gas, or products derived \n     from petroleum, oil, or natural gas; and\n       ``(2) establishes that a merger, acquisition, or \n     transaction is between or involves persons competing in the \n     business of exploring for, producing, refining, or otherwise \n     processing, storing, marketing, selling, or otherwise making \n     available petroleum, oil, or natural gas, or products derived \n     from petroleum, oil, or natural gas;\n\n     the burden of proof shall be on the defendant or defendants \n     to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the \n     merger, acquisition, or transaction at issue will not \n     substantially lessen competition or tend to create a \n     monopoly.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. ENSURING FULL AND FREE COMPETITION.\n\n       (a) Review.--The Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust \n     Division of the Department of Justice shall jointly review \n     and revise all enforcement guidelines and policies, including \n     the Horizontal Merger Guidelines issued April 2, 1992 and \n     revised April 8, 1997, and the Non-Horizontal Merger \n     Guidelines issued June 14, 1984, and modify those guidelines \n     in order to--\n       (1) specifically address mergers and acquisitions in oil \n     companies and among companies involved in the production, \n     refining, distribution, or marketing of oil, gasoline, \n     natural gas, heating oil, or other petroleum-related \n     products; and\n       (2) ensure that the application of these guidelines will \n     prevent any merger and acquisition in the oil industry, when \n     the effect of such a merger or acquisition may be to \n     substantially lessen competition, or to tend to create a \n     monopoly, and reflect the special conditions prevailing in \n     the oil industry described in subsection (b).\n       (b) Special Conditions.--The guidelines described in \n     subsection (a) shall be revised to take into account the \n     special conditions prevailing in the oil industry, \n     including--\n       (1) the high inelasticity of demand for oil and petroleum-\n     related products;\n       (2) the ease of gaining market power in the oil industry;\n       (3) supply and refining capacity limits in the oil \n     industry;\n       (4) difficulties of market entry in the oil industry; and\n       (5) unique regulatory requirements applying to the oil \n     industry.\n       (c) Competition.--The review and revision of the \n     enforcement guidelines required by this section shall be \n     completed not later than 6 months after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission and the \n     Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice shall jointly \n     report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives regarding the review and revision of the \n     enforcement guidelines mandated by this section.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Oil industry.--The term ``oil industry'' means \n     companies and persons involved in the production, refining, \n     distribution, or marketing of oil or petroleum-based \n     products.\n       (2) Petroleum-based product.--The term ``petroleum-based \n     product'' means gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, home heating \n     oil, natural gas, or other products derived from the refining \n     of oil or petroleum.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Feingold, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 879. A bill to amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and \nexporting cartels illegal; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the No Oil \nProducing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2007 (``NOPEC''). It is time for \nthe U.S. government to fight back on the price of oil and hold OPEC \naccountable when it acts illegally. This bill will hold OPEC member \nnations to account under U.S. antitrust law when they agree to limit \nsupply or fix price in violation of the most basic principles of free \ncompetition.\n  Our bill will authorize the Attorney General to file suit against \nnations or other entities that participate in a conspiracy to limit the \nsupply, or fix the price, of oil. In addition, it will expressly \nspecify that the doctrines of sovereign immunity and act of state do \nnot exempt nations that participate in oil cartels from basic antitrust \nlaw. I have introduced this bill in each Congress since 2000. This \nlegislation has passed the Judiciary Committee unanimously three times \nsince it was first introduced, and in 2005 passed the full Senate by \nvoice vote as an amendment to the Energy Bill before being stripped \nfrom that bill in the conference committee. It is now time, in this new \nCongress, to finally pass this legislation into law and give our Nation \na long needed tool to counteract this pernicious and anti-consumer \nconspiracy.\n  Throughout the last year, consumers all across the Nation watched gas \nprices rise to previously unimagined levels. As crude oil prices \nexceeded $40, then $50 and then $60 per barrel, retail prices of \ngasoline over $3.00 per gallon became commonplace. While prices \ntemporarily receded last fall, the general trend is significantly \nupwards, and prices are rising even today. Gas prices have increased 32 \ncents in the last month alone to a national average of\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\n$2.56 per gallon, a nearly 15 percent increase in just one month.\n  As we consider gas price changes, one fact has remained consistent \nany move downwards in price ends as soon as OPEC decides to cut \nproduction. Referring to the 18 percent rise in worldwide crude oil \nprices since the start of the year, OPEC President Mohammed al-Hamli \ncommented ``we had a bad situation at the beginning of the year. It is \nmuch better now.'' The difference--combined output cuts of 1.7 million \nbarrels of oil a day adopted by OPEC last October and December driving \nup crude oil prices. And while OPEC enjoys its newfound riches, the \naverage American consumer suffers every time he or she visits the gas \npump or pays a home heating bill.\n  So there is no doubt that the price of crude oil dances to the tune \nset by OPEC members. Such blatantly anti-competitive conduct by the oil \ncartel violates the most basic principles of fair competition and free \nmarkets and should not be tolerated.\n  Real people suffer real consequences every day in our Nation because \nof OPEC's actions. Rising gas prices are a silent tax that takes hard-\nearned money away from Americans every time they visit the gas pump. \nHigher oil prices drive up the cost of transportation, harming \nthousands of companies throughout the economy from trucking to \naviation. And those costs are passed on to consumers in the form of \nhigher prices for manufactured goods. Higher oil prices mean higher \nheating oil and electricity costs. Anyone who has gone through a \nMidwest winter can tell you about the tremendous personal costs \nassociated with higher home heating bills.\n  We have all heard many explanations offered for rising energy prices. \nSome say that the oil companies are gouging consumers. Some blame \ndisruptions in supply. Others point to the EPA requirement mandating \nuse of a new and more expensive type of ``reformulated'' gas in the \nMidwest or other ``boutique'' fuels around the country. Some even claim \nthat refiners and distributors have illegally fixed prices. On this \nissue, I have repeatedly asked the Federal Trade Commission to \ninvestigate these allegations. As a result of our requests, the FTC has \nput a task force in place to find out if those allegations were true. \nWhile we continue to urge the FTC to be vigilant, the FTC has to date \nfound no evidence of illegal domestic price fixing as a cause of higher \ngas prices.\n  But one cause of these escalating prices is indisputable: the price \nfixing conspiracy of the OPEC nations. For years, this conspiracy has \nunfairly driven up the cost of imported crude oil to satisfy the greed \nof the oil exporters. We have long decried OPEC, but, sadly, no one in \ngovernment has yet tried to take any action. Our bill will, for the \nfirst time, establish clearly and plainly that when a group of \ncompeting oil producers like the OPEC nations act together to restrict \nsupply or set prices, they are violating U.S. law. The bill will not \nauthorize private lawsuits, but it will authorize the Attorney General \nto file suit under the antitrust laws for redress. Our bill will also \nmake plain that the nations of OPEC cannot hide behind the doctrines of \n``sovereign immunity'' or ``act of state'' to escape the reach of \nAmerican justice. In so doing, our bill will overrule one twenty-year \nold lower court decision which incorrectly failed to recognize that the \nactions of OPEC member nations was commercial activity exempt from the \nprotections of sovereign immunity.\n  The most fundamental principle of a free market is that competitors \ncannot be permitted to conspire to limit supply or fix price. There can \nbe no free market without this foundation. And we should not permit any \nnation to flout this fundamental principle.\n  Some critics of this legislation have argued that suing OPEC will not \nwork or that threatening suit will hurt more than help. I disagree. Our \nNOPEC legislation will, for the first time, enable our Justice \nDepartment to take legal action to combat the illegitimate price-fixing \nconspiracy of the oil cartel. It will, at a minimum, have a real \ndeterrent effect on nations that seek to join forces to fix oil prices \nto the detriment of consumers. This legislation will be the first real \nweapon the U.S. government has ever had to deter OPEC from its \nseemingly endless cycle of price increases.\n  There is nothing remarkable about applying U.S. antitrust law \noverseas. Our government has not hesitated to do so when faced with \nclear evidence of anti-competitive conduct that harms American \nconsumers. A few years ago, for example, the Justice Department secured \nrecord fines totaling $725 million against German and Swiss companies \nengaged in a price fixing conspiracy to raise and fix the price of \nvitamins sold in the United States and elsewhere. Their behavior harmed \nconsumers by raising the prices consumers paid for vitamins every day \nand plainly needed to be addressed. As this and other cases show, the \nmere fact that the conspirators are foreign nations is no basis to \nshield them from violating these most basic standards of fair economic \nbehavior.\n  Even under current law, there is no doubt that the actions of the \ninternational oil cartel would be in gross violation of antitrust law \nif engaged in by private companies. If OPEC were a group of \ninternational private companies rather than foreign governments, their \nactions would be nothing more than an illegal price fixing scheme. But \nOPEC members have used the shield of ``sovereign immunity'' to escape \naccountability for their price-fixing. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities \nAct, though, already recognizes that the ``commercial'' activity of \nnations is not protected by sovereign immunity. And it is hard to \nimagine an activity that is more obviously commercial than selling oil \nfor profit, as the OPEC nations do. Our legislation will establish that \nthe sovereign immunity doctrine will not divest a U.S. court from \njurisdiction to hear a lawsuit alleging that members of the oil cartel \nare violating antitrust law.\n  The suffering of consumers across the Nation in the last year has \nmade me more certain than ever that this legislation is necessary. \nBetween OPEC's repeated decisions to cut oil production and the FTC's \nconclusion for the last several years that there is no illegal conduct \nby domestic companies responsible for rising gas prices, I am convinced \nthat we need to take action, and take action now, before the damage \nspreads too far.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our legislation so that our Nation \nwill finally have an effective means to combat this price-fixing \nconspiracy of oil-rich nations. Thank you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 879\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kohl, the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Antitrust and Competition Policy, by \ncosponsoring once again the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels, \nNOPEC, Act. I thank Senator Kohl for his leadership on this important \nissue, and Senators Specter, Grassley, Feingold, Snowe, Schumer, \nDurbin, Boxer and Coburn the other cosponsors, for their continued \nsupport of this critically important effort.\n  The collusive behavior of certain oil producing nations has \nartificially--and drastically reduced the supply and inflated the price \nof fuel. Put simply, the behavior of these oil cartels, which would be \nillegal under antitrust laws, grievously harms American consumers and \nbusinesses.\n  We have introduced this measure in each of the last four Congresses. \nWe introduce it again today, in our never-ending effort to make OPEC \naccountable for its anticompetitive behavior by allowing the Justice \nDepartment to crack down on illegal price manipulation by oil cartels.\n  This bill will allow the Federal Government to take legal action \nagainst any foreign state, including members of OPEC, for price fixing \nand artificially limiting the amount of available oil. While OPEC \nactions remain protected from antitrust enforcement, the ability of the \ngovernments involved to wreak havoc on the American economy will remain \nunchecked.\n  When the President took office, Americans could fill their cars, heat \ntheir homes, and run their businesses on gasoline that cost $1.45 a \ngallon. Fuel prices have skyrocketed since then. Prices will at times \nfall, but because fuel prices are not properly subject to competition \noversight and enforcement, the American consumer will only benefit from \nlower prices when it serves some other purpose of the cartel and \nforeign governments.\n  President Bush has said he is concerned about gasoline costs and has \npledged that the government would keep a close watch on unacceptable \nprofiteering. It is time for the President to join us in supporting \nthis legislation.\n  Our antitrust laws have been called the ``Magna Carta of free \nenterprise.'' If OPEC were simply a foreign business engaged in this \ntype of behavior, it would already be subject to them. It is wrong to \nlet OPEC producers off the hook just because their anticompetitive \npractices come with the seal of approval of national governments. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill and to say ``No'' to OPEC.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 881.

Mr. President. I rise today with my colleague Senator \nLincoln of Arkansas to introduce the Short Line Railroad Investment Act \nof 2007.\n  More than 500 short line railroads operate nationally, serving nearly \nevery State and account for almost 50,000 miles of track in the United \nStates. By connecting to the larger railways, short line railroads are \ncritical to farmers and small businesses that need to move their goods \ninto the marketplace. Moreover, transporting goods using rail relieves \nhighway congestion by decreasing the number of trucks that would \notherwise move the same products.\n  Railroads are capital intensive and require significant investment to \noperate. Today, the unmet infrastructure needs of the short line \nrailroads total in the billions of dollars. And capacity and physical \ndemands on the short lines continue to grow. The presence of heavier \nrail cars being used today only further exacerbates the need for \ninvestment to meet the infrastructure needs of the short line \nrailroads.\n  Currently a tax credit exists to enable increased investment in short \nline railroads. However, this critical credit is set to expire at the \nend of 2007. Current law allows for a taxpayer to claim a tax credit of \n50 cents for every dollar invested in track rehabilitation. The \nextension of the tax credit for short line railroad maintenance and \nrehabilitation is integral to meeting this need.\n  The enactment of this credit in the 2004 American Jobs Creation Act \nhas encouraged the private sector to increase investment in short line \nfreight rail infrastructure. The ultimate beneficiaries of these \ninvestments will be over 11,000 rail customers employing over 1 million \nAmericans in rural and urban areas.\n  It is imperative that we extend this credit. I propose a 3-year \nextension of this credit through 2010 that will help achieve the \noriginal goal of prompting $1.5 billion in new infrastructure \nimprovements on short line railroads.\n  I urge my colleagues support for this important measure that will \nimprove short line railroads that have such a vital role in the \ntransportation of goods and our Nation's economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, and \n        Mr. Casey):\n  S. 882. A bill to require a pilot program on the facilitation of the \ntransition of members of the Armed Forces to receipt of veterans health \ncare benefits upon completion of military service, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, since the March 2003 start of the Iraq \nwar, more than 24,042 members of our Nation's armed forces have been \ninjured, more than 10,685 of them too severely to be returned to \naction.\n  I have visited these soldiers at Walter Reed, at Fort Dix, and at the \nEast Orange Veterans Hospital. I have heard stories consistently from \nour veterans about fighting against DoD and VA bureaucracy for months \nand even years simply to receive the basic benefits they are owed by a \ngrateful Nation.\n  The controversy at Walter Reed again brings to light the shortcomings \nin the process our returning veterans must deal with in their difficult \ntransition from soldier to civilian. Just as\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\nthe deplorable conditions that have come to light are unacceptable, so \ntoo are the countless stories detailing the maze of forms, hearings, \nand medical evaluations that prevent so many of our veterans from \ngetting the health care and benefits they need.\n  Too often, it seems that rather than thanking the soldier for their \nsacrifice, this system sets up yet another battle of bureaucracy. Too \noften, it seems that the system is stacked against the very soldiers it \nis designed to help. Too often, veterans must seek out their own \ntreatment options and benefits or risk missing deadlines and losing \nbenefits. It doesn't have to be this way. We have an obligation not \nonly to fulfill the promises we make to America's fighting men and \nwomen, but to do so in a manner that ensures the benefits we owe them \nare made readily available.\n  At the East Orange VA hospital in my State of New Jersey, for \ninstance, we have a modern War-Related Illness and Injury Study Center \nthat stands underutilized because many veterans aren't even informed \nthat it's there. Patients whose quality of life could be drastically \nimproved by the technology the center provides miss the opportunity \nsimply because they are not aware the option is available. This country \ncan do better; the will of the American people is to do better; now \nthis government must do better.\n  That's why I am proud to introduce the ``Veterans Navigator Act'', a \nbill that would expand and enhance the important work done by VSOs and \nother non-governmental organizations to guide our Nation's servicemen \nand women to and through the VA healthcare system. It would, in fact, \nacknowledge the work of these organizations by providing $25 million in \ngrants over 5 years to augment their capabilities.\n  The ``navigator'' concept is not new. It is similar to the Patient \nNavigator demonstration program I introduced and which was subsequently \nenacted into law. There, we also took a successful small-scale program \nbeing used at select medical facilities around the country and expanded \nit by providing grants for a scaled-up demonstration program to serve \nthose with cancer and other chronic diseases, and in particular, to \nprovide support to medically underserved populations.\n  With the Veterans Navigator bill, I propose to do something similar, \ncapitalizing on the successes of the Patient Navigator concept, to help \nour troops. The $25 million over 5 years in the bill would allow VSOs \nand other organizations to apply for grants so that they could hire and \ntrain navigators to provide assistance, on an individualized basis, to \nmembers of the Armed Forces as they transition from military service to \nthe VA healthcare system. They would do so in coordination with DoD and \nthe VA. Right now, many VSOs rely principally on donations to perform \nthese services.\n  At the end of the 5 years, the VA Secretary would submit a report to \nCongress on the effectiveness of the Veterans Navigator demonstration \nprogram and recommend whether or not it should be made permanent.\n  Often called National Service Officers or counselors, a navigator is \na ``sherpa'', a guide through the maze of paper and people and \nspecialists and benefits. A navigator is an advocate for those no \nlonger able to go it alone. A navigator is a facilitator, someone who \nwill be with you through the process, to provide the expertise you will \nneed to transition between active duty and veterans status and to get \nthe urgent care you need.\n  Let me be clear: a navigator does not supplant the role of the DoD or \nthe VA. A navigator is meant to complement the work done by these \norganizations, particularly at a time when those systems are struggling \nto meet the needs of the soldiers returning from war and will continue \nto do so long after the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have ended.\n  While all veterans will benefit, the bill focuses particular \nattention on four underserved groups in the military community: the \nseriously injured or wounded soldiers, female soldiers, those suffering \nfrom psychological problems like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, \nand members of the activated National Guard and Reserves.\n  These underserved groups have not been sufficiently served in \nexisting VA and DoD transition programs and activities. It is these \nunderserved groups who especially need continuity of care as they enter \nand wind their way through the VA medical system. Part of the reason \nthey have not been adequately cared for is that the nature of the \ncurrent wars we are fighting, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, is different \nfrom previous conflicts we've undertaken.\n  During the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns, we have the largest \nactivation of National Guard and reservists since World War II. As of \nMarch 12, according to DoD, the United States had 141,000 military \npersonnel deployed in Iraq. Of these, 119,005 were active component \npersonnel and 21,995 were National Guard and Reserves. These numbers \nare set to increase due to the recent announcement by President Bush to \nsend at least 20,000 more troops to Iraq by May.\n\n  The GAG released a report in February 2005 citing deficiencies in \nbenefits for these soldiers. The report concluded that National Guard \nand Reserve soldiers ``are given little help navigating a thicket of \nregulations and procedures necessary to gain access to military \ndoctors.''\n  To complicate matters, members of our National Guard who seek medical \ncare must file for an extension of their active duty status in order to \ncontinue to access military bases and hospitals.\n  In its report, GAG also concluded that, and I quote, ``the Army has \nnot consistently provided the infrastructure needed to accommodate the \nneeds of soldiers trying to navigate their way through the ``active \nduty medical extension'' (ADME) process . . . this has resulted in \ninjured and ill soldiers carrying a disproportionate share of the \nburden for ensuring that they do not fall off their active duty \norders.''\n  The Veterans Navigator Act would help minimize such occurrences by \nproviding National Guardsmen and Reservists someone to help bring them \nthrough the ADME process and to help correct any discrepancies before \nthey cause a delay in accessing VA medical care.\n  Veterans with psychological problems also need help. In the last \nseveral years, we've been hearing a lot more about post-traumatic \nstress disorder, or PTSD in veterans and those returning from conflict. \nThe GAO report concluded that almost four out of five service members \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan who were found to be at risk for \nPTSD were not provided appropriate medical assistance. All of these \nfactors mean that now, more than ever, our Nation's soldiers need help \nmoving between the DoD and VA realms.\n  According to a recent study commissioned by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, roughly 13 percent of service men and women returning \nfrom Iraq suffer from PTSD. GAO has concluded that roughly 78 percent \nof those service members at risk for PTSD do not get further \nevaluation. That means they return to active duty or are discharged \nwithout receiving the appropriate care.\n  It is the nature of this disorder to appear not right after the \ntraumatic event is experienced, but often not until an individual re-\nexperiences an event, has a flashback or is somehow reminded of a \nbattlefield event. That may not happen until after a service member has \nbeen discharged from service. Once PTSD does emerge, the veteran may \nnot know how to access VA medical assistance, or he or she may not have \nyet enrolled into the VA medical system.\n  Again, as in the case of the severely wounded, time is of the \nessence. PTSD can manifest itself so severely as to incapacitate a \nsoldier, making medical care more urgent. In the case of returning \nNational Guardsmen and Reservists, the problem is made more complex \nbecause of the 2-year time limit on filing for VA benefits.\n  Since 1991, opportunities for women in our Nation's armed forces have \ngrown. For the first time, the military is placing women in support \nunits at the front line. This has come partly as the result of more \nthan 10 years of policy changes making 91 percent of the career fields \ngender neutral.\n  The Navy and the Air Force have begun to allow female soldiers to fly \nfighters and bombers. The Army has expanded the role of women in \nground-combat operations. Right now, ``women command combat military \npolice companies, fly Apache helicopters, work as\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\ntactical intelligence analysts, and serve in artillery units.''\n  This would have been unheard of a decade ago, but it's happening \nright now. Right now, record numbers of female soldiers are fighting on \nthe front lines and, as a result, more are being seriously wounded or \nkilled. A Baltimore reporter profiling women soldiers' participation in \nIraq observed that ``the war in Iraq has been an equal opportunity \nemployer, by killing and injuring a historic number of female soldiers \nin combat situations.''\n  Therefore, a VA medical system designed to treat wounded male \nsoldiers must now ensure that female soldiers get the right kind of \nmedical care. They will need help finding that care and getting access \nto that care. A veteran navigator can help them do that.\n  Because of the length and size of the deployment, many more soldiers \nare being seriously wounded. According to the GAO, roughly 30 percent \nof U.S. soldiers wounded in combat during World War II later died. \nToday, that number has dropped to 3 percent for those serving in Iraq \nand Afghanistan due to advances in technology and protective gear.\n  While this is clearly a positive development, it also means that many \nof these injured soldiers are returning home with severe disabilities, \nincluding traumatic brain injuries and missing limbs that require \ncomprehensive inpatient rehabilitation services.\n  But, severe injuries often mean a lengthy transition from active duty \nto veteran status. As my story earlier indicates, the physical \nevaluation of a seriously wounded service member to determine whether \nhe or she can return to active duty can take months to complete. In the \ninterim, the VA has to be able to identify these soldiers so that they \ncan perform early outreach, provided that they have the information to \ndo so.\n  Despite this, the GAO observed in a March 2005 report that the VA \nfaces ``significant challenges in providing services to seriously \ninjured service members.''\n  In many cases, VA staff have reported that seriously injured service \nmembers are simply not ready to begin thinking about VA benefits or \ndealing with the VA system during the recovery process. The problem \nhere, as GAO has pointed out, is that the VA has no policy for \nmaintaining contact with these soldiers down the line, once they are \ndischarged. Contact is often conducted on an ad hoc basis. Navigators \ncan also help these seriously wounded soldiers.\n  VSOs such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American \nVeterans, Jewish War Veterans and so many others have emphasized the \nimportance of maintaining contact with seriously injured veterans who \ndo not initially apply for VA health care benefits because it may be \nmany months or even years before they are prepared to apply for them.\n  The Veterans Navigator can help perform this function. Because this \nindividual or individuals have reached out to the injured service \nmember before his or her discharge, they can, in coordination with the \nVA caseworkers, remain in contact with them as they recover and prepare \nto re-enter civilian life. The navigator can also help obtain \ninformation from DoD on seriously injured soldiers earlier on so that \nthey can help ensure that all service members and veterans benefit from \nVA health care services at the right time.\n  At a time when many active duty service people and veterans have \nfought and often made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, we \ncannot risk having any soldier fall through the cracks. We cannot take \nthe risk that our female soldiers, who are fighting alongside their \nmale colleagues, may not receive the medical care they need. We cannot \nrisk the lives and health of soldiers with PTSD. We cannot risk the \nlives and the health of any service member who put their lives at risk \nfor our country.\n  As we have seen with the situation at Walter Reed, DoD and VA simply \ndo not have the manpower to effectively handle the influx of veterans \ncases coming into the system. With a backlog of over half a million \nclaims, the VA can not adequately address the individual needs of \nAmerica's warriors. Our service members didn't have to wait to sign up \nto serve their country; they shouldn't have to wait and fight to get \nthe benefits they are seriously entitled to.\n  The very least that we can do is to ensure that all of these brave \nmen and women are able to access the medical benefits to which they are \nentitled, particularly in their time of greatest need. At some point in \neach of our lives, we might need a guiding hand to help us find our \nway. Today, I am proposing to provide that helping hand to our troops \nin a time of their greatest need. It is the very least that we can do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 883. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend \nloan forgiveness for certain loans to Head Start teachers; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today with Senator Voinovich to \nintroduce legislation that would expand the Federal student loan \nforgiveness program to include Head Start teachers.\n  Nationwide, only 31 percent of Head Start teachers have completed a \nbaccalaureate or advanced degree program.\n  In California, that number is even smaller: only 21 percent of Head \nStart teachers have completed a bachelor's degree.\n  To prepare Head Start children for elementary school, we must recruit \nhighly qualified teachers who have demonstrated knowledge and teaching \nskills in reading, early childhood development, and other areas of the \npreschool curriculum with a particular focus on cognitive learning.\n  Recruiting and retaining teachers with such qualifications is \ncritical to ensuring that our children start elementary school ready to \nlearn.\n  A survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices, the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES), \nfound that ``teachers with higher education levels were found to have \nmore high quality language activities and more creative activities in \ntheir classrooms.''\n  In order to give every child a jump start in life, we must continue \nto recruit highly qualified teachers to the Head Start field and \nprevent the best teachers from leaving.\n  Many Head Start programs across the country, including in California, \nare losing qualified teachers to local school districts in part because \nthe pay is better.\n  Nationally, the average Head Start teacher earns a salary of about \n$21,000--almost half the amount of elementary school teachers' salary \nof about $43,000.\n  Low pay, combined with increasing student debt, makes it increasingly \ndifficult to attract and retain highly qualified Head Start teachers.\n  We must provide incentives to encourage recent graduates, current \nHead Start teachers without a degree, and college students to enter and \nremain in this important field.\n  This legislation would allow recent college graduates (obtaining a \nminimum of a bachelor's degree), and current Head Start teachers \nwithout a degree, to receive up to $5,000 of their Federal student \nloans forgiven in exchange for 5 years of teaching in a qualified Head \nStart program; and provide Head Start teachers with the same \nopportunity as currently offered to eligible elementary and secondary \nschool teachers to receive up to $5,000 in loan forgiveness in exchange \nfor 5 years of service.\n  Providing our Nation's low-income children with access to highly \neducated and qualified Head Start teachers so that they enter school \nready to learn is critical to their future success.\n  Head Start is the primary Federal program that has the potential to \nreach out to low-income children early in their formative years when \ntheir cognitive skills are just developing.\n  Research shows that Head Start is a smart investment in our \nchildren's future.\n  For example, a 2003 Kindergarten Readiness: Head Start Success study \nof more than 600 graduates in San Bernardino County, CA, demonstrated \nthat society receives nearly nine dollars in benefits, i.e. increased \nearnings and employment, for every one dollar invested in Head Start \nchildren.\n  That is why we must act now.\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\n  Every teacher that the Head Start program loses impacts the quality \nand access to services for our Nation's neediest children, and \nultimately can impact their future success.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Voinovich in supporting \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 883\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill toamend chapter 22 of title 44, United States Code, \npopularly known as the Presidential Records Act, to establish \nprocedures for the consideration of claims of constitutionally based \nprivilege against disclosure of Presidential records; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Leahy, to introduce a bill that would restore the \nAmerican people's access to Presidential papers. This bill is the \ncompanion to H.R. 1255, which is sponsored by Representative Henry \nWaxman, and was passed in the House of Representatives with strong \nbipartisan support.\n  In 1978, this body passed the Presidential Records Act and declared \nthat a President's papers were the property of the people of the United \nStates of America and were to be administered by the National Archives \nand Records Administration, or NARA. The Act provided that Presidential \npapers would be made available 12 years after a President left office, \nallowing the former or incumbent President the right to claim executive \nprivilege for particularly sensitive documents. In order to fulfill \nthat mandate, President Reagan in 1989 signed Executive Order 12667, \nwhich gave the former or incumbent President 30 days to claim executive \nprivilege.\n  However, in 2001, President Bush issued Executive Order 13233, \nnullifying President Reagan's order and imposing new regulations for \nobtaining Presidential and Vice-Presidential documents. President \nBush's new order greatly restricts access to Presidential papers by \nrequiring that all requests for documents, no matter how innocuous, be \napproved by both the former President and current White House. In this \nway the order goes against the letter and the spirit of the \nPresidential Records Act by creating a presumption of nondisclosure, \nthus allowing the White House to prevent the release of records simply \nby inaction.\n  The President's order also limits what types of papers are available \nby expanding the scope of executive privilege into new areas--namely \ncommunications between the President and his advisors and legal advice \ngiven to the President. The order extends executive privilege to the \nrecords of the Vice President for the first time. Also, former \nPresidents can now designate third parties, including family members \nand Vice Presidents, to exercise executive privilege on their behalf, \nmeaning that Presidential papers could remain concealed many years \nafter a President's death. These expansions raise some serious \nconstitutional questions. Deleted sentence. My legislation simply seeks \nto restore a presumption that Presidential records belong to the people \nof the United States and to create a legitimate, streamlined means of \ncarrying out this body's wishes--making Presidential records available \nfor examination by the public and by Congress.\n  The administration shouldn't fear passage of this bill. Any documents \nthat contain sensitive national security information would remain \ninaccessible, as would any documents pertaining to law enforcement or \nthe deliberative process of the executive branch. Executive privilege \nfor both former and current Presidents would still apply to any papers \nthe White House designates. With these safeguards in place, there is no \nreason to further hinder access to documents that are in some cases \nmore than 20 years old.\n  By not passing this bill, the Congress would greatly limit its own \nability to investigate previous administrations, not to mention limit \nthe ability of historians and other interested parties to research the \npast. Knowledge of the past enriches and informs our understanding of \nthe present, and by limiting our access to these documents we do both \nourselves and future generations a great disservice. Numerous \nhistorians, journalists, archivists and other scholars have voiced \ntheir disapproval of Executive Order 13233 because they understand how \nimportant access to Presidential papers can be to accurately describing \nand learning from past events. We here in the Congress cannot and \nshould not surrender our ability to investigate previous Presidential \nadministrations because doing so would remove a vitally important means \nof ensuring Presidential accountbility.\n  I believe it is time for these documents to become part of the public \nrecord. I believe in open, honest, and accountable government, and I do \nnot believe in keeping secrets from the American people. The \nPresidential Records Act was one of this country's most vital post-\nWatergate reforms and\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\nit remains vitally important today. In these times when trust in \ngovernment is slipping more and more every day, we need to send a \nstatement to the American people that we here in Washington don't need \nto hide from public scrutiny--that instead we welcome and encourage \npublic scrutiny. This bill will send just such a message.\n  Franklin Roosevelt commented on the opening of his Presidential \nlibrary in 1941:\n  ``To bring together the records of the past and to house them in \nbuildings where they will be preserved for the use of men and women in \nthe future, a Nation must believe in three things. It must believe in \nthe past. I must believe in the future. It must, above all, believe in \nthe capacity of its own people to learn from the past so that they can \ngain in judgment in creating their own future.''\n  I believe that the American people deserve and need access to \nPresidential records.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 886\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EXECUTIVE ORDER OF NOVEMBER 1, 2001.\n\n       Executive Order number 13233, dated November 1, 2001 (66 \n     Fed. Reg. 56025), shall have no force or effect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 887. A bill to restore import and entry agricultural inspection \nfunctions to the Department of Agriculture; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill with \nSenator Durbin to restore our Nation's agricultural inspection \nfunctions to the Department of Agriculture.\n  This bill would transfer the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection \nProgram--AQI--from the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and \nBorder Protection back to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nService--(APHIS).\n  In 2003, as part of the Homeland Security Act, agricultural \ninspections at all points of entry in the United States were \ntransferred from the USDA to DHS. Four years later, it is clear that \nfewer agricultural inspections are being conducted at our borders and \nports.\n  I have heard this message loud and clear from: California Secretary \nof Agriculture A.G. Kawamura, California Farm Bureau, the American \nLandscape and Nursery Association, the California Agriculture \nCommissioners and Sealers Association, the Nisei Farmers League, the \nNature Conservancy, Environmental Defense, National Wildlife \nFederation, Union of Concerned Scientists, Defenders of Wildlife, and \nthe San Diego County Agriculture Commissioner, the Contra Costa County \nAgriculture Commissioner, and many California farmers.\n  These groups have observed not only the decrease in the number of \ninspections since the Agricultural Quarantine Inspection Program was \ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security--DHS--but also \ndecreased communication between the program and State agricultural \norganizations.\n  Last year, the Government Accountability Office produced a report \nthat highlighted the problems associated with the transfer of the \nprogram from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the Department of \nHomeland Security, entitled ``Homeland Security: Management and \nCoordination Problems Increase the Vulnerability of U.S. Agriculture to \nForeign Pests and Disease.''\n  The GAO study found:\n  The inspection rate at several key American points of entry has \nsignificantly decreased. Inspections decreased in Miami by 12.7 \npercent, in Boston by 17.9 percent, and San Francisco by 21.4 percent.\n  Sixty percent of agricultural inspection specialists believed they \nwere doing either ``somewhat'' or ``many fewer'' inspections since the \ntransfer.\n  Sixty-three percent of survey respondents did not believe that their \nport had enough agriculture specialists to carry out agriculture \nduties.\n  Lastly, 64 percent of the agriculture specialists reported that their \nwork was not respected by Customs and Border Patrol.\n  These statistics are deplorable.\n  The failure to protect our borders from the invasion of agricultural \npests\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\nplaces our farmlands and forests at great risk of infestation.\n  USDA estimates nationally that agricultural pests cost the American \nagricultural industry an annual loss of about $41 billion.\n  In California alone, pest infestations cost my State's farmers about \n$3 billion. This amount includes crops lost in the quarantine, and the \ncost of measures taken to control and eradicate pest outbreaks.\n  The farmers in my State continue to battle against serious \nagricultural pests, such as the glassy-winged sharpshooter, the Asian \nlong-horned beetle, the Mediterranean fruit fly, and many others.\n  During the time that DHS has been in charge of agriculture \ninspections, Fresno County experienced its first fruit fly outbreak, \nquarantine, and eradication.\n  According to the Fresno County Department of Agriculture, a 105-\nsquare-mile area had to be quarantined due to an outbreak of the peach \nfruit fly. The pest is indigenous to Asia, and is believed to have \nentered the country on smuggled fruit carried by an airline passenger. \nThe eradication effort cost approximately $1 million.\n  The interception of pests at inspection points, coupled with the \nelimination and eradication of pest outbreaks, is a top priority for \nCalifornia agriculture organizations. And these groups have asked for \nhelp in improving the agricultural inspection process.\n  But this is not just a California problem. Farmers and foresters from \nevery corner of our country have faced the imposing threat of a foreign \nagriculture pest invasion.\n  Here are just a few examples of the pests that threaten our Nation:\n  The glassy-winged sharpshooter is a devastating new pest for \nCalifornia. Since its migration into California in 1990 from the \nsoutheastern United States, the glassy-winged sharpshooter population \nthere has ballooned throughout southern California. This pest transmits \nPierce's disease, which threatens 450,000-plus acres of winegrapes, \nmore than 330,000 acres of raisin and table grapevines, a crop \nproduction of $4 billion and associated economic activity of $45 \nbillion. There is no known cure for Pierce's disease. The glassy-winged \nsharpshooter also threatens crops such as almonds, citrus, and peaches \nas well as native plants, shrubs, and trees.\n  Citrus canker is believed to have originated in Southeast Asia and \nwas discovered in Florida in 1995. It causes lesions on the leaves, \nstems, and fruit of citrus trees, causes leaves and fruit to drop \nprematurely, and makes fruit too unsightly to be sold. The Federal \nGovernment has spent $378 million for eradication, with little results.\n  The Asian long-horned beetle was introduced to the United States in \nAugust 1996 inside solid wood packing material from China. The beetle \nis a serious threat to hardwood trees and has no known natural predator \nin the United States. The beetle has the potential to destroy millions \nof acres of America's hardwood forests and industries such as lumber, \nmaple syrup, nursery, and tourism accumulating over $41 billion in \nlosses. The beetle has spread to New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and \nCalifornia.\n  In the summer of 2002, scientists detected a new exotic insect in \nMichigan, the emerald ash borer. This insect is an invasive species \noriginally from Asia. To date, it has killed or damaged millions of ash \ntrees in Michigan. It has been detected in Ohio, Indiana, Maryland, \nOhio, Illinois, and in Ontario, Canada.\n  The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture--NASDA--\nrecognizes the impending danger and has first-hand experience of how \ninspections have changed since the DHS takeover.\n  NASDA recently announced that one of its key recommendations is to \nreassign cargo inspection from DHS to USDA's Animal and Plant Health \nInspection Service--APHIS.\n  NASDA explains: APHIS has ``the expertise and communication system to \ncarry out a focused and effective agricultural safeguarding effort at \nour borders.''\n  Our Nation's agriculture is too important to leave open to the risk \nof invasion of agricultural pests. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bill.\n  Let us reprioritize the plant and animal border inspections and \nstrengthen the anti-terrorism mission of DHS by returning the \nAgricultural Quarantine Inspections to its logical place, the United \nStates Department of Agriculture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 887\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 105\n\n       Whereas tragic fires in student housing in Nebraska, \n     Missouri, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania have cut short the lives \n     of college students in the United States;\n       Whereas, since January 2000, at least 99 people, including \n     students, parents, and children, have died in campus-related \n     fires;\n       Whereas more than 75 percent of those deaths occurred in \n     off-campus occupancies;\n       Whereas a majority of the students in the United States \n     live in off-campus occupancies;\n       Whereas a number of fatal fires have occurred in buildings \n     in which the fire safety systems have been compromised or \n     disabled by the occupants;\n       Whereas automatic fire alarm systems provide the early \n     warning of a fire that is necessary for occupants and the \n     fire department to take appropriate action;\n       Whereas automatic fire sprinkler systems are a highly \n     effective method for controlling or extinguishing a fire in \n     its early stages and protecting the lives of the building's \n     occupants;\n       Whereas many students are living in off-campus occupancies, \n     sorority and fraternity housing, and residence halls that are \n     not adequately protected with automatic fire alarm systems \n     and automatic fire sprinkler systems;\n       Whereas fire safety education is an effective method of \n     reducing the occurrence of fires and the resulting loss of \n     life and property damage;\n       Whereas students are not routinely receiving effective fire \n     safety education throughout their entire college careers;\n       Whereas it is vital to educate future generations in the \n     United States about the importance of fire safety to help \n     ensure the safety of young people during their college years \n     and beyond; and\n       Whereas by educating a generation of adults about fire \n     safety, future loss of life from fires may be significantly \n     reduced: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2007 as ``Campus Fire Safety \n     Month''; and\n       (2) encourages administrators of institutions of higher \n     education and municipalities--\n       (A) to provide educational programs about fire safety to \n     all students during ``Campus Fire Safety Month'' and \n     throughout the school year;\n       (B) to evaluate the level of fire safety being provided in \n     both on- and off-campus student housing; and\n       (C) to take the necessary steps to ensure fire-safe living \n     environments through fire safety education, installation of \n     fire suppression and detection systems, and the development \n     and enforcement of applicable codes relating to fire safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3143-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3143-S3145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 106--CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT TO ENSURE THAT THE \nFOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES REFLECTS APPROPRIATE UNDERSTANDING \n   AND SENSITIVITY CONCERNING ISSUES RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS, ETHNIC \nCLEANSING, AND GENOCIDE DOCUMENTED IN THE UNITED STATES RECORD RELATING \n                        TO THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Snowe, Ms. \nStabenow, Mr. Coleman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dodd, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Mikulski, \nMr. Reed, Mr. Allard, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Brown, Ms. \nKlobuchar, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Menendez) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 106\n\n       Whereas the Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out \n     by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, resulting in the \n     deportation of nearly 2,000,000 Armenians, of whom 1,500,000 \n     men, women, and children were killed, 500,000 survivors were \n     expelled from their homes, and which succeeded in the \n     elimination of more than 2,500-year presence of Armenians in \n     their historic homeland;\n       Whereas, on May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers issued the \n     joint statement of England, France, and Russia that \n     explicitly charged, for the first time ever, another \n     government of committing ``a crime against humanity'';\n       Whereas that joint statement stated ``the Allied \n     Governments announce publicly to the Sublime Porte that they \n     will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members \n     of the Ottoman Government, as well as those of their agents \n     who are implicated in such massacres'';\n       Whereas the post-World War I Turkish Government indicted \n     the top leaders involved in the ``organization and \n     execution'' of the Armenian Genocide and in the ``massacre \n     and destruction of the Armenians'';\n       Whereas in a series of courts-martial, officials of the \n     Young Turk Regime were tried and convicted on charges of \n     organizing and executing massacres against the Armenian \n     people;\n       Whereas the officials who were the chief organizers of the \n     Armenian Genocide, Minister of War Enver, Minister of the \n     Interior Talaat, and Minister of the Navy Jemal, were tried \n     by military tribunals, found guilty, and condemned to death \n     for their crimes, but the punishments imposed by the \n     tribunals were not enforced;\n       Whereas the Armenian Genocide and the failure to carry out \n     the death sentence against Enver, Talaat, and Jemal are \n     documented with overwhelming evidence in the national \n     archives of Austria, France, Germany, Russia, the United \n     Kingdom, the United States, the Vatican, and many other \n     countries, and this vast body of evidence attests to the same \n     facts, the same events, and the same consequences;\n       Whereas the National Archives and Records Administration of \n     the United States holds extensive and thorough documentation \n     on the Armenian Genocide, especially in its holdings for the \n     Department of State under Record Group 59, files 867.00 and \n     867.40, which are open and widely available to the public and \n     interested institutions;\n       Whereas the Honorable Henry Morgenthau, United States \n     Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to 1916, organized \n     and led protests by officials of many countries, among them \n     the allies of the Ottoman Empire, against the Armenian \n     Genocide;\n       Whereas Ambassador Morgenthau explicitly described to the \n     Department of State the policy of the Government of the \n     Ottoman Empire as ``a campaign of race extermination'', and \n     was instructed on July 16, 1915, by Secretary of State Robert \n     Lansing that the ``Department approves your procedure . . . \n     to stop Armenian persecution'';\n       Whereas Senate Concurrent Resolution 12, 64th Congress, \n     agreed to July 18, 1916, resolved that ``the President of the \n     United States be respectfully asked to designate a day on \n     which the citizens of this country may give expression to \n     their sympathy by contributing funds now being raised for the \n     relief of the Armenians,'' who, at that time, were enduring \n     ``starvation, disease, and untold suffering'';\n       Whereas President Woodrow Wilson agreed with such \n     Concurrent Resolution and encouraged the formation of the \n     organization\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\n     known as Near East Relief, which was incorporated by the Act \n     of August 6, 1919, 66th Congress (41 Stat. 273, chapter 32);\n       Whereas, from 1915 through 1930, Near East Relief \n     contributed approximately $116,000,000 to aid survivors of \n     the Armenian Genocide, including aid to approximately 132,000 \n     Armenian orphans;\n       Whereas Senate Resolution 359, 66th Congress, agreed to May \n     11, 1920, stated in part that ``the testimony adduced at the \n     hearings conducted by the subcommittee of the Senate \n     Committee on Foreign Relations have clearly established the \n     truth of the reported massacres and other atrocities from \n     which the Armenian people have suffered'';\n       Whereas such Senate Resolution followed the report to the \n     Senate of the American Military Mission to Armenia, which was \n     led by General James Harbord, dated April 13, 1920, that \n     stated ``[m]utilation, violation, torture, and death have \n     left their haunting memories in a hundred beautiful Armenian \n     valleys, and the traveler in that region is seldom free from \n     the evidence of this most colossal crime of all the ages'';\n       Whereas, as displayed in the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Museum, Adolf Hitler, on ordering his military \n     commanders to attack Poland without provocation in 1939, \n     dismissed objections by saying ``[w]ho, after all, speaks \n     today of the annihilation of the Armenians?'' and thus set \n     the stage for the Holocaust;\n       Whereas Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term ``genocide'' in \n     1944, and who was the earliest proponent of the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, invoked the \n     Armenian case as a definitive example of genocide in the 20th \n     century;\n       Whereas the first resolution on genocide adopted by the \n     United Nations, United Nations General Assembly Resolution \n     96(1), dated December 11, 1946, (which was adopted at the \n     urging of Raphael Lemkin), and the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, done at Paris December \n     9, 1948, recognized the Armenian Genocide as the type of \n     crime the United Nations intended to prevent and punish by \n     codifying existing standards;\n       Whereas, in 1948, the United Nations War Crimes Commission \n     invoked the Armenian Genocide as ``precisely . . . one of the \n     types of acts which the modern term `crimes against humanity' \n     is intended to cover'' and as a precedent for the Nuremberg \n     tribunals;\n       Whereas the Commission stated that ``[t]he provisions of \n     Article 230 of the Peace Treaty of Sevres were obviously \n     intended to cover, in conformity with the Allied note of 1915 \n     . . . offenses which had been committed on Turkish territory \n     against persons of Turkish citizenship, though of Armenian or \n     Greek race. This article constitutes therefore a precedent \n     for Article 6c and 5c of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters, \n     and offers an example of one of the categories of `crimes \n     against humanity' as understood by these enactments'';\n       Whereas House Joint Resolution 148, 94th Congress, adopted \n     by the House of Representatives on April 8, 1975, resolved \n     that ``April 24, 1975, is hereby designated as `National Day \n     of Remembrance of Man's Inhumanity to Man', and the President \n     of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to \n     observe such day as a day of remembrance for all the victims \n     of genocide, especially those of Armenian ancestry'';\n       Whereas Proclamation 4838 of April 22, 1981 (95 Stat. 1813) \n     issued by President Ronald Reagan, stated, in part, that \n     ``[l]ike the genocide of the Armenians before it, and the \n     genocide of the Cambodians which followed it--and like too \n     many other persecutions of too many other people--the lessons \n     of the Holocaust must never be forgotten'';\n       Whereas House Joint Resolution 247, 98th Congress, adopted \n     by the House of Representatives on September 10, 1984, \n     resolved that ``April 24, 1985, is hereby designated as \n     `National Day of Remembrance of Man's Inhumanity to Man', and \n     the President of the United States is authorized and \n     requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of \n     the United States to observe such day as a day of remembrance \n     for all the victims of genocide, especially the one and one-\n     half million people of Armenian ancestry'';\n       Whereas, in August 1985, after extensive study and \n     deliberation, the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention \n     of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities voted 14 to 1 \n     to accept a report entitled ``Study of the Question of the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide'', which \n     stated ``[t]he Nazi aberration has unfortunately not been the \n     only case of genocide in the 20th century. Among other \n     examples which can be cited as qualifying are . . . the \n     Ottoman massacre of Armenians in 1915-1916'';\n       Whereas such report also explained that ``[a]t least \n     1,000,000, and possibly well over half of the Armenian \n     population, are reliably estimated to have been killed or \n     death marched by independent authorities and eye-witnesses \n     and this is corroborated by reports in United States, German, \n     and British archives and of contemporary diplomats in the \n     Ottoman Empire, including those of its ally Germany'';\n       Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, an \n     independent Federal agency that serves as the board of \n     trustees of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum \n     pursuant to section 2302 of title 36, United States Code, \n     unanimously resolved on April 30, 1981, that the Museum would \n     exhibit information regarding the Armenian Genocide and the \n     Museum has since done so;\n       Whereas, reviewing an aberrant 1982 expression by the \n     Department of State (which was later retracted) that asserted \n     that the facts of the Armenian Genocide may be ambiguous, the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     in 1993, after a review of documents pertaining to the policy \n     record of the United States, noted that the assertion on \n     ambiguity in the United States record about the Armenian \n     Genocide ``contradicted longstanding United States policy and \n     was eventually retracted'';\n       Whereas, on June 5, 1996, the House of Representatives \n     adopted an amendment to H.R. 3540, 104th Congress (the \n     Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act, 1997), to reduce aid to Turkey by \n     $3,000,000 (an estimate of its payment of lobbying fees in \n     the United States) until the Government of Turkey \n     acknowledged the Armenian Genocide and took steps to honor \n     the memory of its victims;\n       Whereas President William Jefferson Clinton, on April 24, \n     1998, stated, ``This year, as in the past, we join with \n     Armenian-Americans throughout the nation in commemorating one \n     of the saddest chapters in the history of this century, the \n     deportations and massacres of a million and a half Armenians \n     in the Ottoman Empire in the years 1915-1923'';\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, on April 24, 2004, \n     stated, ``On this day, we pause in remembrance of one of the \n     most horrible tragedies of the 20th century, the annihilation \n     of as many as 1,500,000 Armenians through forced exile and \n     murder at the end of the Ottoman Empire''; and\n       Whereas, despite the international recognition and \n     affirmation of the Armenian Genocide, the failure of the \n     domestic and international authorities to punish those \n     responsible for the Armenian Genocide is a reason why similar \n     genocides have recurred and may recur in the future, and that \n     a just resolution will help prevent future genocides: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) calls on the President to ensure that the foreign \n     policy of the United States reflects appropriate \n     understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to \n     human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in \n     the United States record relating to the Armenian Genocide \n     and the consequences of the failure to realize a just \n     resolution; and\n       (2) calls on the President, in the President's annual \n     message commemorating the Armenian Genocide issued on or \n     about April 24 to accurately characterize the systematic and \n     deliberate annihilation of 1,500,000 Armenians as genocide \n     and to recall the proud history of United States intervention \n     in opposition to the Armenian Genocide.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncalling on the President to ensure that the foreign policy of the \nUnited States reflects an appropriate understanding of the Armenian \nGenocide and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights, \nethnic cleansing, and other mass atrocities that made up the Armenian \nGenocide.\n  The President usually issues an annual message commemorating the \nArmenian Genocide issued on or about April 24. This resolution calls on \nthe President to accurately characterize what happened to the Armenian \npeople as genocide and to recall the proud history of United States \nintervention in opposition to it.\n  The definition of ``genocide'' is ``the deliberate and systematic \nextermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group.''\n  Scholars agree that what the Armenian people suffered in 1915 to 1917 \nfits the definition of genocide.\n  The sheer scale of the death toll is evidence of a systematic, \norganized plan to eliminate the Armenians. One and a half million \npeople were systematically and deliberately annihilated, many simply \nleft to die of starvation and exposure.\n  To date, 19 countries and the European Parliament have officially \nrecognized this violence as genocide. Countries officially recognizing \nthe Armenian Genocide include: Argentina, Armenia, Belgium, Canada, \nCyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, The Netherlands, \nPoland, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, Vatican City \nand Venezuela.\n  Thirty-seven States of the United States recognize the Armenian \nGenocide. They are: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, \nConnecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, \nLouisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New \nMexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode \nIsland, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington \nand Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\n  Genocide is wrong. It is evil.\n  It is evil whether its victims are Armenians, Sudanese, Rwandan \nTutsis, Cambodians or European Jews.\n  Not to acknowledge genocide for what it is denigrates the memory of \nits victims.\n  Recognition of genocide is part of the healing process.\n  Reminding the world that genocide has occurred far too often serves \nto help prevent it from happening again.\n  Recognizing the Armenian Genocide takes on added importance in the \nface of the genocide occurring right now in the Darfur region of Sudan.\n  As we recognize the role Americans played in exposing the Armenian \nGenocide and trying to relieve the suffering of the Armenian people, we \nremind ourselves that it is our tradition to speak out and do \nsomething.\n  During the Armenia Genocide, American consuls and missionaries, in \nwhat was then the Ottoman Empire, reported the atrocities which were \ntaking place far from the capital in Istanbul. Our ambassador, Henry \nMorganthau Sr., confronted the Ottoman government with the accusations.\n  Ambassador Morganthau wrote in his memoirs:\n\n       Whatever crimes the most perverted instincts of the human \n     mind can devise, and whatever refinements of persecution and \n     injustice the most debased imagination can conceive, became \n     the daily misfortunes of this devoted people. I am confident \n     that the whole history of the human race contains no such \n     horrible episode as this. The great massacres and \n     persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when \n     compared with the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.\n\n  The American Near East Relief Committee, a relief organization for \nrefugees in the Middle East, raised over $102 million for Armenians \nboth during and after the genocide.\n  As I have said in this Chamber before, the response to the atrocities \nwas the birth of the American international human rights movement.\n  Official recognition of the role Americans played in confronting the \nArmenian Genocide over 90 years ago will reaffirm our tradition of \nprotecting the vulnerable and inspire us to not stand by and watch as \ngenocide occurs in our time.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue of \ngreat importance to the Armenian community. In order to move forward, \nwe must not repeat the mistakes of the past. It is for this reason that \nI have long sought to bring proper recognition to the crimes \nperpetuated against the Armenian people.\n  April of this year will mark the 92nd anniversary of the attempted \nannihilation that occurred in the Ottoman Empire from 1915-1923. \nMillions of Armenians of all ages were subjected to deportation, \nexpropriation, abduction, torture, massacre, and starvation.\n  The great bulk of the Armenian population was forcibly removed from \nArmenia and Anatolia to Syria, where the vast majority was sent into \nthe desert to die of thirst and hunger. Large numbers of Armenians were \nmethodically massacred throughout the Ottoman Empire. Women and \nchildren were abducted and horribly abused.\n  There is one word that describes the horrific attempt to annihilate \nthe Armenian people, and it is genocide. Ironically, while the United \nStates has failed to make that recognition, Adolf Hitler, in defending \nhis own plans to rid the world of Polish people, among others, asked, \n``Who, after all, speaks to-day of the annihilation of the Armenians?''\n  The resolution I introduce today, with my distinguished colleague \nSenator Durbin, calls on President Bush to ensure that the foreign \npolicy of the United States demonstrates significant understanding of \nthe issues surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The resolution encourages \nthe President to commemorate the Armenian Genocide by recognizing the \npersecution and extermination of over 1,500,000 Armenian citizens as \ngenocide.\n  The resolution calls on the President to state that the slaughter of \nArmenians by the Ottoman Empire was genocide and to recall the proud \nhistory of United States intervention in opposition to the Armenian \ngenocide. It is important that the United States once and for all \nreaffirms the incontestable facts of history and allows our \nrepresentatives to speak out about the crimes perpetuated against the \nArmenian people from 1915-1923.\n  It is my hope that through recognition of these crimes our Nation and \nthe entire world community will be able to prevent further instances of \ngenocide, ameliorate relations between Turkey and Armenia, and increase \nawareness of issues such as ethnic cleansing and human rights around \nthe globe.\n  As we fight to ensure freedom around the globe, we must ensure that \nour future reflects the lessons of the past. In this case the facts are \nincontestable. Yes, the Armenian people were victims of genocide. \nGenocide at any time, at any place, is wrong and needs to be confronted \nand remembered. Let us come together to remember that by recognizing \nthat what happened to the Armenian people from 1915-1923 was genocide. \nWe owe it to the victims and to the future of freedom.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as we approach the 92nd anniversary of \nthe Armenian Genocide, I rise today in support of a resolution \nintroduced by Senator Richard Durbin, calling on the President to \nrecognize the Armenian Genocide.\n  Specifically, this resolution would: encourage the President to \nincorporate the memory and lessons of the Armenian Genocide into the \nforeign policies of the United States, and; urge the President to \naccurately portray this terrible episode as ``genocide'' in his annual \nstatement.\n  Between 1915 and 1923, as many as 1.5 million Armenians perished and \n500,000 were exiled by the Ottoman government in a systematic campaign \nof murder, deportation, and forced starvation.\n  Ninety-two years later, nearly all of the survivors are no longer \nwith us. Yet their solemn voices still echo, urging us to remember them \nand work to ensure that their suffering was not in vain.\n  In my 15 years in the U.S. Senate, I have received thousands of \nletters from members of the Armenian-American community in my home \nState of California, encouraging our government to recognize the \nArmenian Genocide. Many of them are descendants of the genocide's \nsurvivors, who immigrated to the United States and, over the course of \na few decades, built a strong and vibrant community in California and \nelsewhere.\n  For the genocide's victims, there can be no justice. But by \npreserving and cherishing their memory, we can begin healing the wounds \nthat still linger.\n  The recent murder of Hrant Dink, a Turkish-Armenian journalist who \nchampioned human rights and advocated Turkish recognition of the \nArmenian Genocide, serves as a chilling reminder of the dangers that \nloom in our silence. An open, informed, and tolerant discussion of the \ngenocide is necessary for true and lasting reconciliation between \npresent-day Turkey and the Armenian people.\n  Equally important, recalling the Armenian Genocide is essential to \nthe prevention of ongoing and future atrocities, including the genocide \nin Darfur. By taking an unequivocal stance against genocide--regardless \nof where or when it occurs--we and other members of the international \ncommunity will send a strong message that such atrocities will not be \ntolerated. Let us remember Adolf Hitler's ominous words on the eve of \nthe 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland: ``Who, after all, speaks today of the \nannihilation of the Armenians?''\n  So today, let us speak loudly. Let us join the hundreds of thousands \nof Armenian Americans in my home State of California and across the \nUnited States, as well as millions of people around the world, in \nacknowledging and commemorating the Armenian Genocide. Let us ensure \nthat the legacy of these atrocities is one of reconciliation and hope. \nAnd let us fulfill the promises our parents made us, and we made to our \nchildren: never again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/14/senate-section/article/S3145-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3145-S3146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 19--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS ON \n                      THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM OF IRAN\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Brownback) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                            S.
