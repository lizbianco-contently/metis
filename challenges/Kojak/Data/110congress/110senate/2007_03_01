Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period \nof morning business for 60 minutes, the first half under the control of \nthe Republicans, the second half under the control of the majority. \nFollowing morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. \n4. I announced last night that there would be a Democrat ready to offer \nan amendment. I am told this morning that individual called and said \nthey are not ready now. We have a Bingaman amendment pending, and I \nunderstand there may be a second degree filed to that. If that is the \ncase, I hope they will do that. I know Senator Schumer will be \navailable to offer an amendment after lunch, 1 p.m. or thereabouts.\n  I say this to my distinguished Republican colleague, Senator \nMcConnell: I don't think it is fair to everybody to have such a \nschedule that is kind of up in the air. I think tomorrow we are going \nto finish around noon. Nobody seems to be anxious to offer amendments. \nIt is unfair to everybody else to be kind of standing around waiting \nfor something to happen. We will stay in session tomorrow after that, \nif necessary, for people to offer amendments. As I indicated, we can \nhave some stacked votes when we come in Monday evening.\n  The Republican leader and I have spoken. I don't want to have to file \ncloture on this bill, but Democrats and Republicans should understand \nthat we can't stand around and think we are going to legislate the last \nfew hours of next week. We cannot do that.\n  I say to people on my side of the aisle and those on the other side \nof the aisle, if they have amendments, offer them. I appreciate the \namendments that have been offered in relation to this legislation. This \nis important legislation. There are still some controversial things \nthat have to be decided. Waiting around is not going to do the trick. \nIt is my understanding the Republican manager of the bill has been \nworking with the administration on REAL ID. According to news reports \nthis morning, the administration is going to offer some relief, and the \nmanagers of the bill and those who are concerned about REAL ID will \nhave to decide if that is enough.\n  I simply say that I wanted to have a lot done today, a lot done \ntomorrow, but I don't think it is fair to everybody when there doesn't \nappear to be a lot of interest. We on our side have hotlined Members to \nfind out who has amendments to offer. There are a few amendments \nSenators have requested to put in line for offering themselves. We are \ncertainly able to do that. But that line has to start someplace.\n  We are going to finish this bill next week.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the majority leader yield for an observation on \nthat point?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think it is a problem on both sides of the aisle. I \nagree with the majority leader, we need to get going. I will give an \nexample, what happened yesterday. Senator DeMint came down shortly \nafter noon\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\nto offer his amendment, was prepared to accept a short time agreement, \nso we could have had a vote early in the afternoon. But in that \nparticular instance, the problem was on the side of my good friend, the \nmajority leader. We were unable to get a time agreement on Senator \nDeMint's amendment until almost the end of the afternoon because there \nwas someone on that side of the aisle who wanted to offer a side-by-\nside. This has been sort of a bipartisan problem both the majority \nleader and myself have in getting this legislation going and getting \nvotes up and handled. Yesterday, the dilemma was basically on his side. \nOn our side, our hands are not entirely clean, either. We are trying to \nget amendments up.\n\n  I happen to agree with the majority leader, we ought to have a full \nday with plenty of amendments. We are working hard to get that done on \nour side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I repeat, I have had a number of people come \nto me and say: You have announced there are going to be votes Friday \nafternoon. We are not having votes Wednesday afternoon; why worry about \nFriday afternoon?\n  I say to everyone, if they have things to do this weekend--and I am \nsure they do--we are going to be out of here around noon tomorrow as \nfar as votes. I leave the door open. If Members want to offer \namendments, they can still come and do so. The managers will be here, \nif necessary, until sundown tomorrow night, when Chairman Lieberman's \nSabbath begins.\n  We want to move forward. For the information of Members, today at 3 \np.m., the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Pace, will be \nin 407 to brief Members who wish to be briefed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2438-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wanted to make a few remarks relative to \nthe TSA legislation the Senate is considering. I do hope we can get it \nfinished. I am a little confused about what we are trying to achieve \nwith the measure that is before us. We have already been through this. \nWe have passed a great many of the recommendations that were made by \nthe 9/11 Commission--actually, most of them, as a matter of fact. It is \nof concern to me that we have a 300-page bill here on what is left in \nthe Commission's report.\n  We are going through a number of the bills that relate to portions of \nthe report that really have nothing to do with enhancing homeland \nsecurity. For example, the 9/11 Commission didn't have anything to do \nwith collective bargaining rights for labor unions. Here we probably \nhad a good reason not to do that. In fact, we had this extended debate \nback in 2002. We found that it was not in the interest of national \nsecurity to provide collective bargaining rights in this instance. Here \nwe are dealing with it again.\n  I guess I am just a little impatient in that we need to move on. I \ndon't think homeland security ought to have the approval of labor \nunions to move forward. The policy would also greatly hinder TSA's \nflexibility to respond to terrorist threats, fresh intelligence, and \nother emergencies, if we did it that way. We need to have the ability \nto move screeners around as schedules are necessary and threats change. \nObviously, in a security bill of this kind, there needs to be the kind \nof flexibility, the kind of management that can be there for the \nagencies that are responsible. The real focus is on the capability to \ndeal with homeland security.\n  Another concern I have, frankly, is a provision relative to the \ndistribution of funding. I understand that urban areas, large areas--\nNew York and so on--have more concerns about security and threats, \nperhaps, but rural areas do as well. We have energy production and \nthose kinds of things. Wyoming originally had $20 million involved. It \nhas dropped to $9 million. We do have military bases there. Large sums \nof money have been unused, and we need to evaluate that distribution \nsomewhat.\n  As we debate the bill, I look forward to supporting amendments that \nwould actually make America safer and that we don't get into areas that \nreally are not directly associated with security. That is what this \nlegislation is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are debating S. 4, dealing with the \nTSA employees, the Transportation Security Agency. The most \ncontroversial aspect of that has to do with the unionization of those \nemployees. We have had this debate before. We had it when the \nDepartment of Homeland Security was created. It was a very vigorous \ndebate. Quite frankly, it held up the bill for a considerable period of \ntime.\n  Ultimately, the Senate and the House decided, with the concurrence of \nthe President, that it would not be a good idea to have these workers \nunionized. But they are Federal workers and they should have the same \nrights as every other Federal worker was the argument in favor of \nunionization. The argument against has to do with the peculiar nature \nof their assignment. They are not Federal workers in the same sense \nthat people working in the Federal Highway Administration, building \nhighways, might be Federal workers. They are not Federal workers in the \nsame sense that people dealing with normal routines are Federal \nworkers.\n  They appear to be, as we see them day to day--as all of us go through \nthe security procedures at airports and we take off our shoes and our \nbelts and we forget our boarding pass because it is in the bin with the \ncomputer and they have to help us recover it and so on--we all have the \nsense that these are fairly routine operations they are going through. \nTherefore, why not allow them to form a union and engage in collective \nbargaining, because this is, in fact, fairly routine work--very \nimportant work, to be sure, but fairly routine. In fact, it is not \nfairly routine, as we have seen during the time this force has been in \nplace.\n  Let me take my colleagues back to the situation before the TSA was \ncreated. Screening was done airport by airport, contractor by \ncontractor, because it was viewed as a routine kind of thing. Like all \nSenators, I travel in and out of enough airports to know that each \nairport is different. In the days before TSA, one never quite knew what \nthey were going to get. You would go through one airport very rapidly, \nyou would go to another and they would be sticklers for detail.\n\n  These people were contracted by the airlines, and they had a wide \nrange of skills and a wide range of training. One of the reasons we \ndecided after 9/11 we would have a single Federal force to deal with \nthis was we wanted a single level of training, accountability, and \ncompetence to cover the entire American system anywhere in the country.\n  I have found that is now basically true. If I go through the airport \nin Philadelphia, I get treated pretty much the same way as if I go \nthrough the airport in Salt Lake City. This, however, has a security \ncomponent that is over and above the screening component.\n  We are in a war with an enemy unlike any we have ever had before, and \nthe primary tool in protecting us in this war is intelligence. This is \nan intelligence war rather than a war between tanks and aircraft \ncarriers and infantry battalions. So when the intelligence turns up a \nkey piece of information in this war, the TSA must be flexible and \nresponsive to its leadership.\n  If we had a series of organized unions, one different in each of the \n450 airports that operate in the United States, we would not have the \nflexibility nor the capacity to respond that we currently have in this \nsituation.\n  Let me give you a few case studies to illustrate what I mean.\n  The most dramatic, of course, was that which occurred when the \nBritish\n\n[[Page S2439]]\n\nintelligence operations discovered there was a plot to blow airplanes \nup over the Atlantic through the device of taking innocent-looking \nliquids onboard the airplane and then combining them to create an \nexplosive bomb on the airplane.\n  I remember a study being done at the University of Utah after this \nwas over, by some of the professors there who looked at it and said: It \nis possible, it can be done, and it can be done fairly simply. They \noutlined how it would be done--something that, frankly, had not \noccurred to anybody as they were setting up TSA in the first place.\n  The terrorists in Great Britain were inventive enough to come up with \nthe idea. As we contemplate the possibility of it being carried out, it \nis truly diabolical. They would have gotten on the airplane, passing \nall screening, gotten together back in the coach cabin--they would not \nhave had to storm the cockpit or try to take over the airplane the way \nthe terrorists on 9/11 did--mixed their chemicals together and had the \nairplane blow up over the Atlantic.\n  That means there would be no black box to recover. The entire \nwreckage of the airplane would be at the bottom of the Atlantic, far \nbeyond any discovery, and the airplane would simply have disappeared \noff the radar scope, with no explanation, no commentary in the cockpit. \nThe pilot would be reporting, if anybody was listening, that everything \nwas fine, everything was normal and, suddenly, the airplane would have \ndisappeared.\n  The terrorists were scheduled to blowup not one plane, but three or \nfour. Can we imagine what kind of uncertainty that would have created \nin the air traffic system worldwide if that plot had succeeded? \nFortunately, the British intelligence agencies discovered it, \ninterrupted it, and prevented it. In the process, naturally, they \nnotified the American intelligence agencies. What did those agencies \ndo? They went to TSA. They went to the TSA leadership and explained \nwhat had happened. The TSA leadership had a security clearance to get \nall the information about the intelligence involved, and TSA swung into \naction immediately.\n  Let me give you some of the details. At 4 o'clock in the morning, \ntransportation security officers arriving at the east coast airports, \nwhere the first flights would take off, were informed there were new \nprocedures. They were instructed in the procedures. They were trained \nvery quickly. Immediately, seamlessly, through the entire TSA system, \neveryone was brought up to speed.\n  The difference between what happened in Great Britain and what \nhappened in America is fairly dramatic. Let me read a commentary that \ndescribes that: ``Passengers in the United States and the United \nKingdom saw two completely different effects of the changes. In the UK, \ndozens of flights were canceled, scores delayed, and a nightmare of \ntravel backups ensued and lasted for days. By contrast, no \ncancellations occurred in the United States as a result of this \nchange.'' None.\n  That is because TSA was nimble; TSA could act quickly. There was no \nconcern about revealing the intelligence source of this information to \nthe leaders of TSA because they were all Government employees, and they \nwere all responsive to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  If collective bargaining had been in place and a requirement for \nunion approval of change of routines, a clearance by shop stewards of \nchange of patterns, to make sure it fit in with the collective \nbargaining requirement--a different series of requirements at different \nairports, as the union would organize Philadelphia but not Baltimore, \nas the union would organize Kennedy but not LaGuardia, as the union \nwould organize Miami but not New Orleans or wherever you might want to \ngo--the patchwork that would occur, if passage of S. 4 goes forward in \nits present form, would create all kinds of chaos in the United States.\n\n  Fear of disclosing the British information might have caused U.S. \nofficials to say: Let's think twice before we describe what is going on \nand why we are doing what we are doing because it might reveal sources \nand methods to people who are not cleared for that and inadvertently \nthey could leak it back to al-Qaida. None of those fears occurred. None \nof those problems arose because TSA was structured from the very \nbeginning to be the kind of agency it is.\n  Another example of what could happen if we allow S. 4 to go forward \nin its present form occurred in Canada. Quoting from a description of \nthat:\n\n       Consider a recent incident in Canada, a nation whose air \n     security system does not have the flexibility like that \n     granted to the TSA. Last Thanksgiving, as part of a labor \n     dispute, ``passenger luggage was not properly screened--and \n     sometimes not screened at all'' as airport screeners engaged \n     in a work-to-rule campaign, creating long lines at Toronto's \n     Pearson International Airport.\n\n  OK, that is the kind of thing we expect. Unions organize for the \nability to do slowdowns or strikes or whatever as pressure on \nmanagement to get what they want. That is what happened.\n  What was the consequence with respect to security?\n\n       A government report found that to clear the lines, about \n     250,000 passengers were rushed through with minimal or no \n     screening whatsoever. One Canadian security expert was quoted \n     as saying that ``if terrorists had known that in those three \n     days that their baggage wasn't going to be searched, that \n     would have been bad.''\n\n  I think it would have been more than bad. If the terrorists had had \nany advance indication there would be that kind of breakdown in the \nscreening activities in Canada as a result of union activity, they \nwould have said: All right, that is the time we go to the airport, we \ngo to the airport in some numbers, we carry liquids with us in our \nbaggage, and we put explosives in our checked baggage because it is all \ngoing to go through without proper screening. The pressures from the \nThanksgiving Day travelers are going to be so high that people are \ngoing to say: Well, just let it go through this once.\n  For the terrorists to strike a significant blow at the United States, \nall we need to do is ``let it go through just this once'' and have them \nhave advance notice of when it would go through.\n  You cannot organize a strike, you cannot organize a work action \nwithout people knowing about it. I am not suggesting, in any sense, \nthat anyone in TSA--unionized or not--would ever be complicit in \nnotifying al-Qaida of the fact that a work action was coming. But al-\nQaida, in a unionized situation, would say: Here is something we want \nto monitor. Here is something we want to pay attention to. Some \ninnocent, inadvertent remark on the part of a unionized member of TSA \ncould easily get back to al-Qaida, and they would say: We are ready for \nthis. Let's go. Here is the opportunity. It is going to come up at \nThanksgiving. It is going to come up at New Years. It is going to come \nup at the Super Bowl or some other situation.\n  Unions look for those kinds of situations where they can get maximum \nleverage for their work actions. It is not hard to figure out where \nthat kind of thing might occur. So if a union is dissatisfied with \nworking conditions at an airport that services the Super Bowl city on \nSuper Bowl Sunday and says: We are going to have a slowdown here unless \nwe get this, that or the other, and the slowdown occurs, it would not \ntake a genius on al-Qaida's part to say: That is where we probe. That \nis where we do our best to get into the system.\n  Once again, if the plot in Britain had borne fruit and three \nairplanes had disappeared off the radar screen, with no advance warning \nand no way to find out what actually happened, worldwide travel would \nhave been disrupted everywhere. The economy not only of our country but \nmany others would have been seriously devastated. The consequences, \ntragic as they would have been for the families of those on those three \nairplanes, would have multiplied across the world.\n  I do not want to take that chance. I intend to support the \nadministration's position, which says: If this provision relating to \nunionization of TSA employees does not come out of the bill, we will \noppose the bill. The President has indicated he might very well veto \nthe bill if this provision does not come out. I hope we do not have to \ngo that far. I will oppose this provision. I will oppose the bill if \nthe provision stays in. If it does go that far and gets to the \nPresident's desk, I will vote to uphold the President's veto.\n  I think the war on terror has taught us we are dealing with an \nentirely different kind of enemy, one who is very patient, one who is \nvery intelligent,\n\n[[Page S2440]]\n\nand one who is very inventive. For us to treat security matters such as \nairport security as a routine kind of task that can be dealt with in \nroutine kinds of training and, therefore, is eligible for routine kinds \nof labor relations between management--in this case, our leading \nsecurity agencies--and labor--in this case, those who are on the \nfrontline of security for our Nation--would be foolish.\n  For that reason, again, Mr. President, I would oppose this bill if \nthis provision does not come out.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN.

But \nif you open this, you will see Camel is offering two for one, two packs \nof cigarettes for the price of one.\n  In Ohio, 20 percent or 134,000 high school students smoke, and each \nyear more than 18,000 children under the age of 18 become daily \nsmokers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that \nalmost 300,000 Ohio children under the age of 18 who start smoking now \nwill die prematurely as a result. Almost 300,000 children who start \nsmoking now will die prematurely as a result.\n  Our Nation's youth, frankly, are almost certainly not aware of these \nstaggering statistics when they try their first cigarette, but we are \naware of it. If we are not, we should be. It is our responsibility to \nmake sure our children are safe and don't fall victim to these \nunhealthy addictions--addictions with deadly outcomes. It is our \nresponsibility to make sure our children are safe and don't fall victim \nto unhealthy addictions.\n  FDA regulation of tobacco products, legislation introduced by Senator \nKennedy, is not only necessary to protect our kids, it will improve the \noverall health of our Nation and save countless lives. FDA regulation \nis necessary because most cigarette manufacturers have proved time and \nagain they have no desire to take the course of responsible action. \nInstead, in an act of morally reprehensible profiteering that \ncontravenes a multistate tobacco agreement struck in 1998, cigarette \nmanufacturers are once again using advertising campaigns to lure \nteenagers into a deadly habit.\n  These unscrupulous business practices especially prey on girls in \nparticular. As a father of three daughters, I take personal offense to \nthis kind of advertising that glamorizes cigarettes. Their latest \ngimmick, again, as I said, is a mailing of a takeoff on a popular \nperfume. They are sending these out, I presume, to hundreds of \nthousands of young women.\n  It strains the imagination that this ad campaign and these kinds of \ntwo-for-one coupons--it strains the imagination to think that this is \naimed at anyone other than 15- and 16- and 17-year-old girls. These \nimages make their way into millions of homes across the country through \nthese mailers, and they reveal, as I said, a prize of two-for-one \ncoupons, even though cigarettes are legal only for 18-year-olds and \nolder. Cigarette manufacturers are literally investing in the premature \ndeaths of our daughters.\n  It is up to Congress to put a stop to it. Lung-related cancers are \nthe fastest growing and now the leading cause of cancer death among \nwomen. As elected officials, we have an obligation to ensure the health \nand safety of those who sent us to the Senate. As parents, we have a \nmoral imperative to ensure our children are afforded the best chance \nfor a bright start. There is nothing ``light'' or ``luscious'' about \ndying from lung cancer.\n  Every year, smoking costs our Nation more than $96 billion in health \ncare costs. The real costs, of course, are the 450,000 lives lost every \nsingle year to smoking-related illnesses.\n  In my home State of Ohio, health care costs directly caused by \nsmoking topped $4.3 billion, $1.5 billion of which is covered by our \nState Medicaid Program--the taxpayers. This is a drain on our health \ncare system. It is a drain on our local communities. It is a drain on \nour Federal and State budgets. Congress must grant, under the Kennedy \nproposal, the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products.\n  We have a responsibility to our Nation to ensure that children are \nsafer and they are not the victims of suggestive marketing by tobacco \ncompanies. Congress has debated the issue of FDA authority over tobacco \nfor nearly a decade. It is time to finish the debate and take action to \nprotect children, protect young women, girls, from this kind of \nadvertising, from these kinds of campaigns because if we take the right \nkinds of action, it will save literally hundreds of thousands of lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Otey\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, like every one of my colleagues, I \nstand in awe of the brave men and women who have volunteered to take up \narms and defend our country. Some are called to make the ultimate \nsacrifice. And so today I ask the Senate to pause in loving memory of \nLCpl DeShon E. Otey of Radcliff, KY. He was 24 years old.\n  Lance Corporal Otey, a marine, died on June 21, 2004, while serving \nwith an elite sniper team sent on a crucial mission in Ramadi, Iraq. \nOtey and three other marines entered the town to target the dangerous \nterrorists who had turned it into one of the most hostile in the \ncountry.\n  To this day we can not be sure how tragedy struck Otey on this final \nmission. After headquarters could not make contact with his team, other \nmarines were sent to find out what happened.\n  Lance Corporal Otey was found killed, shot in the torso. The other \nthree soldiers had met the same fate, and their weapons had been taken \nby the enemy.\n  Just 3 months before his death, Lance Corporal Otey had survived a \nparticularly brutal attack by the terrorists--again, in Ramadi, the \nsite of many difficult battles. Then, Otey was the sole survivor out of \nall the men in his humvee.\n  For his actions as a marine, Lance Corporal Otey earned numerous \nmedals and awards, including the Purple Heart and the Combat Action \nRibbon.\n  Mr. President, though we mourn the loss of this hero's life, we would \nnot mourn how he lived it. Lance Corporal Otey's mother Robin Mays \ntells us he wanted to join the Marines for about as long as she could \nremember. ``All he ever dreamed about was being a marine,'' she says. \n``He was the consummate marine--reserved, soft-spoken, would only speak \nwhen spoken to. He lived for the Marines.''\n  As a student at North Hardin High School, in Hardin County, KY, \nDeShon was an amateur boxer who had several bouts in nearby Louisville, \nKY. He was also a lineman for the North Hardin High football team.\n  But even as a high-school student, DeShon was preparing for the \nrigorous life of a marine. He tested for both the Marine Corps and the \nAir Force, earning high scores. He worked with a Marine recruiter, and \nsometimes the two would go off to participate in war games.\n  DeShon proved to have great prowess with a weapon. He was eventually \nselected to be a sniper, a highly respected position that comes with a \nlot of responsibility and a lot of training. He went on to earn the \nRifle Marksman Badge and the Pistol Marksman Badge.\n  Of course, DeShon had other interests as well. His mother remembers\n\n[[Page S2441]]\n\nthat when he was little, he loved to watch television cooking shows. \nOne night after coming home from work, Mrs. Mays told DeShon and his \nlittle brothers Ronald and Domenique that she would cook dinner for \nthem.\n  But after seeing how easy it looked on TV, little DeShon told his mom \nthat he would cook for the family instead. ``Let DeShon cook!'' cried \nRonald and Domenique in agreement. ``Sometimes he'd create his own \nlittle dinner,'' says Ronald, who says DeShon was a good cook.\n  DeShon joined the Marines shortly after high school graduation. He \nunderwent boot camp in Guam, and during a 2-week-long wilderness \nsurvival course had to eat crabs, snakes and snails. He told his \nmother, ``The snails were the nastiest.''\n  DeShon's passion to excel as a marine was clear to others. ``He was \ndedicated,'' says Ronald. ``He loved what he did. He wouldn't change \nit.'' Eventually, DeShon would recruit three of his friends and Ronald \nto join the Marines.\n  ``He's the reason we signed up,'' confirms Ronald. ``He talked about \nit all the time. He would call a lot, let us know how it was.''\n  Ronald looked up to his brother DeShon, who was four years older, and \nRonald also played football at North Hardin High School. After \nenlisting, Ronald entered the school of infantry. DeShon would call his \nlittle brother often to encourage him and give him advice.\n  By that point, DeShon was calling from Ramadi, Iraq, site of some of \nthe toughest fighting against the terrorists. Lieutenant Colonel Paul \nKennedy, his battalion commander, has said that ``within the blink of \nan eye, the situation [in Ramadi] went from relatively calm to a raging \nstorm.''\n  Lance Corporal Otey joined the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine Regiment, \nmade up of tough, battle-hardened warriors. Their motto is ``Second to \nNone,'' and the battalion patch they wear on their shoulders proudly \ndeclares them to be ``The Magnificent Bastards.''\n  Lance Corporal Otey was a star in this elite unit. And he became well \nknown as a survivor of one of the most brutal battles the 2nd \nBattalion, 4th Marine Regiment would ever see.\n  On the morning of April 6, 2004, terrorists walked through Ramadi's \nmarketplace, telling shopkeepers to close their stores and warning \nthem, ``Today, we are going to kill Americans.'' That day they ambushed \nmarines in four separate, but coordinated, attacks.\n  Lance Corporal Otey was part of a squadron sent in to support another \ngroup of marines that was under attack. He and seven other marines \nentered the combat zone in a green humvee.\n  Suddenly terrorist snipers on the rooftops opened fire. Bullets \npierced the humvee, killing driver LCpl Kyle Crowley and sending the \nvehicle tumbling onto its side.\n  ``I remember when we got to our objective I started to hear `tink, \ntink, tink,''' Lance Corporal Otey later told the Marine Corps News. \n``I was like, `Man, we're being shot at. Get out of the vehicle.' ''\n  Lance Corporal Otey leapt out and took cover behind a wall, calling \nout to his fellow marines to do the same. Bullets whizzed by him--one \neven went through his pants leg--but none hit him. Amazingly, a hand \ngrenade thrown at his feet did not go off.\n  Lance Corporal Otey returned fire and eventually more reinforcements \ncame and successfully squelched the terrorists' attack. Otey was the \nonly survivor of all the men who had been in his humvee.\n  In all, 16 marines were killed in the battle, and 25 wounded. But \nmarines seized several hundred weapons systems from the enemy and \nkilled over 250 anti-American fighters.\n  Lance Corporal Otey called his mother later to tell her about the \nepic battle and that he was ok. During their conversation, she could \nhear several people congratulating her son for a job well done.\n  One of the screenwriters of the Mel Gibson film ``We Were Soldiers'' \neven flew to Iraq to hear Lance Corporal Otey's story, telling him it \nmight be used for a movie.\n  Still, this was little consolation for the loss of his Marine \nbrothers. ``I talk with some of the other guys in the platoon about \nwhat happened, but it still hurts,'' Lance Corporal Otey told a \nnewspaper afterwards.\n  Using the Marine term for a sleeping bunk, he continued, ``Every time \nI walk into our living space I see the empty racks. Those were guys I \nused to talk to about my problems. Now I don't hear their voices \nanymore.''\n  Tragically, Lance Corporal Otey's rack would go empty less than 3 \nmonths later.\n  Lance Corporal Otey was buried with full military rites in Cave Hill \nCemetery in Louisville. Robin Mays points out that DeShon lies next to \na World War II veteran and a Korean War veteran, and 10 graves away \nfrom his grandmother, Mrs. Mays's mother.\n  Nothing can turn this sad story into a happy one for Lance Corporal \nOtey's family. But there is one more chapter to tell. Two years after \nLance Corporal Otey's death, marines in Fallujah killed two terrorists, \na sniper and a spotter, who were preparing to shoot at marines. The \nsniper was using an M-40-A-1 rifle that had been taken from Lance \nCorporal Otey's team that fateful day in June 2004.\n  The marines returned the rifle to Lance Corporal Otey's battalion, \nand Lieutenant Colonel Kennedy hopes to make it a memorial to Lance \nCorporal Otey and all the members of his battalion who were killed in \nIraq. And he believes the chances are strong that the terrorists found \nwith this weapon were among the ones who killed Lance Corporal Otey.\n  Our prayers go out to Mrs. Robin Mays for the loss of her son, and we \nthank her for sharing her memories of DeShon with us. DeShon's \nstepfather, Larry Mays; his brothers, Ronald and Domenique; his \nstepsisters, Mykeba Woods and Shauna Mays; his aunts, Terri Able and \nCynthia Williams; his uncles, Ronald Jeffries and Dwayne Able; his \ngrandmother, Betty Williams; and his step-grandmother Gracie Mays are \nin our thoughts today as well.\n  DeShon's brother Ronald is now a lance corporal in the Marines, \ncurrently stationed in North Carolina. He has a son who's just 19 \nmonths old, and born a year to the day after Lance Corporal Otey was \nburied on July 3, 2004, a day the city of Radcliff dedicated to him. \nRonald named his son DeShon after the uncle he will never meet.\n  No one could ever repay Lance Corporal Otey's family for their loss. \nBut we can honor them today by giving his sacrifice the reverence and \nrespect it deserves. And we can promise that his country will never \nforget his service.\n  But I suspect that the greatest tribute to DeShon will be the little \nboy who will grow up bearing his name. Let's not let that child ever \ndoubt that his uncle was a hero.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2441-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2441-S2442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, first let me extend my condolences to \nthe Republican leader and to the people of Kentucky for the loss of \ntheir courageous native son.\n  Mr. President, I rise this morning because in recent days we have \nlearned, to our great dismay, that this administration has let one of \nour most sacred promises go unfulfilled.\n  In Rhode Island last week I visited veterans convalescing at our VA \nhospital in Providence. On Tuesday, members of Rhode Island's branch of \nthe Disabled American Veterans came to talk with me in Washington. They \ncame to appeal for those returning from the war in Iraq.\n  Of course, there are many brave veterans whom I have met with \nthroughout my State over the past several years at American Legion \nposts, senior centers, Fourth of July and Memorial Day parades, and at \nour many community dinners in towns all over Rhode Island. They were \nmen and women, young and old. They served in our Nation's wars from \nWorld War II to Vietnam to the conflict in Iraq. Like the DAV members I \nmet yesterday, they wanted us to hear what they had to tell us: the \ninfuriating truth that we are failing to support our troops as they \nreturn from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  When we ask ordinary men and women to do the extraordinary and stand \nup and serve in harm's way, we know that we can never fully repay what \nthey and their families have given us. The service of Lance Corporal\n\n[[Page S2442]]\n\nOtey, which we just heard about from the Republican leader, certainly \nemphasizes that point. But we can surely pledge to these men and women \nthat we will give them what they need in the field, and when their \nservice is ended we will care for them adequately. Breaking that \npromise is a dishonor to them and to their sacrifice, and it is not \nsupporting our troops.\n  I believe--as do many of my colleagues--that the best way to support \nour troops would be to deploy them back out of Iraq and define a more \nsensible and responsible strategy against terror. Some on the other \nside of the aisle have claimed our calls for a new strategy in Iraq \nmean we do not support our troops. This argument is truly horrible, \nthoroughly false, and I hope people watching can understand how it \nshows the depths to which this debate has plummeted.\n  To add on that for a moment, I say that not because on this side of \nthe aisle we are too thin-skinned to take a shot in the give-and-take \nof politics. That is the nature of what we signed up for. That is not \nwhat this is about. What this is about is that the battle of slogans we \nare seeing over this important issue for our country right now \ndisplaces the exchange of ideas and a thoughtful and realistic \ndiscussion of what our new strategy options are, and in that sense it \ngreatly disserves the American people.\n  Let's judge the support for our troops within this Chamber and within \nthe administration by real actions, not inflammatory and phony \nrhetoric. By that measure, it is fair to question whether the Bush \nadministration and those in this Chamber who support the President's \nIraq policy truly understand the need of America's veterans--men and \nwomen fighting in Iraq--and those who will soon join them there as this \nPresident escalates this conflict.\n  We want our troops now in Iraq to come home safely. They want to send \ntens of thousands more there. They have sent them without adequate \nsupport personnel, equipment, or armor. Indeed, during the course of my \ncampaign to come to this place, I heard from mothers who had to go into \ntheir pocketbooks to pay for body armor for sons and daughters headed \nfor Iraq because they could not count on this administration to provide \nthem that basic need.\n  Also, we have sent them without adequate assurance that should they \nbe injured in the line of duty, they would be properly cared for when \nthey return. That is not supporting the troops. In America, we have the \nbest doctors, nurses, facilities, and medical equipment. From combat \nmedics to VA hospitals, the military can and does provide our Active-\nDuty military personnel and veterans with medical care that is second \nto none. But despite all this, our military and veterans health care \nsystem has a crushing, all-encompassing problem; that is, access to \nthat care.\n  When service men and women enter the VA system, too often they begin \na long, uphill battle for access to the care and benefits they need to \nget well and rebuild their lives. The war in Iraq has triggered a flood \nof new veterans that risks overwhelming the VA system. Mr. President, \n700,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan are expected to enter the \nmilitary and VA health care systems in coming years at a projected cost \nof as much as $600 billion.\n  According to the Army Times, the number of service members being \napproved for permanent disability retirement has ``plunged''--to use \ntheir word, ``plunged''--by more than two-thirds since 2001. The Army's \nphysical disability caseload has increased by 80 percent since 2001. As \nit attempts to process new benefits claims in fiscal year 2006, the VA \nis experiencing a 400,000-case backlog. Veterans frequently wait 6 \nmonths to 2 years before they begin to receive monthly benefits.\n  These problems are especially acute in the area of mental health. \nMore than 73,000 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan treated by the VA \nsince 2002 have been diagnosed with a potential mental disorder. More \nthan 39,000 have been tentatively diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and 35 percent of Iraq veterans have sought psychological \ncounseling within a year of returning home. But where the VA spent over \n$3,500 per veteran on mental health care back in 1995, it spends just \nover $2,500 today--a drop of close to $1,000 per veteran.\n  These are troubling statistics, but they fail utterly to capture our \ndismay at the reports published over the past several days in the \nWashington Post and Newsweek magazine of the unacceptable living \nconditions for outpatients at Walter Reed Medical Center and the \nstifling bureaucracy that blockades many veterans' access to care.\n  The Washington Post wrote of soldiers living in Walter Reed \nfacilities infested with mold and mice, unable to get new uniforms to \nreplace those cut from their bodies by military doctors in the field, \nforced to bring photos and even their own Purple Hearts to prove to \nfile clerks that they, indeed, served in Iraq. Waiting months, as the \nVA processes benefit claims in what Marine Sgt Ryan Groves called ``a \nnonstop process of stalling,'' these soldiers and their families move \nfrom appointment to appointment and submit form after form, often to \nreplace earlier forms already lost by the system. Many suffer, as we \nsaw on television the other night on ABC, from brain injuries, from \npost-traumatic stress disorder, or from other mental health conditions, \nbut Walter Reed's outpatient facilities lack sufficient mental health \ncounselors and social workers to help them navigate the system.\n  The Post tells us many Walter Reed outpatients now face ``teams of \nArmy doctors scrutinizing their injuries for signs of preexisting \nconditions, lessening their chance for disability benefits.'' Veterans \noften must navigate this convoluted system alone, carrying stacks of \nmedical records from appointment to appointment. The Post quoted Vera \nHeron, who lived on the post for over a year helping care for her son. \nHere is what she said:\n\n       You are talking about guys and girls whose lives are \n     disrupted for the rest of their lives, and they don't put any \n     priority on it.\n\n  The care of our veterans returning home from Iraq should be among our \nNation's highest priorities. For these soldiers and their families to \nfeel as forgotten and abandoned as they do means simply that this \nadministration is not serving them as it should. It is not serving them \nas they served us. It is not supporting our troops.\n  The Air Force Times just reported that soldiers at Walter Reed have \nnow been told not to speak to the media and that the Pentagon has--and \nthis is a quote--``clamped down on media coverage of any and all \nDefense Department medical facilities . . . saying in an e-mail to \nspokespeople: `It will be in most cases not appropriate to engage the \nmedia while this review takes place,' referring to an investigation of \nproblems at Walter Reed.''\n  This administration cannot and must not just bury its failure to \nsupport our troops behind a muzzled spokesperson cadre. I commend our \nArmed Services Committee, including my senior Senator, Rhode Island's \nJack Reed, for that committee's announced hearing on conditions at \nWalter Reed Hospital. I hope they will be relentless in their \ninvestigation.\n  My colleagues and the constituents we represent wholeheartedly \nsupport our troops and our veterans. Anything else one hears is a lie. \nWe believe it is time for our soldiers to redeploy out of Iraq because \nwe believe that is our Nation's best strategy forward in the Middle \nEast and to combat terror. But we also believe that as they serve and \nwhen they get home, we must make good on our promises--our promise to \ntrain and equip them in their service and our promise to care for them \nin their injury and illness. It is our obligation to do this. In the \nface of all we have heard and seen, that obligation, like so many \nothers, has been failed by this administration. I thank the Chair, and \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 4, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 4) to make the United States more secure by \n     implementing unfinished recommendations of the 9/11 \n     Commission to fight the war on terror more effectively, to \n     improve homeland security, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 275, in the nature of a substitute;\n       Collins amendment No. 277 (to amendment No. 275), to extend \n     the deadline by which State identification documents shall \n     comply with certain minimum standards; and\n       Bingaman-Domenici amendment No. 281 (to amendment No. 275), \n     to provide financial aid to local law enforcement officials \n     along the Nation's borders.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is the second day of our \nconsideration of this important legislation that came out with a \nbipartisan vote of 16 to 0, with one abstention, from our Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee. As its title makes clear, \nthis bill is aimed at finishing the job, completing the mission the 9/\n11 Commission gave us to secure the American people while at home from \npotential terrorist attack post-9/11.\n  We had some good discussion in the opening day yesterday. We adopted \nby voice an amendment offered by the Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, which improved the security elements of the so-called visa \nwaiver program, and we adopted in rollcall votes two amendments by \nSenator DeMint and another by Senator Inouye which would codify the \nexisting regulatory framework that creates the Transportation Worker \nIdentification Card, TWIC. This is the system by which, again post-9/\n11, we are doing things we never thought we would have to do. Then \nagain, we never thought we would be attacked by terrorists at home, \nstriking against civilians using elements of our own commercial \nsociety, in that case planes, to try to destroy us.\n  So here we are with these two amendments now that would codify the \nscreening process by which we aim to assure that those working at our \ndocks, and this will be extended more broadly over time to \ntransportation sectors--there is a card now that exists for aviation-\nrelated facilities--to make sure that we have done some screening to \nsee that the people who are now working behind the scenes or even in \nfront of these transportation nodes, which have now in this age become \npotential targets of terrorists, will be people whom we have reason to \ntrust with that now very sensitive responsibility.\n  We return to the bill this morning, and we are moving ahead. There \nare several amendments that I know are being discussed. We have an \namendment my ranking member, Senator Collins of Maine, filed regarding \nthe so-called REAL ID Act that is pending. There are other amendments \nthat are being discussed.\n  I would advise my colleagues and their staffs, if they are hearing \nthis at this moment, that the floor is open. We gather that Senator \nSchumer and Senator Menendez may be coming over with an amendment early \nthis afternoon dealing with port security, but there is nothing before \nus now. If you have an amendment, this would be a good time to bring it \nover.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of my friend and colleague from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Sununu, on the floor, and I yield the floor to \nhim at this time.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue that was \nraised by the amendment offered by Senator Collins to this homeland \nsecurity bill dealing with the REAL ID Program, a program that is \nostensibly designed to improve standards for security and eligibility \nfor a driver's license. One of the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission, was that America needs to find a way to improve the \nissuance of driver's licenses, a process which takes place daily in \nStates all across the country and produces a form of identification \nused for various purposes, in order to ensure that this system is as \nsecure and consistent as it can possibly be.\n  I very much support those recommendations. In fact, in 2004, Congress \nsent to the President an intelligence reform bill that included a new, \nstrong, well-defined process for improving those standards for security \nand eligibility, a negotiated rulemaking process, that brought the \ninterested parties together.\n  Who are the interested parties? States that issue the driver's \nlicenses, the motor vehicle departments we have all visited from time \nto time, the privacy advocates, the Department of Homeland Security, \nand other groups. All those entities that have a shared interest in \nimproving the way driver's licenses are issued, improving the standards \nfor eligibility, improving standards for security and verification so \nthat fraudulent activity is more easily identified and prevented.\n  It was a good process, a sound process, but, unfortunately, as \nSenator Collins and others have pointed out in this debate, back in \n2005, during a debate on an appropriation bill, there was a provision \nincluded that struck down this negotiated process, that cut the States \nout of the process, that superceded all those efforts and simply said \nto the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Government, you \ndecide the standards, you decide the criteria, and then simply require \nthe States to comply.\n  In Washington ``speak,'' that is called a big unfunded mandate, a \nmandate from the Federal Government for the States to do something \nwithout any support of funds to actually implement the decision. It is \nnever a good idea to impose such a stark unfunded mandate. Equally \nimportant, that kind of federalized process takes away an important \nresponsibility that the States have historically had and I believe they \nshould maintain.\n  We shouldn't be taking away the responsibility of the States to issue \ndriver's licenses. We shouldn't be taking away the responsibility for \nmanaging this information. We want to make this a better process, we \nwant to improve those standards, but we should not be cutting the \nStates out and moving toward a national identity card system, which I \nthink is fundamentally unnecessary.\n  Senator Collins, recognizing these flaws in the REAL ID Program, came \nforward with an amendment that at least moves us back toward a \nrulemaking that listens to the States, that listens to local \nstakeholders, that listens to the departments of motor vehicles across \nthe country. I think at the end of the day that kind of an inclusive \nprocess will result in better standards that are less costly, that are \nmore easily implemented, and that ultimately can be carried though more \nquickly than any unfunded Federal mandate ever could.\n\n  Senator Akaka and I have introduced legislation to fully repeal the \nREAL ID Act and bring us back to the negotiated rulemaking that we had \nin 2004. I think that would be the best solution because the applicable \nprovisions of that 2004 intelligence reform bill were well crafted, \nwell thought out, supported by both the States and the Federal \nGovernment, and made great progress. But what Senator Collins has \nproposed, in delaying the implementation of these rules and bringing \nback State participants, privacy advocates, and other stakeholders, is \ncertainly a step in the right direction. I very much hope the \nadministration is committed and sincere in the statements they have \nmade that they understand that States need to be a part of this \nprocess.\n  I support very much what Senator Collins is trying to do. I hope as \nour colleagues listen to this debate they recognize that improving \nsecurity and eligibility standards for driver's licenses does not mean \nthat we have to take rights and responsibilities away from the States. \nIt does not mean that we have to create a national ID card. It does not \nmean that we have to have a national database on every driver in \nAmerica. We can do these things in a way that respects the rights of \nStates, that makes us all more secure, and that is consistent with the \n9/11 Commission report.\n  I thank both the chairman and the ranking member for allowing me the \ntime to speak. I certainly hope that we continue to proceed to adopt \nthe Collins amendment or provisions similar\n\n[[Page S2444]]\n\nto the Collins amendment, and I will certainly continue to speak out on \nthis issue with my colleagues, such as Senator Akaka and Senator \nAlexander and others, who recognized, not this year or last year but \nback in 2005 when this program was forced upon us, that REAL ID simply \ndoes not take America in the right direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin my comments this morning by \ncommending the Senator from New Hampshire for his hard work and \nvigorous advocacy on this issue. He has been a very early voice, \npointing out the unfairness of this unfunded mandate on the States, \nunfunded mandates that the National Governors Association estimates may \ncost $11 billion over the next 5 years. He has also raised very \nimportant concerns about the privacy implications of some of the \nprovisions of the REAL ID Act.\n  He was a strong supporter of the approach that we took in 2004 as \npart of the Intelligence Reform Act when we set up a negotiated \nrulemaking process which would bring all of the stakeholders to the \ntable--State governments, Federal agencies, privacy advocates, \ntechnological experts--and clearly that would have been a far better \nway to proceed. The Senator from New Hampshire is one of the Senate's \nforemost advocates for privacy. He has brought that issue up, and his \nconcerns about privacy and civil liberties, on other legislation such \nas the PATRIOT Act that has been before the Senate. I thank him for his \nleadership on this important issue.\n  I do have some good news to report to my colleagues about the pending \nregulations for the REAL ID Act. As many of my colleagues are aware, \none of the problems that the States have had is the Department of \nHomeland Security had yet to issue the regulations giving States the \ndetailed guidance on how to comply with the REAL ID Act. This is a \nmajor problem for the States because of the looming deadline of May of \nnext year by which time they are supposed to be in full compliance with \nthe law, despite the fact that the regulations had not been issued. It \nwas that concern, the long delay by the Department, the cost and the \ncomplexity of the task, and the privacy and civil liberty implications \nthat led several of us to come together and offer an amendment that \nwould have a 2-year delay in compliance with the REAL ID Act.\n  I am pleased to inform my colleagues that as the result of some \nrather spirited negotiations with the Department of Homeland Security \nthat the Department will announce later today regulations that would \ngive any State that asks an automatic, virtually, 2 years--it could be \nmore than 2 years in some cases--but a 2-year delay in the requirement \nto comply with the REAL ID Act. This is significant progress. The \nDepartment has finally recognized that it simply was unfair to impose \nthis burden on the States, to set such an unrealistic compliance date \nwhen the Department had failed to issue the regulations. So the \nDepartment will be announcing today that any State that seeks an \nadditional 2 years to comply with the regulations will be granted that \nextension. This is major progress.\n  In addition, the Department will announce that it will reconvene the \nmembers of the negotiated rulemaking committee that was established by \nthe 2004 Intelligence Reform Act and subsequently repealed by the REAL \nID Act to come together and to comment on the Department's regulations. \nAgain, this reflects a major principle in the Collins amendment: that \nwe should have a 2-year delay to allow for additional compliance time \nbut that we should also reconvene the negotiated rulemaking committee, \nthe committee that is comprised of State officials--in fact, Maine's \nown secretary of state was one of the officials on the committee--and \nprivacy experts, technological experts, all the stakeholders would be \nreconvened to formally review the proposed regulations and provide the \nDepartment with the benefit of this committee's insight.\n\n  That is what should have happened in the first place but, certainly, \ngiven where we are now, this is another very positive step that the \nDepartment is taking. It reflects the principles in the amendment that \nI and others offered yesterday. It is obvious that the pending \namendment provided a great deal of impetus for the Department to \nundertake these revisions in the proposed regulations.\n  These two major concessions by the Department--the extension for \ncompliance and the reconvening of the negotiated rulemaking committee--\nare major steps forward, but they do not solve all of the issues and \nall of the problems with the REAL ID Act, the biggest of which is the \nhuge cost of compliance. Along with Senator Alexander and others--\nSenator Sununu, Senator Carper, Senator Akaka, and others who had been \nactive on this issue--I am pledging today to continue to work very \nclosely with our State leaders and with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to calculate what the actual costs of compliance are going to \nbe--that is going to be easier to do now that the regulations are \nfinally being issued--and to work to try to find some funding to assist \nStates with the cost of compliance.\n  To date, Congress has only appropriated about $40 million to help the \nStates comply with the REAL ID Act, and the Department, I am told, has \nonly allocated about $6 million of that $40 million. So there is some \nadditional money in the pipeline, but if in fact the cost is as high as \nthe National Governors Association and the National Conference of State \nLegislatures estimate, that $40 million is a drop in the bucket. The 5-\nyear cost estimated by the NGA is $11 billion. Clearly, if the costs do \nprove to be in that neighborhood, if they are that high, we have an \nobligation to come forward and assist the States in the cost of \ncompliance. It can be a shared responsibility, but surely, since we \nimposed the mandate, we should be providing some of the funding that is \nneeded.\n  I am very happy the amendment that I and several of our colleagues \nhave offered has prompted the Department to take a second look at its \nregulations, to realize that it was simply unreasonable to expect the \nStates to comply by May of next year when the Department has been so \ntardy in issuing the regulations. And I am pleased that the Department \nhas changed its mind. I thank Secretary Chertoff for working closely \nwith me and for listening to all of us who were raising these \nconcerns--that it was simply unreasonable to expect States to be in \nfull compliance by May of next year when they did not have the detailed \nguidance from the Department.\n  I am also very pleased the Department is going to reconvene the \nnegotiated rulemaking committee members. That will give the Department \nfurther input and insights and improve the quality of the final \nregulations.\n  There is still much work to be done, particularly in the funding \narea, but this is certainly great progress, a welcome development, and \na major step forward by the Department. I again thank Secretary \nChertoff for working so closely with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Collins for her \nleadership and for having created a context in which the administration \nnow has come forward, finally, with the regulations pursuant to the so-\ncalled REAL ID Act, which does create some flexibility for States to \ncomply with the requirement but also doesn't eliminate it because it is \nan important one. This is in the nature of this glorious governmental \nsystem of ours, the wisdom of the Founders more than two centuries ago \nto create the checks and balances. The legislature acts, Congress acts, \nthe executive branch begins to work on implementation, States--this \ncould actually be a textbook. Incidentally, I said to my friend I \ncannot say enough that it was my honor, too many years ago, in teaching \na course at Yale to have the current occupant of the chair, the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Brown, as my student. He learned very well. He taught me \na lot, actually, as time went on. This sounds like we are back in the \nclassroom talking about the relationships in government.\n  It was, I believe, the advocacy of Senator Collins that produced a \nreasonable result without the need for a specific legislative action. I \ndo want to go back and set this in context because the overall purpose \nis a critically important one to the quest for homeland security. The \n9/11 committee found that all but one of the 9/11 hijackers,\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\nthe terrorists who attacked us that day, obtained American \nidentification documents, some--I hate to use the word, but--legally, \nwhich is to say they complied with the requirements for that \nidentification, and then some others by fraud. The 9/11 Commission \nrecommended that the Federal Government set standards for the issuance \nof driver's licenses and identification cards.\n  Driver's licenses are the most commonly used form of personal \nidentification by people in this country. For a long time, what was \nidentification about? It was simply that--maybe for credit purposes, \nmaybe to get into a facility. Now identification is loaded with \ntremendous implications for security and abuse that go beyond financial \nfraud, which is what we were primarily concerned about before.\n  The 9/11 Commission made this recommendation for national standards \nfor driver's licenses and other forms of ID cards. They saw it as \nimportant to protecting the Nation against terrorism post-9/11 because \noften--it is very important to think about this--ID cards are the last \nline of defense against terrorists entering controlled areas such as \nairplanes or secure buildings. Obviously, it is important that we know \nexactly who those people are, that they are what the card says they \nare, and that they haven't obtained that card through fraud.\n  In 2004, as part of the legislative effort successfully completed to \nadopt the proposals of the 9/11 Commission and put them into law, \nSenator Collins, Senator McCain, and I drafted provisions to implement \nthis recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. I am pleased to say that we \ndid so with input from both sides of the political aisle and all \ninterested constituencies to increase security for issuing driver's \nlicenses. Our language was endorsed by State and local governments, by \nthe administration, and by a range of immigration, privacy, and civil \nliberties advocacy groups. In fact, our provisions to create national \nstandards for State issuance of driver's licenses were enacted into law \nas part of the 2004 intelligence reform legislation.\n  In 2005, beginning in the other body, so to speak, the House of \nRepresentatives, the REAL ID Act was included in a supplemental \nappropriations bill providing emergency funding for our troops. The \nREAL ID Act repealed the provisions I have spoken of that Senator \nCollins, Senator McCain, and I and others had put into the 9/11 \nlegislation the previous year. In place of what I still believe was our \nworkable and balanced program, which would have achieved the aims the \n9/11 Commission gave us, the REAL ID Act imposed very difficult and, in \nsome cases, unrealistic and, of course, unfunded requirements on States \nto verify identification documents by plugging into a series of \ndatabases that require technological changes that are expensive and, as \nis happening right now, delaying the actual implementation of a \nnational set of standards which would have guaranteed us that driver's \nlicenses and other ID cards are more secure.\n  The fact is, REAL ID obviously, if it did not have this escape valve \nopened up as a result of Senator Collins' work, would slow down the \nissuance of driver's licenses to everyone and, I fear, might even \nincrease the risk of identity theft. Notwithstanding that, if I had my \ndruthers, as they used to say, I would go back to the provision we had \nin the original 9/11 legislation, but we are not there. The REAL ID Act \nis law, and it is beginning to be implemented.\n  The most important thing we can do is not pull away from the goal \nwhich remains critically important to our national security in the war \nagainst the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and want to do it again; \nthat is, to make sure our driver's licenses and other forms of identity \nare tamper-proof and real.\n  We have now struck a balance, with the initiative of Senator Collins \nand others and the response of the Department of Homeland Security this \nmorning. We still have the goal, and we are going to implement it in a \nmore balanced and reasonable fashion. But it is critically important \nnot to move away from the goal. The goal is fundamental to the security \nof each and every American. Yes, it is going to be a little harder to \nget the driver's license but not a lot harder. What it is going to mean \nto everybody is that we can feel more secure when we get on a plane, \nwhen we go into a secure building, when we just move about enjoying the \nfreedom and way of life we are blessed to enjoy as Americans.\n  I thank Senator Collins for her leadership and the good result. I \nremind colleagues that the floor is open for business. We welcome \namendments.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Amendments Nos. 291 and 292 to Amendment No. 275, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I have two amendments at the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside and that the \ntwo amendments I have at the desk be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes \n     amendments numbered 291 and 292 en bloc to amendment No. 275.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendments be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 291\n\n       (Purpose: To ensure that the emergency communications and \ninteroperability communications grant program does not exclude Internet \n                Protocol-based interoperable solutions)\n\n       On page 121, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       ``(k) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed or interpreted to preclude the use of funds \n     under this section by a State for interim or long-term \n     Internet Protocol-based interoperable solutions, \n     notwithstanding compliance with the Project 25 standard.''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 292\n\n     (Purpose: To expand the reporting requirement on cross border \n   interoperability, and to prevent lengthy delays in the accessing \n  frequencies and channels for public safety communication users and \n                                others)\n\n       On page 361, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n       (c) International Negotiations to Remedy Situation.--Not \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of the Department of State shall report to \n     Congress on--\n       (1) the current process for considering applications by \n     Canada for frequencies and channels by United States \n     communities above Line A;\n       (2) the status of current negotiations to reform and revise \n     such process;\n       (3) the estimated date of conclusion for such negotiations;\n       (4) whether the current process allows for automatic \n     denials or dismissals of initial applications by the \n     Government of Canada, and whether such denials or dismissals \n     are currently occurring; and\n       (5) communications between the Department of State and the \n     Federal Communications Commission pursuant to subsection \n     (a)(3).\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I offer this morning two amendments that \nexpand on the work we did in the Commerce Committee dealing with the \nimplementation of September 11 recommendations; in particular, in the \narea of interoperability, meaning, quite simply, the continued effort \nof State, local, and Federal law enforcement to put in place \ncommunications systems that work reliably, effectively, robustly, and \nthat work effectively with one another.\n  The first amendment deals with the grant programs which have been \nestablished in law already and which are expanded under the legislation \nbefore us. Those grant programs support the purchase of equipment to \nexpand and improve our interoperability for homeland security purposes. \nIt is essential that we make sure that to the greatest extent possible, \nwe look at all available technologies for meeting these goals--in \nparticular, we make sure we don't preclude any funding from going to \nthe Internet-based or IP-enabled services and software and \ncommunications systems that are more and more a part of our daily \nlives. Members of the Senate are often seen roaming the hallways of the \nCapitol with their Blackberrys, for example. More and\n\n[[Page S2446]]\n\nmore, these devices operate like a Palm or a Treo, using IP-enabled \nsystems. These systems are improving. They are getting more robust. \nThey are becoming ever more reliable.\n  The language I offer today simply states that those IP-enabled \ntechnologies which can help improve interoperability should not be \nprecluded from receiving funds under any of the grant programs in this \nlegislation. We have such language already that applies to the NTIA \nwhich is under the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, but I want \nto make sure that language is included throughout the bill. I don't \nthink we should be picking technological winners and losers, but we \nwant to make sure some of the most promising technologies out there at \nleast are put on a level playing field with older alternatives.\n  The second amendment I offer deals with the issue of cross-border \ninteroperability, which simply means communications in areas of the \ncountry where we border a foreign country. The northern part of the \ncountry--New Hampshire, Maine, Vermont, New England States--shares a \nborder with our neighbor Canada, and there are certainly issues in the \nsouthern part of the country with our neighbor Mexico. But there are \nalways questions about awarding or distributing spectrum channels for \ncommunication that would be used by State or local homeland security or \nlaw enforcement issues in those border areas because we don't want to \nengage in policies that unnecessarily interfere with the efforts of the \ncommunication of our foreign neighbors. Unfortunately, there have been \na lot of delays in making spectrum available in those cross-border \nareas.\n  We have language again in part of the bill that I included in the \nCommerce Committee that applies to the FCC to look at the issues \nassociated with awarding spectrum for cross-border interoperability, to \nfind out why there have been delays, find out what can be done to \naccelerate this process, so in those parts of the country that are \naffected by cross-border interoperability, we can serve law enforcement \neffectively. We have some reporting requirements to look at this issue \nwithin the FCC.\n  My second amendment would extend that language to ask the State \nDepartment, which has obvious responsibility in maintaining and \nimproving our relations with foreign countries, to also look at these \nquestions.\n  So these are the two amendments. They expand on work that was \naccepted in a broad, bipartisan consensus in the Commerce Committee. I \nhope my colleagues will have an opportunity today to look at these \namendments. I sincerely ask for their support.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Hampshire. \nThese sound like two very constructive, sensible amendments. We will \ntake a look at them and be in touch with him. But I am optimistic we \nwill want to support these amendments. They improve the basic \narchitecture of the bill, and particularly in the critical area of \nestablishing programs of Federal support for the first time that will \nenable States and localities, consistent with a plan--not just willy-\nnilly but consistent with a plan--to finally make communications \ninteroperable so our first responders can talk to one another in times \nof crisis.\n  I thank my friend from New Hampshire for his initiative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to let the Senator from New \nHampshire know we are reviewing his two amendments. Based on what he \ntold me, I, too, am inclined to agree to them, and I will be working \nwith the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Connecticut to \ntry to get the two amendments cleared.\n  I certainly appreciate, coming from a border State, the concerns the \nSenator from New Hampshire has about U.S.-Canadian issues that might \naffect interoperability of communications equipment. That has been an \nissue for us in Maine as well.\n  I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 277\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, shortly, I am going to ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw the Collins amendment No. 277, which is cosponsored \nby Senators Alexander, Cantwell, Carper, Chambliss, Mikulski, \nMurkowski, and Snowe. It also has received support from Senator Sununu \nthis morning, who was very eloquent in his comments about the \nimplementation of the REAL ID Act.\n  I ask to withdraw my amendment in light of the tremendous progress we \nhave been able to make with the Department of Homeland Security over \nthe last 24 hours in convincing the Department to modify the \nregulations which it is releasing today to allow about 2 years of \nadditional time for compliance with the REAL ID mandates and also to \nreconvene the negotiated rulemaking committee to take a look at those \nregulations and provide their insights and input to the Department so \nthe Department can take them into account in issuing the final \nregulations.\n  Now, I consider this to be tremendous progress. It is a very welcomed \ndevelopment. The Department's actions reflect the two primary \nobjectives I outlined yesterday for my amendment: first, to give the \nFederal Government and States the time and flexibility needed to come \nup with an effective system to provide secure driver's licenses without \nunduly burdening the States and, second, to involve experts from the \nStates, from the technology industry, as well as privacy and civil \nliberty advocates--to bring them back to the table and give them a \nchance to work on these regulations and to improve them.\n  I am very pleased to say over the course of the past week our \namendment has received a great deal of support from a number of \nsources. The National Governors Association praised our amendment for \nproviding States:\n\n     a more workable time frame to comply with federal standards, \n     ensure necessary systems are operational and enhance the \n     input states and other stakeholders have in the \n     implementation process.\n\n  The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, in \na letter to all Senators that was sent on February 27, said:\n\n       We strongly urge you to support an amendment offered by \n     Senator Collins that would delay implementation of \n     requirements under the REAL ID Act. . . .\n\n  The letter goes on to outline the organization's concerns about the \ncosts to States, the capacity for States to meet the REAL ID \nrequirements, and privacy issues and concludes:\n\n       The Collins amendment provides the opportunity to address \n     these matters.\n\n  Similarly, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the NCSL, \nwith which we have worked very closely, in a statement on February 20, \nsaid this legislation would help ``address state concerns over the Real \nID Act. . . .''\n  To this support has been added the voices of Senator Alexander, \nSenator Chambliss, Senator Sununu, and cosponsors on both sides of the \naisle. One of the very first cosponsors is a former Governor who \nunderstands very well the implications for States of complying with the \nREAL ID Act. That individual is Senator Carper of Delaware.\n  So we have been able to build a broad bipartisan coalition, and that \ngave us the strength to prompt the Department of Homeland Security to \nmake the changes as a result of recent, extended discussions with the \nDepartment. As a result, we can now say the primary concerns we have \naddressed with our amendment have been addressed in the Department's \nproposed regulations.\n  In the regulations being announced this morning, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security will commit to granting a waiver to any State that \nasks for it through December 31 of 2009. States will not be required to \nmake a complicated case for the waiver. The Secretary has recognized \nthe delay in the Department's promulgation of the draft regulations is \nreason enough to give States an additional 2 years before they need to \nbegin producing REAL ID-\n\n[[Page S2447]]\n\ncompliant driver's licenses. I am pleased the Department has taken this \nstep.\n  In addition, the Department has agreed, as I have mentioned, to \ninvite the members of the negotiated rulemaking committee--which was \ncreated by the 2004 Intelligence Reform Act, and subsequently repealed \nby the REAL ID Act, just when they were making great progress--to come \nto the Department and discuss, in person, their specific concerns about \nthe regulations. The provisions announced today are in line with the \nneed for more time and the inclusion of all interested parties that \nwere the two primary goals of our amendment. These provisions, of \ncourse, are part of a much larger regulation that will take us time to \nreview, to consult with the States on, and to comment on. I am going to \nfollow closely the whole notice and comment period. I am sure I will be \nsuggesting changes to the regulations, and I will be working closely \nwith the negotiated rulemaking committee to make sure the regulations \nare modified further down the line.\n\n  I am under no illusions that there are not further issues which need \nto be addressed about the REAL ID Act. We must look closely at the \nconcerns that privacy advocates have raised about potentially having \ninterlocking databases among the States so that information is shared. \nThere are a lot of questions, such as who would have access to that \ninformation, how secure it would be, and how correct it would be. There \nis a lot of work to be done.\n  Most of all, we need to get an accurate estimate of how much this \nprogram is going to cost the States and how we can help them bear those \ncosts. This does remain a huge unfunded Federal mandate on our States. \nThe NGA, as I have said several times, has estimated the cost at $11 \nbillion over the next 5 years. That is an enormous burden for States to \nbear.\n  We also have to determine if the technological demands that will be \nimposed on States by these regulations are, in fact, feasible. But I am \nvery pleased to note that our efforts with the Department have achieved \nthe goals that we set out in offering our amendment. There is further \nwork to be done on the REAL ID Act, but we certainly have made \ntremendous progress over the past 24 hours.\n  I thank all of the cosponsors of the bill: Senators Alexander, \nCarper, Cantwell, Chambliss, Snowe, Mikulski, and Murkowski for their \nstrong, bipartisan support, and I thank all of the outside \norganizations, including the Governors and the State legislatures, who \nhave worked so closely with us. I hope we will continue our partnership \nas we make real progress in improving the REAL ID Act.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 277 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, at this time, recognizing the tremendous progress we \nhave made, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 277 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, again, I congratulate Senator Collins \nfor having achieved the purpose of her amendment without having to put \nit formally on the bill, and I look forward to seeing the Department \nmove ahead in a more cooperative way with the States to achieve the \npurposes that the 9/11 Commission set out, which is to make the ID \ncards more secure to protect the rest of us Americans from those who \nwould abuse those identity cards. It is a great accomplishment for my \nfriend from Maine.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to voice my strong opposition \nto section 803 of S. 4 and urge my colleagues to join me in advocating \nits removal from this important piece of legislation.\n  What is section 803? This provision would permit TSA's transport \nsecurity officers, our Nation's airport security screeners, to engage \nin collective bargaining, a change that was not among the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Let me repeat that: it was not \namong the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  At first, some may look at it and say: Why not? The professionals at \nTSA are Federal employees. As such, they cannot strike. They can \nalready join a union, so why not permit collective bargaining?\n  As a former union member and one who believes in collective \nbargaining as a general rule, I can see why many believe that such a \nrequest is reasonable. Unfortunately, as much in life is, the devil is \nin the details.\n  The fact remains that we as a nation are at war. Through the hard \nwork and dedication of our Armed Forces and civil servants such as \nthose at TSA, our Nation has, so far, been spared further tragedies \nsuch as those that occurred on September 11, 2001. However, our past \nsuccess must not lull us into a false sense of security. Those who wish \nto undermine and even destroy Western civilization have been beaten \nback but still remain a potent adversary. Al-Qaida is a sophisticated \nenemy which searches for our weaknesses and attempts to devise ways to \nexploit our vulnerabilities. The surest way to play into their hands is \nto act in a ``business as usual'' manner. In order to defeat this \nenemy, we must be nimble, we must constantly change our tactics and \nstrategies, and we must be flexible and unpredictable.\n  That is why the American people demanded that we create the TSA. The \npeople saw that our Nation required a professional Government agency \nwhose primary purpose is to keep the traveling public safe, an agency \nthat consists of experts who can identify terrorists and their plots \nbefore they board an aircraft or other mode of transport.\n  So what has this to do with the ability of TSA employees to engage in \ncollective bargaining? If one looks at the details, it has everything \nto do with TSA's ability to keep several steps ahead of the terrorists. \nWe all know one of the central aspects of any collective bargaining \nagreement is setting the conditions by which an employee works. When a \nperson works, where they work, and how they work are matters which are \nopen to negotiation. Obviously, efficiency and productivity, for better \nor worse, can be dramatically affected by a collective bargaining \nagreement.\n  So how would this affect TSA's operations? One must remember the \nevents of this past summer. In August, the security services of the \nUnited Kingdom discovered a well-organized conspiracy that reportedly \nsought to blow up commercial aircraft in flight using liquid explosives \ndisguised as items commonly found in carry-on luggage. Within 6 hours, \ndue to their professionalism and the current flexibility of their work \nstructure, TSA's Transportation Security Officers were able to make \nquick use of this highly classified information and train and execute \nnew security protocols designed to mitigate this threat. In six hours \nthat is impressive.\n  In contrast to this history of success and impressive performance, \nthe possibility of collective bargaining only raises questions and \nuncertainties. For example, should the Government have to bargain in \nadvance of what actions it can or cannot take when dealing with an \nemergency situation? If so, how would we know what to bargain for? \nRemember, before the events of September 11, what rational person would \nhave thought of using a commercial aircraft as a suicide bomb? What \nother heinous act might occur that we have not contemplated? Remember, \nthis is an enemy that uses surprise.\n  Other questions come to mind. If timely intelligence is gathered that \nrequires an immediate change in TSA's operation, does the Government \nhave to inform a private entity such as the union? Do we not wish to \npreserve the maximum level of flexibility not only to catch terrorists \nbut to provide a secure situation where the business of the Nation can \ncontinue unmolested?\n  Another example of the flexibility of the current system can be found \nduring this winter's snow storms in Denver. Local TSA officials were \noverwhelmed by the influx of stranded and newly arriving passengers. \nThe agency responded by deploying 55 officers from\n\n[[Page S2448]]\n\nthe mountain State region, including, I am proud to say, my own home \nState of Utah, so that security screening operations were able to \ncontinue around the clock until the situation was resolved. Under \ncollective bargaining, redeployments such as this could be hindered by \nred-tape and cumbersome procedures, greatly reducing the ability of TSA \nto respond efficiently and effectively to these eventualities.\n  It also raises the question, under a collective bargaining agreement, \nwhether redeployment decisions might be subject to seniority rules \nrather than sending individuals with the proper skills. Is deployment \nsubject to binding arbitration? If so, what effect will that have \nduring emergencies?\n  Bureaucratic hurdles preventing the TSA from operating efficiently \nand effectively during a time of war are not the only problems created \nby section 803. The provision also would create an unacceptable drain \nof resources away from the TSA's primary mission, which is protecting \nthe traveling public. Resources would be diminished because of the cost \nto implement and execute a collective bargaining agreement.\n  TSA estimates if this section were enacted, it could cost, in the \nfirst year alone, $175 million. Why? The agency would be forced to \ntrain its employees on union issues and employ labor relations \nspecialists, negotiators, and union stewards. One must also remember \nthat these funds will have to come out of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's budget, a budget which is consistently criticized as being \ntoo small by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  So what do the taxpayers lose for that $175 million? Such a reduction \nin funding is the same as a loss of 3,815 transportation security \nofficers, or 11.5 percent of the total workforce. It also equates to \nclosing 273 of the 2,054 active screening lanes, which would be 12 \npercent of the current lanes. In terms that most of the frequent flyers \nin this body would understand, the loss of capacity to screen 330,000 \npassengers every day. Imagine that line\n  This is not to say that TSA employees should bear an unfair burden. \nFar from it. TSA employees, and especially transportation security \nofficers, should be afforded just compensation and the safest possible \nworking conditions. Some who advocate collective bargaining say \ntransportation security officers have not been given a raise in four \nyears. That is not accurate. TSA's pay scheme is based upon technical \ncompetence, readiness for duty, and operational performance. \nAccordingly, in 2006, TSA paid out over $42 million in pay raises and \nbonuses based upon job performance.\n  If a transportation security officer has a complaint, a grievance, or \ndoes not believe he or she has been paid properly, these are addressed \nthrough the agency's Model Workplace Program, where employees and \nmanagers form councils to address those concerns.\n  This does not mean that employees' due process protections for the \nresolution of employment issues have been sacrificed. Transportation \nSecurity Officers can seek relief from the TSA's Ombudsman Office and \nDisciplinary Review Board or from outside Government agencies such as \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n  Another misconception is that transportation security officers do not \nhave whistleblower protections. As a result of a formal memorandum of \nunderstanding between TSA and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, all \nTransportation Security Officers now have this protection.\n  Others in favor of collective bargaining point to the Transportation \nSecurity Officers' attrition rate. Initially, this was a problem. \nHowever, the agency has addressed and is continuing to address this \nissue. I am pleased to report that the Transportation Security \nOfficers' voluntary attrition rate of 16.5 percent is lower than \ncomparable positions in the private sector, which are estimated at 26.4 \npercent.\n  Injury rates are decreasing.\n  The agency has worked hard to reduce lost time claims by 44 percent. \nJust in 2006, injury claims resulting in lost workdays have been \nreduced by 32 percent. This is not luck but part of a comprehensive \nstrategy to look after the well-being and safety of transportation \nsecurity officers. These safety initiatives include providing a nurse \ncase manager at each airport, utilizing optimization and safety teams \nto create ergonomic work areas to reduce lifting and carrying heavy \nbags, and an automated injury claims filing process.\n  Another question some ask is, Since Customs and Border Protection \nAgents are permitted to engage in collective bargaining, why not \nTransportation Security Officers? However, when Congress created the \nTSA, the goal was to create a new organization that would meet the \nunique needs of our War on Terrorism--a modern organization that would \nhave the maximum flexibility to protect the national security of the \nUnited States. This, of course, is the same charter as the FBI, CIA, \nand Secret Service. These agencies do not permit collective bargaining \nfor this and other reasons.\n  Should we hold the TSA to a different standard despite the fact that \nsecuring our transportation systems is one of the most vital roles our \nGovernment can play? Is TSA perfect? No, of course not. But look at \nwhat has been achieved. Five years ago, TSA did not exist, and now we \ncan all take pride in the agency and more importantly in its personnel \nwho have done such a remarkable job in keeping our Nation safe. They \ndeserve our respect, our thanks, and they deserve fair compensation. \nBut in doing so, we must not undermine one of their greatest weapons in \nthis war--their flexibility to change tactics and strategies at a \nmoment's notice. Such a course of action could have a calamitous effect \non our Nation.\n  Mr. President, as I previously mentioned, in general, I am a \nsupporter of collective bargaining. However, in these times, we must \nnot change a policy that could inadvertently jeopardize the lives of \nAmericans.\n  I urge my colleagues to remove this section from the bill.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Alaska is here, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Lieberman \nand Collins, for working with the Commerce Committee to include \nimportant security measures in this bill. I am grateful to my great \nfriend, Senator Inouye, for his willingness to work in our committee on \na bipartisan basis to develop and report these measures.\n  In the 5\\1/2\\ years since the horrific events of September 11, we \nhave made many good improvements in the security of our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure and ensuring communications \ninteroperability. Our job, however, is far from over, for there are \nstill more improvements to be made and gaps to close. In matters of \nsecurity, we cannot become complacent; as our enemies adapt, so must \nwe.\n  The Commerce Committee's aviation and surface transportation \nlegislation, which has been included in S. 4, will significantly \nenhance the ability of the Department of Homeland Security and the \nTransportation Security Administration to fulfill their missions. These \nprovisions were developed by the Commerce Committee while mindful of \nthe delicate balance between implementing tough security measures and \nthe effects such regulations may have on the Nation's economy and the \nmovement of goods.\n  The aviation provisions incorporated in S. 4 were reported by our \nCommerce Committee on February 13 as S. 509, the Aviation Security \nImprovement Act of 2007. The provisions incorporate aviation-related 9/\n11 Commission recommendations and provide TSA with additional tools to \ncarry out its layered approach to security. To do this, the aviation \nsecurity provisions dedicate continued funding for the installation of \nin-line explosive detection systems utilized for the enhanced screening \nof checked baggage at our Nation's airports.\n  We all recognize the importance of screening 100 percent of cargo \ntransported to and within the United States. Last year, in the Safe \nPort Act, Congress acted to ensure that all cargo arriving in the \nUnited States by sea is screened. In S. 4, we ensure that 100 percent \nof air cargo also is screened. The U.S. air cargo supply chain handles \nover 50,000 tons of cargo each day, of which 26 percent is designated \nfor domestic passenger carriers.\n  Screening is of particular importance in Alaska. Anchorage, my home, \nis the\n\n[[Page S2449]]\n\nNo. 1 airport in the United States for landed weight cargo, and it is \nNo. 3 in the world for cargo throughput. Our provision would require \nTSA to develop and implement a system to provide for screening of all \ncargo being carried by passenger aircraft.\n  To address ongoing concerns about passenger prescreening procedures, \nthe legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to create \nan Office of Appeals and Redress to establish a timely and fair process \nfor airline passengers who believe they have been misidentified against \nthe ``no-fly'' or ``selectee'' watchlists.\n  TSA's layered approach to security relies not only upon equipment and \ntechnological advances but also upon improved security screening \ntechniques employed by TSA screeners as well as the use of very \neffective canines. This legislation calls for TSA's National Explosives \nDetection Canine Team to deploy more of these valuable resources across \nthe Nation's transportation network.\n\n  The bill we are considering also contains the provisions of S. 184, \nthe Surface Transportation and Rail Security Act of 2007, which was \nalso developed and reported on a bipartisan basis by our Commerce \nCommittee. While the aviation industry has received most of the \nattention and funding for security, the rail and transit attacks in \nBritain, Spain, and India all point to a common strategy utilized by \nterrorists. The openness of our transportation system, our surface \ntransportation network, presents unique security challenges. The \nvastness of these systems requires targeted allocation of our resources \nbased upon risk.\n  Most of the surface transportation security provisions in the bill \nbefore the Senate today have been included previously as part of other \ntransportation security bills introduced by Senator Inouye, Senator \nMcCain, and myself. Many of the provisions in the substitute amendment \npassed the Senate unanimously last year as well as in the 108th \nCongress. Each time, however, the House of Representatives did not \nagree to the need to address rail, pipeline, motor carrier, hazardous \nmaterials, and other over-the-road bus security. The time has come to \nsend these provisions to the President's desk. We are hopeful that the \nHouse will agree this time.\n  The substitute also contains provisions of the Commerce Committee's \nreported measure, S. 385, the Interoperable Emergency Communications \nAct. Since 2001, we have heard the cries of public safety officials \nthat the police, firefighters, and emergency medical response personnel \nthroughout the country need help in achieving interoperability. With \nthis $1 billion program which helps every State, public safety will be \nable to move forward with real solutions and begin addressing the \nproblems that have plagued our Nation's first responders for too long. \nThe legislation addresses all of the public safety issues which have \nbeen brought to the attention of the committee. It also includes $100 \nmillion to establish both Federal and State strategic technology \nreserves to help restore communications quickly in disasters equal in \nscale to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  We should not politicize national security. The Commerce Committee's \ninitiatives included in this bill are very important, and I urge their \nadoption.\n  Again, I appreciate very much the cooperation of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee. We achieved the reported \nbills I mentioned from the Commerce Committee because of the \nbipartisanship in our committee. I hope this debate on this important \nbill before the Senate will continue in that same spirit. The American \npeople really expect and deserve nothing less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 298 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside, that I be allowed to offer and speak on \nmy amendment, and that Senator Menendez be permitted to speak after I \ndo. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nthat the Senator amend his unanimous consent request so we can go back \nand forth on his amendment. I suggest that after he speaks, I be \nrecognized, then Senator Menendez, then Senator Coleman, and that we go \nback and forth on the amendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself and \n     Mr. Menendez, proposes an amendment numbered 298 to amendment \n     No. 275.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Madam President, at the request of my colleague from \nMaine, who wishes to wait until Senator Lieberman can come to the \nfloor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, if we could withhold the request for a \nquorum, I thank the Senator from New York for his cooperation in this \nmatter. I know the Senator from Connecticut is on his way.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to speak on an amendment \noffered by myself and my colleague from New Jersey to deal with 100 \npercent scanning of containers that enter our ports.\n  First, I wish to salute my colleague from New Jersey. He has been a \nstalwart leader on this issue while in the House and now in the Senate. \nIt has been a pleasure to work with him side by side on something \npeople on both sides of the Hudson River care so dearly about.\n  I rise today to call upon my colleagues to take action against one of \nthe greatest risks that confront the United States. It is one of the \nvery greatest, if not the greatest risk, and that is a nuclear weapon \nreaching our shores in a shipping container.\n  More than 11 million cargo containers come into our country's ports \neach year, but only 5 percent of these containers are thoroughly \ninspected by Customs agents. That means right now if, God forbid, a \nnuclear weapon were put in one of these containers, it could have a 1-\nin-20 chance of being detected. No American, certainly no New Yorker, \nlikes those odds.\n  It means a terrorist could almost use any cargo container as a \n``Trojan horse'' to hide a nuclear weapon or radiological material and \nbring it to the United States. We know terrorists have tried to \npurchase nuclear weapons and radiological materials on the black \nmarket. We also know the United States is a top target.\n  Let me be clear: a nuclear weapon does not have to enter the United \nStates or leave our ports to cause death and destruction. Our major \nports are also our major cities because so many of our cities, similar \nto New York, were founded and thrive on maritime trading. A terrorist \ngroup could simply detonate a nuclear weapon at the port terminal for \nthe ship docks or even as the ship approaches the harbor. The \ndevastation of a terrorist nuclear attack is literally unimaginable. A \nnuclear explosion in one of our major ports or one of our major inland \ncities--if such a weapon were smuggled into one of our ports and driven \nby truck to it, an Omaha or a Chicago or a Saint Louis--would cause \nenormous loss of life, both immediately and over time. It would inflict \nhuge economic and physical damage, would render parts of the attacked \ncities unusable and unapproachable for decades, and would dramatically \nchange life in this country forever.\n  We are also at risk of an attack with a ``dirty bomb'' that combines \nconventional explosives with radiological material. The consequences, \nwhile not as severe as a nuclear weapon, would also be horrific.\n  A nuclear or radiological attack by terrorists in our ports is a \nscenario that keeps me up at night. I worry about my children, my \nfamily, my friends, and then 19 million New Yorkers, and 30 million \nAmericans. But the people running things at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity do not seem to be losing a wink of sleep over this. DHS gives \nus the usual delay and nay-saying that we have seen so often.\n  I have been talking about this issue for 5 years in this Congress. I \nhave offered amendment after amendment, and every time people come back \nand say: Forbear. We will get it done. Well, it is now 2007. It is 5\\1/\n2\\ years after 9/11, and we are not close to doing what we should be \ndoing--not even close.\n  I am tired of all the excuses and delay and, frankly, lack of focus--\nproportionate focus. I am tired of the lack of proportionate focus the \nDepartment of Homeland Security gives to this issue. If we all agree \nthis is one of the greatest tragedies that could befall us, then how in \nGod's Name do we pay so little attention, put in so few resources to \ngetting this done?\n  Congress--this new Congress--owes it to the country and to our \nchildren and to our families to do better. This amendment will do much \nbetter.\n  The Schumer-Menendez amendment contains the same firm deadlines the \nHouse passed in January for DHS to require all containers coming into \nthe United States from foreign ports to be scanned for nuclear and \nradiological weapons and then sealed with a tamperproof lock.\n  Within 3 years, 100 percent of containers coming from the largest \nforeign ports would be scanned and sealed before arriving in the United \nStates.\n  Within 5 years, 100 percent of all containers from all ports \nworldwide would be scanned and sealed.\n  Imagine, on that date, only 5 years from now, Americans could breathe \na huge sigh of relief knowing we are safe from the nightmare I \ndescribed earlier.\n  Now, I know what the critics say. The critics say 100 percent \nscanning cannot be done. But the truth is, technology for scanning does \nexist, and it can be expected to improve steadily, as technology \nusually does. The experts are divided. There are some who say it cannot \nbe done, some who say it can be done. I know the shipping industry \nwould rather we not do this, that we slow-walk it. I understand their \ninterest. But our interest is much greater.\n\n  We already have advanced scanning equipment that can check for \nradiation as a moving cargo container passes through a port. That is \nwithout dispute. As a part of the same process, we have equipment that \ncan create a detailed image showing the density of the contents of the \ncontainer, in order to see radioactive material that might be shielded.\n  In fact, this scanning equipment is already being set up at foreign \nports and brought online through DHS's Secure Freight Initiative, which \nis a pilot project required under last year's SAFE Port Act.\n  Now, the Secure Freight Initiative is a good start, but it is only a \nsmall start. It will only scan between 5 and 10 percent of our incoming \ncargo for nuclear weapons. We cannot, we must not, and do not have to \naccept 5 percent security.\n  The only real barrier to 100 percent scanning is lack of will--lack \nof will in the administration, which we have seen for 5\\1/2\\ years; \nlack of will in DHS, which we have seen from its inception;\n\n[[Page S2451]]\n\nand, frankly, lack of will in this Congress. If we show we are serious \nabout 100 percent scanning, then we will see an end to the \nadministration's and DHS's foot-dragging and a beginning of real \nsecurity.\n  Adapting to 100 percent scanning may have some small effect on \ncommerce. It is true, it will affect commerce. But that is far \noutweighed by the complete shutdown of trade that a successful attack \nwould cause. A nuclear attack in the shipping chain would grind \ncommerce to a halt.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague from New \nYork, Senator Clinton, be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Our amendment is sensible, it is feasible, and it is \nabsolutely necessary.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says the House bill--which is very \nsimilar to this amendment--will cost the Government $160 million in \n2008 through 2012. That may sound like a lot of money, but it is such a \nsmall price to pay for an enormous improvement in security. When we \ncompare it to the other large sums we spend on other things, it is not \neven close.\n  If we asked Americans to rank the cost of this program with the \nbenefit, it would be at the very top of the list. America sees it. \nCertainly, New York sees it. New Jersey sees it. Why doesn't this body? \nI hope we will.\n  The amendment does not obligate the Government to buy scanning \nequipment or seals. Scanning equipment will simply become a cost of \ndoing international business, similar to so many other necessary costs \nthat are imposed for very good reasons.\n  The DHS rules for 100 percent scanning will not be developed in a \nvacuum but will use the results of the Secure Freight Initiative and \nother demonstrations of scanning technology.\n  Under my amendment, DHS will only issue a final 100 percent scanning \nregulation after the Secure Freight Initiative pilot project is \ncomplete and DHS reports to Congress. DHS will use the lessons learned \nfrom the pilot project to write regulations that are workable.\n  Our amendment also has some flexibility because it is obvious you \ncannot do scanning without equipment. The Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity can extend the deadline for 100 percent scanning by a year if \nthe scanning equipment is not available for purchase and installation \nin a port.\n  This amendment also will not lock us into using today's technology \nwhen tomorrow arrives. Under this amendment, DHS will have to develop \nstandards for the best available scanning technology and also for \ncontainer seals and to update these standards regularly as technology \nimproves.\n  This amendment accommodates our international agreements with our \ntrading partners. It authorizes DHS to develop international standards \nfor container security, and it directs DHS to ensure that 100 percent \nscanning is implemented in a way that is consistent with our \ninternational trade obligations.\n  I cannot overstate how much it disturbs me that Congress has, so far, \nlacked the resolve to impose firm deadlines for 100 percent scanning. \nNow the House has acted decisively and so should the Senate.\n  The amendment is desperately needed to keep the scanning effort \nmoving forward and to create a real incentive for DHS to require \ncontainer scanning all over the world.\n  I truly believe, unless we have a firm deadline, DHS will continue to \ndrag its feet and our people in America, in our ports and on land, will \nbe susceptible to this kind of horror for far too many years than they \nshould have to be. Again, there will be arguments that it is not \nfeasible. A deadline will make it feasible. A deadline will concentrate \nthe minds of those in DHS and in the shipping industry to get it done, \nand if after 3 or 4 years they have shown effort and they say they need \nan extension, they can come back to the Congress to do it. But I would \nargue that is the way to go, not to set no deadline and let them \nproceed at the all-too-slow pace we have seen thus far.\n  This amendment is desperately needed to keep the scanning effort \nmoving forward and to create a real incentive for DHS to require \ncontainer scanning all over the world; otherwise, we will probably see \nthe same misplaced priorities from DHS we usually do.\n  At any given moment, our seaports are full of container ships and \nmore are steaming to and from our shores. Each one of these ships, \nunfortunately, is an opportunity for terrorists to strike at our \nindustry, our infrastructure, and our lives. We know our enemies will \nwait patiently and plan carefully in order to create maximum panic, \ndamage, death. A nuclear weapon in a shipping container would be a \ndream come true for them, those few crazy fanatics who unfortunately \nlive in the same world as we do, but it would be an endless nightmare \nfor us.\n  We have lived with the threat of a nuclear weapon in a shipping \ncontainer for so long that some people seem prepared to accept this \ninsecurity as a fact of life. But talk to intelligence experts or read \nthe New York Times Magazine from last Sunday. Al-Qaida and others are \nfocusing, and they would prefer this method of terrorism, worst of all. \nI am not prepared, my colleague from New Jersey, my colleague from New \nYork, and hopefully a majority of this body is not prepared to let this \ninsecurity continue. When it comes to shipping container security, the \ndanger is obvious, the stakes are high, and the solution is available. \nWe simply cannot afford any more delay.\n  One of the greatest risks facing our security is that a terrorist \ncould easily smuggle a nuclear weapon from a foreign country into our \nports. It would inflict countless deaths, tremendous destruction, and \nbring trade to a standstill. The bottom line is program screening for \nnuclear materials is delayed, funding for research and development \nsquandered, and international security mismanaged.\n  If this administration isn't going to put some muscle behind security \nunder the current laws, then Congress ought to do it, and we ought to \ndo it now. We have waited long enough.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with me and \nSenator Menendez in making our ports, our Nation, and the international \nsupply chain more secure by enacting firm deadlines for 100 percent \nscanning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I understand there is a UC that would \nhave Senator Collins speak next, then Senator Menendez, and then \nmyself. I ask unanimous consent that we alter that so I can speak and \nthen Senator Menendez and then Senator Collins. I would simply switch \nplaces with Senator Collins. That is my understanding of the UC \nagreement.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nask the Senator how long he intends to speak.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Is there a limitation under the UC?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). There is no limitation under the \ncurrent unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would say to my colleague I have the Governor of our \nState with whom I am supposed to meet right now and that is the only \nreason I am inquiring.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would ask my colleague from New Jersey \nhow long he would intend to speak. Would he like to alter the UC to \nspeak first and then I would follow?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would simply ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senator from New Jersey speak for 10 minutes and then I would speak \nand then the Senator from Maine would have an opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, let me, first, thank my colleague for \nhis courtesy. I appreciate it very much. I rise to join my \ndistinguished colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, in offering \nthis amendment. He has been a champion in this regard, and he \nunderstands that the cause of the devastation in the city of New York \nwas the of acts of terrorism. I, too, reside right across the river and \nhaving lost 700 residents on that fateful day, I understand the \nconsequences of inaction.\n  What we are calling for is to move forward to implement 100 percent \nscanning of all the cargo containers entering the United States. This, \n5 years\n\n[[Page S2452]]\n\nlater--5 years later--in understanding the realities of a post-\nSeptember 11 world.\n  Last year this body took action to secure a long overlooked \nvulnerability in our Nation's security. We passed the SAFE Port Act, \nwhich made significant progress toward improving security in our ports. \nBut the fact remains that until we know what is in every cargo \ncontainer entering our ports, we cannot definitively say we are secure.\n  Because of our action in the SAFE Port Act, the Department of \nHomeland Security is now conducting a pilot project to implement 100 \npercent scanning of cargo at six ports. That is a crucial first step. \nHowever, reaching 100 percent scanning should not be a far-off goal but \nsomething we should be doing as quickly and as urgently as possible. \nWhen it comes to the security of our ports, we should not be \ncomfortable with baby steps.\n  The amendment we are offering, the Senator from New York and I, would \nensure that efforts to implement 100 percent scanning move forward by \nsetting clear deadlines for all cargo entering U.S. ports to be \nscanned. Now, deadlines may not be popular, but the fact is they result \nin action. Let's not forget that the requirements set in the SAFE Port \nAct got the Department to act. Within 2 months of the bill being signed \ninto law, the Department moved forward with the pilot project now \nunderway.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission made a critical observation in how to approach \nsecuring our most at-risk targets. The Commission said:\n\n       In measuring effectiveness, perfection is unattainable. But \n     terrorists should perceive that potential targets are \n     defended. They may be deterred by a significant chance of \n     failure.\n\n  We recognize we may not be at an ideal place to implement perfect \ntechnology, but we do have systems that work, and we should be doing \neverything possible to advance and implement them at every port. We \ncannot afford for terrorists to know our ports and our cargo are not \ndefended. Frankly, when 95 percent of the cargo entering our ports has \nnot been scanned, I think it is clear we have a lack of a significant \ndeterrent. We have a 95-percent chance of getting something in. That is \na pretty good percentage for the terrorists.\n  Our ports remain some of the most vulnerable and exploitable \nterrorist targets our Nation has. We cannot afford to wait for years \nand years while we simply cross our fingers that an attack will not hit \nour ports or disrupt our commerce.\n  In the years after September 11, our focus was largely and \nunderstandably on aviation security. But in narrowing in on such a \nsingular focus, we did not start out making the strong investments \nneeded in other areas of our security. We have spent less than $900 \nmillion in port security improvements since 2001, which is a small \nfraction of what we spend annually on aviation security. Only when \nfaced with a very public and highly controversial deal that would have \nput American ports in the hands of a foreign government, did Congress \nact on port security.\n  For some of us, however, this is not a new issue, nor was the threat \nunknown. For 13 years, I represented a congressional district in New \nJersey that is home to the Nation's third largest container port. The \nPort of New York and New Jersey, the majority of which physically \nresides in New Jersey, has a cluster of neighborhoods literally in its \nbackyard. Ask any New Jerseyan from that part of the State and they \nwill tell you how close to home the threat of port security hits. Every \nday, they drive by the containers stacked in rows within throwing \ndistance of major highways. Every day, they see cargo coming off the \nships, ready to be put on a truck that drives through their \nneighborhood or to sit in a shipyard visible from a 2-mile radius \naround the port, with an international airport and a transnortheastern \ncorridor. Until we can assure them we know exactly what is coming into \nour ports and into their neighborhoods, they have a right to question \ntheir safety.\n  Ironically, the people who live in the backyards of the Port of New \nYork and New Jersey also live in the shadows of what was the World \nTrade Center. But there are other ports throughout this country with \nsimilar neighborhoods. So not only are they keenly aware of the \nvulnerability of the ports, many of them have experienced or witnessed \nthe destruction that took place on that fateful day.\n  Despite the awful lesson I hope we learned on September 11, where we \nsaw everyday modes of transportation turned into destructive weapons, \nwe still seem slow to understand that everyday modes of commerce could \nas quickly and easily be turned into weapons with catastrophic \nconsequences. When it comes to the security of our cargo, precision is \neverything. We have to be on the ball every day. We have to be right \nabout what is in every single container entering our ports. The \nterrorists only have to be right once, and they have a 95-percent \nchance to be right once.\n  This is not just a question of homeland security; it is also about \neconomic security. Every year, more than 2 billion tons of cargo pass \nthrough U.S. ports. Jobs at U.S. ports generate $44 billion in annual \npersonal income and more than $16 billion in Federal, State, and local \ntaxes. The Port of New York and New Jersey alone handled more than $130 \nbillion in goods in 2005. While too much of our country's and our \nNation's ports are part of an invisible backdrop, they are key to an \ninternational and domestic economic chain, and if there was a major \ndisruption, economies would be crippled and industries halted.\n  Many of us in this body have repeatedly warned of the disastrous \nrepercussions if there was an attack at one of our ports. Yet, as a \nNation, we have moved at a snail's pace when it comes to doing what is \nnecessary to fully secure our ports. The question is, if we continue to \ndelay and there is an attack because we have not implemented 100 \npercent scanning, what price then are we willing to pay? How much are \nwe willing to sacrifice if the worst-case scenario happens at one of \nour ports?\n  I can't look at a constituent of mine or anyone in this country and \nsay that algorithms--we presently scan only a small percentage, only 5 \npercent, the rest of it we do calculations by algorithms. If I tell an \nAmerican that their protection is based upon algorithms, they would \ntell me I am crazy. But that is what is happening today. That is the \nlayered approach. But it is an algorithm that supposedly protects you. \nIf Hong Kong can do this, certainly the United States of America can do \nthis. We are not talking about immediately, we are talking about 3 \nyears for major ports, 5 years for all other ports, with the \nopportunity for extension.\n  In a post-September 11 world, where we have had to think about the \nunimaginable and prepare for the unthinkable, how can we continue to \noperate as if the threat to our ports is not that great? Can we not \nimagine how a ship with cargo can become a weapon of mass destruction? \nCan we not foresee how a deadly container can get to a truck and be \ndriven through some of the most densely populated cities? Will we be \ncontent in telling the families of those whom we let down that we \ndidn't move fast enough? I, for one, am not willing to do that. I \nbelieve we must do everything possible now so we never have to be in \nthat position.\n  I hope my colleagues join Senator Schumer and myself in making sure \nwe never have to look at a fellow American and tell them we just acted \ntoo slowly or we let economic interests overcome security interests. I \nthink we can do much better. Our amendment does that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues from New York \nand New Jersey about the grave danger, the almost unimaginable horror \nthat would occur if a nuclear device was smuggled into one of the 11 \nmillion containers that come into our ports every year. It is an area \nof vulnerability. It is an issue of great concern.\n  I am not a casual observer of this. I don't just lose sleep over \nthis--which we all should--but for 3 years we worked on this. As \nchairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation, I participated \nin a 3-year review and then laid out a plan of action, working with the \nSenator from Connecticut and working with my Democratic colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray. Of course, I also worked with the \nleadership and Senator Collins from Maine, chairman of the\n\n[[Page S2453]]\n\nHomeland Security Committee last year.\n\n  As a result of that 3-year effort, we put forth a bill last year to \nbolster American security. I say to those watching that there was not a \n95-percent chance of somebody smuggling a nuclear device in a \ncontainer. We are not simply looking at 5 percent and ignoring \neverything else. To raise that kind of level--first, that is simply not \ntrue. We have in place a system we need to do better with, no question \nabout it. We passed legislation last year to help us do better. Part of \nthat legislation is a provision that would require the Department of \nHomeland Security, through the secure freight initiative, to develop a \npilot program to figure out can we do 100-percent testing of every \ncontainer. That is what we should be doing. The idea that somehow there \nis a lack of resolve is simply not true. It is a matter of figuring out \nthe right thing to do.\n  To quote an editorial in the Washington Post on Tuesday, January 9, \n2007:\n\n       Given a limited amount of money and an endless list of \n     programs and procedures that could make Americans safer, it's \n     essential to buy the most homeland security possible with the \n     cash available. And as the little list above demonstrates, \n     that can be a tough job [if you know anything about border \n     crossing and x-ray machines at airports]. That's all the more \n     reason not to waste money on the kind of political shenanigan \n     written into a sprawling Democratic bill--up for a vote in \n     the House this week--that would require the Department of \n     Homeland Security to ensure every maritime cargo container \n     bound for the United States is scanned before it departs for \n     American shores.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 9, 2007]\n\n                            A Bad Investment\n\n       What's more important, Coast Guard patrols or collecting \n     fingerprints at border crossings? Running checked bags \n     through X-ray machines at airports or installing blast \n     barriers at nuclear plants?\n       Given a limited amount of money and an endless list of \n     programs and procedures that could make Americans safer, it's \n     essential to buy the most homeland security possible with the \n     cash available. And as the little list above demonstrates, \n     that can be a tough job. That's all the more reason not to \n     waste money on the kind of political shenanigan written into \n     a sprawling Democratic bill--up for a vote in the House this \n     week--that would require the Department of Homeland Security \n     to ensure that every maritime cargo container bound for the \n     United States is scanned before it departs for American \n     shores.\n       Container scanning technology is improving, but it is not \n     able to perform useful, speedy inspections of cargo on the \n     scale House Democrats envision. Congress has already \n     authorized pilot programs to study the feasibility of \n     scanning all maritime cargo. The sensible posture is to await \n     the results of those trials before buying port scanners, \n     training the thousands who would be needed to operate them \n     and gumming up international trade.\n       The Democrats don't offer a realistic cost estimate for the \n     mandate they will propose today. But the cost to the \n     government and the economy is sure to be in the tens of \n     billions and quite possibly hundreds of billions annually. \n     The marginal benefit isn't close to being worth the price. \n     Under recently expanded programs, all cargo coming into the \n     country is assessed for risk and, when necessary, inspected, \n     all without the cost of expensive scanning equipment, \n     overseas staff and long waits at foreign ports. Perhaps \n     that's why the Sept. 11 commission didn't recommend 100 \n     percent cargo scanning.\n       The newly installed House leadership will bring the bill, \n     which contains a range of other homeland security proposals \n     both deserving and undeserving, directly to the floor, \n     bypassing the Homeland Security Committee. Luckily, the \n     Senate will give more thought to its homeland security bill \n     and probably won't approve a 100 percent container inspection \n     plan. House Democrats can figure those odds as well as \n     anyone. But why not score some easy political points in your \n     first 100 hours?\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. It goes on to say:\n\n       Container scanning technology is improving, but it is not \n     able to perform useful, speedy inspections of cargo on the \n     scale House Democrats envision [or this amendment envisions]. \n     Congress has already authorized pilot programs to study the \n     feasibility of scanning all maritime cargo.\n\n  That is what we have done. I offered that amendment last year. As a \nresult, the Department of Homeland Security is putting in place a pilot \nthat will scan all U.S.-bound containers at three ports by July of this \nyear. They are the Port Qasim in Pakistan, which is ready for testing \nnow; Port Cortez in Honduras, which is ready for testing now; and \nSouthhampton in the United Kingdom, which will be ready in July.\n  So the reality is what we are doing in Congress is acting in a \nrational manner, understanding the needs to go forward as aggressively \nas possible but not fearing demagoguery and telling the public we are \nturning a blind eye to 95 percent of the cargo containers that are \nthere. The idea of 100-percent scanning comes from a system we saw in \nHong Kong, a system I asked the Senator from New York to look at. I \nbelieve he did. When you see that system, what happens is they have a \nscanning technology where vehicles literally roll through, nonstop, \nwith no slowing up of traffic, and as it scans it takes almost a moving \n``CT scan'' to see what is inside. There is a radiation portal device \nin front of it. Then you have that information. That is what he \nobserved. That is 100-percent scanning.\n  But the reality is that system is in place in 2 of the 40 lanes in \nHong Kong. Nothing is done with the information that is gathered it. It \nis not sent over to Langley or integrated into a more comprehensive \nreview of what we do. Even if there are radiation signals that come \noff, there is not necessarily a mandated or forced review of the cargo.\n  So what the Senate did, being the world's most deliberative body, is \nlook at the danger of the threat, and I agree with the Senators from \nNew Jersey and New York that it is an enormously high threat. We said, \nhow do we rationally handle that and not do political shenanigans and \nplay to the fear of the public by saying 95 percent of the cargo \ncontainers are coming to this country without being dealt with. We \nsaid, how do we put in place a system where we see whether we can get \n100-percent scanning to work and integrate it into our other systems. \nThat is part of the point the public should understand. We do have \nsystems in place. When the Senator from New Jersey talks about \nalgorithms, he is saying that cargo--every single container gets rated \nat a level of risk; based on that, determinations are made as to the \nlevel of review. We have what would be called a delayed approach to \nsecurity. We don't have the capacity, resources, or ability to scan 11 \nmillion containers today, so 100-percent scanning should be our goal, \nto be done in a way that we can use the information integrated into the \nsystem. By the way, it is done in a way that doesn't stop the flow of \ncommerce.\n  The mayor of New York testified before the Homeland Security \nCommittee. I asked him the question about 100-percent scanning. His \nquote was:\n\n       Al-Qaida wins if we close our ports, which is exactly what \n     would happen if you tried to look at every single 1 of the 11 \n     million containers that come here.\n\n  We don't want al-Qaida to win or to close our ports. We want 100-\npercent scanning, but we want to do it in a way that doesn't raise the \nlevel of fear and somehow communicate to the public that there is a \nlack of resolve or a lack of will. It is a matter of us trying to \nproceed in a very rational way.\n  By the way, there is nothing in our amendment of last year that stops \nthe Department of Homeland Security from moving forward quicker. Our \namendment last year requires the pilot projects to be done within a \nyear of passage of the bill last year. It says the Department has to \ncome back to us, to Congress, and explain to us what it is going to \ntake to move forward. We have in place today a mechanism that will \naccelerate the opportunity for 100-percent screening as fast as is \npossible. There is no lack of resolve, no lack of will, no bureaucratic \nobfuscation. There is simply the reality of trying to figure out a way \nto take the technology that is out there and incorporate it into the \ndefense system we have so it is doing something. Again, we do it not \nbecause we want to tell people we are looking at 11 million containers. \nWe certainly should not be telling people we are turning a blind eye \nto--or there is a 95-percent chance of something coming in without \nbeing considered. That is not reality.\n  As the mayor of New York also said when he testified, we cannot give \na guarantee. No matter what we do, the enemy is going to try to attack \nus. They may succeed. But it would be a terrible tragedy if somehow it \nwere conveyed that we are sitting on our hands and this Senate is not \nresponding to the real, grave, and terrible threat of a nuclear device \nor a weapon\n\n[[Page S2454]]\n\nof mass destruction coming here in a cargo container.\n  We have in place a pilot project. Let the agency do what the Senate \nand Congress has dictated it do. Let it test the technology, see if it \ncan make it work. Let it come back and tell us how quickly they are \ngoing to get it done. If it is not done quickly enough, I will join \nwith the Senators from New York and New Jersey, and other colleagues, \nand say you have to accelerate the pace. Let there not be fear \nmongering about this issue. Let there not be what the Washington Post \ncalled ``political shenanigans.'' Let us play to our best instincts and \nlet the public know we have resolve on this issue. Let's give the pilot \nprogram a chance to work. I urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nMinnesota for his excellent statement. He has spent a great deal of \ntime on this issue as the former chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations. He examined our ports very closely. He helped draft \nthe port security bill we passed last year. I hope my colleagues will \nlisten to his advice on this issue.\n  Mr. President, 100 percent screening, that sounds like a great \nslogan. After all, who could be against scanning 11 million containers?\n  Let's look at what that would involve. The fact is we need to \nconcentrate our resources on containers that pose a real threat, on \ncontainers and cargo that are at highest risk. It doesn't make sense to \ntry to inspect everything, and it has extraordinarily negative \nconsequences for our system of international trade.\n  I rise to oppose Senator Schumer's amendment that would require \nscanning of all cargo containers entering the United States from large \nforeign ports within 3 years, and containers from all 700 foreign ports \nin 5 years. This approach patently ignores the technological \nlimitations on integrated scanning systems that are necessary to scan \n100-percent of containers. It irrationally assumes that integrated \nscanning systems will be practical and cost-effective and work well in \nonly 3 years. I hope they will be, and I will talk about the pilot \nprograms we have underway to see or to test the feasibility.\n  But the costs of being wrong on this assumption are too high for our \neconomy, as so much of our international trade relies on cargo \ncontainer traffic. Think of how many companies rely on just-in-time \ninventory. Think of how many businesses all across this country receive \ncargo. We need a system that makes sense.\n  The fact is there are substantial technological challenges to \nscanning 100 percent of cargo containers at foreign ports. I traveled \nto Seattle, Long Beach, and Los Angeles to look at the ports and see \ntheir operations. I think anyone who does that quickly reaches the \nconclusion Senator Murray and I have reached, which is this cannot \nwork. If you look at how at-risk cargo is scanned, it takes time to \nunload the container, separate it from the rest of the cargo; it takes \na few minutes to scan each container as this giant x-ray-like machine \ngoes around the container. Then the analysis of the images can take \nseveral more minutes.\n  Think about this. We have 11 million containers headed to the United \nStates; that is in a year's time. That is going up each year. When I \nfirst started working on port security legislation, it was only 8 \nmillion. Now it is 11 million containers. Well, think of the delays \nthat would be caused by scanning each and every container. It would \ncreate a massive backlog of cargo at our ports and it would not make us \nsafer.\n  There are other problems as well. Current radiation scanning \ntechnology produces alarm rates of about 1 percent--almost entirely \nfrom naturally occurring substances in containers. Actually, when I was \nin Seattle with Senator Murray, we were told that, for some reason, \nmarble and kitty litter seemed to trigger false alarms. So obtaining \nenough foreign government and DHS personnel to conduct inspections of \nall those false alarms would be expensive. It is far better to \nconcentrate on containers that, because of the cargo or because of \nother indicators through the sophisticated system used to identify at-\nrisk cargo, warrant that kind of inspection. There would also be a \nrequirement for extensive negotiations with foreign governments to \nagree on the deployment of scanning technologies, the protocol for \ninspecting containers that set off alarms, and stationing customs and \nborder protection inspectors in their ports. Foreign governments would \nprobably turn around and say: If you are going to scan all of the \ncontainers coming into America, we are going to scan all of your \ncontainers coming into our country. That would multiply the costs and \nthe impact.\n  Requiring all containers to be scanned and the images reviewed \nwithout adequate technology in place would make our country less safe, \nnot more safe. The approach in this amendment would unwisely waste \nscarce resources on inspecting completely safe cargo instead of \ntargeting personnel and equipment on the cargo that presents a threat \nto our country and the greatest risk.\n  The Homeland Security Committee spent a great deal of time last year \non port security legislation, and we drafted a bill, brought it \nunanimously to the Senate floor, had extensive debates in September, \nand we debated this very issue at that time. Why we are revisiting it \njust a few months later is beyond me, but here we are.\n  This amendment wholly ignores the pilot projects that were \nestablished by the SAFE Port Act which we passed last year. These pilot \nprojects are intended to test the technology to see if there is a way \nto increase scanning. The technology is changing. It is getting better. \nThis may be feasible at some point, but it is not today.\n  The SAFE Port Act requires the Department of Homeland Security to \ntest scanning in three foreign ports, and the Department is proceeding \nvery rapidly to follow the instructions. It is going to be implemented \nin ports in Pakistan, Honduras, and the United Kingdom. These pilot \nprojects will involve radiation scanning and x-ray or a nonintrusive \nimaging scanning that will then be reviewed by American employees, \nAmerican officials. If these pilots are successful, then we will begin \nto expand the equipment and the personnel. But the fact is that \nextensive research and development remains to be done on 100-percent \nscanning technologies and on infrastructure deployment at seaports.\n  Given the significant impact this requirement would have on our \neconomy, it simply is not responsible to move to this requirement \nbefore we have the technology in place to make it feasible and before \nwe have the results of these pilot projects. This isn't just my \nopinion. If one talks to port directors around the world and on both \ncoasts of the United States, one will find that they believe we cannot \ndo this in a practical way and that it would cause massive backlogs and \ndelay the delivery of vital commodities. It would cause terrible \nproblems for companies that rely on just-in-time inventory. That is why \nmany shippers and importers oppose this amendment, as well as the \nRetail Industry Leaders Association, National Retail Federation and the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  So what do we do now? I think it is important for people to \nunderstand that we do have a good and improving system in place to \nsecure our cargo. DHS has adopted a layered approach to cargo security \nthat balances security interests against the need for efficient \nmovement of millions of cargo containers each year.\n  One layer is the screening of all cargo manifests at least 24 hours \nbefore they are loaded onto ships. This screening is done through DHS's \nautomated targeting system which identifies high-risk cargo and \ncontainers. This is a very important point. The SAFE Port Act, which is \nnow in effect, requires 100 percent of all high-risk containers to be \nscanned or searched by Customs and Border Protection--100 percent. We \nfound in our investigations that was not always the case, that high-\nrisk containers that had been identified were, in some cases, loaded \nonto ships and reaching our shores. But the SAFE Port Act changes that. \nIt ensures that 100 percent of high-risk containers will be scanned.\n  The scanning and inspection of certain high-risk containers is one of \nthe first layers of this multilayered approach the Department uses to \nprevent\n\n[[Page S2455]]\n\nweapons of mass destruction or other dangerous cargo from entering the \nUnited States.\n  A second layer is the Container Security Initiative. This program \nstations Customs and Border Patrol officers--American Customs and \nBorder Protection officers--at foreign ports. The concept here is to \npush back our shores. The more we can do these reviews overseas rather \nthan waiting for dangerous cargo to come to our shores, the better the \nsystem. CSI will be operational in 58 foreign ports by the end of this \nyear, covering approximately 85 percent of containerized cargo headed \nfor the United States by sea. DHS is continuing to expand this program \nby working with foreign governments, but this is an excellent program \nbecause it ensures that our trained American personnel are stationed in \nforeign ports.\n  There is yet another layer, a third layer, and that is the Customs-\nTrade Partnership Against Terrorism Program. It is called C-TPAT. This \nis another layer that is designed to bolster security along the entire \nsupply chain under a voluntary regime. The concept here is that a \ncompany can sign up to be part of C-TPAT by guaranteeing that its \nentire supply chain is secure from the factory floor to the showroom \nfloor, and that is the best kind of security we can have. So when goods \nleave the factory floor, the supply chain, every step of the way--the \ntransporting of the cargo in a truck to the truck going to the port--at \nevery stage, the company has ensured that the supply chain is secure.\n  These layers--the automated targeting system, the work the Coast \nGuard does, which I haven't even touched on--also add to the security. \nThe Container Security Initiative and the C-TPAT Program represent a \nrisk-based approach to enhancing our homeland security. At the same \ntime, they allow the maritime cargo industry in the United States, \nwhich moves more than 11 million containers each year, to continue to \nfunction efficiently.\n  The SAFE Port Act also requires that at the end of this year, the \nlargest 22 U.S. ports must have radiation scanners, which will ensure \nthat 98 percent of containers are scanned for radiation. That \nis practical with the current technology. Again, I have seen that in \noperation in Seattle, where the trucks roll through these radiation \nportal monitors and an alarm can sound if radiation is found. \nSometimes, unfortunately, there are false alarms as well.\n\n  We are also working to install those kinds of radiation monitors \noverseas because, obviously, it is far better if we can do that \nscanning for radiation overseas in foreign ports on cargo before it \nreaches our shores. The Department of Energy, under the Megaports \nInitiative, is currently installing scanning equipment in foreign ports \nand scanning containers for radiological material. So we are making \ngood progress.\n  Some who are advocating 100 percent screening are pointing to a \nproject in Hong Kong, the Integrated Container Inspection System. This \nis a promising concept, but, as my colleague from Minnesota noted, the \nproject in Hong Kong actually covers only 2 lanes of traffic of more \nthan 40 at the port. In addition, what is happening is images are being \ntaken, but no one is reading and analyzing the images. So this is not \ntruly a project that tells us whether a true, 100-percent integrated \nscanning system is feasible. But we do have those projects underway, \nand we should wait until they are ready and finished before moving \nahead.\n  Again, I hope my colleagues will once again reject this amendment. I \nthink it is a big mistake. It would interrupt our system of container \ntraffic, and it could have truly disastrous consequences for our \neconomy. All of us want to make sure cargo coming into this country is \nsafe. There were definitely vulnerabilities and holes in our system for \ncargo security, but the SAFE Port Act, which we passed at the end of \nlast year, took major steps to plugging those gaps, closing those \nholes.\n  We should proceed with vigorous implementation of that bill, \nincluding the requirement that 100 percent of all high-risk cargo be \nscanned, and we should also continue our efforts to build the strongest \npossible layered system to secure the entire supply chain.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to build on some things my \nranking member, Senator Collins, said about this amendment. I think \nwhat ought to be acknowledged is that everyone in the Senate, everyone \nin America would like to get to the point where we have 100 percent \nscanning of containers coming into this country--scanning for radiation \nbecause we are worried about the potential catastrophe of a nuclear \nweapon or a dirty bomb in a container coming into this country.\n  We know the number of containers coming in is enormous. Each day, \nmore than 30,000 containers offload millions of tons at our maritime \nborders. We understand this requires two kinds of screening: First is \nradiation detection equipment to pick up, obviously, radiation \nemanating from a nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb; secondly, so-called \nnonintrusive imaging equipment, which is needed in case terrorists have \nshielded the nuclear weapon or dirty bomb inside some kind of material \nthat will stop it from registering on the radiation equipment. So the \nnonintrusive imaging equipment, x-ray equipment, will note there is \nsomething there that is shielded, which will then lead to a physical \ninspection of the container.\n  There is no question in my mind that everybody in the Senate wants to \nget us to a point where we have 100 percent of the containers coming \ninto America being scanned in the way I just described as soon as \npossible. What I want to say at this point is that the SAFE Port Act, \nwhich, as Senator Collins said, came out of our Homeland Security \nCommittee last year--during those halcyon days when she was Chairman \nand I worked deferentially as the Ranking Minority Member--was a good, \nstrong bill. It came out of committee, was adopted by both Houses, \nenacted, and became law on October 13 of last year. Here is the point. \nThe SAFE Port Act, existing law, sets the goal of 100 percent scanning \nby radiation detection equipment and nonintrusive imaging equipment, as \nsoon as possible.\n\n  Obviously, if somebody says we should do it in 5 years, you would \nsay: Sure, why not do that in 5 years. But I want to suggest now that I \nbelieve the existing law holds open the possibility of achieving that \ngoal of 100 percent cargo scanning, assuming we can get over all the \ntechnological obstacles that Senator Collins and others have spoken of, \nsooner than the 5 year requirement found in this amendment. That is why \nit seems to me, with all due respect, that this amendment is \nunnecessary and, in fact, is less demanding than existing law.\n  Let me go now to section 232 of Public Law 109-347, which is the SAFE \nPort Act. It says that the Secretary, in coordination with the \nSecretary of Energy, and foreign partners as appropriate, shall ensure \nintegrated scanning systems are fully deployed--100 percent--to scan, \nusing nonintrusive imaging equipment and radiation detection equipment, \nall containers--all containers, 100 percent--before those containers \narrive in the United States, as soon as possible.\n  As soon as possible, I hope, will occur before the 5 years required \nby this amendment. Not only does it set the goal as soon as possible, \nit creates a process that, with all due respect, is not found in this \namendment, and that process as Senator Collins and Senator Coleman have \ndescribed. A one year pilot project scanning 100 percent of cargo \ncontainers by these two methods of detection, at three ports around the \nworld. That pilot has already begun. Six months after the conclusion of \nthe pilot program, the Secretary has to report to Congress on the \nsuccess of the program. The Secretary also has to do something else, \naccording to the law. The Secretary has to indicate to the relevant \ncommittees of Congress how soon the 100 percent scanning goal of the \nSAFE Port Act can be achieved.\n  Not only that, but subsection (c) of section 232 of the SAFE Port Act \nsays that not later than 6 months after the submission of the initial \nreport--and every 6 months thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a \nreport to the appropriate congressional committees describing the \nstatus of full-scale deployment of 100 percent cargo screening. That is \nnot in the House-passed provision or, as I see it, in this amendment \nbefore us now.\n\n[[Page S2456]]\n\n  In other words, 6 months after the year long pilot project, the \nSecretary is going to report on the results and tell us when exactly he \nthinks we can achieve 100 percent screening of all cargo. The Secretary \nwill then be required to file a similar report every 6 months \nthereafter until we achieve full-scale deployment of these two types of \nscanning devices to detect nuclear weapons that may be smuggled into \nthis country in a container.\n  Obviously, if the relevant committees of Congress that receive these \nreports--the first of which by my calculation would be April of next \nyear, 2008, and then every 6 months thereafter--believe this \nimplementation is not moving rapidly enough, we can come back and set a \ndefinite deadline date. Right now, however, I submit to my colleagues, \nexisting law, the SAFE Port Act, actually sets a goal of 100 percent \ncargo scanning that I think may be more quickly achieved than the 5 \nyears in this amendment, and sets up a process not found in the \namendment, which requires reports to Congress every 6 months. This will \ninevitably, by the nature of the congressional process, trigger further \nlegislation, perhaps specifically stating a deadline date for 100 \npercent scanning if we, in our wisdom, think that the Secretary and the \nindustry are not moving rapidly enough.\n  The bottom line is this. Existing law, in a technologically very \ndifficult area, with significant potential impacts on our economy and \nthe world economy, actually holds the potential of achieving more, and \nI believe will achieve more, than the amendment that is being offered. \nFor those reasons, I will respectfully oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, yesterday, the Washington Post brought to \nthe Nation's attention the story of a young boy, Deamonte Driver, who \ndied Sunday, February 25, at the age of 12. Our thoughts are with the \nDriver family. Deamonte's death, the result of a brain infection \nbrought on by a tooth abscess, is a national tragedy. It is a tragedy \nbecause it was preventable. It is a tragedy because it happened right \nhere in the United States, in a State which is one of the most affluent \nin the Nation. It happened in a State that is home to the first and one \nof the best dental schools in the Nation, the University of Maryland. \nIt happened in Prince George's County, whose border is less than 6 \nmiles from where we are standing in the United States Capitol.\n  By now, most of my colleagues are familiar with Deamonte's story. \nThrough a sad confluence of circumstances and events, the disjointed \nparts of our health care system failed this child. The Driver family, \nlike many other families across the country, lacked dental insurance. \nAt one point his family had Medicaid coverage, but they lost it because \nthey had moved to a shelter and the paperwork fell through the cracks. \nEven when a dedicated community social worker tried to help, it took \nmore than 20 phone calls to find a dentist who would treat him.\n  Deamonte began to complain about headaches just 8 weeks ago, on \nJanuary 11. An evaluation at Children's Hospital led beyond basic \ndental care to emergency brain surgery. He later experienced seizures \nand a second operation. Even though he received further treatment and \ntherapy, and he appeared to be recovering, medical intervention had \ncome too late. Deamonte passed away on Sunday, February 25.\n  At the end, the total cost of Deamonte's treatment exceeded $250,000. \nThat is more than 3,000 times as much as the $80 it would have cost to \nhave a tooth extraction. It is not enough for the community and the \nState, and even the Senate, to mourn Deamonte's death. We must learn \nfrom this appalling failure of our broken health care system, and we \nmust fix it.\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop once said: ``There is no \nhealth without oral health.'' The sad story of the Driver family has \nbrought Dr. Koop's lesson home in a painful way.\n  Our medical researchers have discovered the important linkage between \nplaque and heart disease, that chewing stimulates brain cell growth, \nand that gum disease can signal diabetes, liver ailments, and hormone \nimbalances. They have learned the vital connection between oral \nresearch advanced treatments like gene therapy, which can help patients \nwith chronic renal failure. Without real support for government \ninsurance programs like SCHIP and Medicaid, however, all this textbook \nknowledge will do nothing to help our children.\n  Here are some basic facts: According to the American Academy of \nPediatric Medicine, dental decay is the most chronic childhood disease \namong children in the United States. It affects one in five children \naged 2 to 4, half of those aged 6 to 8, and nearly three-fifths of 15-\nyear-olds.\n  Tooth decay is five times more common than asthma among school-aged \nchildren.\n  Children living in poverty suffer twice as much tooth decay as middle \nand upper income children.\n  Thirty-nine percent of Black children have untreated tooth decay in \ntheir permanent teeth.\n  Eleven percent of the Nation's rural population has never visited a \ndentist.\n  An estimated 25 million people live in areas that lack adequate \ndental care services.\n  One year ago, the President signed into law the so-called Deficit \nReduction Act. I voted against that bill. It included dangerous cuts to \nMedicaid that provide only short-term savings while raising health care \ncosts and the number of uninsured in the long term. That law allows \nStates to increase copayments by Medicaid beneficiaries for services, \nputting health of America's most vulnerable residents like the Drivers \nat risk.\n  The new law also removes Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, \nDiagnostic, and Treatment Program guarantee, which provides children \nwith vital care, including dental services. This became effective as of \nJanuary 1.\n  What does this mean? Before the Deficit Reduction Act, Medicaid law \nrequired all States to provide a comprehensive set of early and \nperiodic screening and diagnostic treatment benefits to all children. \nNow States can offer one of four benchmark packages instead, and none \nof these packages include dental services. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, as a result of this provision, 1.5 million \nchildren will receive less benefits by 2015.\n  The last few years have also produced budgets that have crippled \nhealth initiatives in this country. This is the result of an agenda \nthat does not give priority to health care, science, and education. \nAfter doubling NIH's budget in 5 years, at about a 15-percent annual \ngrowth ending in 2003, we are now looking at increases that don't even \nequal the rate of inflation. With flat funding in the President's NIH \nbudget this year, we are not doing more, we are treading water. When it \ncomes to research project grants, we are doing less. At the same time, \noverall appropriations for the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration are declining.\n  The agency's principal responsibility is to ensure that primary care \nhealth care services and qualified health professionals are available \nto meet the health needs of all Americans, particularly the \nunderserved. The President's fiscal year 2008 budget cuts this program \nby $251 million. President Bush, once again, proposes to almost wipe \nout programs that educate non-nurse health professionals. This is \nhappening at a time when more than 20 percent of our dentists are \nexpected to retire in the next decade.\n  The 2008 Bush proposal would also cut more than $135 million from \nhealth professions training programs. Programs that help prepare \nminority high school and college students for dentistry would be shut \ndown, as would grants to help support training of primary care doctors \nand dentists. Scholarships for minority and disadvantaged children \nwould be cut significantly.\n  Dental reimbursement for programs within the Ryan White CARE Act, \nwhich help dental schools train doctors to care for HIV patients, is \nnot increased sufficiently to meet our communities' needs. We cannot \nlet this happen. These training programs provide critically important \ntraining and health education services to communities throughout the \ncountry, including those in my own State of Maryland.\n\n[[Page S2457]]\n\n  We need to do more to make the public and the administration \nunderstand that dental care must be part of a comprehensive medical \napproach in this country, and we need to find ways to provide dental \ncoverage as part of health insurance plans.\n  This comes back to a fundamental question: What should the role of \nthe Federal Government be in these matters? We cannot end these vital \nhealth education resource programs; we must strengthen them. Deamonte's \ndeath should be a wake-up call to all of us in the 110th Congress. This \nyear we will be called upon to make important decisions about Medicaid \nfunding and we will be called upon to authorize the SCHIP program. We \nmust ensure that the SCHIP reauthorization bill we send to the \nPresident for his signature includes dental coverage for our children. \nI call upon my colleagues, as we begin this debate in the spring, to \nremember Deamonte. I also ask them to remember his brother, DaShawn, \nwho still needs dental care, and the millions of other American \nchildren who rely on public health care for their dental care needs. \nThat is the least we can do.\n  I urge my colleagues to give these matters the attention they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                     Accountability at Walter Reed\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, yesterday I had the privilege of \nspending 3 hours at Walter Reed Army Hospital, specifically looking at \noutpatient care. As a result of that visit, I have come to several \ninescapable conclusions about the leadership of the armed services over \nthis important area.\n  First, we have to start with a foundational premise, and that premise \nis our wounded deserve the best. The men and women who have crossed \nthat line and say ``I will go'' and go and get hurt and come home \ndeserve the best our military can give them--not Building 18.\n  There are so many problems at Walter Reed, and legislation has been \nintroduced that I am honored to cosponsor that will address a lot of \nthese problems--systemic bureaucratic problems: not sufficient \ncounselors, not sufficient training, not taking care of the families of \nthe wounded. A lot of necessary issues are covered in that legislation. \nBut today I thought it important to spend a few minutes talking about \nthe leadership.\n  We have to make up our mind around here whether we are going to say \n``support the troops'' and provide oversight and accountability or \nwhether we are going to mean it. If you are going to have \naccountability under these circumstances you have to look at the \nculture of leadership. You have to look at the very top of the \nleadership tree over Walter Reed. In this instance the leader, General \nKiley, was at Walter Reed at or near the time Building 18 opened. It is \nclear that General Kiley, the Surgeon General of the Army, knew about \nthe conditions at Building 18. More importantly, he knew about the \nother problems.\n  The irony of this situation is General Weightman, who has only been \nthere a year, stepped up and said, I take responsibility. I am the \ncommander here now. Just minutes ago he was relieved of his command, \nwhile General Kiley is quoted repeatedly as if there is not a problem--\nhe is spinning: ``I want to reset the thinking that while we have some \nissues here, this is not a horrific, catastrophic failure at Walter \nReed. I mean these are not good, but you saw rooms that were perfectly \nacceptable.''\n  They are not perfectly acceptable. You have people who are stationed \nat Walter Reed who have better barracks than the wounded. That is \nunacceptable. Our wounded should get the best. The people in better \nbarracks can be placed in apartments in town. When the decision was \nmade to let these men move into Building 18, they could have moved into \nthe better barracks and the people who are stationed there permanently \ncould have been stationed elsewhere.\n  On Building 18 he said the problems--by the way, he lives within a \nblock of Building 18, General Kiley--``weren't serious and there \nweren't a lot of them.'' They are serious and there are a lot of them. \nHe said they were not ``emblematic of a process of Walter Reed that has \nabandoned soldiers and their families.''''\n  Back in December, when the vets organizations met with General Kiley \nand enumerated these problems about the wounded and their families and \nthe problems they were facing in outpatient, General Kiley said, ``very \nimportant testimony.'' That was it.\n  I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding. Colonel Callahan, \nwho is in charge of the hospital at Walter Reed, was open and honest \nand clearly cared, as did most of the leaders I talked to around the \ntable. But I went away with an uneasy sense that all the legislation we \npass and all the paint we can put on the walls is not going to solve \nthis problem if we don't begin to speak out for accountability within \nthe leadership of the military.\n  When we had the scandal at Abu Ghraib, noncommissioned officers were \ndisciplined. Up until the relieving of General Weightman today, no one \nabove a captain had been disciplined in this matter. It is time the \nleadership at the top takes responsibility and that is why I have \ncalled today for the Surgeon General of the Army, LTG Kevin Kiley, to \nbe relieved of his command over the medical command of the United \nStates Army so the message can go out loudly and clearly: We will not \ntolerate treatment of our wounded in any way that does not reflect the \nrespect we have for them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 290, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify \namendment No. 290.

Mr. President, I come here today first to make some \ncomments about the legislation that is before the Chamber. I can think \nof no greater responsibility for this Senate to take on than to make \nsure our homeland is in fact secure and protected. I commend my \ncolleagues, the chairman, Senator Joe Lieberman, and Senator Susan \nCollins, the ranking member, for having worked with the committee to \nhave brought a very good product here to the floor of the Senate. It is \nlegislation I strongly support. It moves our country in the right \ndirection in terms of making sure we are moving forward with the \nappropriate level of homeland security.\n  When the people of Colorado chose me to represent them here in this \nChamber, I made a promise to them that protecting our homeland and \nsupporting law enforcement would be among my very highest priorities. \nIn the 2 years-plus since I took that oath of office, I have had the \nprivilege of working hard to fulfill that pledge with my colleagues \nhere in the Senate. With the help of colleagues of both parties, I have \nbeen privileged to help pass the Combat Meth Act, I have been \nprivileged to help find bipartisan support on the PATRIOT Act, provide \nresources for law enforcement and emergency responders, and pass, last \nyear, a comprehensive immigration reform bill that secured our borders \nand enforced our laws.\n  Great challenges remain. Great challenges remain as we move forward \nwith the challenge of homeland security, challenges that cannot be \ndeferred, challenges we should not defer here in Washington. These are \nchallenges that require compromise and a bipartisan approach in dealing \nwith homeland security. This week we take up those challenges as we \nimplement the unfinished recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  I begin my remarks by reading a few sentences from the preface of the \n9/11 Commission report. That report said in its preface the following:\n\n       We have come together with a unity of purpose because our \n     Nation demands it. September 11, 2001, was a day of \n     unprecedented shock and suffering in the history of the \n     United States. The nation was unprepared. How did this happen \n     and how can we avoid such tragedy again?\n\n  These words convey a simple but a very important message. We have an \nobligation to work together, not as partisans but as policymakers, to \nensure our Nation is better protected in the future. The bill we are \ndebating today takes a number of very important steps in that \ndirection.\n  First, I am pleased to see the creation of a grant program dedicated \nto improving interoperable communications at the Federal, State, and \nlocal levels. This grant program will help ensure that communities \nacross the country in both urban and rural areas receive the funding \nnecessary to improve their communications systems. Money alone will not \nsolve the problem of interoperability, but many cash-strapped \ncommunities need the Federal funds necessary to help purchase the \nnecessary radio and tower upgrades.\n  It is also important to note that States will be required to pass on \nat least 80 percent of grants under this program to local and tribal \ngovernments and to demonstrate that those funds will be used in a \nmanner consistent with statewide operability plans and the National \nEmergency Communications Plan. While Colorado has been a leader in \nachieving interoperability, many communities in my State simply do not \nhave the resources necessary to purchase radio equipment. As Frank \nCavaliere, the chief of the Lower Valley Colorado Fire District, told \nmy office last year, ``We are many light years away from being able to \npurchase enough radio equipment let alone all of the repeater towers \nneeded for effective coverage.'' This grant program alone will not \nsolve the problem, but it is an important step in the right direction.\n  Second, I am pleased to see the proposed legislation would improve \nthe sharing of intelligence and information with State and local and \ntribal governments. In particular, I am pleased the bill establishes an \nintelligence training program for State, local, and tribal law \nenforcement officers and emergency responders, and it authorizes the \nInteragency Threat Assessment Coordination Group, which will coordinate \nthe dissemination of intelligence to State and local officials.\n  Intelligence and information sharing is an issue of particular \nimportance to law enforcement officials and emergency responders \nthroughout our Nation. Indeed, when I conducted a survey last year of \nColorado emergency officials, by a 3-to-1 margin they felt \nantiterrorism information they received from the Federal Government was \ninsufficient and ineffective. The chief of police for Estes Park, CO, \nLowell Richardson, summed this up when he told my office the following. \nHe said ``a duplicity in sharing information . . . exists between State \nand Federal agencies. This overwhelms our ability to efficiently sift \nthrough the information and forward what is relevant to the officers on \nthe street.''\n  I am hopeful this bill will begin to sort out this program and ensure \nour State and local emergency responders have all the necessary \ninformation and intelligence.\n  Finally, I am pleased the bill would mandate the creation of a \nNational Biosurveillance Integration Center which would promote the \nintegration of Federal, State, and local data from human health, \nagriculture, and environmental surveillance programs in order to \nenhance the ability to rapidly identify and attack outbreaks following \na bioterrorist attack or a naturally occurring pandemic. In the survey \nof Colorado emergency responders, by a 4-to-1 margin they felt \nunprepared to handle a weapons of mass destruction attack. It is our \nduty as a Congress to do everything in our power to help State, local, \nand tribal communities prepare for the possibility of a bioterrorist \nattack and this bill takes an important step in that direction.\n  I also note two amendments which I offered to strengthen this already \ngood bill. These amendments deal with two issues which I understand \nwell since serving as attorney general for Colorado, the planning and \ntraining for law enforcement.\n  Now I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set aside. I \ncall up amendment No. 290 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. This amendment would require the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to conduct a ``Quadrennial Homeland Defense Review.'' I am \nproud both Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins are cosponsors of this \nlegislation.\n  This amendment would provide a comprehensive examination of the \nnational homeland security strategy and an assessment of interagency \ncooperation, preparedness of Federal response\n\n[[Page S2459]]\n\nassets and infrastructure, and a budget plan.\n  The quadrennial homeland defense review would mirror the quadrennial \nhomeland defense review prepared by the Pentagon which helped shape \ndefense policy, military strategy, and resource allocation. The \nquadrennial review would not be another bureaucratic document which \ngathers dust on some shelf; instead, this document will require DHS to \ndo the hard thinking, preparation, and planning necessary to coordinate \nnational homeland security resources.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 280 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  The second amendment I wish to discuss is amendment No. 280. I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the pending amendment \nbeing set aside?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Salazar], for himself, Mr. \n     Chambliss, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Pryor, proposes an amendment \n     No. 280 to amendment No. 275.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RURAL POLICING INSTITUTE.\n\n       (a) In General.--There is established a Rural Policing \n     Institute, which shall be administered by the Office of State \n     and Local Training of the Federal Law Enforcement Training \n     Center (based in Glynco, Georgia), to--\n       (1) evaluate the needs of law enforcement agencies of units \n     of local government and tribal governments located in rural \n     areas;\n       (2) develop expert training programs designed to address \n     the needs of rural law enforcement agencies regarding \n     combating methamphetamine addiction and distribution, \n     domestic violence, law enforcement response related to school \n     shootings, and other topics identified in the evaluation \n     conducted under paragraph (1);\n       (3) provide the training programs described in paragraph \n     (2) to law enforcement agencies of units of local government \n     and tribal governments located in rural areas; and\n       (4) conduct outreach efforts to ensure that training \n     programs under the Rural Policing Institute reach law \n     enforcement officers of units of local government and tribal \n     governments located in rural areas.\n       (b) Curricula.--The training at the Rural Policing \n     Institute established under subsection (a) shall be \n     configured in a manner so as to not duplicate or displace any \n     law enforcement program of the Federal Law Enforcement \n     Training Center in existence on the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``rural'' means \n     area that is not located in a metropolitan statistical area, \n     as defined by the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section (including for \n     contracts, staff, and equipment)--\n       (1) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2008; and\n       (2) $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2013.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, this amendment, which I offer with \nSenators Chambliss, Isakson, and Pryor, would create a Rural Policing \nInstitute at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. I have often \nreferred to our rural communities as ``the forgotten America.'' Indeed, \nrural America is the backbone of our country. But often those with wide \nstretches of land out in the heartland of America are forgotten and \ndon't have the kinds of resources found in larger cities.\n  What this amendment would do is create a Rural Policing Institute \nthat would be operated out of the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter in Georgia. I am proud my colleagues in Georgia and Arkansas \nhave agreed to cosponsor the amendment. The essence of this amendment \nis to evaluate the needs of rural and tribal law enforcement agencies. \nIt would develop training programs designed to address the needs of \nrural law enforcement agencies. It would export those training programs \nto those agencies, and it would conduct outreach to ensure the programs \nreach rural law enforcement agencies.\n  Let me comment briefly on this amendment. When I step back and see \nwhat we are trying to do on the front of homeland security, we know \nthat at some point, someplace, we in the United States will be attacked \nagain in the same way we were attacked on 9/11. The question becomes, \nWhat will we do to prevent those kinds of attacks from occurring?\n  If one looks at the men and women who wear our uniform as our peace \nofficers around the country, there are some 600,000 of them out there \nin patrol cars. They are the ones who are going to be the first to \nreally know whether there is a threat somewhere within a small \ncommunity or a large community. It is important for us to support these \nmen and women who are out there as law enforcement officers and make \nthem a coordinated partner in helping us deal with issues of homeland \nsecurity. The Rural Policing Institute, which is a top-of-the-line \ninstitute for Federal law enforcement training, should be made \navailable to these rural law enforcement officers because that will \nhelp them be true partners in enhancing homeland security, which we \nneed so much.\n  I commend the leadership of Senators Lieberman and Collins on this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Jersey will \nwithhold, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess from \n3 p.m. to 4 p.m. for the national security briefing in S. 407; that \nupon reconvening at 4 p.m., the Senate resume the Schumer amendment No. \n298; that prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, there be 45 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled by Senators Schumer \nand Lieberman or their designees; that no amendment be in order to the \namendment prior to the vote; and that upon use of the time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relationship to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 298\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will try to conclude my remarks \nbefore the time we are closing down the Senate.\n  The House has taken an important step to implement the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. I am pleased to see us at work to complete \nour deliberations on this bill, but for the moment, I wish to talk \nabout amendment No. 298 which Senator Schumer has offered to strengthen \nour port and container security. It builds on a law I helped write last \nyear. It was then that I authored language in the SAFE Ports Act to \nrequire the Bush administration to scan every container entering our \ncountry, looking for weapons and contraband. My amendment called for a \ndramatic change in our national policy on cargo screening, but the \nadministration was not moving fast enough. That is why it is essential \nthat we pass today's amendment offered by Senator Schumer, which I \ncosponsored.\n  The 2-mile stretch that is between Port Newark and Newark-Liberty \nInternational Airport is considered the most at-risk area in the \ncountry for a terrorist attack. This is asserted by the FBI, and it is \nsomething to which we have to pay serious attention.\n  I served as a commissioner of the Port Authority of New Jersey and \nNew York. I know how vulnerable a target the port region is. Our ports \nare the doors through which essential goods and commodities enter our \nnational economy. They are the doors through which supplies flow to our \nmilitary. Ninety-five percent of all America's imported goods arrive by \nship. We need a way to ensure that 100 percent of these containers \ncoming into our country are WMD free. We need a scanning system in \nplace as soon as possible. Since the Bush administration has failed to \nact promptly to put this scanning system in place at our ports, we need \nto pass this amendment to push the administration to complete the task.\n\n  The New Jersey-New York port is the second busiest container port in \nthe entire country. In 2005, 13 percent of all vessels arriving in \nAmerica called on our port. Thousands of longshoremen and others work \nat docks where these ships come in, and millions of people live in the \ndensely packed communities around the port. Every day we fail to make \nour ports safer is a day we can leave them more vulnerable to a \nterrorist attack.\n  Today, we only inspect about 5 percent of the shipping containers \nthat enter our country. Who knows what lies within those containers? We \nhave seen attempts to smuggle arms into our country through the port. \nWithin 95 percent of the containers we don't inspect, terrorists could \nlaunch an attack even more devastating than 9/11,\n\n[[Page S2460]]\n\nvirtually in the same neighborhood. Terrorists could smuggle \nthemselves, traditional weapons, chemical or biological weapons, or \neven nuclear weapons. We know about the availability of smaller, more \ncompact, more deadly weapons that are being developed.\n  We have seen what happened in the past. In April 2005, security \nguards at the Port of Los Angeles found 28 human beings, Chinese \nnationals, who were smuggled into the country in two cargo containers. \nIn October 2002, Italian authorities found a suspected Egyptian \nterrorist living in a shipping container en route to Canada. According \nto a news report at the time, he had a laptop computer, two cell \nphones, a Canadian passport, security passes for airports in three \ncountries, a certificate identifying him as an airline mechanic, and \nairport maps. We can't let that happen.\n  We have screened all airline passengers for weapons, and we do it \nbecause Congress passed a strong law with clear deadlines. Of course, \nthat forced the Bush administration to act. We need to screen all cargo \ncontainers for weapons. That is why we have to pass a strong law now.\n  Some in the industry and the administration say 100 percent screening \ncannot be done without crippling our economy. Let me tell my colleagues \nwhat would cripple commerce--that would be another terrorist attack. We \nlost 700 New Jerseyans and a total of over 3,000 people on 9/11. I \ndon't want my State or anybody in our country to lose any more. This \namendment will give us the tools and incentives we need to help prevent \nan attack on our ports, and it will help protect our economy and \nAmerican lives.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the amendment and urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 6 minutes prior to the recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, at 4:45, there will be a vote on or \nin relation to the amendment offered by Senator Schumer and Senator \nMenendez. I wish to explain very briefly--and Senator Collins will \nspeak later--on why we did not include this provision in the committee \nbill.\n  This provision which Senators Schumer and Menendez have offered \nmirrors the section of the House-passed 9/11 bill. It was not actually \ncalled for by the 9/11 Commission, specifically, but it obviously \nrelates to security and our concern about nuclear weapons or dirty \nbombs coming in through the thousands of containers that enter our \nports every day.\n  The reasons our committee in its deliberation in bringing this bill \nto the floor did not include language similar to the House bill is, \nfirst, the 9/11 Commission didn't ask for it, and most of what we have \ndone, though not all, was included in that report; but, secondly, we \nacted last year in adopting the SAFE Port Act, enacted into law on \nOctober 13, 2006.\n  It does provide for a pilot program at three foreign ports to provide \nfor the scanning of cargo containers by radiation detection monitors \nand x-ray devices required under this proposal. There will be a report \ncoming 6 months after the end of that one year pilot program. Among \nother responsibilities dictated by the law, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity will be required to report not only on how the pilot program \nwent, but when we will achieve the goal of which--reading from the law, \nsection 232--``all containers entering the United States, before such \ncontainers arrive in the United States, shall as soon as possible be \nscanned using nonintrusive imaging equipment and radiation detection \nequipment.''\n  In other words, existing law requires that we move--and I quote \nagain--``as soon as possible to 100 percent scanning of all of the \ncontainers coming into the country.'' It requires the Secretary to \nreport on how we are moving toward that goal, and when he thinks we can \nachieve it, every 6 months.\n  In my opinion, existing law has a 100-percent goal right now, with \nreporting every 6 months to the relevant committees. Senators Schumer \nand Menendez have asked that it occur within 5 years and actually give \na 1-year waiver opportunity to the Secretary.\n  At this point, I say respectfully that this requirement is premature. \nI hope that under current law, ``as soon as possible'' will occur \nbefore 5 years time. To my friends who offer the amendment, if after \nthe first 6-month report, due next April, or the second 6-month report, \nit looks like, based on what the Secretary reports, 100 percent \nscanning of containers coming into the country is to be much more \ndelayed than I had hoped it would be, then I will join them in offering \nan amendment that will have a definite date by which 100 percent \nscanning should occur. It is for that reason that our committee did not \ninclude this section. We talked about it and decided not to include \nit--as it was in the House bill, because we think existing law does at \nleast as good, and perhaps a better job. I will respectfully oppose the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I know the time is divided equally. How \nmuch time does each side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York has 16 minutes. The \nSenator from Connecticut has 7 minutes 21 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I have a great deal of respect for my \ncolleague, and I know he cares a great deal about protecting our \ncountry. But with all due respect, I cannot stand here and say that the \nSAFE Port Act does enough. The SAFE Port Act says that 100 percent \nscanning must be imposed ``as soon as possible.'' It might as well say \nwhenever DHS feels like it.\n  For somebody like myself and my colleague from New Jersey and my \ncolleague from New York, we have been waiting for DHS to do this ``as \nsoon as possible'' for 4 years. We have been alerting DHS to this \nterrible potential tragedy we face--a nuclear weapon being smuggled \ninto our harbors, a nuclear weapon exploding on a ship right off our \nharbors--for years. DHS just slow-walks it. Why?\n  Part of the reason is that they are never adequately funded, which is \nno fault of my colleague from Connecticut. But the administration does \nnot like to spend money on anything domestic. They never put the \nadequate money into it. It is amazing to me that they will spend \neverything it takes to fight a war on terror overseas. Some of that is \nwell spent and some, I argue, is not. Nonetheless, they spend it. They \nwon't spend hardly a nickel, figuratively speaking, to protect us on \ndefense at home. So the progress has been slow.\n  This is not the first time I have offered amendments to prod DHS to \ndo more on nuclear detection devices, on port security. I don't know \nwhy anyone in this Chamber, faced with the potential tragedy that we \nhave, would decide\n\n[[Page S2461]]\n\nto leave it up to DHS. But that is just what this base bill does. I \ndon't know what people are afraid of. Yes, we have people with shipping \ninterests who say don't do this, it will cost a little bit more. \nTerrorism costs all of us more. To allow a narrow band of shippers to \nprevail on an issue that affects our security is beyond me.\n  Is the technology available? I will be honest with you that there is \na dispute. Either way, the amendment the Senator from New Jersey and I \nhave introduced makes sense. If it is available, they will implement \nit. If it is not available, they will perfect it and get it working \nbecause they have a deadline. Nothing will concentrate the mind of DHS \nlike a deadline. But vague, amorphous language that says ``as soon as \npossible''--their view of ``as soon as possible'' is not enough to \nsafeguard America.\n  Very few things that we do in the Senate frustrate me more than this. \nWhy don't we force DHS and force the administration to make us safe \nagainst arguably the greatest disaster that could befall us--one that \nwe know al-Qaida and other terrorists would like to pursue? Why do we \nallow laxity, just obliviousness, and a narrow special interest to \nprevail over what seems to be so much the common good?\n  I am aghast. This amendment should not even be debated by now. Maybe \nin 2003, maybe in 2004. But it is now 2007, and we are still not doing \nclose to what we should be doing. Just last night, I spoke to an expert \nwho said the technology is there. If there is a will, there is a way. \nAgain, I say if you believe the technology isn't there, the answer \nisn't to let DHS proceed at the same lackadaisical pace, when one of \nthe greatest dangers that could befall us could happen.\n  My colleagues, nobody wants to wake up in a ``what if'' scenario. \nAfter 9/11 occurred, we were all ``what-ifing''--what if we had done \nthis or what if we had done that. It was hard before that because \nnobody envisioned that somebody would fly a whole bunch of airplanes \ninto our buildings. We know the terrorists want to explode a nuclear \ndevice in America or off our shores. That is not a secret. I argue that \nthat is as great a danger to us as is what is happening in Iraq. Will \nmy colleagues say we should not spend all the money when it comes to \nfighting a war on terror overseas? Of course not.\n  The other side of the aisle says spend every nickel we need. Here, \nwhen it comes to homeland security, they are either defending an \nadministration that has botched this issue like they botched so many \nothers or because maybe some shipping interests complain or because \nthey truly believe the technology is not available, and we continue to \nslow-walk this issue.\n  I will have more to say in a few minutes. I will yield the floor so \nmy colleague from Maine and my colleague from New Jersey can have a \nchance to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of my time be reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Very briefly, the Senator from New York has spoken \npassionately. I agree with everything he said about the urgency of the \nthreat and the need to protect our people from weapons of mass \ndestruction, which may arrive in containers. But I want to come back to \nwhat I said for a few moments. There is existing law that sets up a \nprocess that compels the Secretary of Homeland Security to achieve 100 \npercent cargo scanning as soon as possible, based on the outcome of the \nthree port pilot projects that are occurring this year.\n  My friend from New York has said that ``as soon as possible'' could \nbe whenever the Department of Homeland Security wants, that they have \nbeen doing nothing for the 5\\1/2\\ years since \n9/11. However, this law, the SAFE Ports Act, just became law last \nOctober 13, 2006. So the pilot programs at the three ports have just \nstarted in the last 5 months.\n  At the end of the year, the Secretary will make a report to Congress \nabout how those pilots are going. Again, he is required by the law to \nstate to the appropriate Congressional committees in April of next \nyear, and every 6 months thereafter, the status of full-scale \ndeployment under subsection (b), which is basically saying how soon can \nwe get to exactly what Senators Schumer, Menendez, Collins, and I and I \npresume everybody--wants, which is 100 percent cargo container \nscanning.\n  So, again, we think we have a mechanism. We share the same goal. If \nfor some reason after the first 6 month report, or the second one, we \nare dissatisfied with the pace of implementation by the Secretary, I am \nsure we will all join to set a deadline. For now, the committee has \ndecided that it is not necessary.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Certainly.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Again, I have great respect for my colleague and all he \nhas done in homeland security. But I don't get the argument. My \ncolleague just said they will report to us, and if we are not satisfied \nwe can later impose a deadline. Given the urgency, why not do it the \nother way? Put in a deadline, and if 2 years from now they say they \ncannot do it, they will come back to us and we can remove the deadline. \nIt seems to me that would get them to act more quickly than the \napproach my colleague has suggested.\n  I yield for an answer.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from New York. Of course, I send \nback the same respect to him, truly, coming from New York, particularly \nafter 9/11, he has been an effective advocate for homeland security. My \nanswer is this: Maybe history will show me to be an unjustified \noptimist. I hope ``as soon as possible,'' as stated in the law, means \nthat we should have 100 percent scanning sooner than 5 years. I will \nnot have a real sense of that until we get the first 6 month report, or \nmaybe the second. So to me, again, it is the judgment of the committee \nto not include the House-passed provision, not recommended by the 9/11 \nCommission, and to give the system time to work.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield 5 minutes of our remaining time to my colleague \nand fellow sponsor, Senator Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the leadership and advocacy of my \ncolleague from New York to work with us on this issue. Look, the \nquestion is, On what side do we err? It seems to me we should err on \nthe side of having a deadline that moves the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and us as a nation toward having the greatest possibility of \nsecurity in a post-September 11 world.\n  If this was pre-September 11 and we were arguing that a conventional \nmeans of transportation--in this case a cargo ship--could, in fact, be \nused as a weapon of mass destruction and we hadn't had that experience, \nI could see the skepticism. But the reality is we are in a post-\nSeptember 11 world. Five years after we saw a traditional form of \ntransportation be used as a weapon of mass destruction, as we saw a \nsimple envelope be tainted ultimately and be used as a weapon against \nan individual, as we saw someone who boarded an aircraft and tried to \nignite his shoes, the reality is it doesn't take a lot to be convinced \nyou can take 95 percent of the cargo, which goes unscanned, comes into \nthis country, and have a great shot of including something in there, \nparticularly a nuclear device, that would cost us far more--far more--\nthan what we are talking about proceeding on today. Three years for \nmajor ports, 5 years for other ports--that is too fast? Ten years after \nSeptember 11, that is too fast? I can't comprehend it.\n  There are those who say we already have a risk-based approach, it is \nlayered, it is whatnot. That is great if you trust algorithms to \nultimately protect the Nation. I don't trust algorithms to ultimately \nprotect the Nation. I want real scanning, and the technology is there. \nIt seems to me if Hong Kong can do it and other places in the world can \ndo it, we can expect it as well.\n  There is also the suggestion of cost. How much did we spend after \nSeptember 11? How much will we spend in lives and national treasure if \nwe make a mistake by not ensuring that the traffic that comes into the \nports of this country is as secure as it can be? And who among us is \nwilling to look at the sons and daughters of those who work on the \ndocks or the communities that surround these ports--most were built in \na way where communities surround them--and what will we do about the\n\n[[Page S2462]]\n\nnational economy, because it won't be just a regional economy that will \nbe affected but a ripple effect in the national economy? How much will \nwe spend? Far more. The lives that will be lost are incalculable and \npriceless.\n  I argue that, in fact, what we saw in the SAFE Port Act got the \nDepartment to act because they, in essence, had a deadline. So when we \nhave deadlines, we see the Department acting. In my mind, all the more \nreason to have what I think is a very reasonable deadline--3 years for \nmajor ports, 5 years on all other ports, and even with the ability to \nextend beyond that by virtue of the Secretary making a determination. \nThat moves the Department to understanding where we want to be.\n  But ultimately, I don't believe the present risk-based approach that \nlets 95 percent of all the cargo coming into this country go unscanned, \nthat we depend on algorithms, that we use the costs supposedly to \nachieve 100-percent scanning is something that is acceptable.\n  The question is: How much greater will the costs be? Look at the \ncosts we are incurring in aviation. They are enormous.\n  Then we won't be able to get host nations to agree: The reality is \nthose host nations want access to the greatest market in the world, the \nUnited States of America. I cannot fathom that they won't do something \nthat is necessary to try to get access to the greatest market in the \nworld, the most prosperous market in the world. I think they will.\n  As someone who represents a State that lost 700 residents on \nSeptember 11, I am not ready--I certainly am not ready--to take the \nposition that we will do less than what we can do to achieve the \nsecurity of our people. That is what this amendment is all about. It is \nstructured in a reasonable way.\n  We have seen deadlines generate the Department of Homeland Security \nactivity we want to see. We give time frames that are reasonable, \ntechnology that is available. We have incentives for all the right \nreasons for the marketplace and, above all, we can look at our citizens \nand say, in fact, they are protected.\n  I yield any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield such time to the Senator from \nMaine as she desires of the time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 5 seconds remaining.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the committee \nfor yielding time to me.\n  You can read the entire 567 pages of the ``9/11 Commission Report'' \nas I have and you will not find a recommendation to undertake 100-\npercent scanning of cargo containers. This bill's purpose--the bill \nbefore us--is to finish the business of implementing the 9/11 \nCommission Report recommendations. Senator Schumer's and Senator \nMenendez's amendment is not one of the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  Further, I want to address what has been said about our system for \nimproving the security of our seaports by focusing on cargo container \nsecurity.\n  The fact is a great deal has been done since the attacks on our \ncountry on September 11, 2001. We have a layered approach to cargo \nsecurity. It balances security interests against the need for efficient \nmovement of millions of containers through our seaports each year--11 \nmillion, in fact, last year alone.\n  One layer is the screening of all cargo manifests at least 24 hours \nbefore the cargo is loaded onto ships bound for our shores. That \nscreening, along with work done by the Coast Guard, is used in DHS's \nautomated targeting system which identifies high-risk containers.\n  As a result of the cargo security bill that we passed last fall, we \nhave a requirement that 100 percent of all high-risk cargo be subjected \nto scanning and that is appropriate. We want to focus our resources on \nthe cargo that is of highest risk. But that is only one layer in the \nprocess.\n\n  Another layer is the Container Security Initiative. This program \nstations Customs and Border Protection officers at foreign ports. CSI \nwill be operational in 58 foreign ports by the end of this year, \ncovering approximately 85 percent of all containerized cargo headed to \nthe United States by sea. That is another layer of security.\n  There is yet another one. It is the Customs-Trade Partnership Against \nTerrorism Program, known as C-TPAT. This program is a cooperative \neffort between the Government and the private sector to secure the \nentire supply chain. It is a result of the legislation Senator Murray, \nSenator Coleman, Senator Lieberman, and I authored last year.\n  Firms that participate in C-TPAT and secure their supply chain are \ngiven certain advantages when it comes to scanning cargo because DHS \nwill have certified that they have met certain standards. That is an \nimportant layer of security.\n  There is another important safeguard that is a result of the SAFE \nPort Act, and that is the law requires by the end of this year that the \n22 largest American ports must have radiation scanners which will \nensure that 98 percent--98 percent--of inbound containers are scanned \nfor radiation. That is because we do have the technology to do scanning \nfor radiation. We have these radiation portal monitors that trucks can \ndrive through with the containers loaded on them and be scanned for \nradiation. There is a problem with some false positives. I was \ndescribing earlier that for some reason, marble and kitty litter tend \nto cause false positives. But at least we identify these containers \nthat are giving off alarms, and then they are subject to further \ninspection and search, and that makes sense.\n  I should mention we are also installing these overseas as part of the \nDepartment of Energy's Megaports Initiative.\n  The idea that nothing has been done to secure our seaports since 9/11 \nis demonstrably false. We took a giant step forward last year with the \npassage of the SAFE Port Act.\n  There is more that is being done, however, and that is, as Senator \nLieberman and Senator Coleman have explained, the new law authorizes \npilot programs to test 100-percent integrated scanning programs.\n  We keep hearing Hong Kong brought up, but the fact is, in Hong Kong, \nthere is scanning being done on only 2 of 40 lines, and the images are \nnot being read. What good is it to take the picture, the X-ray, \nessentially, but then not have anyone analyzing the images? How does \nthat increase security?\n  We still will learn something from the Hong Kong project, but I think \nwe are going to learn even more from the three projects the Department \nhas started already as a result of the SAFE Port Act.\n  There have been allegations that somehow the Department is sitting on \nits hands. That is not true. In fact, three ports--one in the United \nKingdom, one in Honduras, and one in Pakistan--have been selected \nalready and the projects are going forward to test these pilot \nprograms. I think that is important to know.\n  So we have made a great deal of progress. We are going to make more \nas a result of these pilot projects. But the whole point is until we \nhave the technology in place to do this effectively and efficiently, it \nwill cause a massive backup in our ports if we are trying to scan 11 \nmillion containers--low-risk containers, containers that pose \nabsolutely no threat to the security of this country--and that approach \ndoes not make sense.\n  Finally, let me read something from the Chamber of Commerce which has \nsent around an alert on this issue because I think this summarizes the \nissue:\n\n       The Chamber points out that more than 11 million containers \n     arrive at our Nation's seaports each year and 95 percent of \n     our Nation's trade flows through our seaports.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n45 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I continuing quoting the Chamber of Commerce:\n\n       If adopted, the Schumer amendment would significantly \n     disrupt the flow of trade and impose costly mandates on \n     American businesses without providing additional security.\n\n\n[[Page S2463]]\n\n\n  That is the bottom line. I urge the rejection of the Schumer \namendment, and when the time has expired, I will move to table the \namendment.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, what is the status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized. There \nis 3 minutes 1 second remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, first, I thank my colleague from Maine \nfor helping make our case. She says the technology for detecting \nradiation is available. Who in God's name thinks if we didn't set a \ndeadline or if the President didn't order DHS to make it the highest \npriority that we wouldn't find a way to scan all containers within 5 \nyears? Of course we would. This is just defense of DHS. I say to my \ncolleagues, DHS has a terrible track record in this area, like so many \nothers. They have been asked to do this for years already, and they are \nnowhere.\n\n  Now, my good friend from Connecticut says: Well, on October 13, we \npassed legislation. Well, that is 3 years after 9/11. What is wrong, my \ncolleagues? Why isn't everything right with a deadline that says you \nbetter move as quickly as you can? Yes, if they should need, if they \ncome to us 3 years from now and we are convinced that they have done \neverything they can, that the money has been spent, that the experts \nhave been contacted and used appropriately, then we can delay it. \nInstead, we have this approach which seems to me to be backward--let us \ndelay another 2 or 3 years, and if they do not do a good job, we can \nthen put in a deadline.\n  No one is arguing we shouldn't have deadlines. The argument boils \ndown to, do you trust DHS to do the job or would you rather have an \nimmutable deadline on something which is the most damaging thing? I \ncan't think of anything worse or close to it than a nuclear weapon \nexploding in America or off our shores. The technology is there, my \ncolleagues. Yes, DHS doesn't want to spend the money necessary. Yes, \nDHS has not had very good people in this Department.\n  How are my colleagues going to go home and tell their constituents \nthat when there was a chance to really move an agency and set a \ndeadline, as the House did--this is not some crazy idea; the House \nvoted by a significant majority for it--that they didn't do it, they \ndidn't do it because they had faith in DHS? I don't know who does. How \ndo my colleagues say they didn't do it because their port or a shipping \ncompany said they didn't want to do it or they didn't do it because \nthey didn't think it was that big a problem? I don't think any of those \nreasons stand up. I don't think any of them stand up.\n  I have to say I have listened carefully to my colleagues, and I have \ngreat respect for them and the jobs they do, but their arguments just \ndon't wash: Let's give them another chance. My colleagues, when it \ncomes to this problem, we can't afford to give them another chance.\n  I urge a vote for the amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Kennedy, \nLautenberg, and Biden be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The time of the Senator from New York has expired. The Senator from \nMaine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Madam President, I move to table the Schumer amendment, and I request \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the \nSenator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, more than 11 million cargo containers enter \nthe United States each year. One hundred percent of the shipping \nmanifests are screened to determine their risk. Approximately 17 to 19 \npercent of those containers determined to be high risk are examined by \nscreening machines using xray or gamma ray technology, and only 5 \npercent of containers are physically opened and examined. This is not \nsatisfactory. Clearly, much more needs to be done to increase the \nnumber of containers that are screened prior to entering this country. \nOnly a more robust system will provide the deterrence necessary to make \nAmerica safer.\n  I have been a leader in the effort to provide additional funding to \npurchase screening equipment and hire the personnel to perform these \ninspections. Nevertheless, I voted to table the amendment of the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer. I believe we must set realistic \ngoals. There is a process which has been set in place by the SAFE Port \nAct to get us to the ability to conduct 100 percent inspections. I will \ncontinue to do all in my power to provide the funds to ensure that we \nreach an achievable goal as rapidly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I note the presence of a friend and \ncolleague from Hawaii, a distinguished member of our Homeland Security \nCommittee. I yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business on the REAL ID Act, and I thank the \nchairman for his agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today the Department of Homeland Security \nreleased its much anticipated proposed\n\n[[Page S2464]]\n\nregulations implementing the REAL ID Act of 2005. Although I am still \nreviewing the 162 pages of regulations, I note that the regulations \naddress the problems with the statutory May 11, 2008, deadline for \ncompliance. However, the regulations remain troublesome because they \nreflect the problems of the underlying statute.\n  I intend to ensure that these problems are resolved, which is why I \nreintroduced the Identity Security Enhancement Act, S. 717, to repeal \nREAL ID and replace it with the negotiated rulemaking process and the \nmore reasonable guidelines established in the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004.\n  I am pleased to be joined ``by Senators Sununu, Leahy, and Tester. I \nalso thank Senator Collins for her work on this issue.\n  From its inception, REAL ID has been surrounded in controversy and \nsubject to criticism from both ends of the political spectrum. The act \nplaces a significant unfunded mandate on States and is a serious threat \nto privacy and civil liberties.\n\n  I support the goal of making our identification cards and driver's \nlicenses more secure, as recommended by the 9/11 Commission. However, \nthe massive amounts of personal information that would be stored in \ninterconnected databases, as well as on the card, could provide one-\nstop shopping for identity thieves. As a result, REAL ID could make us \nless secure by giving us a false sense of security.\n  Nearly half of our Nation's State legislatures--22--have acted to \nintroduce or to pass legislation to condemn REAL ID since the beginning \nof the year. In some cases, States would be prohibited from spending \nmoney to implement the act. Two bills have been introduced in the \nHawaii State legislature, one supporting the repeal of REAL ID and the \nother supporting passage of my legislation.\n  As I noted earlier, DHS has acknowledged the implementation problems \nand the need to help address the burdens on States. Secretary Chertoff \nannounced today that States could easily apply for a waiver from the \ncompliance deadline and could use up to 20 percent of the State's \nHomeland Security Grant Program, SHSGP, funds to pay for REAL ID \nimplementation. But this is a hollow solution. The President's fiscal \nyear 2008 budget proposes to cut SHSGP by $835 million. I fail to see \nhow States are able to implement an $11 billion program with Federal \nhomeland security grants that the Bush administration continues to cut.\n\n  Moreover, the regulations proposed today fail to address several of \nthe most critical privacy and civil liberties issues raised by REAL ID, \nwhich essentially creates a national ID. No hearings were held on REAL \nID when it was passed as part of the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami \nRelief Act in 2005. I think this is part of the problem and is where I \nhope to bring forth a solution.\n\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, I plan to hold hearings in the near future to review the \nproposed regulations and how DHS plans to implement this costly and \ncontroversial law. Unfunded mandates and the lack of privacy and \nsecurity requirements are real problems that deserve real consideration \nand real solutions. Congress has a responsibility to ensure that \ndriver's licenses and ID cards issued in the United States are \naffordable, practical, and secure--both from would-be terrorists and \nidentity thieves.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues--Senators Sununu, Leahy, \nTester, Collins and others--to address the real problems with REAL ID.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to talk as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 314\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the managers for their hard work. \nThey sincerely want to strengthen homeland security and want to keep \nthis bill focused on that goal and not allow it to be tangled up in \npartisan issues. That is my goal, too. That is why I am offering this \namendment today.\n  The provision in this bill, found on page 215, that reverses a \ncritical homeland security policy and introduces collective bargaining \nfor airport screeners who work at the Transportation Security \nAdministration, or what we call the TSA, has nothing to do with \nimproving our homeland security. It was certainly not recommended by \nthe 9/11 Commission. My amendment would strike this provision so TSA \ncan continue to protect us from another terrorist attack.\n  It may be helpful to review the history of this debate so my \ncolleagues understand how we got here. Just 5 years ago, Congress voted \nin favor of a flexible personnel management system at TSA in \nrecognition that special flexibility is necessary to protect American \npassengers from terrorists. This system allows security screeners to \njoin a union, but it doesn't tie the hands of TSA when it comes to \nmanaging its workforce and protecting the American people.\n  Collective bargaining, however, would allow labor unions to stand \nbetween TSA and its employees in ways that would make the agency less \nflexible and less nimble and create an operational and security \ndisaster. Mr. President, collective bargaining has been a topic of \ndiscussion since TSA's inception. It is important that my colleagues \nknow that it has been evaluated and rejected in every instance as \nsomething that would be harmful to our safety.\n  First, in 2001, collective bargaining was not included in the \nAviation and Transportation Security Act when TSA was first created.\n  Second, in 2003, collective bargaining was rejected by the TSA \nAdministrator for security reasons.\n  Third, in 2004, collective bargaining was not recommended by the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  I need to repeat that because it is important. This whole bill is \ndesigned to fulfill the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and \nthey did not mention anything about collective bargaining.\n  Finally, the decision against collective bargaining at TSA has been \nupheld by multiple Federal and labor relations courts between 2002 and \n2006.\n  Now I will outline six of the negative security consequences of this \ndramatic change in policy. First, TSA currently uses a security \nstrategy as recommended by the 9/11 Commission that is based on \nflexible, random, and unpredictable methods. This approach keeps would-\nbe attackers off guard.\n  Under collective bargaining, TSA will have to negotiate a \npredetermined framework within which the agency will be required to \noperate. This policy was not recommended in the 9/11 Commission Report, \nand it goes directly against the Commission's recommendations. This \nwill weaken our security.\n  Second, TSA currently establishes security protocols on a national \nand international basis without having to bargain in advance over the \nimpact of these protocols.\n  Under collective bargaining, TSA will be required to negotiate on \nevery security protocol with multiple unions on an airport-by-airport \nbasis. At its worst, this could stop many critical new security \nprotocols, but even at its best it will slow them down. This will \nweaken our security.\n  Third, TSA currently shifts resources in real time without having to \ninform any entity. Under collective bargaining, redeployment decisions \nwill be subject to binding arbitration review by a third party who has \nno Government or security experience but has authority to reverse TSA \nsecurity decisions.\n  As my colleagues know, arbitration can take months or even years to \nresolve. This will weaken our security.\n  Fourth, TSA currently moves, upgrades, replaces, and repositions \nequipment to stay in tune with operational requirements. Under \ncollective bargaining, equipment deployment will be subject to a 60- to \n180-day negotiation process. All information, including standard \noperating procedures and tactics, will also be subject to union \nnegotiation. This will weaken our security.\n  Fifth, TSA currently protects sensitive security information, such as \nthe security resources at a particular site, and releases this \ninformation only to those who need to know.\n  Under collective bargaining, TSA will be required to disclose \nsecurity information to third party negotiators and arbitrators, \nincreasing the risk of unauthorized information release. This will \nweaken our security.\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\n  Sixth, and finally, TSA currently deploys many innovative security \nprograms within weeks. Under collective bargaining, new positions and \npromotions will all be subject to months, or years, of impact in \nimplementation.\n  TSA provided just-in-time explosive training to more than 38,000 \nsecurity screeners in less than 3 weeks in November of 2005. Under \ncollective bargaining, training is subject to negotiation on the need, \ndesign, order of training delivered, and method of delivery. This \nprocess could add 60 to 180 days to security training programs and \nweaken our security.\n  I know my colleagues understand the need for TSA to be able to move \nquickly, so I want to make sure everyone knows how slow and how \ncumbersome collective bargaining will be. Let's please keep in mind as \nwe look at this situation the whole purpose of TSA is to protect our \ncountry. That is their first priority. We cannot allow the unionization \nand union requirements to preempt this first priority of TSA.\n  Today, TSA--and I know this is very difficult to read--can implement \nits changes in 1 day or less, and we will talk about some of those \nexamples. But under collective bargaining, it can take up to 568 days \nto work out the negotiations and possible litigation that could occur \nwhen they are trying to establish new protocols. This is not acceptable \nwhen it comes to protecting our country.\n  If we introduce collective bargaining at TSA as proposed in this \nbill, changes could take, as I said, up to 568 days. My colleagues can \nsee a collective bargaining process starts with up to 14 days of \nadvance notice, up to 14 days for the union to decide how they are \ngoing to negotiate, plus up to 180 days to negotiate, and followed by 7 \ndays to implement.\n  This whole process does not fit with national security interests. I \nhope my colleagues agree that this is too long and too cumbersome to \nsubject our Nation's security to.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues several real-world examples of how \nTSA has been able to rapidly respond to security threats. I will point \nthe attention of my colleagues to the United Kingdom bomb plot, of \nwhich we are all aware, last August in 2006. On August 10 of last year, \ninformation about one of the most spectacular terrorist plots since 9/\n11 was shared with TSA. TSA worked very quickly to develop a plan that \nwould, over the course of 12 hours, ban all liquids beyond the security \ncheckpoint and enact the quickest changes to the prohibited items list \nin history. It was simply the most drastic change airport security had \never undergone, and it happened in less than 6 hours from the time the \narrest of the alleged terrorists was revealed.\n  I understand one of my colleagues has offered an amendment that would \nundercut the whole idea of this bill and force TSA to prove it is an \nemergency or an imminent threat in order to take the action we did when \nthis plot was revealed.\n  What will TSA have to go through to prove there is an emergency? What \nkind of court case, what kind of litigation, what kind of hearings in \nCongress will they have to go through to prove it is an emergency? This \nattempt to gut this bill makes it worse than the underlying bill \nbecause it subjects our security to constant litigation and second-\nguessing.\n  The success of this operation--this United Kingdom bomb plot--was \nbased on a number of factors, including a nimble and professional \nworkforce who is highly trained and rewarded for their performance: an \nability to change procedures within hours, expertise in dealing with \nthe public to educate, inform, and help them handle the changes, and a \ncommitment to security in the face of emerging threats. This is a clear \nexample of why we should not tie TSA's hands and prevent it from \naccomplishing its security mission.\n  Another example of how TSA has been able to react quickly happened \nlast July, when Lebanon erupted into violence and fighting broke out, \nleaving thousands of Americans trapped in between the warring factions. \nThe Government of the United States safely evacuated these Americans \nand thousands of other refugees.\n  From July 22 to July 31, TSA officers helped to secure 58 chartered \nflights from Cypress to the United States and screened over 11,000 \npassengers. The overseas and domestic deployment was the first of its \nkind, and it demonstrated TSA's ability to use its flexible structure \nto appropriately respond to both domestic and overseas needs.\n  TSA delivered on its security mission and ensured the security of \narriving airplanes and passengers. The mission was designed, executed, \nand people were being screened overseas within 96 hours, which is \nremarkable for a Government agency that had never deployed overseas and \nhad not envisioned a need to do so.\n  It is important for us to remember at this point the amendment that \nhas been offered to change my amendment would likely have resulted by \nnow with TSA being in court, being challenged as to whether the \nsituation in Lebanon was an imminent threat to our country, which is \nthe language of the amendment that has been offered to change this \nbill.\n  We cannot water down our Nation's security by allowing TSA to have to \nfollow collective bargaining rules or, which has been proposed, prove \nit is an emergency or an imminent threat. This would create a heyday \nfor lawyers.\n  If these operations had been subject to arbitration and review \nrequired by collective bargaining, changes in deployments of personnel \nwould have required notification on TSA's management to the collective \nbargaining unit, followed by a response accepting the changes in \nemployment conditions or proposing modifications. This process would \nhave created time-consuming rounds of negotiation, even using an \nexpedited process.\n  TSA's response to the United Kingdom terrorist plot was developed in \n12 hours, and the screeners were deployed to Lebanon and Cypress within \n96 hours, response times that would have been significantly delayed by \ndays and weeks, if not made impossible, had the notification and \nnegotiation requirements in this bill been in effect. We cannot allow \nthat to happen to our Nation's security.\n  I would now like to outline three ways collective bargaining will \nnegatively affect workforce performance.\n  First, TSA currently uses a paid-for performance system that is based \non technical competence, readiness for duty, and operational \nperformance. Top security screeners receive a 5-percent base pay \nincrease on top of a 2.1-percent cost-of-living adjustment and a $3,000 \nbonus.\n  Under collective bargaining, this paid-for performance system will be \nreplaced with a pass-fail system based heavily on seniority that will \nnot adequately assess technical skills. The collective bargaining \nsystem will not reward screening performance or good customer service, \nand it will reduce standards. This will weaken workforce performance.\n  Second, TSA can also currently remove ineffective security screeners \nwithin 72 hours. Imagine that: The frontline security of our country \ncan identify someone who is not doing their job and remove them so our \ncountry and the airline passengers can be safe.\n  Under collective bargaining, however, arbitration proceedings will \nretain substandard employees for months, preventing the hiring of \nreplacement officers. This process could take 90 to 240 days and will \nreduce overall workforce performance. This will weaken workforce \nperformance.\n\n  Third, TSA currently uses multiple screening disciplines, adding \ninterlocking layers of security. Under collective bargaining, employees \nwill be able to refuse multidisciplinary jobs resulting in fewer \nresources to serve passenger checkpoints. This will weaken workforce \nperformance.\n  My colleagues should know exactly how this weakened workforce \nperformance affects air travelers in our country, and we can have a \ngood look at how that is going to affect us by looking at Canada. A \nrecent incident in Canada provides a great example.\n  Canada's air security system does not have the flexibility that TSA \nenjoys. Last Thanksgiving, as part of a labor dispute, passenger \nluggage was not properly screened and sometimes not screened at all as \nairport screeners engaged in a work-to-rule campaign, as they called \nit, creating long lines at the Toronto airport.\n  A government report found that to clear the lines, about 250,000 \npassengers were rushed through with minimal or\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\nno screening whatsoever. One Canadian security expert was quoted as \nsaying that if terrorists had known that in those 3 days their baggage \nwasn't going to be searched, that would have been bad. That is an \nunderstatement of the year. We cannot afford to have this kind of \nunion-sponsored disruption at our airports. The Canadian union's \nairport security was not allowed to strike either, but we can see what \nthey did in order to disrupt the proper screening of baggage there. \nThis would happen in our country as well.\n  I think it is also important that people know how collective \nbargaining will impact passenger service. I know that for most \nAmericans, security is the No. 1 goal when it comes to air travel, but \nthey also want security operations to be efficient and not needlessly \ndisrupt their schedules.\n  I know my colleagues would be pleased to know that TSA has managed \nthe growth of passenger travel and kept average peak wait times to less \nthan 12 minutes. Under collective bargaining, TSA will have to pull at \nleast 3,500 screeners, or 8 percent of the total workforce, off a line \nto fulfill the needs of the new labor-management infrastructure. This \nwould close at least 250 screening lanes, causing longer lines at \ncheckpoints.\n  Under these circumstances, average wait times would increase from 12 \nminutes at peak to more than 30 minutes. This is something that will be \nvery unpopular, especially given the fact that these longer wait lines \ncome with less security.\n  TSA is also currently capable of relocating security screeners to \nenable on-time aircraft departures. Under collective bargaining, \nnegotiating job stations and functions will result in poor staffing, \nleading to longer lines, late flight departures, and other adverse \nindustry impacts. Americans want to make their flights, and they will \nnot support needless delays that come at the expense of their security.\n  I think it is also important that my colleagues understand what I am \ntalking about and how it could play out in real terms.\n  During Hurricane Katrina, TSA deployed security officers from around \nthe country to New Orleans to screen evacuees during the aftermath of \nthe storm. This response allowed them to evacuate 22,000 men, women, \nand children through the airport safely and securely. Several weeks \nlater, TSA responded the same in response to Hurricane Rita in Houston. \nSecurity screeners left their home airports with little notice to fly \nto Houston to help those in need.\n  Another example of how TSA has been able to react quickly to weather-\nrelated events occurred this past December when a big snowstorm hit \nDenver. Because local TSA employees were unable to get to the airport, \nTSA responded quickly by deploying 55 officers from Las Vegas, Salt \nLake City, and Colorado Springs to Denver. The deployment allowed TSA \nto open every security lane around the clock at the airport until they \nwere back to normal operations.\n  Should we force TSA to prove this was an imminent danger or an \nemergency before they respond to the needs of the American people? That \nis what the second-degree amendment is intended to do. We cannot allow \nthat. That will weaken our security.\n  These operations have been subject to arbitration review required by \ncollective bargaining. Changes in deployment of personnel would have \nrequired notification by TSA management to the collective bargaining \nunit, followed by a response accepting the changes in employment \nconditions or proposing modifications. This process would have created \ntime-consuming rounds of negotiations, even using an expedited process. \nAmericans do not want needless bureaucracy in our airports, especially \nwhen it comes at the expense of our safety.\n  I also want my colleagues to understand the amount of money \ncollective bargaining is going to cost and how it will impact TSA's \noperation in air travel security.\n  The first year startup costs of creating a collective bargaining \ninfrastructure is conservatively estimated at $160 million, forcing TSA \nto relocate thousands of screeners currently working on aviation \nsecurity. Since there is no money allocated for this change, this \nmandate would force TSA to pull 3,500 transportation security officers, \nor 8 percent of the total workforce, off the checkpoints.\n  These officers equate to 250 of the 2,054 active screening lanes \nacross the Nation at any given time, closing 250 lanes. This impact is \nequivalent to closing all the checkpoint screening lanes in Chicago, \nLos Angeles, Boston, and New York. This impact is the equivalent of \nclosing all screening operations across the system 1 day every week. \nThis impact would result in failing to screen 300,000 passengers every \nday.\n  Some may say we should increase spending for TSA by $160 million. But \nif we have this money, why use it to pay for redtape? Let's use it for \nsecurity.\n  I also want to address some of the objections to TSA's flexible \nmanagement. First, those who want collective bargaining at TSA say they \nwant screeners to be treated as every other Federal employee. That \nwould be fine, except for the fact they are not like every other \nFederal employee. They have a mission to protect the American people, \nand collective bargaining will prevent them from accomplishing this \nmission.\n  Second, those who want collective bargaining at TSA say it will lead \nto lower attrition and, therefore, more safety. Collective bargaining \nmay lead to lower rates of attrition, but it will not lead to more \nsecurity.\n  I am sure there are security screeners who would like to be \nguaranteed lifetime employment, but that would prohibit TSA from \nkeeping America safe. TSA currently has the ability to reward screeners \nbased on their performance and to remove those screeners who are not \nperforming. That is what ensures safety, not a workforce that is \nrewarded for seniority and is not accountable.\n  We have also heard the supporters of collective bargaining at TSA say \nit is working at Customs and border control. First, I take issue with \nthe claim it is working with Customs or working at our borders. Our \nCustoms agency has experienced numerous delays and complications in \nsecuring our borders that have been caused by collective bargaining. I \nthink our Customs agency and border security should have the same \nflexibility TSA enjoys, and it is a debate we should have as we look at \nways to better secure our borders.\n  Let's make sure we understand what we are saying. Advocates of \ncollective bargaining for airport security are saying our border \nsecurity has worked well. It is hard to look at 10 to 12 million \nillegal aliens in our country and say our border security is working \nwell. It is not working well.\n  We are also hearing increasingly from all over the world that our \ncustoms process is among the worst in the world. Our tourism is down \nand our business visits are down because we are making it harder and \nharder for people from around the world to get into our country. Our \ncustoms system doesn't work and neither does our border security.\n  The supporters of collective bargaining at TSA also believe our \nscreeners are lacking important protections to address their \ngrievances. I hope my colleagues know TSA has given screeners the \nability to have their whistleblower complaints reviewed by the Office \nof the Independent Counsel, even though it is not required in law. \nCritics also claim screeners do not have the ability to appeal adverse \nactions against them, such as suspensions and terminations, through the \nMerit System Protection Board. This is true, but TSA has created its \nown disciplinary review board that provides workers with relief faster \nthan the Merit System Protection Board.\n  I want my colleagues to understand what all of this means for unions, \nbecause I am afraid that is what this policy is all about. Unionizing \nthe 48,000 workers at TSA will give labor unions a $17 million annual \nwindfall in dues from these new union workers. Let me share a quote. \nFor my colleagues who doubt this policy is being driven by unions, I \nwant them to hear what was said earlier this week by two leaders of the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, which is affiliated with \nthe AFL-CIO. They said:\n\n       We must gain 40,000 new members a year to break even today. \n     But because of the age of our members and pending \n     retirements, that number will grow to 50,000 in 2 years and \n     probably 60,000 a few years after that.\n\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\n\n  An additional comment:\n\n       This campaign is the perfect opportunity to convince TSA \n     employees to join our union and become activist volunteers in \n     our one great union.\n\n  The purpose of TSA is not to create activist volunteers for unions. \nIt is to protect our country. Again, I need to remind my colleagues the \ntop priority of Homeland Security and TSA is to protect Americans.\n  I conclude by saying this is a very serious issue, and I encourage \nall my colleagues to think about it carefully. We all want workers to \nhave better benefits, but that is not what this debate is about. TSA \noffers great benefits and important protections to its workforce. This \ndebate is about how to keep our country safe, and we cannot tie TSA up \nin knots of redtape.\n  I understand the unions want this new policy because it will add \nthousands of new dues-paying members to their rolls, but they are going \nto have to live without it in order to keep our country safe. This bill \nis about doing things that will prevent another 9/11 attack. Adding an \nearmark for labor unions that prevents TSA from doing its job is the \nlast thing we should do.\n\n  I realize the Senator from Connecticut feels strongly about this \nissue, and I know I probably haven't changed his mind. Unionizing the \nFederal workforce is something that is very important to him, and it is \nsomething he has worked on for many years, most notably when Congress \ncreated the new Department of Homeland Security in 2002. I also realize \nthe majority leader has impressed upon the Senators on the other side \nof the aisle to stick together in supporting this destructive policy. \nThis is very disappointing, because it shows the majority may be more \ninterested in having a political showdown than they are in \nstrengthening our security.\n  The President has issued a veto threat on this bill if it creates \ncollective bargaining at TSA, and there are enough Senators to sustain \nit. That leaves us with two options: We can remove this misguided \nposition and preserve the bill or we can let the bill die. I simply ask \nmy colleagues: Is this union earmark worth killing this bill for? I \ndon't think so.\n  I think it is important to also note the second-degree amendment that \nis being offered to change my amendment is not supported by Homeland \nSecurity. In fact, they believe it will make this bill worse than it is \nright now.\n  My colleagues, I ask everyone to set aside the partisan politics, set \naside special interests, and let us continue to improve TSA, our \nTransportation Security Agency. They have demonstrated that while there \nhave been a lot of problems with starting up a new agency, each year \nthey have gotten better. Each year their workforce has gotten better \ntrained. Each year we are moving passengers through with less and less \ninconvenience and better and better security. This is not the time to \nturn back. This is not the time to play politics and payback with our \nsecurity.\n  I encourage everyone to take a careful look at this amendment and I \nask my colleagues to support it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I have listened to the arguments of my \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle, and I believe the amendment I \nhave offered answers many of his concerns but also provides basic \nrights for our 40,000-some TSA officers across this country.\n  Let us first talk about what this amendment does that I have offered. \nIt does three things, three simple things. First, it gives them \nwhistleblower protection.\n  As somebody who has spent 8 years as an auditor, as someone who has \nspent a great deal of time figuring out where Government is doing its \njob well and not so well, I understand the importance of whistleblower \nprotection. The best information you get as an auditor comes from the \nemployees of the Government, and they all must be reassured, especially \nthose working on the front line of security, that they will be \nprotected if they tell things they see that need to be fixed. That is \nimportant.\n  Secondly, this bill gives them the right to appeal suspensions of 14 \ndays or more to an independent board, as other Federal workers.\n  It also gives them the right to collectively bargain, like the Border \nPatrol, like the Capitol Police, like FEMA employees, and like \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement.\n  What does this amendment not do? It is important to understand the \nlimitations in this amendment. First, it makes sure they do not have \nthe right to strike.\n  Secondly, it prohibits them from bargaining for higher pay. They \ncannot bargain for higher pay. This is important, because my colleagues \nspent a great deal of time talking about safety. It explicitly states \nthat no classified or sensitive intelligence can be divulged or \nreleased during any grievance process.\n  It goes further than the original legislation and the original \namendment by saying the TSA Administrator or the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity can take whatever actions necessary to carry out an agency \nmission during emergencies and whenever needed to address newly \nimminent threats. No questions asked. These employees have to follow \norders. In any emergency, the director has the complete and immediate \ncontrol over these workers. Let me emphasize that again. In any \nemergency the director, the administrator have complete control over \nanything these workers should do.\n  By the way, as an aside, having talked with and been around these \nscreening officers many times as I move through the airports, I think \nit is a little insulting to them to act as if they would not respond \nwhen directed to an emergency. Americans across the board want to do \nwhat is right in times of crisis for our country. To indicate these \nAmericans would not do what was asked of them in time of an emergency, \nand that they would try to rely on some kind of right under the law to \nnot do what is necessary in an emergency, frankly, I think, is unfair \nto them.\n  What does collective bargaining get these workers? It provides a \nstructure for quick and fair resolution of grievances and workplace \ndisputes. It provides a forum to discuss health and safety issues, \nwhich will reduce the number of on-the-job injuries suffered by TSOs. \nIt reduces the high TSO turnover rate.\n  Let's talk about that turnover rate. Talk about saving money. Think \nof the money we are investing in these officers that is wasted right \nnow. We have a 23-percent annual turnover among these screening \nofficers. Among the part-time officers, it is 50 percent. As somebody \nwho has worried about the bottom line in a private business, that kind \nof turnover is completely unacceptable in terms of the costs.\n  Let's look at the safety issue. The experience we are losing by that \nkind of turnover--and I am not talking about people being dismissed for \nbad conduct or getting rid of bad screeners; I am talking about people \nwho are leaving. That turnover rate, if you don't consider anything \nelse, should tell my colleagues something is wrong. I believe what is \nwrong is they do not have the basic rights and protections other \nFederal workers have.\n  It increases public safety by allowing the TSOs to go through their \nunion to expose threats to aviation security without fear of \nretaliation. It addresses procedures for emergency and security \nsituations so workers are fully aware of their duties in the event of \nan emergency.\n  This is a good amendment for everyone. It puts these workers on equal \nfooting with other Federal workers. It does not give them the right to \nstrike. It does not give them the right to refuse to be deployed in \ncase of an emergency. It does not allow them to negotiate for higher \npay.\n  I was not a Senator at the time, but I understand that the Department \nof Homeland Security needed the flexibility to get up and running when \nthe agency was first created years ago--5 years ago; more than 5 years \nago.\n  But they are no longer processing 5,000 more screener applications \nper month in order to transition from a private force to a Federal \nforce. We are no longer scrambling to create a Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We are now in a position to professionalize. We are now in a \nposition to professionalize airport officers and give them basic worker \nprotections and, as a result, we will have a seasoned staff and much \nbetter security.\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\n  My colleague mentioned the threatened veto. That is kind of hard to \nfigure out. It is hard to imagine that the President would use a veto \nto veto legislation that is all about making our country safer, all of \nthe provisions that this bill will contain, that will go directly to \nthe heart of the matter of the safety of our Nation, that will do what \nthe 9/11 Commission wanted. It is hard to imagine, because the \nPresident does not like unions, that he would threaten to veto this \nbill just because we want to give the same basic worker protections to \nthe screeners at airports that the Border Patrol, the Capitol Police, \nand immigration officials currently have.\n  I cannot imagine that the President would veto under those \ncircumstances. I can't imagine that the American public would think \nthat is a good use of a veto pen. I can't imagine that some of our \ncolleagues who think that unions are the enemy would use the collective \nbargaining rights--that are so limited in scope in this amendment--as \nan excuse to stop this concerted effort that we are all making to do \nwhat we must do to improve homeland security.\n  If we continue to treat our TSA officers different from their \ncolleagues in the Border Patrol and their colleagues in homeland \nsecurity, we will never have the seasoned and professional and \nexperienced staff in place as part of our important effort to protect \nthe Nation's transportation system and the people who live and work and \ncare about the United States of America.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Sure.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I want to make sure I understand the provisions in the \nSenator's amendment. I know one of them is TSA, in order to act quickly \nand make changes rapidly, would need to establish that there is an \nemergency.\n  My question is, Would the ongoing global war on terror be considered \nan emergency?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I do not believe declaring that we have a problem \nwith terrorism worldwide, that is a status quo day in and day out, \nwould be considered a day-to-day emergency. The examples you used, \nhowever, of Hurricane Katrina or the necessity to respond in Lebanon--I \nthink those issues certainly would be issues that the professionals at \nTSA, the officers, would want to respond to quickly.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I know another criterion is that if they could establish \nthat we have a newly imminent threat they could act quickly to respond \nand not go through the collective bargaining process. Would al-Qaida be \nconsidered a newly imminent threat?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I understand the point my colleague is trying to \nmake. I would say there are a whole lot of things that some are trying \nto put under the rubric of a continuing threat against America. There \nhave been proposals to take away some basic constitutional rights. \nThere have been proposals to change the way we view some of the rights \nand privileges that Americans have.\n  I think to say that these workers don't get the same benefits as the \nBorder Patrol or Customs agents just because they are screening in \nairports, under this rubric that we have to be concerned about \nworldwide terror, is specious reasoning.\n  Mr. DeMINT. If I could make one last appeal? This document is the \ncollective bargaining procedures the border agents have for just one \nunit. This bill opens the possibility of literally hundreds of unions \nin every airport. I appeal to my colleagues. If every airport has to \ndeal with separate collective bargaining arrangements and has to \nestablish an emergency or imminent threat on every occasion, and we can \nsecond-guess them in Congress--and lawyers will--I think we need to \nwork together to make sure we come to the best conclusion. I know the \namendment of the Senator is well intended. Hopefully we can discuss it \nmore on the floor tomorrow or next week.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the amendment \noffered by my colleague, Senator DeMint, and in support of employee \nprotections for Transportation Security Officers TSOs at the \nTransportation Security Administration\n  It is only fair to give TSOs the same rights and protections as other \nemployees at the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The provision in S. 4 would allow the President to put TSOs in the \nsame personnel system that President Bush argued was needed for \nhomeland security employees in 2002 in order to put the right people in \nthe right jobs at the right pay--to hold employees accountable--and to \nreorganize and quickly shift resources to meet new terrorist threats.\n  Although DHS was authorized to waive certain provisions of title 5 \nrelated to pay, labor relations, and employee appeals in order to \nprotect the U.S. from terrorists attacks, other employee rights and \nprotections remained--veterans preference, collective bargaining, and \nfull whistleblower rights with appeal to the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard, MSPB.\n  It is wrong to deny these basic rights and protections to TSOs--who \nwork for DHS.\n  Because TSOs lack employee protections, they have one of the largest \nattrition rates, one of the highest workers compensation claims, and \none of the lowest levels of morale among Federal employees.\n  I recognize the efforts by TSA to address these issues, but I firmly \nbelieve that the gains made by those efforts are only temporary if \nemployees continually feel threatened by retaliatory action or that \nthey cannot bring their concerns to management.\n  National security is jeopardized if agencies charged with protecting \nour Nation continually lose trained and talented employees due to \nworkplace injuries and a lack of employee protections--including \nprotection against retaliation for blowing the whistle on security \nbreaches.\n  Moreover, the whole point of creating DHS was to consolidate 22 \nagencies into one entity in order to prevent and respond to terrorist \nattacks. By denying TSOs the same rights provided to other DHS \nemployees, we are reinforcing the very stovepipes we sought to tear \ndown with the Homeland Security Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this is a very difficult issue that is \nnow before the Senate. The Aviation Transportation Security Act \nprovided TSA with flexibility with respect to the critical national \nsecurity mission of TSA security officers. These management authorities \nallow TSA to shift resources and implement new procedures daily, in \nsome cases hourly, to respond to critical intelligence and to meet an \never-changing airline schedule. This was made very clear to us in a \nclassified briefing that I attended yesterday. Sometimes these \nsituations can be classified as emergencies. Other times the day-to-day \nsituations, such as a flight gets canceled, still require extensive \nmodifications that may not constitute emergencies.\n  I think, however, that there is a middle ground in this debate. I \nthink we can find a solution, and I am working with Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to try to see if there is a middle ground. It seems \nto me that TSA does need some flexibility to allow it to adjust the \nworkforce in order to provide additional security. That happened in \nresponse to the United Kingdom air bombing plot last summer. In that \ncase, TSA changed the nature of employees' work and even the location \nof their work to respond to that emergency.\n  But I see no reason TSA employees cannot have the protections of the \nWhistleblower Protection Act, for example. There is no reason they \nshould not have the same protections as other Federal employees and be \nbrought under that law.\n  Similarly, I think there should be some way for TSA employees to have \nthe right to appeal adverse actions, such as a removal, a suspension \naction, a reduction in grade level or pay that has been taken away from \nthem. I am still exploring this issue, but it seems to me that they \nshould have the right to appeal adverse employment actions to the Merit \nSystem Protection Board.\n  I know there is another one of my colleagues waiting to speak, so I \nam not going to go into great detail tonight. But let me say that I do \nnot think this is an all-or-nothing situation as, unfortunately, much \nof the debate suggested tonight. I do not think\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\nthat we have to deny TSA employees whistleblower protections and the \nright to appeal adverse employment actions in the name of security. I \nthink we can still achieve our vital security goals while affording TSA \nemployees employment rights when an adverse action is taken, appellate \nrights. I also believe there is absolutely no reason they can't be \nbrought under the Whistleblower Protection Act.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a close look at this issue. I think it is \nunfortunate that the debate has been so polarized on this issue and \nthat it is being portrayed as whether you appreciate the work done by \nthe TSO's or whether you don't appreciate it or whether you are pro-\nunion or anti-union. That does not do justice to the debate before us. \nI believe we can come up with a middle ground that gives TSA the \nflexibility it truly needs to be able to change working conditions, \nworking hours, unexpectedly to respond to critical intelligence and new \nthreats, or canceled flights for that matter, without depriving TSA \nemployees of other rights that Federal employees enjoy and that they \nshould enjoy, too.\n  Part of the problem is--and then I am going to yield to my colleague \nwho I see is waiting--we have not had the kind of thorough review of \nthis issue that is needed. I hope Senator Akaka and Senator Voinovich, \nwho are the leaders on civil service issues on the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee, might hold hearings to take a close \nlook at this and to bring in the experts and hear from the employees, \nhear from the employees' representatives, the unions, TSA; to have the \nkind of information that Kip Holly, the head of TSA, has provided us in \nthe past few days.\n  I think that while it is premature to do what the committee did on \nthe spur of the moment, I also am not enamored of the idea of just \nstriking all of that.\n  I think there is a middle ground and with goodwill and a sincere \neffort we can find it. I hope we would avoid what I saw tonight--where \nthe tree was filled up instantly to block alternatives, to block an \nattempt, a good-faith attempt to find that middle ground.\n  I am going to keep working on that along with interested colleagues, \nand I hope that, in fact, maybe we can find a compromise that achieves \nour goals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 313 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maine.\n  I have an amendment at the desk on behalf of myself and Senator \nConrad. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I call up my amendment and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Conrad, proposes an amendment numbered 313 to amendment \n     No. 275.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require a report to Congress on the hunt for Osama Bin \n       Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and the leadership of al Qaeda)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REPORT ON THE HUNT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN, AYMAN AL-\n                   ZAWAHIRI, AND THE LEADERSHIP OF AL QAEDA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, the \n     Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of \n     Defense jointly shall submit to Congress a report describing \n     the status of their efforts to capture Osama Bin Laden, Ayman \n     al-Zawahiri, and the leadership of al Qaeda.\n       (b) Contents.--Each report required by subsection (a) shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) A statement whether or not the January 11, 2007, \n     assessment provided by Director of National Intelligence John \n     Negroponte to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     Senate that the top leadership of al Qaeda has a ``secure \n     hideout in Pakistan'' was applicable during the reporting \n     period and, if not, a description of the current whereabouts \n     of that leadership.\n       (2) A statement identifying each country where Osama bin \n     Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and the leadership of al Qaeda are \n     or may be hiding, including an assessment whether or not the \n     government of each country so identified has fully cooperated \n     in the efforts to capture them, and, if not, a description of \n     the actions, if any, being taken or to be taken to obtain the \n     full cooperation of each country so identified in the efforts \n     to capture them.\n       (3) A description of the additional resources required to \n     promptly capture Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and the \n     leadership of al Qaeda.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment which is similar to \none Senator Conrad and I have offered previously. It deals with the \nissue of al-Qaeda and its leadership. It has been now 5\\1/2\\ years \nsince that fateful morning with the bright sunshine and the blue sky \nhere in Washington, DC, when I was looking out the window of the \nleadership meeting which I was attending that Tuesday. We could see the \nsmoke rising from the Pentagon because of the attacks. We watched on \ntelevision the collapse of the World Trade towers, attacked by \ncommercial airplanes being used as guided missiles full of fuel. None \nof us will ever forget that morning. More than 3,000 innocent Americans \nwere murdered. Shortly after that period, we heard people boast about \norchestrating the murder of those innocent Americans. Osama bin Laden, \nMr. al-Zawahiri, his chief lieutenant, and al-Qaeda have boasted about \norchestrating the attacks against our country that murdered innocent \nAmericans.\n  The legislation before the Senate deals with the 9/11 Commission \nReport. That Commission did an extraordinary job. I appreciate Senator \nReid bringing this to the floor and the work that has been done by the \ncommittees. These are recommendations which are long overdue. They \nshould have been dealt with previously by the Congress, but they have \nnot been.\n  Now we have legislation on the Senate floor, recommendations on how \nto provide for this country's protection, how to provide security, how \nto prevent another attack by al-Qaeda or other terrorist organizations. \nIt is very important legislation. We do need to protect our country \nfrom attacks. But there is something else that is long overdue; that \nis, we have taken our eye off the greatest threat. That is not me \nsaying so. Let me tell my colleagues what the greatest threat to our \ncountry is. This is testimony on January 11, a month and a half or so \nago, before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence by Mr. \nNegroponte, who was a top intelligence chief.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       Al Qaeda continues to plot attacks against our homeland and \n     other targets with the objective of inflicting mass \n     casualties. And they continue to maintain active connections \n     and relationships that radiate outward from their leaders' \n     secure hideout in Pakistan to affiliates throughout the \n     Middle East, northern Africa and Europe.\n\n  Mr. Negroponte continued by saying:\n\n       Al Qaeda is the terrorist organizations that poses the \n     greatest threat to US interests, including to the Homeland.\n\n  That is from the top intelligence expert in our Government. He says \nthe terrorist organization that poses the greatest threat to U.S. \ninterests is al-Qaeda; the greatest threat to our homeland is from al-\nQaeda. He says they are in a secure hideout in Pakistan.\n  Tuesday of this week, the new Director of Intelligence, Mike \nMcConnell, said almost exactly the same thing.\n  We also read in the New York Times a week or so ago the following:\n\n       Senior leaders of Al Qaeda operating from Pakistan over the \n     past year have set up a band of training camps in the tribal \n     regions near the Afghan border, according to American \n     intelligence and counterterrorism officials.\n       American officials said there was mounting evidence that \n     Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, have been \n     steadily building an operations hub in the mountainous \n     Pakistani tribal area of North Waziristan.\n\n  Now, let me go back to 4 days after \n9/11. President Bush said the following in an address to a joint \nsession of Congress. I was sitting near the front row. The President \nsaid:\n\n       We will not only deal with those who dare attack America. \n     We will deal with those who harbor them and feed them and \n     house them.\n\n  In his State of the Union Address several months later, he said:\n\n       As part of our offensive against terror, we are also \n     confronting the regimes that harbor and support terrorists.\n\n  So the head of our intelligence services, the Directors of \nIntelligence, know that the leadership of al-Qaeda,\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\nincluding Osama bin Laden--or ``Osama bin Forgotten,'' as some have \nsuggested in recent years--are in a secure hideaway in Pakistan. At the \nsame time, we have 21,000 troops sent on a surge elsewhere. And so I \nask: Why are we not making a greater effort to capture the leadership \nof the biggest terrorist threat to this country, as described by the \nDirectors of Intelligence, past and current? Are they being harbored?\n  We read that there has been an agreement of sorts between the \nGovernment of Pakistan and al-Qaeda and those who harbor al-Qaeda in \nPakistan. We know there are training organizations now. We see the \nexamples of them in the film and video on our television sets, more \nsophisticated attacks, additional techniques about terrorist attacks.\n  So we offer an amendment that is very simple. It is an amendment that \nsays: We want every 6 months from this administration a classified \nreport to the Congress that tells us several things: First, where is \nthe al-Qaeda leadership? If they know they are in Pakistan, reaffirm \nthat. If they are not in Pakistan, tell us where they are, each \ncountry, and whether those countries are harboring these terrorists.\n  Second, we deserve to know whether these countries in which these \nterrorists reside are helping us. Are they helping us bring to justice \nand capture the leadership of the greatest terrorist threat to our \ncountry? We deserve to know that.\n  And third, if Osama bin Laden and the other top leaders are still at \nlarge, we need a report describing what resources are needed to hunt \nthem down and finally capture them.\n\n  I don't understand at all why year after year passes and those who \ndirected the attacks against this country that killed thousands of \ninnocent Americans are not brought to justice.\n  It is perfectly appropriate--in fact, it is essential--that we bring \nto the floor of the Senate a 9/11 Commission bill that helps protect \nthis country. I commend the managers of the bill for it. I want to be \nout here helping pass this legislation. But that is one part of \nproviding security.\n  Another part of providing security is to apprehend those who \nperpetrated the most aggressive attacks ever launched against this \ncountry. Apparently, based on the testimony of the heads of \nintelligence on two occasions in the last month, we know where they \nare. Yet they remain at large.\n  I asked a question the other day of the Secretary of Defense, the \nSecretary of State, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when \nthey testified. I asked the question: If we know where the leadership \nof al-Qaeda is and if this is the greatest threat to our country's \nsecurity and our homeland, then why on Earth, if we have soldiers to \nsurge, are we not trying to apprehend and bring to justice the \nleadership of al-Qaeda to destroy the leadership? I was told: Well, we \ncan't just invade some other country to go find them.\n  I thought we were getting cooperation from this other country. If \nthey are in Pakistan, are the Pakistanis cooperating with us? If not, \nare they harboring al-Qaeda? If they are not harboring them, then how \nabout allowing us to work with them to bring to justice the leadership \nof the organization that poses the most significant terrorist threat to \nthis country? When will that happen?\n  There are some who have said Osama bin Laden and the leadership of \nal-Qaeda do not matter. They are dead wrong. I think the intelligence \ncommunity knows that. The question is, When will this country, with its \ncapability, decide to eliminate the greatest terrorist threat to \nAmerica?\n  Let me again quote what Mr. Negroponte said on January 11 of this \nyear:\n\n       Al Qaeda is the terrorist organization that poses the \n     greatest threat to U.S. interests, including to the Homeland.\n\n  How long will it be before this Congress can expect the same \naggressive activity against the leadership of al-Qaeda as President \nBush decided to take against Saddam Hussein? Saddam Hussein has been \nexecuted. He is gone. We understand this was a brutal dictator. We have \nunearthed mass graves with apparently somewhere near 400,000 skeletons \nof human beings murdered by that dictator. But he is executed; he is \ngone. Iraq has its own Constitution. They have their own Government. \nThe question is, Do they have the will to provide for their security? \nThat is another issue, and an important one.\n  We have American soldiers in harm's way in the middle of sectarian \nviolence, in the middle of what clearly is now a civil war in Iraq. But \nwhen we talk about committing America's soldiers for this country's \nsecurity, when will this President and this Congress decide to confront \nthe greatest terrorist threat to our country and to our homeland--the \nleadership of al-Qaeda in a secure hideaway in Pakistan? Four days \nafter 9/11, our President said that those who harbor terrorists are \njust like the terrorists. So let's decide to ask those in whose \ncountries terrorists now reside to work with us to bring them to \njustice, to capture them, and to eliminate the leadership of the \ngreatest terrorist threat to this country.\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad, and I have offered an amendment. We \nwill hope it will be given a vote next week. It ought not be a \ncontroversial amendment for anybody in this Chamber. It is a deep \nreservoir of common sense, for a change, for us to do what we ought to \ndo, and protect this country.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Improving \nAmerica's Security Act.\n  The 9/11 Commission released its report in July 2004. But more than 2 \nyears have now passed, and many of its recommendations still haven't \nbeen implemented. The Nation remains seriously unprepared for another \nterrorist strike.\n  I commend Senator Reid for making these recommendations a top \npriority. Democrats are committed to implementing the Commission's \nrecommendations and we intend to honor that commitment.\n  The Commission urged Congress to prevent further attacks by stopping \nterrorists before they reach our shores. This bill includes practical \nsteps using technology and diplomacy to keep terrorists out of the \ncountry. It provides greater security for the visa waiver program, by \nauthorizing the Department of Homeland Security to establish a \nsimplified online electronic visa application to visitors before they \nenter the United States. It also improves the reporting of lost and \nstolen passports and the exchange of information about prospective \nvisitors who may be a security threat. The visa waiver program is \nworthwhile, but we need to make it as secure as possible.\n  I commend the committee for including in the bill an amendment \ngranting collective bargaining and appeal rights to Transportation \nSecurity Administration officers. These men and women are on the \nfrontlines of our effort to keep America safe. But for years, they have \nbeen treated as second-class citizens, lacking basic workplace rights. \nThe agency has higher injury and attrition rates than any other Federal \nagency. It is vital to our national security to minimize turnover in \nthis important profession and give these workers a voice on the job to \nspeak out on safety issues without fear of reprisal or retaliation. \nGranting them these fundamental rights will stabilize this essential \nworkforce, increase its morale, and improve our national security.\n  In addition, the bill establishes a dedicated funding stream to \npromote communications interoperability. This was one of the hard \nlessons we learned on 9/11 and also during Katrina. The lack of funding \nfor interoperable communications is one of the highest concerns I hear \nfrom first responders in Massachusetts. They shouldn't have to rely on \nuncertain funding from the overburdened and underfunded FIRE grants \nprogram to achieve such communications. The committee correctly \nrecognized that this is a national goal and it has proposed a $3.3 \nbillion grant program over 5 years to achieve it.\n  This bill makes real progress in another key area that the Commission \nidentified for improvement: intelligence sharing at all levels of \nGovernment, in order to disrupt terrorist networks before their plan is \ncarried out. Information sharing is vital so that analysts have all \navailable information to ``connect the dots'' before an attack is \nlaunched. The bill orders a homeland security advisory system to alert \nState and local governments about threats, and authorizes a training \nprogram for State and local law enforcement in\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\nhandling intelligence. It also establishes homeland security fusion \ncenters to bring Federal, State and local antiterrorism efforts under \nthe same roof and promote further information sharing.\n  The bill makes progress in other areas identified by the 9/11 \nCommission as needing improvement. It provides support to State and \nlocal governments to establish incident command stations to coordinate \nresponse efforts during a terrorist attack or other disasters. It calls \nfor a national strategy for transportation security to provide transit \nsystem operators with guidance to protect passengers and \ninfrastructure. It calls on the Department of Homeland Security to make \nannual risk assessments of critical infrastructure, and to make \nrecommendations for hardening those targets and putting other \ncountermeasures in place.\n  The bill also strengthens the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board in \nsignificant ways. It requires Senate confirmation of all of its members \nand ensures that no more than three members will be of the same party. \nImportantly, it requires that the Board expand its public activities, \nwhich will allow for greater accountability. It also gives the Board \nauthority to request that the Attorney General issue a subpoena and \nrequires that the Attorney General notify Congress if he does not do \nso. Finally, it includes a $30 million authorization over the next 4 \nyears to ensure that it has the resources to carry out its important \nresponsibilities.\n  In some areas, the bill could be improved. The 9/11 Commission \nrecommended that homeland security funds be allocated strictly on the \nbasis of risk. While all States may bear some degree of risk, our \nexperience on 9/11 suggests that terrorists are most likely to target \nareas that will produce the greatest loss of life or property or \nnational symbols. The bill improves on current law in allocating \nresources under the largest of the homeland security grant programs---\nthe State homeland security grants. Currently, each State is guaranteed \nat least three-quarters of 1 percent of the total appropriated for the \nprogram. That may seem like a relatively modest amount, but when you \nmultiply it 50 times, it represents nearly 40 percent of the total \nappropriation. The bill lowers the minimum guarantee to 0.45 percent, \nallowing more of the overall sum to be allocated based purely on actual \nrisk. The House bill lowers that amount even further to one-quarter of \n1 percent. The issue is how best to allocate these limited resources, \nand I believe the House funding formula more faithfully reflects the 9/\n11 Commission's recommendation and is the wisest use of limited \nresources.\n  On the bill's proposal for a National Bioterrorism Integration \nCenter, I agree that the Nation must be able to rapidly identify and \nlocalize biological threats, but I am concerned that this new system \nwill duplicate existing disease monitoring systems. I appreciate the \nchairman's willingness to work out ways to minimize duplication and \nallow a flow of information between the new system proposed in the bill \nand existing disease monitoring systems.\n  One issue not addressed in this legislation is the health needs of \nfirst responders, volunteers, and residents of New York City harmed by \nthe 9/11 terrorist attacks. On that day, valiant police officers, \nfirefighters and health care workers rushed to the site, and many lost \ntheir lives. Many others today are sick, and growing sicker, because of \ntheir heroism. Tens of thousands of others who worked to clean up and \nrebuild downtown Manhattan were also exposed to a toxic mix of dust and \nchemicals whose effects are just beginning to be understood. This is an \nissue we will be taking up in the coming weeks in the HELP Committee, \nwith the leadership of Senator Clinton, and I hope we can work together \nto enact legislation to help these brave men and women and their \nfamilies as soon as possible.\n  Again, I commend the committee for proposing this needed bipartisan \nbill.\n  We also owe an immense debt to the members of the 9/11 Commission, \nespecially Chairman Tom Kean and Vice Chairman Lee Hamilton, for never \nrelenting in their mission to see that their recommendations are \nimplemented to protect the Nation from future terrorist attacks. I have \nno doubt that their persistence is in no small part the reason this \nbill is being acted on today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order Of Business\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I \nknow the distinguished assistant leader is going to be making comments \nshortly about the schedule tomorrow, but it appears there may be two \nrollcall votes. It is still being negotiated as to exactly what they \nare going to be on. It looks as if they may be on amendments offered by \nSenators Salazar and Sununu.\n  I want, for the record, to state those amendments are acceptable on \nthis side of the aisle. I was prepared to accept them without the need \nfor a rollcall vote, but at this point it is my understanding that \nrollcalls are likely for tomorrow. I am sure we will hear shortly from \nthe leaders on that.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for allowing me to precede him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will speak to the schedule and \nadjournment in just a moment, but before that I ask unanimous consent \nto be recognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come again to the floor this evening to \nspeak about Darfur in Sudan. Most Americans are now familiar with what \nis going on in this remote part of our world.\n  Hundreds of thousands of people have died. Two million have been \nforced to flee their homes and still cannot return. Humanitarian \nworkers have been raped, beaten, arrested, and killed.\n  This is genocide. That is a word we should use with the utmost \ncaution. If we misuse the term, we diminish it; we dilute its power. \nBut if we fail to use the word or if we use it and fail to act, then \nthat is even worse.\n  The entire world has allowed Darfur to happen. Now it is up to every \none of us to stop it. Those of us who have the privilege of being \nelected to office have a higher responsibility than most. We sought out \nthese positions, and we must assume the duties that come with them.\n  There are few duties more fundamental than the obligation to save \ninnocent men, women, and children from slaughter.\n  This week, Luis Moren-Ocampo, the International Criminal Court's \nprosecutor, presented evidence on the mass murder in Darfur to the \njudges of the International Criminal Court. This evidence focuses on \ntwo individuals as helping to lead and coordinate this campaign of \nviolence.\n  The first individual named by Mr. Ocampo is Ahmad Muhammad Harun, \nformer state minister of the interior, and now a state minister for \nhumanitarian affairs for the Government of Sudan. State minister for \nhumanitarian affairs--it is hard to even speak those words.\n  From 2003 to 2005, Harun was responsible for the ``Darfur security \ndesk'' in the Sudanese Government. His most important task was the \nrecruitment of janjaweed militias. He recruited them, as Prosecutor \nOcampo points out, with the full knowledge that the janjaweed militia \nmembers he was recruiting ``would commit crimes against humanity and \nwar crimes against the civilian population of Darfur.''\n  That was, in fact, the point of his recruitment effort.\n  The second individual named in the prosecutor's presentation of \nevidence to the court is Ali Abd-al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb.\n  Ali Kushayb is a janjaweed commander who personally led attacks on \nvillagers, just as the Sudanese Government intended.\n  This was part of a coordinated strategy of the Sudanese Government to \nachieve victory over rebels not by confronting the rebels but by \nattacking\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\nthe civilian populations around them, by destroying entire villages and \ndriving out or killing every inhabitant.\n  Let me read a short section of Mr. Ocampo's document to illustrate \nthe crimes these two men helped coordinate and lead. It is graphic and \nhorrifying. This is what they wrote:\n\n       During the attack on [the village of] Bindisi on or about \n     15 August 2003, Ali Kushayb was present wearing military \n     uniform and he was issuing orders to the Militia/Janjaweed. \n     Ground forces were shooting at civilians and burning huts. \n     The attacking forces pillaged and burned dwellings, \n     properties and shops. The attack on Bindisi lasted for \n     approximately five days and resulted in the destruction of \n     most of the town and the death of more than 100 civilians, \n     including 30 children.\n       In Arawala, in December 2003, Ali Kushayb personally \n     inspected a group of naked women before they were raped by \n     men under his command. A witness said she and the other women \n     were tied to trees with their legs apart and continually \n     raped.\n       In or around March 2004, Ali Kushayb personally \n     participated in the execution of at least 32 men from Mukjar. \n     The evidence shows Ali Kushayb standing near the entrance of \n     the prison and hitting these men as they filed past and into \n     Land Cruisers. The vehicles left with Ali Kushayb in one of \n     them. About fifteen minutes later, gunshots were heard and \n     the next day 32 dead bodies were found in the bushes.\n       The Application [which is the term for Ocampo's \n     presentation of evidence] alleges that Ahmad Harun and Ali \n     Kushayb bear criminal responsibility in relation to 51 counts \n     of war crimes and crimes against humanity including: rape; \n     murder; persecution; torture; forcible transfer; destruction \n     of property; pillaging; inhumane acts; outrage upon personal \n     dignity; attacks against the civilian population; and \n     unlawful imprisonment or severe deprivation of liberty.\n\n  Many can ask, why, when hundreds of thousands of people have died and \nmillions have suffered, why just single out these two men? What does \nthis presentation of evidence to a court sitting in the Hague in Europe \naccomplish? Why single them out? Because that is where you start and \nbecause this submission by the prosecutor illustrates a direct chain of \ncommand from the janjaweed, who rode into the villages on horseback to \nrape, murder, and plunder, to the official government in Khartoum that \norchestrated these atrocities.\n  It is an act of accountability, when up to now there has been none. \nBut it is not enough.\n  The International Criminal Court has issued summonses for the two men \nnamed by Mr. Ocampo. If they do not appear, it must issue arrest \nwarrants. If the Sudanese Government does not turn them over, then the \nUnited Nations Security Council must act.\n  But this is about far more than two individuals. It is time for the \nUnited States of America to lead. Here in Congress, we have been told \nthat progress is being made. I do not see it at all. We have been told \nthat we cannot push harder at the United Nations because the Chinese \nmay veto any resolution we put forward.\n  I have a simple proposition. Let's put this matter before the U.N. \nSecurity Council. Let's let the American representative--our \nAmbassador--to the United Nations vote in accordance with our finding \nthat a genocide is taking place. Let's let every civilized nation in \nthe world know where we stand. And let's ask them on the record where \nthey stand.\n  If any country--China or any other--wants to step up and say we \nshould take no action to stop this genocide, so be it. Let the record \nof history show where they stand as this genocide unfolds.\n  Congress has passed many bills giving the administration additional \nsanctions they can presently use as tools by the United States to stop \nthis genocide.\n  On two different occasions, I have spoken directly and personally \nwith the President about Darfur. I feel very intensely about it. I have \nsaid on the floor before--and I think it bears repeating--as a student \nin this city at Georgetown University, I had a famous professor named \nJan Karski. He was in the Polish Underground during World War II and \ncame to the United States to try to alert them to the evidence that he \nhad accumulated about the Holocaust that was taking place. He was a man \nwho spoke broken English, but he was on a mission, looking for anyone \nwho would listen to him, praying that the United States, that he heard \nso much about, would step forward and do something to stop this \nHolocaust. He met with a few individuals. He did not get to the highest \nlevels of our Government and left in frustration, having accomplished \nvery little.\n  Some 25 or 30 years later, Dr. Karski was a professor at my \nuniversity. I remember when he told that story, I thought to myself: \nHow could this happen? How could 6 million people die and no one do \nanything about it? He tried. At least he tried. But what about everyone \nelse? I did not understand it. But now I do. I do because I have \nwatched what has happened in Darfur since the genocide was declared. \nThe honest answer is: Almost nothing. And the honest answer is: The \nUnited States of America has done almost nothing.\n  I have asked the President directly, I have spoken to Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice, and I have spoken to all who will listen, \nbegging them to do something, something to respond to this declared \ngenocide.\n  Special Envoy Andrew Natsios said that come January 1, the United \nStates would exercise sanctions if Sudan did not agree to a joint \nAfrican Union-United Nations peacekeeping mission.\n  Well, January 1 came and went and no mission was allowed. There is no \njoint peacekeeping mission in the Sudan today, and it is March 1.\n  I believe we should use every economic and diplomatic tool at our \ndisposal. We should implement additional sanctions immediately. But, \nmore importantly, we must convince other countries and the United \nNations to do the same. And it starts with us personally, divesting \nourselves of those businesses that are doing business in Sudan.\n  I made this speech and put out a press release a month or two ago, \nand some enterprising reporter went through the 5 or 10 mutual funds my \nwife and I owned and spotted one that had an investment in PetroChina. \nPetroChina is the Chinese oil company in the Sudan. He identified that \nmutual fund, and I sold it immediately. I was not embarrassed because \nyou cannot really keep up with a mutual fund and everything they own. \nBut I knew I had an obligation to do something once I was advised. It \nwasn't that difficult for my family. Certainly it didn't damage my \nportfolio, as modest as it may be. But I ask everyone, if you seriously \nbelieve that the genocide in Darfur must end, start by seeing what you \ncan do personally. Every American should ask if their investments are \ngoing to support the Government of Sudan. Every mutual fund director \nshould ask the same thing. I have written to every college and \nuniversity in my State asking them to divest of investments in Sudan \nuntil the genocide in Darfur ends. Unilateral sanctions by the United \nStates are important, but multilateral sanctions imposed by the United \nNations can make a difference. Genocide occurs because the world allows \nit to occur. It is time to prove that the 21st century will be \ndifferent.\n\n  Mr. President, just a few days ago--in fact, just yesterday--in the \nWashington Post, a woman who is well known to many, Angelina Jolie, \npublished an article about the situation in Darfur. It is entitled \n``Justice for Darfur.'' Ms. Jolie, who is well known to all of us, is a \ncomely actress whom I had a chance to meet a year or two ago when she \ncame to town in her capacity as goodwill ambassador for the United \nNations High Commission for Refugees. She has certainly proven her \nskill as an actor, and I think she has demonstrated that her caring for \npeople around the world is genuine. The article she wrote in the \nWashington Post is one that, at the end of my statement, I will ask to \nhave printed in the Record so that it is an official part of our Senate \nproceedings. She is in Bahai, Chad. She says in this article ``Justice \nfor Darfur'' the following:\n\n       Sticking to this side of the Sudanese border is supposed to \n     keep me safe.\n\n  Ms. Jolie writes:\n\n       By every measure--killings, rapes, the burning and looting \n     of villages--the violence in Darfur has increased since my \n     last visit in 2004. The death toll has passed 200,000; in 4 \n     years of fighting, Janjaweed militia members have driven 2.5 \n     million people from their homes, including the 26,000 \n     refugees crowded into Oure Cassoni.\n\n  She talks about accountability. In this article, she says:\n\n       Accountability is a powerful force. It has the potential to \n     change behavior--to check aggression by those who are used to \n     acting\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\n     with impunity. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the \n     International Criminal Court, has said that genocide is not a \n     crime of passion, it is a calculated offense. He's right. \n     When crimes against humanity are punished consistently and \n     severely, the killers' calculus will change.\n\n  Mr. President, she concludes by saying:\n\n       In my 5 years with the United Nations High Commission for \n     Refugees, I have visited more than 20 refugee camps in Sierra \n     Leone, Congo, Kosovo and elsewhere. I have met families \n     uprooted by conflict and lobbied governments to help them. \n     Years later, I have found myself at the same camps, hearing \n     the same stories and seeing the same lack of clean water, \n     medicine, security and hope.\n       It has become clear to me that there will be no enduring \n     peace without justice. History shows that there will be \n     another Darfur, another exodus, in a vicious cycle of \n     bloodshed and retribution. But an international court finally \n     exists. It will be as strong as the support we give it. This \n     might be the moment we stop the cycle of violence and end our \n     tolerance for crimes against humanity.\n       What the worst people in the world fear most is justice. \n     That's what we should deliver.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Washingtonpost.com, Feb. 28, 2007]\n\n                           Justice for Darfur\n\n                          (By Angelina Jolie)\n\n       Bahai, Chad.--Here, at this refugee camp on the border of \n     Sudan, nothing separates us from Darfur but a small stretch \n     of desert and a line on a map. All the same, it's a line I \n     can't cross. As a representative of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees, I have traveled into Darfur \n     before, and I had hoped to return. But the UNHCR has told me \n     that this camp, Oure Cassoni, is as close as I can get.\n       Sticking to this side of the Sudanese border is supposed to \n     keep me safe. By every measure--killings, rapes, the burning \n     and looting of villages--the violence in Darfur has increased \n     since my last visit, in 2004. The death toll has passed \n     200,000; in four years of fighting, Janjaweed militia members \n     have driven 2.5 million people from their homes, including \n     the 26,000 refugees crowded into Oure Cassoni.\n       Attacks on aid workers are rising, another reason I was \n     told to stay out of Darfur. By drawing attention to their \n     heroic work--their efforts to keep refugees alive, to keep \n     camps like this one from being consumed by chaos and fear--I \n     would put them at greater risk.\n       I've seen how aid workers and nongovernmental organizations \n     make a difference to people struggling for survival. I can \n     see on workers' faces the toll their efforts have taken. \n     Sitting among them, I'm amazed by their bravery and \n     resilience. But humanitarian relief alone will never be \n     enough.\n       Until the killers and their sponsors are prosecuted and \n     punished, violence will continue on a massive scale. Ending \n     it may well require military action. But accountability can \n     also come from international tribunals, measuring the \n     perpetrators against international standards of justice.\n       Accountability is a powerful force. It has the potential to \n     change behavior--to check aggression by those who are used to \n     acting with impunity. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of \n     the International Criminal Court (ICC), has said that \n     genocide is not a crime of passion; it is a calculated \n     offense. He's right. When crimes against humanity are \n     punished consistently and severely, the killers' calculus \n     will change.\n       On Monday I asked a group of refugees about their needs. \n     Better tents, said one; better access to medical facilities, \n     said another. Then a teenage boy raised his hand and said, \n     with powerful simplicity, ``Nous voulons une epreuve.'' We \n     want a trial. He is why I am encouraged by the ICC's \n     announcement yesterday that it will prosecute a former \n     Sudanese minister of state and a Janjaweed leader on charges \n     of crimes against humanity.\n       Some critics of the ICC have said indictments could make \n     the situation worse. The threat of prosecution gives the \n     accused a reason to keep fighting, they argue. Sudanese \n     officials have echoed this argument, saying that the ICC's \n     involvement, and the implication of their own eventual \n     prosecution, is why they have refused to allow U.N. \n     peacekeepers into Darfur.\n       It is not clear, though, why we should take Khartoum at its \n     word. And the notion that the threat of ICC indictments has \n     somehow exacerbated the problem doesn't make sense, given the \n     history of the conflict. Khartoum's claims aside, would we in \n     America ever accept the logic that we shouldn't prosecute \n     murderers because the threat of prosecution might provoke \n     them to continue killing?\n       When I was in Chad in June 2004, refugees told me about \n     systematic attacks on their villages. It was estimated then \n     that more than 1,000 people were dying each week.\n       In October 2004 I visited West Darfur, where I heard \n     horrific stories, including accounts of gang-rapes of mothers \n     and their children. By that time, the UNHCR estimated, 1.6 \n     million people had been displaced in the three provinces of \n     Darfur and 200,000 others had fled to Chad.\n       It wasn't until June 2005 that the ICC began to \n     investigate. By then the campaign of violence was well \n     underway.\n       As the prosecutions unfold, I hope the international \n     community will intervene, right away, to protect the people \n     of Darfur and prevent further violence. The refugees don't \n     need more resolutions or statements of concern. They need \n     follow-through on past promises of action.\n       There has been a groundswell of public support for action. \n     People may disagree on how to intervene--airstrikes, sending \n     troops, sanctions, divestment--but we all should agree that \n     the slaughter must be stopped and the perpetrators brought to \n     justice.\n       In my five years with UNHCR, I have visited more than 20 \n     refugee camps in Sierra Leone, Congo, Kosovo and elsewhere. I \n     have met families uprooted by conflict and lobbied \n     governments to help them. Years later, I have found myself at \n     the same camps, hearing the same stories and seeing the same \n     lack of clean water, medicine, security and hope.\n       It has become clear to me that there will be no enduring \n     peace without justice. History shows that there will be \n     another Darfur, another exodus, in a vicious cycle of \n     bloodshed and retribution. But an international court finally \n     exists. It will be as strong as the support we give it. This \n     might be the moment we stop the cycle of violence and end our \n     tolerance for crimes against humanity.\n       What the worst people in the world fear most is justice. \n     That's what we should deliver.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I conclude by saying that the subcommittee \nwhich I chair of the Judiciary Committee, the Human Rights \nSubcommittee, had a hearing several weeks ago on genocide in Darfur. We \nare preparing legislation as a result of that hearing to authorize \nState and local governments and others to divest of investments in \nSudan and businesses that are doing business in Sudan and furthermore \nto extend the authority of the U.S. Department of Justice to prosecute \nthose whom we find guilty of genocide in foreign lands. That authority \ncurrently exists for those whom we accuse and wish to prosecute for \ntorture; the same thing should apply to crimes of genocide.\n  Those two legislative changes may help, but in the meantime it is \ntime for our Government to help. I commended the Bush administration 4 \nyears ago when they finally used the word ``genocide'' as it related to \nDarfur. I thanked then-Secretary of State Colin Powell for his courage \nin using that word. I said the same to Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice. But, having said that, we must understand that if we use the word \nand fail to act, what does it say of us? If we acknowledge that a \ngenocide is taking place and do nothing, what does it say of America?\n  We have the power to do things, to change this. It will take \npolitical courage, not only in the White House but here in Congress. \nHistory will write in years to come whether we acted or not, as it is \nwritten about the lack of response to the Holocaust.

Madam President, I would like to take a personal moment \nto express my deepest gratitude and bid farewell to my senior defense \npolicy analyst, Archie Galloway.\n  For the past 10 years, Archie has dedicated his time, energy and \nskill to assisting me but more importantly to assisting America and the \ncitizens of Alabama. He has been a friend and an asset to the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, and his performance stands as a tribute to \nthe professionalism of our military community. Archie leaves us to join \nthe private sector, but our Nation will continue to benefit from his \nmany contributions for many years.\n  I congratulate Arch on his bright future but with a heavy heart. His \nexperience as a battle-tested Army officer, Ranger, and 101st Airborne \nScreaming\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\nEagle, combined with his in-depth knowledge of the workings of Capitol \nHill, cannot be matched. Upon joining my team, he quickly became a \npillar in my office. His undeniable work ethic and his unwavering \ndedication to our country and to my State of Alabama were a great \nexample to his fellow staffers.\n  As my senior defense policy analyst, I have relied on Archie's \nexperience and sound judgment. In the last 10 years, he has been \ninstrumental in the passage of key legislation, such as the HEROES Act \nthat Senator Lieberman and I cosponsored--I believe the Senator was \nhere a moment ago--that doubled the death benefits provided to the \nfamilies of those who lost a servicemember in combat. Alabama's success \nin the recent Base Realignment and Closure round reflected so much of \nhis hard work. The footprints of his dedication to the needs of this \nNation and to the State of Alabama are deep and permanent as he moves \non to his next journey in life.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention the other half of the Galloway \nteam. Archie's wife Carol is a tremendous contributor to his success. \nWe will always be impressed by the strength of their partnership and \nthe heart and soul they put into everything they do together.\n  On behalf of myself, my staff, and the people of Alabama, the \nmilitary community, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the entire \ncountry, may I say thank you to Colonel Archie Galloway.\n  During these 10 years, Archie has won the admiration and respect of \neveryone he has worked with. Many have sent their regards, so I thought \nI would quote a few.\n  Charlie Able, former Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and \nReadiness and the former Armed Services Committee staff director had \nthis to say:\n\n       Archie is a professional soldier and a dedicated Senate \n     staffer who cares deeply about soldiers and their families. \n     It's equally important to recognize his wife Carol for her \n     dedication and service. This partnership is truly their best \n     asset.\n\n  Les Brownlee, the former Senate Armed Services Committee staff \ndirector and Under Secretary of the Army had this to say:\n\n       Archie wore the uniform of a soldier and brought all of \n     that wonderful experience to the U.S. Senate, where it has \n     been invaluable to Senator Sessions, the Army, and the \n     Nation.\n\n  Here are the words of General Cody, Vice Chief of Staff of the United \nStates Army:\n\n       Archie Galloway is a patriot in every sense of the word. \n     His commitment to this Nation and the Army has not faltered \n     through 40 years of service. In and out of uniform, Archie \n     has dedicated his life to taking care of the soldiers that \n     defend our freedoms. Although Arch will be missed, he can \n     take great pride in knowing the indelible impact he has made \n     will continue to save lives, strengthen our national \n     security, and protect the liberties from which we all \n     benefit. Thank you for your service Arch, Army Strong!\n\n  Dick Walsh, senior member of the Armed Services Committee, writes on \nbehalf of the Armed Services Committee and their team:\n\n       There aren't many people working on Capitol Hill these days \n     who have served in the Armed Forces, and among those, there \n     are even fewer who--like Arch Galloway--served over 20 years \n     on active duty, commanded troops, and achieved the rank of \n     Colonel in the United States Army. We have been fortunate to \n     have Arch working issues in support of Senator Sessions on \n     behalf of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines and working \n     for the people of our country. Whether he learned it from his \n     parents or whether he learned it in the Army, Archie brought \n     the qualities of common sense, good judgment, commitment to \n     duty, honor, and country, wisdom and an inherent \n     understanding of how to get things done the right way in the \n     U.S. Senate. Archie helped us all see each day that the Army \n     is an institution we all have to listen to, support, and \n     advocate for. Any outfit that keeps someone like Arch for a \n     career and then hands him off to more public service is doing \n     something right. No one was able to send a message of \n     appreciation and thanks for support and a job well done with \n     a plate of delicious cookies better than Archie Galloway, and \n     we thank Carol Galloway for her contributions as Archie's G4 \n     to committee morale. Archie like few others understands the \n     ``force multiplier'' effect of baked goods. All part of being \n     a great leader. The staff of the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee relies greatly on the military legislative \n     assistants who work for our Senators and those who have the \n     kind of experience and qualities that Arch possesses \n     represent a tremendous resource. They are full partners with \n     the committee staff. We are sad to see Archie leave, and he \n     will be missed, but we are very grateful for his friendship \n     and service.\n\n  Rob Soofer, the chief staffer for the minority side on the Strategic \nForces Subcommittee says:\n\n       Most legislative assistants view their primary \n     responsibility as supporting the Senator's interests in \n     the State. While Archie was indeed a forceful advocate for \n     defense interests in Alabama, he never lost sight of the \n     broader national security interests and the role Senator \n     Sessions played as chairman of the Strategic Forces \n     Subcommittee. As the liaison between the committee staff \n     and the Senator, he made sure the Senator was prepared to \n     chair subcommittee hearings and address critical strategic \n     force issues during the preparation and passage of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act.\n\n  John Little, now the chief of staff for Senator Martinez, a former \nstaffer in my office, said this:\n\n       I cannot say enough about Archie Galloway. It was my honor \n     to work with him for 8 years. I have never worked with \n     someone who is more honest, sincere and dedicated. As a \n     native of Alabama, I know how much he has done for my State. \n     America is truly stronger for his service to our Nation. I \n     wish him and Carol much happiness and the best of luck as he \n     embarks on his new professional career. I am very glad that I \n     can call him my friend.\n\n  Here are some comments from those with whom he has worked. Rick \nDearborn, the Chief of Staff in my office, says:\n\n       If James Brown was known as the hardest working man in show \n     business, Arch Galloway should be known as the ``hardest \n     working military legislative assistant on the Hill.'' The \n     focus that Arch has placed on men and women in uniform over \n     10 years, particularly those who served in the State of \n     Alabama, was a tribute to his country and the man who \n     represents them. I know of no one who has worked harder, put \n     in more hours, more thought and sweat than Archie Galloway on \n     behalf of the men and women in uniform and in the name of \n     national security.\n\n  Major Shannon Sentell, former military fellow in my office, back now \non active duty, said:\n\n       Be it the soldier in the field, the constituent in need of \n     assistance, or the numerous relationships he has on the Hill, \n     Archie Galloway always gave 110 percent in making sure the \n     welfare of those individuals and groups was taken care of. \n     His untiring efforts and tenacious attitude made Arch the \n     ``go-to'' man when a lot of heavy lifting was needed. On a \n     personal note, I refer to him as my colleague, my mentor, but \n     most of all, my friend. Thank you, Arch, for what you do on a \n     daily basis. You have made an incredible difference in so \n     many lives. You will be sorely missed.\n\n  Meagan Myers, who now works under Colonel Galloway on my staff, said \nthis:\n\n       Though he would never admit it, Arch is my father figure in \n     Washington, D.C. I have truly never learned so much about \n     life from one individual. To call him my mentor would be an \n     understatement at best. Although I will miss Arch in the \n     office, I look forward to his success in the private sector.\n\n  Watson Donald, who also worked under Archie Galloway and is now the \nmilitary legislative assistant for Congressman Jo Bonner, said:\n\n       Archie Galloway is one of the most dedicated, hard-working, \n     loyal, intelligent people I know. His decade-long service to \n     Alabama has been invaluable and I know our entire \n     congressional delegation will miss his defense-related \n     expertise. Having worked for him personally for 3 years, I am \n     proud to have him not only as a professional mentor, but as a \n     friend.\n\n  Leroy Nix, who also worked under Arch and is now in law school said:\n\n       I would simply like to express my gratitude to Colonel \n     Galloway for his tireless commitment to excellence and the \n     service of the people of Alabama and this Nation. Having \n     worked with Arch in Senator Sessions' office for the better \n     part of 3 years, I had the luxury of learning from him, not \n     just the finer points of professionalism and personal \n     development, but also those things that I feel will continue \n     to influence the man I am and the man I strive to be. My only \n     hope is that more people, young and old, could have such a \n     fine teacher, mentor, and most importantly, friend.\n\n  John Muller, current military fellow and major in the Army says:\n\n       Archie is a true patriot and a great mentor. He shows you \n     the way and gives you the freedom to work the issues, but he \n     will not let you fail.\n\n  Stephen Boyd--LA, Sessions staffer said:\n\n       I've had the very good fortune to work about 10 feet from \n     Arch Galloway, day in and day out, for several years now. \n     It's given me a deep respect for all he has done behind the \n     scenes for Senator Sessions and for the State of Alabama. \n     When I came to Washington fresh from law school, I was long \n     on eagerness but short on experience. It didn't take\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\n     me long to realize that Arch Galloway, more than any other, \n     knew exactly what he was doing in this town. I decided early \n     on to use Arch's attitude, style, and work ethic as a model \n     for my own, and I think that is one of the best decisions I \n     have ever made. His guidance has never let me down.\n\n  Mike Brumas, press secretary, Senator Sessions, said:\n\n       the use of use of superlatives is all too common these \n     days. But someone trying to describe Arch Galloway's 10-year \n     tenure on Capitol Hill is forced to reach for the highest of \n     accolades--best, brightest, consummate professional, hardest \n     worker. Arch Galloway brought the can-do spirit of a \n     distinguished military career to Senator Sessions's office, \n     and we all benefited by his example. He will be hard to \n     replace and is already missed.\n\n  Madam President, I have had the opportunity to travel to Iraq on more \nthan one occasion with Colonel Galloway. He is more than an employee in \nmy office. He is a friend and a partner in service to our country. His \ncareer was exceptional in the Army on active duty. His service in my \noffice has been exceptional. No one on the Hill, I think, is more \nrespected than Archie Galloway for his hard work and professionalism. I \nam going to miss him. Our country is going to miss him.\n  I don't do this often, but I think on very special occasions, those \nwho serve this Senate exceedingly well deserve a few moments of \nmention. I think it is true for Archie Galloway. I think all of us \nappreciate our staff members. So many serve in so many superb ways, but \nI have to tell my colleagues, this one was special. I am really going \nto miss him. I wish he and Carol every success. He has been a partner, \na friend, and a patriot in his service to America.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I wish to very briefly thank Senator \nSessions for his tribute to Archie Galloway. I had the privilege to \nwork with Arch and traveled with him at least a couple of times. He is \na patriot. He served his country in many different roles, including the \nlast period of time working with Senator Sessions, to the benefit of \nthe Senate and his country. I wish him the best in the years ahead, and \nI look forward to continuing our friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2476-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment, as they are \ntalking about the way to proceed further, to read a letter I have read \nevery year since I have been in the Senate on or around March 2, which \nis Texas Independence Day. Today is the 171st anniversary of the \nsigning of the Texas Declaration of Independence. This is a document \nthat declares that Texas would be a free and independent republic. This \nis a tradition that was started by my colleague, Senator John Tower. It \nis a most historic time for Texas because we celebrate Texas \nIndependence Day every year because we know that fighting for freedom \nhas made a difference in what our State has become. We love our \nhistory. We were a republic for 10 years, and then we came into the \nUnited States as a State.\n  The defense of the Alamo by 189 courageous men, who were outnumbered \n10 to 1, was a key battle in the Texas Revolution. The sacrifice of \nColonel William Barret Travis and his men made possible General Sam \nHouston's ultimate victory at San Jacinto, which secured independence \nfor Texas. Sam Houston and Thomas Rusk, who was the Secretary of War \nfor the Republic of Texas, were the first two United States Senators to \nserve from the State of Texas.\n  I will read the letter that was sent by William Barret Travis from \nthe Alamo, asking for arms.\n\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna--I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man--the enemy has demanded a surrender \n     at discretion, otherwise, the garrison is to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken--I have answered the demands with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the \n     wall--I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism \n     and of everything dear to the American character, to come to \n     our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving \n     reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or \n     four thousand in four or five days. If this call is \n     neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as \n     possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due \n     to his own honor and that of his country--Victory or Death.\n                                            William Barret Travis,\n                                              Lt. Col., Commander.\n\n  As everyone knows that battle did continue. Colonel Travis did not \nreceive any help, but it was the delay of those brave soldiers, \nnumbering under 200, that allowed Sam Houston to reinforce his own army \nand take a stand at the battle of San Jacinto that happened April 21 of \nthat year and did, in fact, determine that Texas would become an \nindependent republic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2476-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2476-S2480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the tax relief that \nwas passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush in 2001 \nand 2003, and to bring some reality to an upcoming debate this month \nthat involves the budget resolution. Since that tax relief was enacted \nin 2001 and 2003, and especially since last November, we have heard \nfrom the liberal establishment in Washington and elsewhere that this \nbipartisan tax relief must be ended and that taxes should be increased \non millions of Americans of all income levels.\n  Today, I am going to look at what is driving the tax increase crowd \nand talk about why they are wrong and why increasing taxes is a bad \nidea. The liberal establishment uses deficit reduction as a primary \nexcuse for their craving to raise taxes, but before we applaud their \nefforts to balance the budget, let's think about their solution. When \nanyone says we need to increase taxes to balance the budget, what they \nare saying is they are unwilling to cut Government spending. In \nactuality, the tax increase crowd wants to increase Government \nspending.\n  Yesterday, I focused on what extending the bipartisan tax relief \npackage means to nearly every American who pays income tax. So today, \nas I promised yesterday, I want to examine the tax relief and to look \nat the impact it has on our economy.\n  Regardless of whether you look at Federal revenues, employment, \nhousehold wealth, or market indexes, the impact of tax relief has been \noverwhelmingly positive. I am going to put a chart up that gives the \nfigures I want you to consider as I go through the points I am making.\n  The first chart illustrates the growth of revenue with the red line \nand the growth in GDP with the green line. As we can see, revenues are \ncurrently increasing, and are projected to increase in the near future, \neven before tax relief is scheduled to sunset under current law in the \nyear 2010. Clearly, tax relief has not destroyed the Government's \nrevenue base. I want to point out that this chart shows percentage \nchanges in revenue and percentage changes in GDP. So if the lines are \nflat in places, it means revenues and GDP are increasing at a constant \nrate.\n  The next chart graphs the Standard & Poor's 500 equity price index \nover a period of several years. So, here again, the lowest point of \nboth the red line, representing the weekly S, and the green line, \nrepresenting an average, seems to correspond closely with May of 2003, \nwhich, not coincidentally, is when dividend and capital gains tax cuts \nwere signed into law. Aside from benefiting Americans directly invested \nin the stock market, this is good news for anyone with a pension who \ninvests in the stock market as well. Of course, that happens to be well \nover half the people. I think somewhere between 56 and 60 percent of \nthe people, either through pensions or directly investing in the stock \nmarket, have money reserves in the stock market. So this is not \nsomething that affects 10 or 15 percent of maybe the wealthiest people \nin the country, as it did 20, 25 years ago; more people are vested in \nthe stock market, mostly through pensions.\n  According to the Federal Reserve--I have another chart--net wealth of \nhouseholds and nonprofit organizations has increased from a low of \naround $39 trillion in 2002 to more than $54 trillion in the third \nquarter of 2006. Since tax relief went into effect, our Nation's \nhouseholds and nonprofit organizations have benefited from more than \n$15 trillion of new wealth.\n  This trend is also apparent when we are looking at employment. I show \nyou yet another chart. Total nonfarm employment was calculated to \nconsist of\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\naround 130 million jobs in the summer of 2003 but is projected to be \n137 million jobs in January of this year. This shows a 7 million \nincrease in nonfarm employment since the 2003 tax relief bill was \nsigned into law.\n  I have just described to you four indicators of prosperity. All four \nof them have increased since bipartisan tax relief was passed by \nCongress and signed into law. I wish to emphasize that word \n``bipartisan'' tax relief legislation of 2001 and 2003. Federal \nrevenues are growing steadily at a rate, then, greater than the gross \ndomestic product. The S 500 ended a downward slide and began moving \nupward around the time of the 2003 tax bill. Also, since the 2003 tax \nbill became law, household and nonprofit wealth has steadily increased, \nand literally millions of new jobs have been created. I think it is \nmore than a coincidence that all of these positive economic indicators \nare correlated with tax relief. I do not think anything short of \nwillful ignorance could lead anyone to say tax relief has been bad for \nthis country.\n  Now, going back to what I was saying before, the liberal \nestablishment wants to reverse the tax relief that has done all the \ngood things I was just talking about and that we demonstrated by chart, \nand all in the name of deficit reduction. However, this same crowd has \nnot expressed any interest in reducing the deficit through reduced \nspending. I believe the reason for this is that this crowd, comprised \nof lobbyists, the big-city press, and the entrenched Federal \nbureaucracy, wants to raise taxes--your taxes--to spend your money on \ngrowing Government rather than working to trim spending. In fact, the \nmore Government spends, the more power these interests are able to \naccumulate. The Federal bureaucracy gets to control more money, which \nwill lead to more people hiring high-paid lobbyists to apply pressure \nto take a bigger piece of the pie the taxpayers are paying for. While \nthese interests have no trouble thinking of themselves, they are not \nthinking of America's families, America's senior citizens, America's \nsmall business owners, and hard-working workers across America. These \npeople may not be able to hire lobbyists or write syndicated columns, \nbut their welfare should be our top priority.\n\n  I am going to talk in greater detail about America's families, \nseniors, small business owners, and workers, but for now, I just want \nto mention some more about our economy as a whole and how rolling back \nthe 2001 and 2003 tax relief would have dire consequences for our whole \neconomy.\n  There is an old saying that goes something like this: Figures don't \nlie, but liars can figure. This saying is especially true in \nWashington, DC. Any given issue has champions on both sides of the \naisle able to generate studies and research that just happens to \nsupport their position. I say this because the source for the \ninformation I am going to present now is not one of those groups but, \nrather, the Goldman Sachs Group.\n  Goldman Sachs is an enormously successful and well-respected \nfinancial services firm. I do not think it is possible for any \nDemocratic politician, liberal think-tanker, or liberal journalist to \naccuse Goldman Sachs of being a tool of my party, the Republican Party. \nClinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin served as cosenior partner and \ncochairman, and current New Jersey Governor and former Senator Jon \nCorzine served as chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs. Our current \nTreasury Secretary also enjoyed a prominent career at that firm. So I \nwould recommend that Republicans, but especially Democrats, pay \nattention when a Goldman economist sends up a red flag.\n  In a report that is titled ``Fiscal Policy: Marking Time until the \nTax Cut Sunsets,'' the U.S. Economic Research Group at Goldman Sachs, \nin this report, projects a recession--projects a recession--if the 2001 \nand 2003 tax relief is allowed to sunset. Now, this study actually came \nout in November of 2006, so I am a little surprised we have not heard \nmore about it.\n  For this report, Goldman Sachs economists used the Washington \nUniversity macro model. To give a little background on the Washington \nmodel, it is a quarterly econometric system of 611 variables, 442 \nequations, and 169 exogenous variables. The Washington model was \ndeveloped and is maintained by Macroeconomic Advisers, Limited \nLiability Corporation, out of St. Louis, MO. Macroeconomic Advisers is \nwhere former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin \nserves as a senior adviser. Plus, the firm won the prestigious 2005-\n2006 National Association for Business Economics Outlook Forecast Award \nfor their accurate GDP and Treasury bill rate forecasts. That ought to \ngive them a great deal of credibility. Now, of course, Macroeconomic \nAdvisers and their Washington model must be accurate enough for people \nto pay to use it, which is not true for every organization that has \nbeen modeling the effects on the economy of letting tax relief expire.\n  Getting back to the Goldman Sachs study, the authors assumed that \nCongress would let the 2001 and 2003 tax relief expire, so they reset \ntaxes to their year 2000 levels, grossed them up slightly to match the \nCongressional Budget Office estimate of the revenue impact of letting \nthe tax cuts expire, and allowed for an appropriate monetary response. \nFor monetary policy, the study's authors assumed that the Federal \nReserve would call for interest rate cuts when output falls below its \ntrend and for interest rate increases when inflation rises above its \ncomfort zone.\n  The study states that:\n\n       In the first quarter of 2011, real GDP growth drops more \n     than 3 percentage points below what it would otherwise be. \n     Absent a strong tailwind to growth from some other source, \n     this would almost surely mark the onset of a recession.\n\n  If tax relief is allowed to expire, this study shows that a recession \nis likely to result. By not extending or making tax relief permanent, \nCongress will be deliberately inflicting a recession on the American \npeople. Is a lot of hollow, high-sounding rhetoric about balanced \nbudgets worth the job losses or business closures that would result in \nsuch a recession?\n  The study eventually predicts higher output but notes that \nconsumption would be lower.\n  So that everyone has the opportunity to review this study, I ask \nunanimous consent, Mr. President, that it be printed in the Record, \nalong with one of the very few news stories to note its findings.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the U.S. Economic Analyst, Nov. 10, 2006]\n\n         Fiscal Policy: Marking Time Until the Tax Cut Sunsets\n\n       Near-term changes in US fiscal policy are unlikely despite \n     the shift in control of the Congress. Key decisions on \n     extending tax cuts are not forced until 2010, after the next \n     election, while efforts to roll back these cuts before then \n     would surely trigger a veto.\n       As the tax cut ``sunsets'' approach, the Congress regains \n     power, as legislation will then be needed to extend the cuts. \n     The choice will not be easy given the magnitude of the tax \n     increase--about 1\\1/2\\% of GDP--that would occur if the tax \n     cuts all expired and its likely impact on near-term growth.\n       In a simulation exercise, we confirm that this ``do nothing \n     Congress'' scenario would quickly balance the budget but at \n     the cost of a sharp hit to growth in the short term. Farther \n     out, the benefits are higher output and lower inflation and \n     interest rates, at the expense of less consumption--an \n     inevitable price for this decade's tax cuts.\n       The Democratic Party has regained control of both houses of \n     Congress with a surprisingly strong showing in the mid-term \n     election. Although the new leadership will clash with \n     President Bush on many issues, several areas appear ripe for \n     compromise, including immigration policy, a minimum wage \n     hike, and Iraq policy. Each could have significant impact on \n     the economy.\n       Third-quarter real GDP growth could be revised up to about \n     2% (annualized), but the fourth-quarter prognosis remains \n     murky. Early reads on retail sales suggesting that October \n     spending was weak, and the factory sector must begin to work \n     off an inventory overhang. The labor market continues to \n     impress, though we expect the jobless rate to begin trending \n     higher soon as the housing correction triggers more job \n     losses.\n\n                    I. Return to Divided Government\n\n       The Democratic Party has regained control of both houses of \n     Congress with a surprisingly strong showing in the mid-term \n     election.

Each could have significant impact on \n     the economy.\n       Third-quarter real GDP growth may have been a bit stronger \n     than first reported, with data in hand suggesting an upward \n     revision to about 2% (annualized). However, the fourth-\n     quarter prognosis is murky, with\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\n     early reads on retail sales suggesting that spending was weak \n     in October, and a substantial inventory overhang in the \n     manufacturing sector. The labor market continues to impress, \n     though we expect the unemployment rate to begin trending \n     higher soon as the housing correction triggers more job \n     losses.\n     Democrats Retake Congress\n       With surprisingly strong mid-term election gains, the \n     Democratic Party has retaken a majority not only in the House \n     of Representatives, but also in the Senate with a much \n     thinner 51-49 edge (counting two independents who will caucus \n     with the Democrats). This marks the first time that Democrats \n     have controlled both houses of Congress since 1994; the size \n     of the net changes (6 in the Senate, about 30 in the House) \n     approaches those of previous ``landslide'' mid-term \n     elections, especially given the relatively small number of \n     competitive races.\n       With Democrats setting the agenda, the initial focus of \n     Congress next year is likely to be on the six issues \n     highlighted in the campaign: (1) reinstatement of PAYGO \n     budget rules; (2) repeal of tax preferences for integrated \n     oil companies; (3) reductions in student loan rates; (4) \n     direct negotiation of Medicare prescription drug prices; (5) \n     an increase in the minimum wage, and (6) implementation of \n     the September 11th Commission recommendations.\n       Although President Bush and the Democratic Congress are \n     likely to clash on many fronts, several major issues with \n     ramification, for the economy appear ripe for compromise:\n       1. Immigration. Continued large inflows of undocumented \n     immigrants and bipartisan acknowledgement that current \n     policies are insufficient to address the situation have \n     created fertile ground for legislative progress. A potential \n     compromise on immigration policy would likely involve a \n     combination of increased quotas for legal immigration, \n     tougher enforcement of those quotas, and some sort of \n     procedure through which illegal immigrants could eventually \n     apply for US citizenship.\n       2. Minimum wage. As noted above, Democrats have targeted a \n     significant increase in the national minimum wage, to $7.25 \n     from $5.15 per hour, as part of their initial agenda. A \n     majority in both houses of the current Congress had already \n     supported an increase even before the election, but the deal \n     was never consummated. More than half (26) of the states \n     already have higher minimums, covering a significant portion \n     of the US labor force.\n       3. Iraq. Iraq policy could see a fundamental shift, with \n     Donald Rumsfeld's departure as Secretary of Defense an \n     indicator of possible changes ahead. The upcoming report by a \n     special commission chaired by former Secretary of State James \n     Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton (who also co-\n     chaired the September 11 Commission) could offer both parties \n     political cover for a change of course. This might ultimately \n     reduce the drain on the federal budget from Iraq-related \n     expenditures.\n       However, compromise is less likely on many other issues. \n     The White House appeared to be considering making entitlement \n     reform its top priority in Bush's last two years in office, \n     but this now seems unlikely given the huge political \n     obstacles and the likelihood that lawmakers' focus will soon \n     turn to the 2008 presidential election. Federal spending is \n     unlikely to be dramatically different, though divided \n     government historically has meant more controlled spending \n     about in line with GDP growth (-0.02 points per year) versus \n     slightly faster (+0.23 points) when government was under \n     control of a single party.\n       Tax policy seems unlikely to change either. Most important \n     tax cuts don't expire until 2010, and there is little \n     Democrats in Congress can do to alter tax policy, given the \n     likelihood of a Bush veto. In addition, Democrats appear far \n     from unified on repealing many of these tax cuts, and the \n     resulting fiscal tightening would pose temporary downside \n     risks to the economic outlook. There is a small risk that \n     tighter budget rules could force the cost of extending these \n     cuts to be offset by tax increases elsewhere. Most likely, \n     these would come from the closing of corporate ``loopholes'' \n     or other business-related revenue raisers. Relief from the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) will be extended, but plans to \n     require the cost of any tax cuts to be offset could put two \n     of the Democrats' priorities in conflict (see this week's \n     center section for a fuller discussion of the fiscal \n     outlook).\n     More Growth Then, Less Now?\n       Economic news this week implied that third-quarter growth \n     might turn out to be a bit stronger than initially estimated. \n     In particular, better export performance and lower oil \n     imports resulted in a substantially narrower trade deficit \n     for September--$64.3 billion versus August's downward-revised \n     $69.0 billion shortfall. This, combined with more inventory \n     building than Commerce officials assumed, puts our best guess \n     for third-quarter real GDP growth slightly above 2% \n     (annualized). Upcoming reports on retail sales and \n     inventories could still swing this figure.\n       However, the market's focus is on the outlook, and here we \n     remain cautious. In theory, the sharp drop in energy prices \n     over the past three months should boost consumer spending in \n     the fourth quarter, but this acceleration has yet to \n     materialize. Early reads on retail sales activity--the \n     official government data are due out Tuesday--suggest that \n     October spending was weak. In fact, we have trimmed 0.2 \n     points from our retail sales estimates, to -0.4% overall and \n     -0.3% excluding autos. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector \n     will have to begin working off a significant inventory \n     overhang.\n       The labor market continues to impress. For example, initial \n     jobless claims moved back down near the 300,000 level, \n     implying that last week's rise was a head fake and \n     reinforcing the generally strong tone of the October \n     employment report. Although the labor market is clearly tight \n     at present, we expect job losses--particularly from the \n     housing sector--to begin pushing up the unemployment rate \n     within the next few months.\n\n       II. Fiscal Policy: Marking Time Until the Tax Cut Sunsets\n\n       Near-term changes in U.S. fiscal policy are unlikely \n     despite the shift in control of the Congress. Key decisions \n     on extending tax cuts are not forced until 2010, after the \n     next election, while any efforts to roll back these cuts \n     before then would surely trigger a presidential veto.\n       As the tax cut ``sunsets'' approach, the Congress regains \n     power, as legislation will then be needed if the tax cuts are \n     to be extended. The choice will not be easy given the \n     magnitude of the tax increase--about 1\\1/2\\ percent of GDP-\n     that would occur if the tax cuts all expired and its likely \n     impact on near-term growth.\n       In a simulation exercise, we confirm that this ``do nothing \n     Congress'' scenario would quickly balance the budget but at \n     the cost of a sharp hit to growth in the short term. Farther \n     out, the benefits are higher output and lower inflation and \n     interest rates, at the expense of less consumption--an \n     inevitable price for this decade's tax cuts.\n     Near-Term Fiscal Policy: No Major Shift\n       Talk of imminent change in fiscal policy, focused on tax \n     hikes, has surfaced as Democrats have regained control of the \n     Congress. They netted about 30 more seats in the House of \n     Representatives, giving them a comfortable margin. In the \n     Senate, the Democratic margin is much thinner--a 51-49 edge.\n       However, this shift in control of Congress does not \n     translate into an immediate shift in fiscal policy for four \n     reasons. First, the budget deficit has narrowed sharply over \n     the past two years, as shown in Exhibit 1. This may reduce \n     the sense of urgency in the minds of many lawmakers, and \n     therefore their willingness to strike deals even though the \n     longer-term imbalance remains serious and unresolved. Second, \n     the main components of President Bush's signature tax cuts--\n     enacted with ``sunsets'' to contain their budget impact--do \n     not expire until the end of 2010. Hence, the thorny issue of \n     extending these cuts need not be addressed until after the \n     next Congress (and president) is elected in 2008. Third, any \n     effort to roll back these cuts before their scheduled \n     expiration would almost surely trigger a presidential veto, \n     which the Congress could not override, and it would provide \n     the GOP with an election issue to boot. Therein lies the \n     fourth reason, that the impending 2008 presidential election \n     will limit the time and scope for meaningful progress.\n       Similar logic applies to the spending side of the ledger, \n     where any efforts to trim outlays for defense or homeland \n     security would be fraught with political risk. Our working \n     assumption is that total spending on national security will \n     not change much, although the composition might shift; for \n     other discretionary spending we expect gridlock between a \n     Democratic majority that would like to restore some programs \n     and a Republican president whose veto pen will suddenly be \n     full of ink. The same probably holds for Democrats' announced \n     intention to push for direct negotiation of Medicare \n     prescription drug prices.\n       One issue the new congressional leadership will face is how \n     to handle the various tax measures whose renewal has become \n     an annual ritual in recent years. By far the largest of these \n     is the temporary fix of the alternative minimum tax (AMT), \n     without which the number of taxpayers affected by this \n     obscure tax calculation would soar. Although renewing the AMT \n     would boost the deficit by an estimated $65 billion for \n     fiscal year (FY) 2008, it enjoys bipartisan support. This is \n     because many of its unsuspecting victims live in ``blue'' \n     states. Hence, the new Congress will probably find some way \n     to make it happen and pass most of the other ones (another \n     $16 billion) as well. In doing so, the Democrats risk \n     compromising another objective they have championed in recent \n     years, namely to reinstate pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules for \n     federal budget legislation. Unlike the administration and the \n     current congressional leadership, who favor PAYGO only for \n     outlays, Democrats have pushed to have these rules apply to \n     taxes as well. Notably, the decision to resurrect PAYGO does \n     not require the president to sign off, as it can be \n     implemented simply as part of the budget resolution. Hence, \n     an early test of the Democrats' resolve to control the budget \n     deficit will be whether they restore PAYGO or something \n     similar and, more critically, whether they adhere to it.\n     2010: A Year of Wreckoning?\n       On balance, our expectations for significant change in \n     fiscal policy during the next two years are low. Thereafter, \n     the calculus changes radically as the 2010 sunsets approach. \n     Absent legislative action, the tax\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\n     code essentially reverts to its pre-2001 provisions on \n     January 1, 2011. Marginal tax rates on ordinary income rise \n     significantly, dividend income loses its special treatment, \n     the capital gains tax rate goes back to 20 percent, the \n     marriage penalty reappears, the child tax credit drops, and \n     the estate--oops, death--tax springs back to life.\n       One implication of this situation is that the initiative \n     reverts to Congress, specifically the one to be elected in \n     2008. It can opt for fiscal balance simply by doing nothing \n     and letting the tax cuts expire, or it can pass legislation \n     to extend any or all of the cuts. Although the president--\n     whoever that may be--obviously still has the right of veto, \n     he/she obviously cannot reject a bill that has not reached \n     his/her desk.\n       More importantly, the stakes are high, as the sunsets \n     potentially telescope into one year the reversal of tax cuts \n     implemented in various stages between mid-2001 and early \n     2004. According to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     estimates, tax revenue would rise by $236 billion between FY \n     2010 and FY 2012 if all of the tax cuts were to expire. \n     Scaled to the estimated size of the economy at that time, \n     this is a fiscal drag of about 1\\1/2\\ percent of GDP.\n       Even the most die-hard fiscal hawks are apt to think twice \n     about the implications of this for the near-term performance \n     of the economy. After all, a tax increase of this magnitude, \n     imposed all at once, would likely throw the economy into \n     recession. How bad would it be, and what would the benefit be \n     in terms of budget improvement and longer-term economic \n     performance?\n     Costs and Benefits of Letting Tax Cuts Expire\n       To provide some perspective on these questions, we \n     simulated the effects of allowing all the tax cuts to expire \n     as scheduled--or, to twist Harry Truman's famous phrase, a \n     ``do nothing Congress'' scenario. Specifically, using the \n     Washington University Macroeconomic Model (WUMM), we reset \n     taxes to their 2000 levels, grossed them up slightly to match \n     CBO's estimate of the revenue impact of letting the tax cuts \n     expire, and allowed for appropriate monetary policy response. \n     On the latter, we assume that the Fed follows a rule calling \n     for rate cuts when output falls below its trend and rate \n     hikes when inflation is above its ``comfort zone.''\n       Exhibit 2 illustrates the main results of this exercise, \n     showing how key variables would diverge from a status quo \n     forecast in which the tax cuts are extended. The results are \n     as follows:\n       Reversing the tax cuts quickly closes most, if not all, of \n     the fiscal deficit. The immediate effect is to cut the \n     deficit by about 1\\1/2\\ percent of GDP, as shown in the top \n     panel of Exhibit 2. This is about three-fifths of the \n     shortfall we currently project for FY 2011, based on \n     assumptions we consider realistic. Under the more restrictive \n     assumptions underlying the CBO's baseline projections, the \n     budget comes very close to balance, as indicated in that \n     agency's latest budget update as well as its estimates that \n     extending the tax cuts would boost the deficit by 1.6 percent \n     of GDP relative to its baseline.\n       More budget progress occurs in the out years. The budget \n     improvement persists and even increases over time without \n     further changes in tax law. This reflects the beneficial \n     effects of a sharp reduction in interest expense, which \n     results both from reduced borrowing and lower interest rates. \n     Five years out, the budget improvement swells to about 2\\1/2\\ \n     percent of GDP, covering about three-quarters of our \n     projected deficit and putting the budget into modest surplus \n     under the CBO assumptions.\n       The economy suffers a lot of short-term pain. The jump in \n     taxes on January 1, 2011 squeezes disposable income and hence \n     consumption. This feeds through to the rest of the economy, \n     sharply curtailing growth and prompting an aggressive easing \n     in monetary policy. The lower two panels of Exhibit 2 lay out \n     the major elements of the macroeconomic story.\n       In the fIrst quarter of 2011, real GDP growth drops more \n     than 3 percentage points below what it would otherwise be. \n     Absent a strong tailwind to growth from some other source, \n     this would almost surely mark the onset of a recession. In an \n     effort to resuscitate demand, the Fed immediately cuts the \n     federal funds rate, bringing it 250 basis points (bp) below \n     the status quo level over the next year and one-half, as \n     shown in the bottom panel of Exhibit 2. Despite this, output \n     growth remains well below trend over that period, putting \n     downward pressure on inflation as slack in the economy \n     increases. Inflation drops by 150 bp during the sag in growth \n     before coming back up as the monetary stimulus pushes output \n     back toward, and eventually above, trend.\n       In the longer run, economic growth benefits from ``crowding \n     in.'' When the government runs a large deficit, ``crowding \n     out'' occurs in the capital markets: Its borrowing, backed by \n     the power to tax, takes priority over private borrowing and \n     therefore denies some companies the funds they need for \n     investment that is usually more productive than the \n     government's use of the funds. As a result, growth suffers \n     and real interest rates rise.\n       The opposite occurs in our simulation. Restoring better \n     balance to the government's books reduces the deficit and \n     hence the growth in its debt. This frees funds that now flow \n     to the private sector allowing the capital stock to grow more \n     rapidly and pushing down interest rates. As shown by the gap \n     between the lines in the bottom panel, real interest rates \n     end up substantially lower. This, eventually, raises output \n     by about 1 percent above the level that would have prevailed \n     without the tax increase.\n       At first glance, this seems like a straightforward case of \n     short term pain (recession) leading to longer term gain \n     (higher output). Unfortunately, this assessment is a bit too \n     optimistic. Although output is higher than it otherwise would \n     be, consumption is lower. Since the 2001 tax cuts helped \n     thrust the budget back into deficit, the federal government \n     has borrowed to fund its spending and, via the tax cuts, some \n     consumer spending as well. A reversion in 2011 to higher \n     taxes simply recognizes that fact and starts paying off the \n     debt. If instead Congress chooses to maintain the cuts, they \n     just push the due date for the 2000s spending bill even \n     further into the future. In that case, the ultimate payment--\n     the drop in consumption--would be even higher.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From TCSDAILY, Feb. 6, 2007]\n\n                 Hillary Clinton and Recession of 2011\n\n                         (By James Pethokoukis)\n\n       How predictable. The fiscal 2008 budget that President Bush \n     put forward yesterday gets slammed for being unrealistic--if \n     not downright mendacious. If the $2.9 trillon proposal \n     actually got enacted as written--doubtful given that Bush is \n     dealing with a Democratic-controlled Congress--the plan would \n     theoretically balance the budget by 2012. As Team Bush \n     crunches the numbers, the U.S. government would run a $61 \n     billion surplus in 2012 year after running tiny deficits in \n     2010 ($94.4 billion, or 0.6 percent of GDP) and 2011 ($53.8 \n     billion, or 0.3 percent of GDP). All that while permanently \n     extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts due to expire in 2010.\n       Of course, journalists and think-tank analysts had barely \n     scanned the budget when critics started pointing out its \n     supposed flaws. Among them: the budget assumes more upbeat \n     economic conditions--and thus more tax revenue--than does the \n     forecast from the Congressional Budget Office. (In 2011 and \n     2012, the White House forecasts 3.0 percent and 2.9 percent \n     GDP growth vs. 2.7 percent for each of those years by the \n     CBO.) As the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \n     puts it, ``The budget employs rosy revenue assumptions; it \n     assumes at least $150 billion more in revenue than CBO does \n     for the same policies.''\n       Indeed, the CBO viewed by the inside-the-Beltway crowd as \n     the impartial umpire of all budget disputes--also predicts a \n     balanced budget by 2012. The catch is that it assumes the \n     Bush tax cuts are repealed leading to a surge of revenue in \n     2011 and 2012. It forecasts that the budget deficit would \n     drop from $137 billion in 2010 to just $12 billion in 2011. \n     And in 2012, the budget would move into the black with a $170 \n     billion surplus. Yet if the Bush tax cuts are extended, CBO \n     predicts total deficits of $407 billion in 2011 and 2012 and \n     then continuing thereafter.\n       No wonder Democratic presidential candidates are finding it \n     so easy to pledge or strongly hint that if they are sitting \n     in the White House in 2010, they will veto any effort to \n     extend the tax cuts. One can easily envision President \n     Hillary Rodham Clinton harking back to her husband Bill's \n     1993 tax hikes and economic success as historical \n     justification for a repeat performance. Deficits are often \n     used as reason for higher taxes, such as in 1993 and 1982. \n     But to believe in higher taxes as sound economic policy in \n     coming years, you also have to believe in the CBO's cheery \n     forecast that hundreds of billion of dollars in new taxes \n     will have little or no effect on economic growth.\n       Now you don't have to be an acolyte of supply-side guru \n     Arthur Laffer to find that sort of ``static analysis'' a \n     little weird. Most Americans probably would. So, apparently, \n     did the economic team at Goldman Sachs, the old employer of \n     Robet Rubin, President Bill Clinton's second treasury \n     secretary. Thus the firm's econ wonks decided to try and \n     simulate the real world effect of letting the Bush tax cuts \n     expire at the end of 2010. Using the respected Washington \n     University Macro Model, Goldman reset the tax code to its \n     pre-Bush status, assumed all tax cuts expired, and watched \n     how the economy reacted as 2011 began. What did the firm see? \n     Well, in the first quarter of 2011 the economy dropped 3 \n     percentage points below what it would have been otherwise. \n     ``Absent a tailwind to growth from some other source,'' the \n     analysis concludes, ``this would almost surely mark the onset \n     of a recession.''\n       So actually it's CBO's economic forecast, not Bush's that \n     is overly, optimistic about future economic growth. But \n     wouldn't the Federal Reserve jump in and cut interest rates, \n     offsetting the fiscal drag of the tax hikes with easy \n     monetary policy? The Goldman Sachs experiment assumes it \n     would, but WUMM still shows the economy sinking;\n       ``In an effort to resuscitate demand, the Fed immediately \n     cuts the federal funds rate, bringing it 250 basis points \n     below the status quo level over the next year and one-half. . \n     . Despite this, output growth remains well\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\n     below trend over that period, putting downward pressure on \n     inflation as slack in the economy increases.''\n       And guess what? A recession would throw CBO's carefully \n     calculated tax revenue assumptions out the window. Indeed, \n     the CBO admits that recessions in 1981, 1990 and 2001, \n     ``resulted in significantly different budgetary outcomes than \n     CBO had projected few months before the downturns started.''\n       Of course, it's been the history of tax increases that they \n     tend not to bring in as much revenue as originally predicted. \n     President Rodham Clinton or President Obama or President \n     Edwards would likely find the same budgetary disappointment--\n     and then have to explain to an angry American public during \n     the 2012 election season why their president decided to \n     plunge the economy into a recession.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Goldman Sachs study was clearly not written by \ncheerleaders for tax relief; indeed, the authors seemed to share the \npoint of view of many in this Chamber that a cut in spending is not an \noption. The authors regard an eventual drop in consumption as a forgone \nconclusion of tax relief and equate it with the necessity to pay back \nwhat had been borrowed over the previous decade. At the very least, the \nstudy says: ``The economy suffers a lot of short-term pain.''\n  Congress needs to act to extend or make permanent tax relief enacted \nin 2001 and 2003 or we risk plunging the country into a frivolous \nrecession. I say frivolous because the recession will be the result of \nvanity on the part of those who use balancing the budget as a cover for \ntax-and-spend politics.\n  More cause for concern of the impact of tax increases comes to us \nfrom China. I am sure everyone is aware that the Shanghai Composite \nIndex lost 8.8 percent of its value this past Tuesday. According to \nvarious news reports, including a dispatch from the Associated Press, a \nfactor in the drop may have been rumors that a capital gains tax on \nstock investment was in order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an ABC NEWS article entitled ``Shanghai \nShares Rebound Nearly 4 percent'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Shanghai Shares Rebound Nearly 4 Percent\n\n                         (By Elaine Kurtenbach)\n\n       Shanghai, China.--Chinese stocks recovered Wednesday \n     following their worst plunge in a decade as regulators \n     shifted into damage control, denying rumors of plans for a 20 \n     percent capital gains tax on stock investments.\n       The Shanghai Composite Index gained 3.9 percent to 2,881.07 \n     after opening 1.3 percent lower. On Tuesday, it tumbled 8.8 \n     percent, its largest decline since Feb. 18, 1997.\n       Bullish comments in the state-controlled media appeared to \n     reassure jittery domestic investors, who account for \n     virtually all trading.\n       China will focus on ensuring financial stability and \n     security, the official Xinhua News Agency cited Premier Wen \n     Jiabao as saying in an essay due to be published in \n     Thursday's issue of the Communist Party magazine Qiushi.\n       Markets across Asia were still rattled, with many falling \n     for a second day. Japan's benchmark Nikkei Index sank 2.85 \n     percent, while stocks in the Philippines tumbled 7.9 percent. \n     Malaysian shares fell 3.3 percent, while Hong Kong's market \n     fell 2.5 percent.\n       On Tuesday, concerns about possible slowdowns in the \n     Chinese and U.S. economies sparked Wall Street's worst drop \n     since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The Dow Jones \n     industrial average lost 416 points, or 3.3 percent.\n       Analysts said they expected China's stock market to \n     stabilize and keep climbing over time although further near-\n     term declines were possible given concerns that prices may \n     have risen too precipitously in recent months.\n       Tuesday's ``sell-off does not reflect any fundamental \n     change in the outlook for China's economy,'' Yiping Huang and \n     other Citigroup economists said in a report released \n     Wednesday. ``A sharp contraction in excess liquidity that \n     would reinforce damage in the stock market remains \n     unlikely,'' it said.\n       China's big institutional investors are all state-\n     controlled and would be unlikely to sell so heavily as to \n     completely reverse gains that more than doubled share prices \n     last year. With a key Communist Party congress due in the \n     autumn, the authorities have a huge stake in keeping the \n     markets on an even keel.\n       ``They are acting now to nip a nascent bubble in the bud,'' \n     says Stephen Green, senior economist at Standard Chartered \n     Bank in Shanghai, adding that it's a challenge given \n     generally bullish sentiment and the massive amount of funds \n     available for investment.\n       ``So they have to somehow calibrate the rhetoric and policy \n     actions to keep a lid on this, while not triggering a \n     collapse,'' Green says.\n       One option is a capital gains tax on stock investments. \n     Rumors that such a tax may be enacted are thought to have \n     been one factor behind Tuesday's sell-off.\n       But the Shanghai Securities News ran a front-page report \n     denying those rumors. The newspaper, run by the official \n     Xinhua News Agency and often used to convey official \n     announcements, cited unnamed spokesmen for the Ministry of \n     Finance and State Administration of Taxation.\n       China has refrained from imposing a tax on capital gains \n     from stock investments, largely because until last year the \n     markets were languishing near five-year lows. The Shanghai \n     Securities News report cited officials saying that the \n     government had little need to impose such a measure now, \n     given that tax revenues soared by 22 percent last year.\n       The exact cause of Tuesday's decline in China was unclear, \n     given the lack of any significant negative economic or \n     corporate news.\n       Some analysts blamed profit taking following recent gains: \n     the market had hit a fresh record high on Monday, with the \n     Shanghai Composite Index closing above 3,000 for the first \n     time.\n       Others pointed to comments by former Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan, who warned in remarks to a \n     conference in Hong Kong that a recession in the U.S. was \n     ``possible'' later this year.\n       Adding to those factors was a persisting expectation that \n     China might impose further austerity measures, such as an \n     interest rate hike, to cool torrid growth: China's economy \n     grew 10.7 percent last year the fastest rise since 1995 and \n     most forecasts put growth at between 9.5 percent and 10 \n     percent this year.\n       China's markets took off after a successful round of \n     shareholding reforms helped alleviate worries over a possible \n     flood of state-held shares into the market. Efforts to clean \n     up the brokerage industry and end market abuses also helped.\n       Their confidence renewed, millions of retail investors \n     began shifting their bank savings into the markets in search \n     of higher returns last year. Strong buying by state-\n     controlled institutional investors and overseas funds also \n     helped.\n       China still limits foreigners' purchases of the yuan-\n     denominated stocks that make up the biggest share of the \n     markets, though that is gradually changing as regulators \n     allow increasing participation by so-called qualified foreign \n     institutional investors.\n       Stocks have shown unusual volatility this year, with the \n     Shanghai index notching one-day drops of 4.9 percent and 3.7 \n     percent already this year before recovering to hit new \n     records.\n       But there are limits to how far shares are allowed to drop \n     in a single trading day: total single-day gains and losses \n     are capped at 10 percent.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The same AP report notes that regulators have already \ndenied those rumors and that the Shanghai Securities News ran a front \npage report to the same effect yesterday. Incidentally, the Shanghai \nComposite Index gained 3.9 percent yesterday.\n  I think the Chinese regulator's swift debunking of rumors that a \ncapital gains tax was going to be enacted shows the negative impact \nsuch a tax could have on growing markets and expanding economies.\n  As I have said before, what is missing from the debate on extending \ntax cuts and clearly missing from the reasoning of the authors of the \nGoldman Sachs study is the option, and necessity, of reducing \nGovernment spending. The right thing to do is to let Americans keep as \nmuch of their own money as we can and not seize it from them to promote \nspecial interests, encourage high-priced lobbyists or give free rein to \nthe big city press to tell everyone else what to do.\n  It is often said by the Democratic leadership that tax cuts are not \nfree. That statement is true. Tax cuts score as revenue losses under \nour budget rules. What is equally true, if you listen to economists \nand, more importantly, the American taxpayer, is that tax increases are \nnot free as well. Taxpayers have to write a check to Uncle Sam.\n  Tax increases change taxpayer behavior. Tax increases will affect \nwork, investment, and other economic activities. From an economic \npolicy standpoint, tax increases, especially those that are used to \ncover more Government spending, have a policy cost. Tax increases are \nnot free to the taxpayers and are not free to a growing economy.\n  So I would ask that the Democrat leadership, as they draw up their \nbudget resolution, to hopefully keep this in mind. Tax increases have \nconsequences to the American taxpayer and consequences to the American \neconomy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2480-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2480-S2481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 U.S. SENTENCING COMMISSION NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his help in \nconnection with the confirmation of members to the Sentencing \nCommission. I\n\n[[Page S2481]]\n\nam glad a cloture petition turned out not to be necessitated by \nanonymous Republican opposition and delay but regret that it has taken \nso long and so much attention to follow through on this matter.\n  Last night, the Senate finally considered and confirmed the \nPresident's nomination of Beryl Howell to a second term on the U.S. \nSentencing Commission. We also proceeded with the confirmation of the \nnomination of Dabney Friedrich, a former staffer of Senator Hatch and \nassociate White House counsel.\n  Last month, the President finally sent these nominations to the \nSenate to fill preexisting vacancies on the U.S. Sentencing Commission. \nBoth these nominees were serving on the Commission, having been \nrecessed appointed by the President in the last month of the 109th \nCongress. Regrettably the White House had delayed for many months \nmaking the nominations last year. Had the President sent the Senate \nthese nominations in a timely fashion, their recess appointments would \nnot have been necessary and we could have confirmed both of these \nnominees in the last Congress.\n  The nonpartisan nature of the Sentencing Commission is preserved by \nmaking sure its membership is balanced and includes experienced \nCommissioners who stick to the merits and command the respect of both \nCongress and the Judiciary. I look forward to the President nominating \nsuch a person on the recommendation of the ranking Republican member of \nthe Judiciary Committee so that the final vacancy may be appropriately \nfilled.\n  Commissioner Howell graduated from Bryn Mawr College and Columbia \nUniversity School of Law, clerked for Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise on \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. She served with \ndistinction as a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nthe Eastern District of New York, earning a number of commendations for \nher work. She later served for almost 10 years as a member of the \nSenate Judiciary staff. She earned the respect of Senate and House \nRepublicans and Democrats. Besides now serving as a member of the \nSentencing Commission, she is also managing director and general \ncounsel of the Washington, DC, office of Stroz Friedberg, LLC, one of \nthe leading cybersecurity and forensic firms in the country.\n  Commissioner Friedrich assumes her post having served in the White \nHouse counsel's office and having previously served on Senator Hatch's \nSenate Judiciary Committee staff. I believe her husband is a political \ndeputy in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. I wish \nher well in her new position.\n  The Sentencing Commission has important work to do. Federal judges \nare still wrestling with the Booker decision, which made the Federal \nSentencing Guidelines advisory, rather than mandatory, and the \nCommission is once again preparing a report to Congress on the unjust \ndisparity of crack versus powder cocaine sentencing.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmations \nlast night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2481-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On June 4, 2002, in Cortez, CO, 16-year-old Fred Martinez, described \nas a transsexual Navajo, was brutally beaten to death by Shaun Murphy. \nMurphy received a sentence of 40 years for his crime. According to \naffidavits filed in Montezuma County Court, Murphy bragged to friends \nin the days after Martinez's slaying that he had ``beat up a fag.''\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2481-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2481-S2482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, early one October morning in 1960, Senator \nJohn F. Kennedy stood on the steps of the University of Michigan Union \nand challenged a group of students to serve their country by living and \nworking abroad. Today I rise to commemorate the service of 187,000 \nAmericans, young and old, who have met that challenge.\n  From Armenia to Zambia, Peace Corps volunteers have lived and worked \nin 139 countries around the world for the past 46 years. They act as \nambassadors of our goodwill and promote a world of peace and \nfriendship. Historically, more Peace Corps volunteers have come from \nCalifornia than any other State indeed, 25,467 Peace Corps volunteers \nhave hailed from my State. Today, I am proud to represent 768 Peace \nCorps volunteers currently working abroad.\n  In their work as teachers, business advisors, information technology \nconsultants, agriculture and environmental specialists, and health \neducators; Peace Corps volunteers have not only met the needs of the \nindividuals and communities who are their hosts, but also promoted a \nbetter understanding of Americans.\n  After almost five decades, the mission and goals of the Peace Corps \nare as vital and relevant as they were the day of its establishment. In \nan age when fear, misunderstanding, and blind prejudice can breed \naggression and hate, more than 20 percent of Peace Corps volunteers are \nworking in predominantly Muslim countries.\n  In the past 10 years, the Peace Corps has expanded to meet new \nhumanitarian challenges, sending Returned Peace Corps Volunteers to \nserve in the Crisis Corps. These extraordinary men and women have been \ndeployed to tsunami-ravaged regions in Sri Lanka and Thailand, to \nGuatemala after Hurricane Stan, and 272 Returned Peace Corps Volunteers \njoined in disaster relief efforts along the gulf coast following \nHurricane Katrina.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the Returned Peace Corps \nVolunteers who have been participating in National Peace Corps Week. By \nsharing their experiences, these Returned Peace Corps Volunteers are \nfulfilling the third goal of the Peace Corps, to ``strengthen \nAmericans' understanding about the world and its peoples.''\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I extend my \ncongratulations to the Peace Corps on the occasion of its 46th \nanniversary this week. I know that in doing so I join a countless \nnumber of past and present Peace Cops volunteers in commemorating the \nfruitful history of the organization.\n  Since the establishment of the Peace Corps over four decades ago, its \nvolunteers have served as unofficial U.S. Ambassadors, representing the \nbest of what America has to offer abroad. Their mission could not be \nmore important than it is right now, during a time when our nation is \nso misunderstood in many parts of the world. With its global presence \nand tangible impact, the Peace Corps has worked to combat \nmisperceptions about what America stands for and reaffirm American \nvalues. I have no doubt that these good deeds on behalf of others have \nmade a tremendously positive impact on the communities in which our \nPeace Corps volunteers serve.\n  I am a strong believer in investing in cross-border relationships \nthrough programs such as the Peace Corps, which places American \nvolunteers in the heart of communities throughout all corners of the \nworld. Who knows how the interaction and good works completed by Peace \nCorps volunteers will change the world as a result? Perhaps the example \nset by a Peace Corps volunteer will correct a distorted perception, or \nprevent someone from sliding into hatred and extremism. Perhaps an \nAmerican volunteer will acquire a new understanding of the needs in \nother parts of the world which will lead to a critical humanitarian \nintervention. The Peace Corps, through the impact on the community and \nthe volunteer, is a win-win investment in stability.\n  The Peace Corps has a daily direct impact by meeting the needs of \nforeign\n\n[[Page S2482]]\n\ncommunities with its volunteers serving as teachers, business advisors, \ninformation technology consultants, agriculture workers, and HIV/AIDS \neducators. Indeed, these services directly contribute to the strategic \npriorities of our national security, because addressing poverty and \npublic health issues helps promote global stability. As one of many \nexamples, today the Peace Corps volunteers are playing an important \nrole in implementing President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.\n  In recent years the Peace Corps has increased in size, in response to \na growing need for its services. I am happy to see that it has over \n7,700 volunteers working in 73 countries, and hope it continues to \nexpand its reach.\n  I am especially proud of the Minnesota volunteers who are currently \nserving around the world, of which there are currently over 200. To \nthem, and to the over 5,000 returned Minnesotan volunteers, I want to \nexpress my heartfelt thanks, for their great efforts to spread \nMinnesotan values of dedication, integrity, and hard work to another \npart of the world. Among these veterans is Mr. Robert Tschetter, the \ncurrent director of the Peace Corps and one of my constituents. I was \nhonored to help confirm Mr. Tschetter during my tenure as the chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace \nCorps and Narcotics Affairs.\n  A medieval Spanish Rabbi named Maimomedes said he believed that the \nworld is held in balance between good and evil and a single act of \ngoodness and virtue tips the balance. I believe that the actions made \nby Peace Corps volunteers all over the world work to tip the balance \ntowards good everyday. It is because of this belief that I have \nconsistently been a strong supporter of the Peace Corps. Again, I would \nlike to express my deepest admiration and best wishes to the Peace \nCorps leadership and its volunteers. Thank you for making the world a \nbetter place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2482-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2482-S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Authorized investigations may be conducted \n     by members of the Committee and/or designated Committee staff \n     members.\n\n\n                           rule 7. subpoenas\n\n       Subpoenas authorized by the Committee for the attendance of \n     witnesses or the production of memoranda, documents, records, \n     or any other material may be issued by the Chairman, the Vice \n     Chairman, or any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman, and may be served by any person designated by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman or member issuing the subpoenas. Each \n     subpoena shall have attached thereto a copy of S. Res. 400 of \n     the 94th Congress, and a copy of these rules.\n\n\n         rule 8. procedures related to the taking of testimony\n\n       8.1. Notice.--Witnesses required to appear before the \n     Committee shall be given reasonable notice and all witnesses \n     shall be furnished a copy of these Rules.\n       8.2. Oath or Affirmation.--At the direction of the Chairman \n     or Vice Chairman, testimony of witnesses shall be given under\n\n[[Page S2483]]\n\n     oath or affirmation which may be administered by any member \n     of the Committee.\n       8.3. Interrogation.--Committee interrogation shall be \n     conducted by members of the Committee and such Committee \n     staff as are authorized by the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or \n     the presiding member.\n       8.4. Counsel for the Witness.--(a) Any witness may be \n     accompanied by counsel. A witness who is unable to obtain \n     counsel may inform the Committee of such fact. If the witness \n     informs the Committee of this fact at least 24 hours prior to \n     his or her appearance before the Committee, the Committee \n     shall then endeavor to obtain voluntary counsel for the \n     witness. Failure to obtain such counsel will not excuse the \n     witness from appearing and testifying.\n       (b) Counsel shall conduct themselves in an ethical and \n     professional manner. Failure to do so shall, upon a finding \n     to that effect by a majority of the members present, subject \n     such counsel to disciplinary action which may include \n     warning, censure, removal, or a recommendation of contempt \n     proceedings.\n       (c) There shall be no direct or cross-examination by \n     counsel. However, counsel may submit in writing any question \n     he wishes propounded to his client or to any other witness \n     and may, at the conclusion of his client's testimony, suggest \n     the presentation of other evidence or the calling of other \n     witnesses. The Committee may use such questions and dispose \n     of such suggestions as it deems appropriate.\n       8.5. Statements by Witnesses.--A witness may make a \n     statement, which shall be brief and relevant, at the \n     beginning and conclusion of his or her testimony. Such \n     statements shall not exceed a reasonable period of time as \n     determined by the Chairman, or other presiding members. Any \n     witness required or desiring to make a prepared or written \n     statement for the record of the proceedings shall file a \n     paper and electronic copy with the Clerk of the Committee, \n     and insofar as practicable and consistent with the notice \n     given, shall do so at least 48 hours in advance of his or her \n     appearance before the Committee.\n       8.6. Objections and Rulings.--Any objection raised by a \n     witness or counsel shall be ruled upon by the Chairman or \n     other presiding member, and such ruling shall be the ruling \n     of the Committee unless a majority of the Committee present \n     overrules the ruling of the chair.\n       8.7. Inspection and Correction.--All witnesses testifying \n     before the Committee shall be given a reasonable opportunity \n     to inspect, in the office of the Committee, the transcript of \n     their testimony to determine whether such testimony was \n     correctly transcribed. The witness may be accompanied by \n     counsel. Any corrections the witness desires to make in the \n     transcript shall be submitted in writing to the Committee \n     within five days from the date when the transcript was made \n     available to the witness. Corrections shall be limited to \n     grammar and minor editing, and may not be made to change the \n     substance of the testimony. Any questions arising with \n     respect to such corrections shall be decided by the Chairman. \n     Upon request, those parts of testimony given by a witness in \n     executive session which are subsequently quoted or made part \n     of a public record shall be made available to that witness at \n     his or her expense.\n       8.8. Requests to Testify.--The Committee will consider \n     requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before \n     the Committee. A person who believes that testimony or other \n     evidence presented at a public hearing, or any comment made \n     by a Committee member or a member of the Committee staff, may \n     tend to affect adversely his or her reputation may request to \n     appear personally before the Committee to testify on his or \n     her own behalf, or may file a sworn statement of facts \n     relevant to the testimony, evidence, or comment, or may \n     submit to the Chairman proposed questions in writing for the \n     cross-examination of other witnesses. The Committee shall \n     take such action as it deems appropriate.\n       8.9. Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person \n     be cited for contempt of Congress or that a subpoena be \n     otherwise enforced shall be forwarded to the Senate unless \n     and until the Committee has, upon notice to all its members, \n     met and considered the recommendation, afforded the person an \n     opportunity to state in writing or in person why he or she \n     should not be held in contempt or that the subpoena be \n     otherwise enforced, and agreed by majority vote of the \n     Committee to forward such recommendation to the Senate.\n       8.10. Release of Name of Witness.--Unless authorized by the \n     Chairman, the name of any witness scheduled to be heard by \n     the Committee shall not be released prior to, or after, his \n     or her appearance before the Committee. Upon authorization by \n     the Chairman to release the name of a witness under this \n     paragraph, the Vice Chairman shall be notified of such \n     authorization as soon as practicable thereafter. No name \n     of any witness shall be released if such release would \n     disclose classified information, unless authorized under \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress or Rule 9.7.\n\n\n   rule 9. procedures for handling classified or committee sensitive \n                                material\n\n       9.1. Committee staff offices shall operate under strict \n     precautions.

Before entering the Committee \n     office space all persons shall identify themselves and \n     provide identification as requested.\n       9.2. Classified documents and material shall be stored in \n     authorized security containers located within the Committee's \n     Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Copying, \n     duplicating, or removing from the Committee offices of such \n     documents and other materials is prohibited except as is \n     necessary for the conduct of Committee business, and in \n     conformity with Rule 10.3 hereof. All classified documents or \n     materials removed from the Committee offices for such \n     authorized purposes must be returned to the Committee's SCIF \n     for overnight storage.\n       9.3. ``Committee sensitive'' means information or material \n     that pertains to the confidential business or proceedings of \n     the Select Committee on Intelligence, within the meaning of \n     paragraph 5 of Rule XXIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     and is: (1) in the possession or under the control of the \n     Committee; (2) discussed or presented in an executive session \n     of the Committee; (3) the work product of a Committee member \n     or staff member; (4) properly identified or marked by a \n     Committee member or staff member who authored the document; \n     or (5) designated as such by the Chairman and Vice Chairman \n     (or by the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director acting \n     on their behalf). Committee sensitive documents and materials \n     that are classified shall be handled in the same manner as \n     classified documents and material in Rule 9.2. Unclassified \n     committee sensitive documents and materials shall be stored \n     in a manner to protect against unauthorized disclosure.\n       9.4. Each member of the Committee shall at all times have \n     access to all papers and other material received from any \n     source. The Staff Director shall be responsible for the \n     maintenance, under appropriate security procedures, of a \n     document control and accountability registry which will \n     number and identify all classified papers and other \n     classified materials in the possession of the Committee, and \n     such registry shall be available to any member of the \n     Committee.\n       9.5. Whenever the Select Committee on Intelligence makes \n     classified material available to any other committee of the \n     Senate or to any member of the Senate not a member of the \n     Committee, such material shall be accompanied by a verbal or \n     written notice to the recipients advising of their \n     responsibility to protect such materials pursuant to section \n     8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. The Security Director \n     of the Committee shall ensure that such notice is provided \n     and shall maintain a written record identifying the \n     particular information transmitted and the committee or \n     members of the Senate receiving such information.\n       9.6. Access to classified information supplied to the \n     Committee shall be limited to those Committee staff members \n     with appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know, as \n     determined by the Committee, and, under the Committee's \n     direction, the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director.\n       9.7. No member of the Committee or of the Committee staff \n     shall disclose, in whole or in part or by way of summary, the \n     contents of any classified or committee sensitive papers, \n     materials, briefings, testimony, or other information in the \n     possession of the Committee to any other person, except as \n     specified in this rule. Committee members and staff do not \n     need prior approval to disclose classified or committee \n     sensitive information to persons in the Executive branch, the \n     members and staff the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, and the members and staff of the Senate, \n     provided that the following conditions are met: (1) for \n     classified information, the recipients of the information \n     must possess appropriate security clearances (or have access \n     to the information by virtue of their office); (2) for all \n     information, the recipients of the information must have a \n     need-to-know such information for an official governmental \n     purpose; and (3) for all information, the Committee members \n     and staff who provide the information must be engaged in the \n     routine performance of Committee legislative or oversight \n     duties. Otherwise, classified and committee sensitive \n     information may only be disclosed to persons outside the \n     Committee (to include any congressional committee, Member of \n     Congress, congressional staff, or specified non-governmental \n     persons who support intelligence activities) with the prior \n     approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, \n     or the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director acting on \n     their behalf, consistent with the requirements that \n     classified information may only be disclosed to persons with \n     appropriate security clearances and a need-to-know such \n     information for an official governmental purpose. Public \n     disclosure of classified information in the possession of the \n     Committee may only be authorized in accordance with Section 8 \n     of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.\n       9.8. Failure to abide by Rule 9.7 shall constitute grounds \n     for referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. Prior to a \n     referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400, the Chairman and Vice Chairman \n     shall notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader.\n       9.9. Before the Committee makes any decision regarding the \n     disposition of any testimony, papers, or other materials \n     presented to it, the Committee members shall have a \n     reasonable opportunity to examine all pertinent testimony, \n     papers, and other materials that have been obtained by the \n     members of the Committee or the Committee staff.\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\n       9.10. Attendance of persons outside the Committee at closed \n     meetings of the Committee shall be kept at a minimum and \n     shall be limited to persons with appropriate security \n     clearance and a need-to-know the information under \n     consideration for the execution of their official duties. The \n     Security Director of the Committee may require that notes \n     taken at such meetings by any person in attendance shall be \n     returned to the secure storage area in the Committee's \n     offices at the conclusion of such meetings, and may be made \n     available to the department, agency, office, committee, or \n     entity concerned only in accordance with the security \n     procedures of the Committee.\n\n\n                             RULE 10. STAFF\n\n       10.1. For purposes of these rules, Committee staff includes \n     employees of the Committee, consultants to the Committee, or \n     any other person engaged by contract or otherwise to perform \n     services for or at the request of the Committee. To the \n     maximum extent practicable, the Committee shall rely on its \n     full-time employees to perform all staff functions. No \n     individual may be retained as staff of the Committee or to \n     perform services for the Committee unless that individual \n     holds appropriate security clearances.\n       10.2. The appointment of Committee staff shall be approved \n     by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or, at the \n     initiative of both or either be confirmed by a majority vote \n     of the Committee.

The members of the Committee staff shall not discuss \n     either the substance or procedure of the work of the \n     Committee with any person not a member of the Committee or \n     the Committee staff for any purpose or in connection with any \n     proceeding, judicial or otherwise, either during their tenure \n     as a member of the Committee staff or at any time thereafter, \n     except as directed by the Committee in accordance with \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the \n     provisions of these rules, or in the event of the termination \n     of the Committee, in such a manner as may be determined by \n     the Senate.\n       10.6. No member of the Committee staff shall be employed by \n     the Committee unless and until such a member of the Committee \n     staff agrees in writing, as a condition of employment, to \n     abide by the conditions of the nondisclosure agreement \n     promulgated by the Select Committee on Intelligence, pursuant \n     to Section 6 of S.

Further, any illegal use of \n     controlled substances by a member of the Committee staff, \n     within the workplace or otherwise, shall result in \n     reconsideration of the security clearance of any such staff \n     member and may constitute grounds for termination of \n     employment with the Committee.\n       10.11. All personnel actions affecting the staff of the \n     Committee shall be made free from any discrimination based on \n     race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, \n     or disability.\n\n\n              rule 11. preparation for committee meetings\n\n       11.1.

Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the \nDignity for Wounded Warriors Act. While reading the recent news reports \nregarding the situation at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital, I was \nincensed when I discovered that our brave men and women who have risked \ntheir lives in service to our country are currently convalescing under \nconditions that are nothing less than disgraceful--and, frankly, \ndisrespectful of all who so honorably wear our Nation's uniform. This \nabomination is a far cry from the timeless words of President Theodore \nRoosevelt, who once said that ``a man who is good enough to shed his \nblood for his country is good enough to be given a square deal \nafterwards.''\n  I applaud Senators Obama and McCaskill for swiftly responding to \nthese shameful revelations by introducing this legislation at a time \nwhen more than 600,000 courageous service men and women have returned \nfrom combat in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In the past, Senator Obama \nand I have worked in a bipartisan manner to bolster the military's \nability to detect and treat traumatic brain injury, reduce the claims \nat the Veterans Benefits Administration, VBA, and most recently, we \nhave fought to improve the ability of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to provide Congress with an accurate assessment of returning \nveterans health care and benefits needs. I also appreciate Senator \nMcCaskill's advocacy on this issue, and I look forward to working with \nher in the future.\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\n  During the past few weeks, the Washington Post has reported in \nscrupulous detail the dire and startling conditions at recuperation \nfacilities used by Walter Reed Army Medical Center--the very facility \nreplete with moldy walls, broken elevators, bug infestation, a lack of \nsupport programs, and general disrepair. These confines are not even \nhabitable, not to mention acceptable, in any way, shape or form for the \nprovision of health care to America's finest. Above all, such degrading \nmedical quarters ultimately send the wrong message to our troops who \nhave risked their lives in defense of our country that somehow they are \nfit and capable enough to serve us but not enough for us to serve them. \nAlthough the Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital has remained the \npreeminent health facility for wounded and recovering service members \never since the admittance of its first patients on May 1, 1909, these \nrecent news reports have uncovered blatant defects in U.S. military \nhealth facilities that must be fixed immediately.\n  In order to ensure that these stalwart Americans receive the \ntreatment they have earned and that is unquestionably well deserved, \nthis legislation will establish stringent standards for military \noutpatient housing, requiring that concomitant dormitories match the \nexisting services standard for Active-Duty barracks, and mandating that \nall requests for repairs be completed within 15 days or alternate \nhousing must be offered. Additionally, recent reports have revealed \nWalter Reed Army Medical Hospital's lack of support counseling to \nassist troops and their families in times of need. To alleviate these \nconcerns, our legislation will require an emergency medical technician, \nEMT, and a crisis counselor at all outpatient residences, while \ncreating an inspection team to ensure that high-level military \nofficials are aware of all problems occurring at medical facilities, \nincluding those related to personnel and maintenance.\n  Furthermore, the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act will help solve \nrecent problems regarding the overwhelming workloads for military \ncaseworkers, which have, unfortunately, left countless service members \nhelpless. This legislation will not only increase the number of \ncaseworkers at military outpatient facilities but will establish an \ninterim ratio of one caseworker and one supervising noncommissioned \nofficer for each 20 recovering service members, while requiring staff \ntraining for the identification of mental illness and suicide \nprevention.\n  This legislation will also address the processing delays for troops \nwho seek a determination for their military status and disability \nlevel, which on average, takes as long as 7 months. This legislation \nwould bring the Physical Disability Evaluation System under one command \nin order to reduce lengthy bureaucratic delays that have left even the \nmost severely injured service members without a health determination \nfor unnecessary lengths of time.\n  Family members also carry a large burden for the sacrifices made by \ntheir loved ones in uniform. In order to ease the burdens of the health \ncare process for these families, our legislation creates two 24-hour \ncrisis counseling and family assistance hotlines and requires the \ncreation of a single manual for outpatient care procedures, which will \nallow families to access all of the information they need to help care \nfor their loved one. Sadly, family members are often forced to decide \nbetween attending to their loved one or keeping their job--a decision \nthat no family member of our courageous troops should ever have to \nmake. Therefore, this legislation provides Federal protections for the \njobs of family members who are caring for a recovering service member, \nwhile extending medical care to family members who are living at \nmilitary treatment facilities.\n  And finally, one of the underlying concerns of the revelations at \nWalter Reed Army Medical Hospital was the lack of accountability and \noversight at a facility which houses thousands of heroic Americans. \nThis legislation would create a Wounded Warrior Oversight Board \nappointed by congressional leadership who will supervise the \nimplementation of this legislation's provisions and serve as an \nadvocate for all recovering service members in the future.\n  The obligation of this country to its veterans is sacred and solemn \nand one that must be fulfilled every day. We should strive to put into \naction the words of President Lincoln that we must ``care for him who \nshall have borne the battle . . .'' Since the attacks of September 11, \nmillions of valorous American men and women have fearlessly and \nhonorably answered the call to service. Congress must now do its duty \nand everything in its power to vigorously extend the finest medical \ntreatment and care possible to troops upon their return--attention that \nis worthy of their tremendous and immeasurable contributions to us all.\n  Once again, I am pleased to join Senators Obama and McCaskill in \nintroducing the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act because I believe it \nis crucial for Congress to provide our Nation's veterans with a \nguarantee that they will never have to worry about dilapidated living \nconditions in military hospitals ever again, and I urge my colleagues \nto voice their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2485-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAN CREGER\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a hard \nworking, respected young man, Mr. Dan Creger. Dan is from Casper, WY, \nand has proven that in spite of his disabilities, one man can have a \ngreat impact.\n  Dan was born with arthrogryposis, a condition that causes multiple \njoint problems and limits the range of motion of a joint. As a result \nof this disease, Dan has spent most of his life in a wheelchair. \nDespite his disability, Dan refuses to be held back, relying not on \npublic assistance but rather on his determined spirit and the support \nof friends and family to achieve his daily successes.\n  Dan worked for the Bureau of Land Management for 20 years. Recently \nthe BLM honored his service by presenting him with the Honor Award for \nSuperior Service. Casper Field Office Manger, Jim Murkin said, ``Dan is \na Go to Guy! He is someone who you can depend on to get a job done. He \nalways wants to stay busy. He hates doing nothing. He is a great asset \nto the BLM.''\n  Four years ago Dan began working at the National Historical \nInterpretive Trails Center in Casper. The director of the center, Jude \nCarino, says that Dan ``always has a smile. He always has good things \nto say about people, and he doesn't complain.'' At the center Dan \ngreets visitors, answers questions and leads tours for schools and \nother organized groups. In 2006 he assisted 8,000 visitors, and guided \nnearly 2,000 schoolchildren through the facility.\n  A volunteer for the National Historical Interpretive Trails Center \nsaid, ``I have learned a lot from Dan in how to guide guests through \nthe center. He is a wealth of knowledge and has a great sense of \nhumor.''\n  Dan's life was thrown another curve when last summer he was diagnosed \nwith esophageal cancer. But through it all he continues to have a \npositive attitude. Dan said that when he was first told about the \ncancer he felt both sadness and anger, but soon he decided that this \nwas just another challenge for him to deal with. He said, ``I've tried \nto go on with my life and take it day by day.''\n  A friend of Mr. Creger summed it up best when he said, ``In my eyes, \nDan is a man of courage that stands 6 feet tall. He lives his life as \nany productive member of society and pushes aside any thought of pity \nfor himself. He doesn't let his physical limits or the threat of cancer \nkeep him from achieving his goals in life. In this way, Dan is better \nthan many men who face lesser challenges in life. I am proud to know \nDan and be his friend.''\n  It is obvious that Dan is a good, hard-working man who refuses to let \nlife's challenges stand in his way. Dan Creger is an inspiration to all \nof us, and I am honored to share his story.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2485-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2485-S2486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING EARL B. OLSON\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, we take this floor at different times for \ndifferent reasons, to debate bills and talk about the condition of our \ncountry and its future. At times, we tend to exaggerate the importance \nof the laws we pass to the progress of our society. I say that because \nthere is no law to make people do the most important things: love their \nfamilies, sacrifice for their communities, or create a legacy that will \nlast for generations.\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\n  Today I rise to honor a great man who did those things and changed \nlife on the Minnesota prairie for thousands of people who maybe never \neven heard his name. Today I want to pay tribute to the life and legacy \nof Earl B. Olson, an innovator for Minnesota agriculture, a leader in \nthe Nation's turkey industry, and a man of great faith.\n  There is a passage in the Book of Isaiah that truly captures his \nlife. In the midst of difficult times for Israel, it talks about a \nfuture day of blessing when God will:\n\n     .  .  . bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, \n     the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of \n     praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called \n     oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display \n     of his splendor.\n\n  If ever there was an ``oak of righteousness,'' it was Earl Olson, who \nbrought beauty, gladness, and praise to the hearts of many.\n  Earl Olson founded the Jennie-O Turkey Store in 1949. At that time, \nthe Minnesota turkey industry was a tiny fraction of what it is today. \nCurrently, Jennie-O is the largest turkey company in the United States, \nwith Minnesota leading the Nation in turkey production.\n  Born on May 8, 1915, Earl was the son of Swedish immigrants. He grew \nup on a farm outside of Murdock, MN, and attended the West Central \nSchool of Agriculture in Morris, MN, graduating in 1932.\n  Earl's first job, at the age of 17, was at the Murdock Cooperative \nCreamery. Within 1 year, he became the manager of Swift Falls Creamery.\n  As the story has been told, one day a woman came into the Swift Falls \nCreamery to purchase some ice. As Earl was chopping away at a small \nblock of ice, another employee spilled 100 gallons of scalding hot \nwater on him, burning much of his body and sending him to the hospital. \nFortunately, the company had health insurance and Earl was compensated \nwith $1,000. With this money, Earl began his empire by purchasing 300 \nturkeys. After earning a dollar for each turkey, Earl soon began \npurchasing more. Fifteen years later, Earl found himself selling a half \nmillion turkeys annually. By 1970, Jennie-O turkeys were being sold \nacross the entire Nation. Earl B. Olson saw the impossible as an \nopportunity; he turned a tragedy into a success.\n  Faith was always a central part in the life of Earl Olson. When Earl \nwas young, he and his family were founding members of the Bethesda \nLutheran Church. Earl was later a member of Vinje Lutheran Church and \nhelped lead the church's efforts in building a new facility. Throughout \nhis life, his generosity helped countless troubled youth and prison \ninmates find their path to a better life. He always found time and \nresources to help people in their time of need.\n  Earl undertook many leading roles in the turkey industry. He served \nas the president of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association, director \nof the National Turkey Federation, and director of the National Poultry \nand Egg Association.\n  This past spring, I was privileged to have lunch with Earl. Even at \nthe age of 90, I found him sharp and forward-looking. We had an \nengaging conversation about the future of the Minnesota turkey industry \nand the health of the Minnesota agricultural economy. It was an \ninspiration to still see the passion in his heart.\n  Today, Jennie-O Turkey employs nearly 7,000 people and creates more \nthan 1,500 products. Minnesota has been truly blessed to have a \nvisionary leader like Earl B. Olson live in Minnesota and work to make \nour State a better place.\n  America has many assets: abundant natural resources, good systems of \nhealth and education, and a great democratic tradition of the rule of \nlaw. We can never forget though, that part of our greatness comes from \nthe ``oaks of righteousness'' among us. I am thankful to have known \none: Earl B. Olson, who helped make Minnesota great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2486-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       IN MEMORY OF DEANNE STONE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I speak to the memory of \nDeanne Stone of Framingham, MA, a dear friend of mine who passed away \non Sunday, February 4, at the age of 67. I am deeply saddened by \nDeanne's death and will keep her friends and family in my thoughts and \nprayers during this difficult time.\n  Those of us who were lucky enough to know Deanne could not help but \nbe touched by her kind and generous spirit. Throughout the town of \nFramingham, where she lived for 46 years after marrying her husband \nHarvey, she was known for being willing to help anyone who asked. Mr. \nStone recently told the Boston Globe that one young man recently \napproached him to tell him that whenever he needed help with a school \nproject, he knew that Mrs. Stone would be the best person to whom to \ngo.\n  In addition to always being willing to help her friends and \nneighbors, Deanne was also involved with many philanthropic efforts. \nDeeply inspired by her Jewish faith, Deanne believed in the power of \nindividuals to make a difference through community service. To this \nend, she worked for numerous charitable organizations, developing a \nreputation as a dedicated and prodigious fundraiser. Throughout her \ncareer, Deanne worked for both the Combined Jewish Philanthropies of \nGreater Boston and B'nai B'rith International, for which she served as \nregional director for New England.\n  Deanne was also deeply involved with various educational \norganizations. She worked with both the Maimonides Jewish Day School in \nBrookline, MA, and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. She \nalso worked with the Foundation for Children's Books, a Boston-based \norganization dedicated to promoting literacy among young children in \nthe hope of instilling in them a love of reading and learning. Deanne \nwas inspired to get involved with this organization while visiting \nschools in Roxbury, MA. Deanne would interact with the students, be \namazed at how intelligent they all were, and wondered why many of them \nwere not succeeding in the classroom. She believed that if these young \npeople could be taught to love reading at the earliest age possible, \nthey might gain a sense of discovery that would inspire them to achieve \nacademically.\n  Such a dedication toward education is not surprising, coming from \nsomeone who was as dedicated a student as Deanne. While attending \nWeaver High School in Hartford, CT, where she was born and raised, \nDeanne was involved in numerous extracurricular activities, including a \nstint as editor of the high school's newspaper. Even with so much on \nher plate, she was still valedictorian of her high school class in \n1957. Five years later, she graduated from the prestigious Brandeis \nUniversity.\n  Mr. President, when looking back at the life of a person as warm and \naltruistic as Deanne Stone, who affected so many people in such a \npositive way, it is excruciatingly difficult to find the words to sum \nit up, while also doing Deanne justice. Be that as it may, I believe \nDeanne's sister, Barbara Gordon, another dear friend of mine, put it \nbest when she wrote in a letter that was read aloud at Deanne's funeral \nthat ``The world will be emptier without my sister Deanne, but the \nworld is a better place for her having been in it for 67 years!'' I \ncouldn't have put it better myself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2486-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2486-S2487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 556.

A bill to amend title 4, United States Code, to authorize the \nGovernor of a State, territory, or possession of the United States to \norder that the National flag be flown at half-staff in that State, \nterritory, or possession in the event of the death of a member of the \nArmed Forces from that State, territory, or possession who dies while \nserving on active duty; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, every day across our Nation, families, \nfriends, and entire communities mourn the loss of fallen soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines. Michigan has lost 130 heroes in the wars \nin Iraq an Afghanistan. One of the most powerful ways we can honor \nthose who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country is to fly \nthe flag they fought under at half-staff.\n  At times during the course of these wars, governors around the \ncountry have issued proclamations for State agencies and residents to \nlower our Nation's flag to honor fallen service members from their \nStates. Many Federal agencies in those States comply with such \nproclamations, but some have not. To a family member, the effect can be \nthat the Federal Government appears not to be paying the proper respect \nto their loved one.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that would prevent this situation \nby giving governors the explicit authority to order the Nation's flag \nlowered to half staff when a member of the Armed Forces from their \nState dies while serving on active duty. It would also require Federal \nagencies in that State to lower their flags consistent with a \ngovernors' proclamation. Congressman Bart Stupak is introducing \nidentical legis1ation in the House of Representatives.\n  One of my greatest honors as the chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee is to spend time with our troops, and they are as \ncourageous, honorable, and capable a fighting force as the world has \never known. These men and women have made a commitment to protect our \nNation. We need to make an equally strong commitment to honor them when \nthey make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. We owe our fallen \nsoldiers, their families, and their communities a unified showing of \nrespect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, and \n        Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 721. A bill to allow travel between the United States and Cuba; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Freedom \nto Travel to Cuba Act with Senator Dorgan and a number of Senators. \nThis legislation addresses only the travel provisions of our Cuba \npolicy.\n  The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act is very straightforward. It states \nthat the President should not prohibit, either directly or indirectly, \ntravel to or from Cuba by United States citizens.\n  I have had the opportunity to watch what has happened with Cuba \nthrough the years and I am reminded of something my dad used to say--if \nyou keep on doing what you have always been doing, you are going to \nwind up getting what you already got. That has been the situation with \nthe United States policy on Cuba. We have been trying the same thing \nfor over 40 years, and our strategy has not worked. I am suggesting a \nchange to get more people in Cuba to increase the dialogue.\n  Most of us know that Fidel Castro's health is not good and that he \nceded power to his brother Raul last year. I have heard arguments that \nnow is not the time to change our policy toward Cuba, and that by \nchanging policy, we could strengthen Raul's grip on the nation. This is \nthe same argument we have been hearing for the last 40 years, simply a \nnew verse.\n  When we stop Cuban-Americans from bringing financial assistance to \ntheir families in Cuba, end the people-to-people exchanges, and stop \nthe sale of agricultural and medicinal products to Cuba, we are not \nhurting the Cuban government--we are hurting the Cuban people. We are \nfurther diminishing their faith and trust in the United States and \nreducing the strength of the ties that bind the people of our two \ncountries.\n  If we allow travel to Cuba, if we increase trade and dialogue, we \ntake away the Cuban government's ability to blame the hardships of the \nCuban people on the United States. In a very real sense, the more we \nwork to improve the lives of the Cuban people, the more we will reduce \nthe level and the tone of the rhetoric used against us by the Cuban \ngovernment.\n  It is time for a different policy--one that goes further than \nembargoes and replaces a restrictive and confusing travel policy with a \nnew one that will more effectively help us to achieve our goal of \nsharing democratic ideas with the people of Cuba.\n  The bill we are introducing today makes real change in our Cuba \ntravel policy toward that will lead to real change for the people of \nCuba. What better way to let the Cuban people know of our concern for \ntheir plight than for them to hear it from their friends and extended \nfamily from the United States. Let them hear it from the American \npeople who will go there. The people of this country are our best \nambassadors and we should let them show the people of Cuba what we as a \nnation are all about. If we want to give the Cuban people real \nknowledge of the truth about America, we need to have Americans go \nthere to share it.\n  Unilateral sanctions stop not just the flow of goods, but the flow of \nideas--ideas of freedom and democracy are the keys to positive change \nin any nation. The rest of the world is not doing what we are doing. \nCountries around the world are trading with Cuba, investing in Cuba, \nand allowing their citizens to visit Cuba. China, Venezuela, and Iran \nare becoming the largest investors on the island. These nations are in \na position to directly influence the future of Cuba. Americans are \nnowhere to be found.\n  Keeping the door closed and yelling at the Castro government on the \nother side does nothing to spread democracy and does nothing to help \nthe people of Cuba. Let us do something, let us open the door and talk \nto the Cuban people. I encourage all of my colleagues to take a look at \nthis legislation and join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\n  S. 722. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior and the \nSecretary of Agriculture to jointly conduct a study of certain land \nadjacent to the Walnut Canyon National Monument in the State of \nArizona; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Kyl \nin reintroducing legislation to authorize a special resources and land \nmanagement study for lands adjacent to the Walnut Canyon National \nMonument in Arizona. The study is intended to evaluate a range of \nmanagement options for public lands adjacent to the monument to ensure \nadequate protection of the canyon's cultural and natural resources. A \nsimilar bill was introduced last Congress and received a hearing in the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee on \nNational Parks. The bill being introduced today reflects suggested \nchanges of that Subcommittee and includes language that met their \napproval. I am grateful for the input of the members of the \nSubcommittee and their staff.\n  For several years, local communities adjacent to the Walnut Canyon \nNational Monument have debated whether the land surrounding the \nmonument would be best protected from future development under \nmanagement of the U.S. Forest Service or the National Park Service. The \nCoconino County Board and the Flagstaff City Council have passed \nresolutions concluding that the preferred method to determine what is \nbest for the land surrounding Walnut Canyon National Monument is by \nhaving a Federal study conducted. The recommendations from such a study \nwould help to resolve the question of future management and whether \nexpanding the monument's boundaries could complement current public and \nmultiple-use needs.\n  The legislation also would direct the Secretary of the Interior and \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to provide recommendations for management \noptions for maintenance of the public uses and protection of resources \nof the study area.\n  This legislation would provide a mechanism for determining the \nmanagement options tor one of Arizona's high uses scenic areas and \nprotect the natural and cultural resources of this incredibly beautiful \nmonument. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nMcCain introducing the Walnut Canyon Study Act of 2007. I cosponsored \nsimilar legislation in the last Congress. That legislation had a \nfavorable hearing in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nUnfortunately, we were unable to enact it before the Congress ended.\n  The bill is simple. It directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the \nSecretary of the Interior, utilizing a third-party consultant, to \nconduct jointly a study of approximately 31,000 acres surrounding \nWalnut Canyon National Monument. The purpose of this study is to help \nthe land managers ascertain the best long-term management strategy for \nthese surrounding lands in order to protect the natural, cultural, and \nrecreational values. I want to emphasize that adding these acres to the \nmonument is not the end goal of this study.\n  As stated, the study area consists of approximately 31,000 acres. \nApproximately 25,000 acres are currently managed by the Forest Service \nthrough the Land Resource Management Plan for the Coconino National \nForest. The plan was amended in early 2003 with local input to close \nthe area to motorized access and remove the land encircling the \nmonument from consideration for sale or exchange. The plan, as amended, \nis under revision. The remaining acres are comprised of State trust \nland managed by the State Lands Department and the Walnut Canyon \nNational Monument itself, which is managed by the National Park \nService. A small number of acres, about 200, are private land. That \nprivate land is already subject to the Coconino County and the \nFlagstaff City Council-approved Flagstaff-area Regional Land Use and \nTransportation Plan, RLUTP, which restricts development within the \nstudy area.\n  This legislation is the product of extensive public input that \nincluded State and local officials, Federal agencies, and local \ncitizens who use the land surrounding the monument. This public \nparticipation highlighted the core of the debate: how can we best \nprotect the natural and cultural resources in the area while continuing \nthe multiple-use management in a way that has stability and permanence. \nI hope that this independent study will help answer that important \nquestion. I urge my colleagues to approve the bill at the earliest \npossible date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 725. A bill to amend the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention \nand Control Act of 1990 to reauthorize and improve that Act; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, my colleague from Maine, Senator \nCollins and I are very pleased to introduce the National Aquatic \nInvasive Species Act of 2007. This bill, which reauthorizes the \nNonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, takes a \nComprehensive approach towards addressing aquatic nuisance species to \nprotect the Nation's aquatic ecosystems. Invasive species are not a new \nproblem for this country, but what is so important about this bill is \nthat it takes a comprehensive approach toward the problem of aquatic \ninvasive species rather than just focusing on species after they are \nestablished and a nuisance. The bill deals with the prevention of new \nintroductions of species, the screening of live aquatic organisms \nimported into the country, the rapid response to new invasions before \nthey become established, and the research to implement the provisions \nof this bill.\n  More than 6,500 non-indigenous invasive species have been introduced \ninto the United States and have become established, self-sustaining \npopulations. These species--from microorganisms to mollusks, from \npathogens to plants, from insects to fish to animals--typically \nencounter few, if any, natural enemies in their new environments and \noften wreak havoc on native species. Aquatic nuisance species threaten \nbiodiversity nationwide, especially in the Great Lakes.\n  In fact, the aquatic nuisance species became a major issue for \nCongress back the late eighties when the zebra mussel was released into \nthe Great Lakes. The Great Lakes still have zebra mussels, and now, \nmore than 20 States are fighting to control them. They have traveled \ndown the Mississippi River, then up the Arkansas River over to \nOklahoma, and zebra mussels have been found out even in Nevada and \nCalifornia. From 1993 to 2003, rapidly multiplying zebra mussels caused \n$3 billion in damage to the Great Lakes region. Industry and \nmunicipalities spend millions to keep water pipes from becoming clogged \nwith zebra mussels. And that is just the economic impact that one \nspecies has caused.\n  Zebra mussels were carried over from the Mediterranean to the Great \nLakes in the ballast tanks of ships. The leading pathway for aquatic \ninvasive species was and still is maritime commerce.\n  Most invasive species are contained in the water that ships use for \nballast to maintain trim and stability. There are over 180 aquatic \ninvasive species in the Great Lakes. Some of the more notorious aquatic \ninvaders such as the zebra mussel and round goby were introduced into \nthe Great Lakes when ships pulled into port and discharged their \nballast water. In addition to ballast water, aquatic invaders can also \nattach themselves to ships' hulls and anchor chains.\n  Because of the impact that the zebra mussel had in the Great Lakes, \nCongress passed legislation in 1990 and 1996 that has reduced, but not \neliminated, the threat of new invasions by requiring ballast water \nmanagement for ships entering the Great Lakes. Today, there is a \nmandatory ballast water management program in the Great Lakes, and the \nCoast Guard recently turned the voluntary ballast water exchange \nreporting requirement into a mandatory ballast water exchange program \nfor all of our coasts. The current law requires that ships entering the \nGreat Lakes must exchange their ballast water, seal their ballast tanks \nor use alternative treatment that is ``as effective as ballast water \nexchange.'' Unfortunately, alternative treatments have not been fully \ndeveloped and widely tested on ships because the developers of ballast \ntechnology do not know what standard\n\n[[Page S2492]]\n\nthey are trying to achieve. This obstacle is serious because \nultimately, only on-board ballast water treatment will adequately \nreduce the threat of new aquatic nuisance species being introduced \nthrough ballast water.\n  Our bill addresses this problem by setting a ballast discharge \nstandard. After 2011, all ships that enter any U.S. port after \noperating outside the Exclusive Economic Zone of 200 miles will be \nrequired to use a ballast water treatment technology that meets the \nballast technology standard. This standard is based on the standard \nproposed by the International Maritime Organization but is more \nprotective of our waters by a factor of 100. The standard would ensure \nthat ships discharge water that has less than 1 living organism that is \ngreater than 50 micrometers per 10 cubic meters of water. If the Coast \nGuard determines in 2010 that technology is not available that can meet \nthis standard, then the Coast Guard and EPA would establish a standard \nfor ballast water management based on the best performance available \nthat exceeds the international standard. Technology vendors and the \nmaritime industry will know what standard they should be striving to \nachieve and when they will be expected to achieve it.\n  I understand that ballast water technologies are being researched, \nand some are currently being tested on-board ships. The range of \ntechnologies includes ultraviolet lights, filters, chemicals, \ndeoxygenation, ozone, and several others. Each of these technologies \nhas its own merits, and each has a different price tag attached to it. \nThis bill will not overburden the maritime industry with an expensive \nrequirement to install technology because the market for technology to \nmeet a domestic and an international standard is evolving into a \ncompetitive market, and that competition will provide affordable \ntechnology.\n  Technology will always be evolving, and we hope that affordable \ntechnology will become available that completely eliminates the risk of \nnew introductions. Therefore, it is important that the Coast Guard \nregularly review and revise the standard so that it reflects what the \nbest technology currently available is.\n  There are other important provisions of the bill that also address \nprevention. For instance, the bill encourages the Coast Guard to \nconsult with Canada, Mexico, and other countries in developing \nguidelines to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance \nspecies. The Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force is also charged with \nconducting a pathway analysis to identify other high risk pathways for \nintroduction of nuisance species and implement management strategies to \nreduce those introductions. And this legislation, establishes a process \nto screen live organisms entering the country for the first time for \nnon-research purposes.\n  Organisms believed to be invasive would be imported based on \nconditions that prevent them from becoming a nuisance. Such a screening \nprocess might have prevented such species as the Snakehead, which has \nestablished itself in the Potomac River here in the DC area, from being \nimported.\n  The third title of this bill addresses the early detection of new \ninvasions and the rapid response to invasions as well as the control of \naquatic nuisance species that do establish themselves. If fully funded, \nthis bill will provide a rapid response fund for states to implement \nemergency strategies when outbreaks occur. The bill requires the Army \nCorps of Engineers to construct and operate the Chicago Ship and \nSanitary Canal project which includes the construction of a second \ndispersal barrier to keep species like the Asian carp from migrating up \nthe Mississippi through the Canal into the Great Lakes. Equally \nimportant, this barrier will prevent the migration of invasive species \nin the Great Lakes from proceeding into the Mississippi system.\n  Lastly, the bill authorizes additional research which will identify \nthreats and the tools to address those threats.\n  Though invasive species threaten the entire nation's aquatic \necosystem, I am particularly concerned with the damage that invasive \nspecies have done to the Great Lakes. There are now roughly 180 \ninvasive species in the Great Lakes, and on average, a new species is \nintroduced every 8 months. Invasive species cause disruptions in the \nfood chain which is now causing the decline of certain fish. Invasive \nspecies are believed to be the cause of a new dead zone in Lake Erie. \nAnd invasive species compete with native species for habitat.\n  This bill addresses the ``NOBOB'' or No Ballast on Board problem \nwhich is when ships report having no ballast when they enter the Great \nLakes. However, a layer of sediment and small bit of water that cannot \nbe pumped out is still in the ballast tanks. So when water is taken on-\nboard and then discharged all within the Great Lakes, a new species \nthat was still living in that small bit of sediment and water may be \nintroduced. By requiring that these ships immediately begin saltwater \nflushing so that freshwater species cannot survive in the saltwater \nbeing pumped through the ballast tank, this bill addresses a very \nserious issue in the Great Lakes. In 2012, these NOBOB ships, like all \nships, will be required to install and use ballast technology.\n  All in all, the bill would cost about $150 million each year if \nauthorized funding were to be fully appropriated. This is a lot of \nmoney, but it is a critical investment. As those of us from the Great \nLakes know, the economic damage that invasive species can cause is much \ngreater. The zebra mussel, which is just 1 of the 180 species that has \ninvaded the Great Lakes, has caused $3 billion in economic damage over \n10 years. Imagine what the cost of zebra mussels is to all of the \nstates that are now dealing with them. Compared to the annual cost of \nzebra mussels and the hundreds of other aquatic invasive species, the \ncost of this bill is more than reasonable. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work to move the bill \nswiftly through the Senate.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, from Pickerel Pond to Lake Auburn, from \nSebago Lake to Bryant Pond, lakes and ponds in Maine are under attack. \nAquatic invasive species threaten Maine's drinking water systems, \nrecreation, wildlife habitat, lakefront real estate, and fisheries. \nPlants, such as Variable Leaf Milfoil, are crowding out native species. \nInvasive Asian shore crabs are taking over Southern New England's tidal \npools and have advanced well into Maine--to the potential detriment of \nMaine's lobster and clam industries.\n  I rise today to join Senator Levin in introducing legislation to \naddress this problem. The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2007 \nwould create the most comprehensive nationwide approach to date for \ncombating alien species that invade our shores.\n  The stakes are high when invasive species are unintentionally \nintroduced into our Nation's waters. They endanger ecosystems, reduce \nbiodiversity, and threaten native species. They disrupt people's lives \nand livelihoods by lowering property values, impairing commercial \nfishing and aquaculture, degrading recreational experiences, and \ndamaging public water supplies.\n  In the 1950s, European Green Crabs swarmed the Maine coast and \nliterally ate the bottom out of Maine's soft-shell clam industry by the \n1980s. Many clam diggers were forced to go after other fisheries or \nfind new vocations. In just one decade, this invader reduced the number \nof clam diggers in Maine from nearly 5,000 in the 1940s to fewer than \n1500 in the 1950s. European green crabs currently cost an estimated $44 \nmillion a year in damage and control efforts in the United States.\n  Past invasions forewarn of the long-term consequences to our \nenvironment and communities unless we take steps to prevent new \ninvasions. It is too late to stop European green crabs from taking hold \non the East Coast, but we still have the opportunity to prevent many \nother species from taking hold in Maine and the United States.\n  Senator Levin and I first introduced a version of this legislation in \nlate 2002. Unfortunately, in the subsequent years in which Congress has \nfailed to act on our legislation, a number of new invasive species have \ntaken hold in Maine. North America's most aggressive invasive species--\nhydrilla--was found shortly after we first introduced our legislation. \nThis stubborn and fast-growing aquatic plant has taken hold in Pickerel \nPond in the Town of Limerick, ME. This plant is now found throughout \nPickerel Pond, where it diminishes recreational use for swimmers and \nboaters.\n\n[[Page S2493]]\n\n  Eurasian Milfoil is another invasive which has taken hold since our \nlegislation was first introduced. Maine was the last of the lower 48 \nStates to be free of this stubborn and fast-growing invasive plant. \nEurasian Milfoil degrades water quality by displacing native plants, \nfish and other aquatic species. The plant forms stems reaching up to 20 \nfeet high that cause fouling problems for swimmers and boaters. In \ntotal, there are now 27 documented cases of aquatic invasive species \ninfesting Maine's lakes and ponds.\n  When considering the impact of these invasive species, it is \nimportant to note the tremendous value of our lakes and ponds. While \ntheir contribution to our quality of life is priceless, their value to \nour economy is more measurable. Maine's Great Ponds generate nearly 13 \nmillion recreational user days each year, lead to more than $1.2 \nbillion in annual income for Maine residents, and support more than \n50,000 jobs.\n  With so much at stake, Mainers are taking action to stop the spread \nof invasive species into our State's waters. The State of Maine has \nmade it illegal to sell, possess, cultivate, import or introduce 11 \ninvasive aquatic plants. Boaters participating in the Maine Lake and \nRiver Protection Sticker program are providing needed funding to aid \nefforts to prevent, detect and manage aquatic invasive plants. \nVolunteers are participating in the Courtesy Boat Inspection program to \nkeep aquatic invasive plants out of Maine lakes. Before launch or after \nremoval, inspectors ask boaters for permission to inspect the boat, \ntrailer or other equipment for plants.\n  While I am proud of the actions that Maine and many other States are \ntaking to protect against invasive species, all too often their efforts \nhave not been enough. Protecting the integrity of our lakes, streams, \nand coastlines from invading species cannot be accomplished by \nindividual states alone. We need a uniform, nationwide approach to deal \neffectively with invasive species. The National Aquatic Invasive \nSpecies Act of 2007 will help my State and States throughout the Nation \ndetect, prevent and respond to aquatic invasive species.\n  The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2007 would be the most \ncomprehensive effort ever undertaken to address the threat of invasive \nspecies. By authorizing $150 million per year, this legislation would \nopen numerous new fronts in our war against invasive species. The bill \ndirects the Coast Guard to develop regulations that will end the easy \ncruise of invasive species into US waters through the ballast water of \ninternational ships, and would provide the Coast Guard with $6 million \nper year to develop and implement these regulations.\n  The bill also would provide $30 million per year for a grant program \nto assist State efforts to prevent the spread of invasive species. It \nwould provide additional funds for the Army Corps of Engineers and Fish \nand Wildlife Service to contain and control invasive species. Finally, \nthe Levin-Collins bill would authorize $30 million annually for \nresearch, education, and outreach.\n  The most effective means of stopping invading species is to attack \nthem before they attack us. We need an early alert, rapid response \nsystem to combat invading species before they have a chance to take \nhold. For the first time, this bill would establish a national \nmonitoring network to detect newly introduced species, while providing \n$25 million to the Secretary of the Interior to create a rapid response \nfund to help States and regions respond quickly once invasive species \nhave been detected. This bill is our best effort at preventing the next \nwave of invasive species from taking hold and decimating industries and \ndestroying waterways in Maine and throughout the country.\n  One of the leading pathways for the introduction of aquatic organisms \nto U.S. waters from abroad is through transoceanic vessels. Commercial \nvessels fill and release ballast tanks with seawater as a means of \nstabilization. The ballast water contains live organisms from plankton \nto adult fish that are transported and released through this pathway. \nOur legislation would require all ships, with limited exceptions, to \nmeet environmentally protective performance standards for ballast water \ndischarge by 2012. In addition, it would establish a mandatory ballast \nwater management program that includes invasive species management \nplans, ballast management reporting requirements, and best management \npractices for all ships in US waters.\n  The National Aquatic Invasive Species Act of 2007 offers a strong \nframework to combat aquatic invasive species. I call on my colleagues \nto help us enact this legislation in order to protect our waters, \necosystems, and industries from destructive invasive species--before \neven more of them take hold in our lakes and rivers and along our \ncoastlines.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself Mr. Dodd, Mr. Akaka, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n        Stevens, Mr. Lott, Mr. Smith, Mr. Alexander, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 727.

Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Teaching \nGeography is Fundamental Act. I am pleased to be joined by my friend \nfrom Connecticut Mr. Dodd. The purpose of this bill is to improve \ngeographic literacy among K-12 students in the United States by \nsupporting professional development programs for their teachers that \nare administered in institutions of higher education. The bill also \nassists States in measuring the impact of education in geography.\n  Ensuring geographic literacy prepares students to be good citizens of \nboth our Nation and the world. Last May, John Fahey, President of the \nNational Geographic Society, stated that ``Geographic illiteracy \nimpacts our economic well-being, our relationships with other nations \nand the environment, and isolates us from the world.'' When students \nunderstand their own environment, they can better understand the \ndifferences in other places, and the people who live in them. Knowledge \nof the diverse cultures, environment, and distances between States and \ncountries helps our students to understand national and international \npolicies, economies, societies, and political structures on a more \nglobal scale.\n  The 2005 publication, What Works in Geography, reported that \nelementary school geography instruction significantly improves student \nachievement and proved that the integration of geography into the \nelementary school curriculum improves student literacy achievement an \naverage of 5 percent. That's the good news. However, the 2006 National \nGeographic-Roper Global Geographic Literacy Survey shows that 69 \npercent of elementary school principals report a decrease in time spent \nteaching geography and less than a quarter of our Nation's high school \nstudents take a geography course in high school. This survey shows that \nmany of our high school graduates lack the basic skills to navigate our \ninternational economy, policies and relationships.\n  To expect that Americans will be able to work successfully with the \nother people in this world, we need to be able to communicate and \nunderstand each other. It is a fact that we have a global marketplace, \nand that will continue to be the case. We need to be preparing our \nyounger generation for global competition and ensuring that they have a \nstrong base of understanding to be able to succeed. A strong base of \ngeography knowledge improves those opportunities.\n  The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis announced yesterday that 27.9 \npercent of the U.S. GDP, that is $3.7 trillion, annually results from \ninternational trade. According to the CIA World Factbook of 2005, U.S. \nworkers need geographic knowledge to compete in this global economy. \nGeographic knowledge is increasingly needed for U.S. businesses in \ninternational markets to understand such factors as physical distance, \ntime zones, language differences, and cultural diversity among project \nteams.\n  In addition, geospatial technology is a new and emerging career \navailable to people with an extensive background in geography \neducation. Professionals in\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\ngeospatial technology are employed in Federal Government agencies, the \nprivate sector and the non-profit sector, focusing on areas such as \nagriculture, archeology, ecology, land appraisal, and urban planning \nand development. In the United States, there are currently 175,000 \nindividuals employed in the geospatial technology industry. It is \nestimated that this industry is growing up to 14 percent per year and \nit is projected to be a $5-6 billion industry by 2010. A strong \ngeography education system is a necessity for this industry's continued \nadvancement.\n  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, ``To solve most of the \nmajor problems facing our country today, from wiping out terrorism, to \nminimizing global environmental problems, to eliminating the scourge of \nAIDS, will require every young person to learn more about other \nregions, cultures, and languages.''\n  We need to do more to ensure that the teachers responsible for the \neducation of our students, from kindergarten through high school \ngraduation, are prepared and trained to teach these critical skills to \nsolve these problems. Over the last 15 years, the National Geographic \nSociety has awarded more than $100 million in grants to educators, \nuniversities, geography alliances, and others for the purposes of \nadvancing and improving the teaching of geography. Their models are \nsuccessful and research shows that students who have benefitted from \nthis teaching outperform other students. State geography alliances \nexist in 19 States, including Mississippi, endowed by grants from the \nsociety. But, their efforts alone are not enough. The bill I am \nintroducing establishes a Federal commitment to enhance the education \nof our teachers, focus on geography education research, and develop \nreliable, advanced technology based classroom materials.\n  In my State of Mississippi, teachers and university professors are \nmaking progress to increase geography education in the schools through \nadditional professional training. Based at the University of \nMississippi, over 300 geography teachers are members of the Mississippi \nGeography Alliance. Two weeks ago, the Mississippi Geography Alliance \nconducted a workshop for graduate and undergraduate students who are \npreparing to be certified to teach elementary through high school-level \ngeography in our State. The workshop provided opportunities for model \nteaching sessions and discussion of best practices in the classroom.\n  I hope the Senate will consider the seriousness of the need to invest \nin geography and I invite other Senators to cosponsor the Teaching \nGeography is Fundamental Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 728. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out \nrestoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a project of \ngreat importance to my State and our environment--one that has been \ndiscussed before on this floor when I helped unveil a vision that would \nrehabilitate and restore New Mexico's Bosque. I return here today to \nimplement this vision that concerns this long neglected treasure of the \nSouthwest.\n  I would like to point out that this project passed through this body \nin the last Congress. The project that I am proposing today was \ncontained in the 2005 Water Resources Development Act, which passed the \nSenate on July 19, 2006. I hope that this important project will again \nobtain the approval of the Senate.\n  The Albuquerque metropolitan area is the largest concentration of \npeople in New Mexico. It is also the home to the irreplaceable riparian \nforest which runs through the heart of the city and surrounding towns \nthat is the Bosque. It is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in \nthe Southwest, and one of the last of its kind in the world.\n  Unfortunately, mismanagement, neglect, and the effects of upstream \ndevelopment have severely degraded the Bosque. The list of its woes is \nlong: It has been overrun by non-native vegetation; graffiti and trash \nmar locations along its length; the drought and build up of hazardous \nfuel have contributed to fires. As a result, public access is \nproblematical and crucial habitat for scores of species is threatened.\n  Yet the Middle Rio Grande Bosque remains one of the most biologically \ndiverse ecosystems in the Southwest. My goal is to restore the Bosque \nand create a space that is open and attractive to the public.\n  This is a grand undertaking to be sure; but I want to ensure that \nthis extraordinary corridor of the Southwestern desert is preserved for \ngenerations to come--not only for generations of humans, but for the \ndiverse plant and animal species that reside in the Bosque as well.\n  The rehabilitation of this ecosystem leads to greater protection for \nthreatened and endangered species; it means more migratory birds, \nhealthier habitat for fish, and greater numbers of towering cottonwood \ntrees. This project can increase the quality of life for a city while \nassuring the health and stability of an entire ecosystem. Where trash \nis now strewn, paths and trails will run. Where jetty jacks and \ndiscarded rubble lie, cottonwoods will grow. The dead trees and \nunderbrush that threaten devastating fire will be replaced by healthy \ngroves of trees. School children will be able to study and maybe catch \nsight of a bald eagle. The chance to help build a dynamic public space \nlike this does not come around often, and I would like to see Congress \nembrace that chance on this occasion.\n  Having grown up along the Rio Grande in Albuquerque, the Bosque is \nsomething I treasure, and I lament the degradation that has occurred. \nBecause of this, I have been involved in Bosque restoration since 1991, \nand I commend the efforts of groups like the Bosque Coalition for the \nwork they have done, and will continue to do, along the river. I \npropose to build on their efforts with the legislation I am introducing \ntoday.\n  I remain grateful to each of the parties who have been involved with \nthis idea since its inception. Each one contributes a very critical \ncomponent of the project. The Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District \n(the ``MRGCD\") owns the vital part of the Bosque which runs from the \nNational Hispanic Cultural Center north to the Paseo Del Norte Bridge. \nThe MRGCD has proven to be a valuable local partner that has worked \nwith all parties to provide options on how the Bosque can be preserved, \nprotected and enjoyed by everyone. Additionally, the Army Corps of \nEngineers is developing a preliminary restoration plan for the Bosque \nalong the Albuquerque corridor.\n  My bill authorizes $10 million dollars in Fiscal Year 2007 and such \nsums as are necessary for the following nine years to complete \nprojects, activities, substantial ecosystem restoration, preservation, \nprotection, and recreation facilities along the Middle Rio Grande. I \nurge my fellow members to help preserve this rare and diverse ecosystem \nand to aid the city of Albuquerque and the State of New Mexico in \nbuilding a place to treasure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 728\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to better provide for compensation for certain persons \ninjured in the course of employment at the Rocky Flats site in \nColorado; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about legislation I \nintroduced today. The Rocky Flats Special Exposure Cohort Act will at \nlong last repay our debt to the patriotic American workers of Rocky \nFlats, who served our Nation during the Cold War.\n  Many Americans contributed to our victory in the Cold War. Brave men \nand women worked in laboratories and factories throughout the Nation, \nfashioning nuclear weapons that led to the fall of the former Soviet \nUnion. Unfortunately, many of these Cold War Veterans contracted cancer \nand other disabling and fatal diseases due to their service.\n  Before I arrived to Washington, DC, Congress recognized the \nsacrifices made by our nuclear weapons workers by enacting the Energy \nEmployees Occupational Injury Compensation Act (EEOICPA) to provide \nbenefits to nuclear weapons workers for their work-related illnesses or \nto their survivors when these illnesses took their lives.\n  While thousands of workers are successfully applying and receiving \nbenefits today, others face incredible obstacles as they try to \ndemonstrate that they qualify for benefits. In fact, a combination of \nmissing records and bureaucratic red tape has prevented many workers \nfrom accessing benefits who served at the Rocky Flats facility in \nColorado.\n  Our government failed these workers when they maintained shoddy, \ninaccurate, and incomplete records. Thankfully, Congress had the \nforesight in the Energy Employees Act to realize that some workers \nmight not be able to prove that their cancers were caused by their work \nin nuclear weapons facilities, whether due to the lack of records or \nother problems that make it difficult or impossible to determine the \ndose of radiation they received. To protect these workers, Congress \ndesignated a Special Exposure Cohort to receive benefits if they \nsuffered from one of the specified cancers known to be linked to \nradiation exposure.\n  Since February 2005, Rocky Flats workers have patiently and \ndiligently been making their case to the Federal Government. \nUnfortunately, many of the Rocky Flats workers are running out of time. \nOver the past 2 years, several have passed away without having received \nthe healthcare and other benefits that they would have qualified for if \nthey were granted an SEC designation.\n  Their petition is being reviewed by the Advisory Board on Radiation \nand Worker Health (ABRWH), a body that is stretched thin. In the past, \nI have raised my strong concerns about the several unfilled Advisory \nBoard seats. I commend these Americans for having answered the calls of \ntheir government to serve our country. Like our Cold War Veterans, \nAdvisory Board members have sacrificed their time and energy to perform \nan important service. I believe it is the responsibility of this \nCongress to fulfill its duty as well.\n  The bill I am introducing today would extend Special Exposure Cohort \nstatus to workers employed by the Department of Energy or its \ncontractors at Rocky Flats according to the stringent requirements of \nthe EEOICPA. As a result of this designation, a Rocky Flats worker \nsuffering from one of the 22 listed cancers will be able to receive \nbenefits despite the inadequate records maintained by the Department of \nEnergy and its contractors.\n  Through five decades, men and women worked at Rocky Flats, producing \nplutonium, one of the most dangerous substances in creation, and \ncrafting it into the triggers for America's nuclear arsenal. These men \nand women served a critical role in a program deemed essential to our \nnational security by a succession of Presidents and Congresses. We owe \nthem an enormous debt of gratitude.\n  My bill is a companion bill to the bipartisan House bill, H.R. 904, \nintroduced by my friends, Congressman Mark Udall and Congressman Ed \nPerlmutter from Colorado. I look forward to its bipartisan support in \nthe Senate and urge this body to swiftly take up and pass this \nimportant legislation. In doing so, we will right a wrong and fulfill a \ntask that is long overdue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 730. A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to protect \nvoting rights and to improve the administration of Federal elections, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as we move forward in the coming months in \nthe Senate Committee on Rules and Administration on critical election \nreform hearings, I wanted to take this opportunity to re-introduce my \nlegislation, the Voting Opportunity and Technology Enhancement Rights \n(VOTER) Act of 2007. I am committed to working with our new Rules \nCommittee Chair Senator Feinstein and my other Rules Committee \ncolleagues, and with others off the committee, to try to secure \nenactment of tough new election reform legislation in this Congress. \nThis bill provides a focus and framework for that discussion.\n  It does not purport to address all of the key problems in election \nreform that have arisen since enactment in 2002 of the historic Help \nAmerica Vote Act (HAVA), but it is an important start, and I am pleased \nthat Senator Feinstein and I will be working together on comprehensive \nreform legislation this year. In light of the continuing barriers that \nAmerican citizens\n\n[[Page S2496]]\n\nfound at polling places across this Nation last November, including \ntechnological barriers, human errors, and other problems, we cannot \nrest on the laurels of past legislation. We must continue to strive to \nprovide an equal opportunity for all citizens to participate in their \ndemocracy by voting and having their vote counted.\n  That's why today I am re-introducing this legislation. There is \nnothing more fundamental to the vitality of a democracy of the people, \nby the people, and for the people, than the people's right to vote. In \nthe words of Thomas Paine: ``The right of voting for representatives is \nthe primary right by which other rights are protected.'' Indeed, it is \nthe right on which all others in our democracy depend.\n  We still have a long way to go before we get to the point where all \nAmericans are able to participate without obstacles in our elections, \nand able to participate with confidence in the voting systems they use. \nIn the 2000 presidential election, 51.2 percent of the eligible \nAmerican electorate voted. And although in the 2004 presidential \nelection voting participation reached its highest level since 1968, \nonly 60.7 percent of eligible Americans voted. That dropped back down, \nin the 2006 off-year elections, to just over 40 percent.\n  While there are many reasons why more Americans do not vote, we \nlearned from the debacle of the 2000 presidential elections that many \ncitizens cannot vote and have their vote counted because they are \nimproperly removed from registration rolls, do not have access to \naccessible voting systems and ballots, or lack confidence in antiquated \nand error-prone machines and State administrative procedures. In \nresponse to those concerns, in 2002 Congress enacted HAVA, \noverwhelmingly bipartisan election reform legislation. For the first \ntime in our history, that landmark legislation established the role of \nthe Federal Government in administering and funding Federal elections. \nThe twin goals of the act were to make it easier to vote and harder to \ndefraud the system.\n\n  On the day that the Senate adopted its version of HAVA, I noted that \nthe Senate bill was a bipartisan compromise and the culmination of the \nhard work of a dedicated group of Senators. But I also noted that the \ncompromise was just that--it was not everything that all of us wanted, \nbut it was something that everyone wanted. That was equally true of the \nfinal HAVA compromise on election reform.\n  The 2004 and 2006 elections raised both continuing and new concerns. \nAnd some of the most important of these concerns are not addressed by \nHAVA. The fact that less than one-half of the eligible voting age \npopulation voted in 2006 underscores the reality that not everybody \nvotes in America. We must do better on this front, and we can. As the \n2006 elections in some states reminded us, we also must do better at \nbolstering Americans' confidence in the security and reliability of our \nelection systems, while preserving critical access to people with \ndisabilities, language minorities, and others.\n  Let me summarize briefly what this bill does. First, the VOTER Act \nprovides every eligible American, regardless of where they live in the \nworld or where they find themselves on election day, the right to cast \na National Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot in Federal elections. This \nnew national absentee ballot extends to all citizens the same right to \na Federal absentee ballot that overseas and active military voters \ncurrently have. Beginning with Federal elections in 2008, every State \nshall provide early voting opportunities for a minimum of 15 days prior \nto election day, including Saturdays. Beginning in 2009, any otherwise \neligible voter must be allowed to register to vote on election day and \nhave that vote counted in Federal elections. This last provision would \nin itself be a major advance.\n  The VOTER Act also addresses many of the recurring, and new, barriers \nto voting that voters faced at the polls in the last two federal \nelections. It requires that a State count a provisional ballot for \nFederal office cast within the State by an otherwise eligible voter, \nnotwithstanding the polling place where the ballot is cast.\n  HAVA established a uniform national right for every voter in a \nFederal election to receive and cast a provisional ballot. This new \nright was intended to ensure that no otherwise eligible voter could be \nturned away from the polls because of an administrative error or other \nchallenge. But in 2004, and again in 2006, we saw this right eroded by \nStates and applied in non-uniform ways. Some States, such as Ohio, \ninitially interpreted HAVA to require that a voter be in their correct \nprecinct in order to cast a Federal provisional ballot. Other States \ninterpreted the same HAVA language to allow challenged voters to cast a \nprovisional ballot in their county of residence. Whether or not the \nprovisional ballot was ultimately counted turned solely on State law. \nThis bill ensures that voters who cast a provisional ballot for Federal \noffice will have that ballot counted in a uniform manner.\n  In addition, the VOTER Act requires that each State provide a minimum \nrequired number of voting systems and poll workers for each polling \nplace on election day and during early voting, consistent with \nmandatory standards established by the Election Assistance Commission. \nThis is to avoid the problem of long lines and disenfranchised voters \nbecause of too few voting systems or ballots at polling places and too \nfew poll workers to assist voters. This requirement would become \neffective in January, 2008.\n  To ensure that all voters have an opportunity to independently verify \ntheir ballot before it is cast and counted, the VOTER Act also requires \nthat all States provide voters a voter-verified ballot with a choice of \nat least four formats for verification: a paper record; an audio \nrecord; a pictorial record; and an electronic record or other means \nwhich is fully accessible to the disabled, including the blind and \nvisually impaired.\n  HAVA already requires that all voting systems provide voters an \nopportunity to verify their ballot before it is cast and counted. HAVA \nalso requires that all systems produce a permanent paper record for \naudit purposes. However, it does not spell out how that verification is \nto be achieved to ensure security and independence of the voter's \nchoice.\n  In the last few years, many have called on Congress to require a \nvoter-verified paper ballot. And I understand what is behind that \nimpulse. Even so, unless voter verification schemes are carefully \ncrafted, paper-only processes can be less accurate, printer jams can \nresult in more destroyed ballots, and they can inherently discriminate \nagainst the disabled, particularly the blind and visually-impaired. \nHAVA already requires that all voters, regardless of disability, be \nable to verify their ballots. With current and developing technology--\nand with new approaches being developed which will require paper \nballots which are then convertible into formats for verification that \nare accessible to persons with disabilities and language minorities--I \nam hopeful that as we move forward we will be able to work out an \napproach on which all sides can agree.\n  I continue to believe it is important to preserve the anti-\ndiscrimination requirements in current law, by ensuring that \nappropriate verification alternatives are offered to those who need \nthem. I know my colleagues have various proposals on this issue to \nbring before the Committee for its consideration, either separately or \nas part of more comprehensive reform efforts, and we should examine \nthose proposals carefully. That process has already begun with the \nCommittee's hearing last month which focused on problems with \nelectronic voting systems, including those currently before the court \nin the contested election for the 13th Congressional District in \nSarasota County, Florida.\n  The VOTER Act also addresses the continuing problem of minority \ndisenfranchisement through last-minute purges of voter registration \nlists by requiring States to provide public notice of any such purges \nnot later than 45 days before a Federal election.\n  To expedite the studies called for under HAVA for establishing \nelection day as a Federal holiday, the VOTER Act requires the EAC to \ncomplete its study and issue recommendations within 6 months of \nenactment and earmarks funds within the EAC budget solely for this \npurpose.\n  It also includes amendments to HAVA that build on the existing voting \nsystem requirements to ensure that all voting systems, including punch \ncards\n\n[[Page S2497]]\n\nand central count optical scan machines, provide voters with actual \nnotice of over-votes. Also, beginning in 2009, States must allow for \nvoter registration through the Internet. The bill also includes \nprovisions to ensure both the security and uniform treatment of voter \nregistration applications by requiring that all voters sign an \naffidavit attesting to both their citizenship and age, in lieu of the \nHAVA requirements for a check-off box alone, effective in 2009.\n  HAVA requires that voter registration forms include questions \nregarding citizenship and age with check-off boxes that applicants use \nto indicate whether or not they meet eligibility requirements. States \nare further required to contact any applicant who does not fill in the \nboxes in order to complete the form. However, in the 2004 and 2006 \nelections, States implemented this requirement in widely varying ways, \nresulting in non-uniform treatment of voters in Federal elections. In \nsome cases, States refused to process the form and failed to contact \nthe voter. In other States, voters who had submitted incomplete forms \nwere asked to complete those forms at the polling place. While the twin \npurposes of HAVA were to make it easier to vote and harder to defraud \nthe system, as implemented this requirement achieves neither purpose. \nThis requirement further resulted in disenfranchising voters who failed \nto check a box but nonetheless signed an affidavit, under penalty of \nperjury, attesting to both their citizenship and age. With the \nimplementation of statewide voter registration lists, the check-off box \nrequirement is unnecessary and burdensome to both voters and election \nadministrators.\n  To ensure that the implementation of the voter identification \nrequirements in HAVA do not make it harder to vote, the VOTER Act \nexpands the forms of identification that can be used to establish \nidentity for first-time voters who submit their voter registration by \nmail to include an affidavit executed by the voter attesting to his or \nher identity, generally subject to penalties for perjury under State \nlaw.\n  The VOTER Act also begins to respond to concerns first raised in the \n2000 Presidential election in Florida, and echoed again in the 2004 and \n2006 elections, regarding the appearance of impartiality by State \nelection officials who were otherwise active in Federal campaigns. The \nbill imposes new accountability and transparency requirements on \nStates, beginning in 2008, including a public notice requirement of any \nchanges in State law affecting the administration of elections, such as \nchanges in polling places and actions denying access to polling place \nobservers. Some have urged going beyond this, including by banning \nstate election officials from engaging in political activity in races \nwhich they oversee; the committee should consider this approach \ncarefully.\n  To ensure the independence of the Election Assistance Commission, and \nthe timely issuance of guidance and standards, the bill provides the \nagency with independent budget authority and the authority to issue \nmandatory standards to implement the new requirements. Finally, in \nrecognition of the inherent role of the States in the administration of \nFederal elections, the VOTER Act provides additional Federal funds for \nthe State requirement grants under HAVA to implement the new \nrequirements.\n  This measure does not pretend to be exhaustive, and I know there are \nother important reform ideas that will be considered by the committee, \nincluding measures to penalize deceptive voter intimidation practices, \nto impose additional voting systems testing, to improve poll worker \ntraining, to ease registration for new voters, and others. I welcome a \nfull discussion of all of these issues.\n  While Congress accomplished much with the passage of the Help America \nVote Act following the debacle of the 2000 Presidential election, 5 \nyears later voters still face some of the same barriers to voting that \nHAVA promised to remove. As we move forward on election reform this \nyear, let us ensure that every eligible American voter has an equal \nopportunity to cast a vote and have that vote counted in Federal \nelections.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this measure, and \nI ask unanimous consent that a brief section-by-section analysis of \nthis measure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Voting Opportunity and Technology Enhancement Act of 2007\n\n\n                      section-by-section analysis\n\n     Sec. 1.--Tit1e;

A bill to develop a methodology for, and complete, a national \nassessment of geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the \nNational Carbon Dioxide Storage Capacity Assessment Act of 2007.\n  Our earth is getting warmer. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration recently announced that 2006 was the warmest year on \nrecord, and every single year since 1993 has fallen in the top twenty \nwarmest years on record.\n  In February 2007, a report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change found the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse \ngases in the atmosphere resulting from the burning of fossil fuels have \nincreased more than 30 percent since the Industrial Revolution. The \nincreased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are contributing \nto the increased temperatures we are seeing today.\n  The United States is the largest emitter of CO2 in the \nworld, and much of these emissions come from satisfying our energy \nneeds. These same energy needs that fuel our homes, our cars, and our \neconomy are hurting our planet. The debate on climate change in the \nSenate has started to transform, it has gone from whether or not \nclimate change is real, to what can we do, now, to address climate \nchange. There has been much discussion in the Senate about the need to \ncreate a clean energy future for America, and there is much optimism \nabout our ability to produce energy in ways that do not harm the \nenvironment.\n  In attempting to limit emissions, one promising step we can take is \nto sequester carbon dioxide. Carbon sequestration is a process where \ncarbon is captured before it is released into the atmosphere, \ncompressed, and stored underground in geological areas such as saline \nformations, unmineable coal seams, and oil and gas reservoirs. This \ntechnology exists today.\n  My legislation would start us on the path to large-scale \nsequestration by directing the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct a \nnational assessment of our sequestration capacity. Specifically, this \nassessment would evaluate the potential capacity and rate of carbon \nsequestration in all possible sites throughout the United States, as \nwell the various risk levels involved.\n  Carbon sequestration also holds potential economic benefits for the \nUnited States. Sequestration has the potential to enhance the recovery \ncapabilities of certain oil, gas, and coal-bed reservoirs increasing \nthe efficiency of these important resources to the benefit of all.\n  The Department of Energy has already established seven regional \ncarbon sequestration partnerships. These partnerships have vital \nexperience and understanding about the potential for storing carbon \ndioxide. This bill will build upon the existing work of these \npartnerships, and create a national database assessable to the public \non the potential storage sites across the United States--enabling \ncompanies to make cost-effective decisions needed to make sequestration \na viable option.\n  The need to combat climate change is here; many of the techniques and \ntechnologies to combat climate change are available; and we have the \nwill to act. What is missing for carbon sequestration is a accessible, \nnational assessment of the potential storage sites. This bill gives us \nthe tools our country needs to spur the implementation of carbon \nsequestration, fight climate change, and create a clean energy future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 732. A bill to empower Peace Corps volunteers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, March 1, marks the 46th Anniversary \nof the Peace Corps. Never in our history has it been more critical that \nthe Peace Corps succeed in its mission to ``promote world peace and \nfriendship.'' As we all know, the Peace Corps seeks to advance both a \nbetter understanding of Americans and better understanding by \nAmericans; and these goals are especially central if we want to \neffectively counter the spread of extremist ideology to disaffected \npeople around the world, people who, after all, know as little of us as \nwe know of them.\n  Since 1961, nearly 190,000 Peace Corps volunteers have served our \nNation as citizen diplomats. For the last 45 years, by living and \nworking side-by-side with people from 139 nations, these volunteers \nhave represented the very best of American ideals: working to improve \nthe human condition, and overcoming barriers of culture, language and \nreligion, through patience, mutual respect, and partnership.\n  The Peace Corps is an absolutely crucial instrument in advancing \nAmerica's longer term foreign policy goals. And so today I am proud to \nintroduce the Peace Corps Volunteer Empowerment Act that is designed to \nmake the Peace Corps even more relevant to the dynamic world of the \n21st Century. I am also very pleased to announce that another returned \nPeace Corps volunteer, Congressman Sam Farr will shortly introduce a \ncompanion bill in the House so that both bodies can begin working to \npass this very important legislation.\n  The bill will provide seed monies for active Peace Corps volunteers \nfor demonstration projects at their specific in-country sites. It \nauthorizes $10 million in additional annual appropriations to be \ndistributed by the Peace Corps as grants to returned Peace Corps \nvolunteers interested in undertaking ``third goal'' projects in their \ncommunities. The bill will also authorize active Peace Corps volunteers \nto accept, under certain carefully defined circumstances, private \ndonations to support their development projects.\n  For any organization to thrive, managers and leaders must have access \nto first-hand knowledge and perspectives of those working on the front \nlines. And so, this bill will establish mechanisms for more volunteer \ninput into Peace Corps operations, including staffing decisions, site \nselection, language training and country programs. This bill will also \nexplicitly protect certain rights of Peace Corps volunteers with \nrespect to termination of service and whistleblower protection.\n  We must bring the Peace Corps into the digital age. To that end, this \nbill will provide volunteers with better means of communication by \nestablishing websites and email links for use by volunteers in-country.\n  Inadequate funding and internal structural roadblocks have \nunfortunately resulted in an unfulfilled Presidential pledge to double \nthe size of the Peace Corps by 2007. Despite a large increase in \nvolunteers signing up for the Peace Corps immediately after September \n11, the Congressional Research Service reports that the number of Peace \nCorps volunteers actually declined in 2006. It is crucial that we work \nto reverse this troubling trend. That is why this bill authorizes \nactive recruitment from the 185,000 returned Peace Corps volunteer \ncommunity for second tours as volunteers and as participants in third \ngoal activities in the United States.\n  This bill will also remove certain medical, healthcare and other \nimpediments that discourage older individuals from becoming Peace Corps \nvolunteers. It will create more transparency in the medical screening \nand appeals process, and require reports on costs associated with \nextending post-service health coverage from 1 month to 6 months.\n  Finally, and perhaps most crucially, my bill includes annual \nauthorizations for Fiscal Years 2008 to 2011, so that we can provide \nthe means by which the\n\n[[Page S2499]]\n\nPeace Corps can double the number of volunteers to 15,000, by 2011.\n  In all the controversies of the past 5 years, all the vagaries of \nstrategy and tactics and plans and counter plans, there's one policy \nthat guarantees success: sending our best young men and women into the \nworld to make America known. So, I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis bill, to modernize, strengthen and enlarge the Peace Corps. On the \n46th Anniversary of this great program, let us act swiftly to ensure \nthat at the very least, the Peace Corps will continue to thrive for an \nadditional 46 years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 733. A bill to promote the development of health care cooperatives \nthat will help businesses to pool the health care purchasing power of \nemployers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, labor, and pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator \nCollins from Maine, I am introducing legislation to help businesses \nform group-purchasing cooperatives to obtain enhanced benefits, to \nreduce health care rates, and to improve quality for their employees' \nhealth care.\n  High health care costs are burdening businesses and employees across \nthe Nation. These costs are digging into profits and preventing access \nto affordable health care. Too many patients feel trapped by the \nsystem, with decisions about their health dictated by costs rather than \nby what they need.\n  Nationally, the annual average cost to an employer for an individual \nemployee's health care is $3,615. For a family, the employer \ncontribution is $8,508. We must curb these rapidly increasing health \ncare costs. I strongly support initiatives to ensure that everyone has \naccess to health care. It is crucial that we support successful local \ninitiatives to reduce health care premiums and to improve the quality \nof employees' health care.\n  By using group purchasing to obtain rate discounts, some employers \nhave been able to reduce the cost of health care premiums for their \nemployees. According to the National Business Coalition on Health, \nthere are nearly 80 employer-led coalitions across the United States \nthat collectively purchase health care. Through these pools, businesses \nare able to proactively challenge high costs and inefficient delivery \nof health care and share information on quality. These coalitions \nrepresent over 10,000 employers nationwide.\n  Improving the quality of health care will also lower the cost of \ncare. By investing in the delivery of quality health care, we will be \nable to lower long term health care costs. Effective care, such as \nquality preventive services, can reduce overall health care \nexpenditures. Health purchasing coalitions help promote these services \nand act as an employer forum for networking and education on health \ncare cost containment strategies. They can help foster a dialogue with \nhealth care providers, insurers, and local HMOs.\n  Health care markets are local. Problems with cost, quality, and \naccess to health care are felt most intensely in the local markets. \nHealth care coalitions can function best when they are formed and \nimplemented locally. Local employers of large and small businesses have \nformed health care coalitions to track health care trends, create a \ndemand for quality and safety, and encourage group purchasing.\n  In Wisconsin, there have been various successful initiatives that \nhave formed health care purchasing cooperatives to improve quality of \ncare and to reduce cost. For example, the Employer Health Care Alliance \nCooperative, an employer-owned and employer-directed not-for-profit \ncooperative, has developed a network of health care providers in Dane \nCounty and 12 surrounding counties on behalf of its 157 member \nemployers. Through this pooling effort, employers are able to obtain \naffordable, high-quality health care for their nearly 73,000 employees \nand dependents.\n  This legislation seeks to build on successful local initiatives, such \nas the Alliance, that help businesses to join together to increase \naccess to affordable and high-quality health care.\n  The Promoting Health Care Purchasing Cooperatives Act would authorize \ngrants to a group of businesses so that they could form group-\npurchasing cooperatives to obtain enhanced benefits, reduce health care \nrates, and improve quality.\n  This legislation offers two separate grant programs to help different \ntypes of businesses pool their resources and bargaining power. Both \nprograms would aid businesses to form cooperatives. The first program \nwould help large businesses that sponsor their own health plans, while \nthe second program would help small businesses that purchase their \nhealth insurance.\n  My bill would enable larger businesses to form cost-effective \ncooperatives that could offer quality health care through several ways. \nFirst, they could obtain health services through pooled purchasing from \nphysicians, hospitals, home health agencies, and others. By pooling \ntheir experience and interests, employers involved in a coalition could \nbetter address essential issues, such as rising health insurance rates \nand the lack of comparable health care quality data. They would be able \nto share information regarding the quality of these services and to \npartner with these health care providers to meet the needs of their \nemployees.\n  For smaller businesses that purchase their health insurance, the \nformation of cooperatives would allow them to buy health insurance at \nlower prices through pooled purchasing. Also, the communication within \nthese cooperatives would provide employees of small businesses with \nbetter information about the health care options that are available to \nthem. Finally, coalitions would serve to promote quality improvements \nby facilitating partnerships between their group and the health care \nproviders.\n  By working together, the group could develop better quality insurance \nplans and negotiate better rates.\n  This legislation also tries to alleviate the burden that our Nation's \nfarmers face when trying to purchase health care for themselves, their \nfamilies, and their employees. Because the health insurance industry \nlooks upon farming as a high-risk profession, many farmers are priced \nout of, or simply not offered, health insurance. By helping farmers \njoin cooperatives to purchase health insurance, we will help increase \ntheir health insurance options.\n  Past health purchasing pool initiatives have focused only on cost and \nhave tried to be all things for all people. My legislation creates an \nincentive to join the pools by giving grants to a group of similar \nbusinesses to form group-purchasing cooperatives. The pools are also \ngiven flexibility to find innovative ways to lower costs, such as \nenhancing benefits, for example, more preventive care, and improving \nquality. Finally, the cooperative structure is a proven model, which \ncreates an incentive for businesses to remain in the pool because they \nwill be invested in the organization.\n  We must reform health care in America and give employers and \nemployees more options. This legislation, by providing for the \nformation of cost-effective coalitions that will also improve the \nquality of care, contributes to this essential reform process. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this proposal to improve the \nquality and costs of health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 733\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Health Care \n     Purchasing Cooperatives Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Health care spending in the United States has reached \n     16 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the United \n     States, yet 46,000,000 people remains uninsured.\n       (2) After nearly a decade of manageable increases in \n     commercial insurance premiums, many employers are now faced \n     with consecutive years of double digit premium increases.\n       (3) Purchasing cooperatives owned by participating \n     businesses are a proven method of achieving the bargaining \n     power necessary to manage the cost and quality of employer-\n     sponsored health plans and other employee benefits.\n       (4) The Employer Health Care Alliance Cooperative has \n     provided its members with\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\n     health care purchasing power through provider contracting, \n     data collection, activities to enhance quality improvements \n     in the health care community, and activities to promote \n     employee health care consumerism.\n       (5) According to the National Business Coalition on Health, \n     there are nearly 80 employer-led coalitions across the United \n     States that collectively purchase health care, proactively \n     challenge high costs and the inefficient delivery of health \n     care, and share information on quality. These coalitions \n     represent more than 10,000 employers.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to build off of \n     successful local employer-led health insurance initiatives by \n     improving the value of their employees' health care.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe rate of the tentative minimum tax for noncorporate taxpayers to 24 \npercent; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to provide relief to the rising number of taxpayers \nimpacted by the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Between a lack of \nindexing for inflation and higher AMT tax rates relative to the regular \nincome tax system, we now have a tax system which has grown far beyond \nits intended result. Important changes must be made to address these \ntwo critical issues. Absent legislative action, the number of taxpayers \nsubject to AMT liability will continue to rise sharply. The AMT Rate \nReduction Act of 2007 would bring the AMT back ``in line'' with the \nregular individual income tax by reducing its rate back to 24 percent. \nCombined with the continued extension of the AMT exemption, this \nproposal would remove millions of unintended middle-class taxpayers \nfrom the AMT rolls.\n  The AMT functions as a parallel tax system to the regular income tax \nso that when a taxpayer's AMT liability exceeds their regular income \ntax liability, that person must pay the AMT. The AMT is set up to \nensure that high-income taxpayers pay their fair share by denying \ncertain deductions and exemptions available under the regular income \ntax. However, the AMT is now hitting the middle class--and hitting them \nhard.\n  It is important to keep in mind that the first version of the AMT was \ncreated in 1969 in response to a small number of high-income \nindividuals who had paid little or no federal income taxes. In 2006, \n3.5 million taxpayers will be subject to the AMT, and that number will \ncontinue to increase sharply in the coming decade. In Pennsylvania \nalone, 79,000 individuals filed their returns under the AMT in 2003, \naccounting for 1.37 percet of all Pennsylvania returns; 114,000 \nPennsylvania returns were filed under the AMT in 2004, accounting for \n1.97 percent of all Pennsylvania returns; and 137,486 Pennsylvania \nreturns were filed under the AMT in 2005.\n  This onerous tax is slapped on average American families largely \nbecause the AMT is not indexed for inflation, while the regular income \ntax is indexed, and taxpayers are ``pushed'' into the AMT through so-\ncalled ``bracket creep.'' Temporary increases in the AMT exemption \namounts expired at the end of 2006. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001 increased the AMT exemption amount effective \nfor tax years between 2001 and 2004; the Working Families Tax Relief \nAct of 2004 extended the previous increase in the AMT exemption amounts \nthrough 2005; and the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of \n2005 increased the AMT exemption amount for 2006. If we do not again \nadjust the AMT exemption amount, it is estimated that the number of \ntaxpayers subject to the AMT will jump from 3.5 million in 2006 to 23 \nmillion in 2007, with middle-income taxpayers most affected. In \nPennsylvania alone, that number will jump drastically to 837,000 in \n2007. According to the Congressional Research Service, taxpayers\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\nfiling joint returns with no dependents will be subject to the AMT \nstarting at income levels of $75,386. Large families will be subject to \nthe AMT at income levels as low as $49,438.\n  In addition to the issue of indexing the AMT exemption amount for \ninflation, the AMT tax rate relative to the regular income tax must \nalso be addressed to keep additional taxpayers who were never intended \nto pay the AMT from being subject to its burdensome grasp. In 1993, \nPresident Clinton and a Democrat-controlled Congress imposed a \nsignificant tax hike on Americans through the regular income tax. At \nthe same time, the AMT tax rate was also increased from 24 percent to \n26 percent for taxable income under $175,000 and from 24 percent to 28 \npercent for taxable income that exceeds $175,000. In theory, these \nsimultaneous changes had the effect of keeping roughly the same number \nof individuals paying their taxes under the AMT. However, when \nPresident Bush's tax cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003, Congress did \nnot again adjust the AMT tax rates. Ironically, by reducing regular \nincome tax liabilities without substantially changing the AMT, many new \ntaxpayers were pushed into these higher AMT tax rates created in 1993.\n  According to an editorial in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on \nFebruary 23, 2007, entitled ``Bill Clinton's AMT Bomb,'' the number of \nfilers paying the AMT increased from 300,000 to nearly 2 million \nbetween 1992 and 2002. The WSJ also cites a Joint Committee on Taxation \n(JCT) analysis from April 2006 which shows that about 11 million more \nAmericans will have to pay the AMT next year as a result of the 1993 \nAMT rate increase. It concludes that ``going back to the pre-Clinton \nrates would leave only about 2.6 million tax filers subject to an AMT \npenalty next year instead of 23 million under current law.''\n  The most unfortunate aspect of adjusting the AMT is the associated \ncost. According to the April 2006 JCT analysis, the ten-year cost of my \nproposal, combined with extension of the AMT exemption amount, is a \nstaggering $632.7 billion. However, it is still substantially less than \nthe cost of full repeal. According to the Congressional Research \nService, it is estimated that repealing the AMT would cost, depending \non whether the recent reductions in the regular income tax are extended \nbeyond 2010, $806 billion to over $1.4 trillion from 2007 through 2016.\n  I am cognizant of the fact that Democrats in the 110th Congress will \nseek to fully offset the cost of the lost revenue resulting from any \nadjustment to the AMT. With the political realities being as such, I am \nwilling to work with my colleagues to identify reasonable offsets, if \nthey are necessary, to garner broad support for this effort. However, \nit is questionable whether an offset should be needed to recover \n``lost'' revenue that was never intended to be collected in the first \nplace.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to both simplify our tax \ncode and to identify the best avenue for keeping unintended taxpayers \nfrom falling prey to the AMT. I will continue to support the so-called \n``hold-harmless patch.'' By both extending and increasing the AMT \nexemption amount to keep up with inflation, the ``patch'' ensures that \nno additional taxpayers on the lower end of the income spectrum become \nliable for the AMT. However, I urge my colleagues to support my \nlegislation which would remove millions of additional unintended \ntaxpayers who are currently subject the AMT.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 734\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``AMT Rate Reduction Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REDUCTION IN RATE OF TENTATIVE MINIMUM TAX FOR \n                   NONCORPORATE TAXPAYERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Clause (i) of section 55(b)(1)(A) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to noncorporate \n     taxpayers) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) In general.--In the case of a taxpayer other than a \n     corporation, the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year \n     is--\n       ``(I) 24 percent of the taxable excess, reduced by\n       ``(II) the alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit for \n     the taxable year.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subparagraph (A) of section \n     55(b)(1) of such Code is amended by striking clause (iii).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, and Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 735. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to improve the \nterrorist hoax statute; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the wake of the tragic events of \nSeptember 11, Congress, the Administration and the country faced the \nurgent need to do all we can to strengthen our national security and \ncounterterrorism strategy. Soon after the attacks, Congress moved \nswiftly to enact new intelligence and law enforcement powers for the \nFederal Government through the PATRIOT Act. Since then, we have also \nenacted legislation to reform our intelligence laws, and we spent \nsignificant time re-authorizing key provisions of the PATRIOT Act last \nyear.\n  Yet, much work still needs to be done to achieve the goals of the 9/\n11 Commission. Two and a half years after its report, many of its \nrecommendations haven't been implemented and the Nation remains \nseriously unprepared for another terrorist strike. A top priority is to \nenact the pending Improving America's Security Act--an important step \nin the right direction to implement the Commission's recommendations \nand strengthen the nation's preparedness against terrorism.\n  Given the circumstances driving the passage of these measures, the \nadministration and Congress must continue to work together to assess \nwhether existing national security laws are adequate and make necessary \nimprovements when required.\n  While families in Boston, New York and across the country were still \ngrieving over the tragedy of September 11, our communities suddenly \nfaced a new threat, when anthrax contamination resulted in 5 deaths and \n20 hospitalizations across the country. As Federal, State and local law \nenforcement struggled to deal with the threat of terrorism, yet another \nchallenge arose because of reckless individuals who perpetrated hoaxes \nthat caused panic, unrest and expenditure of critical resources.\n  Since September 11 such hoaxes have seriously disrupted many lives \nand needlessly diverted law-enforcement and emergency-services \nresources. In the wake of the anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001, for \nexample, a number of individuals mailed unidentified white powder, \nintending for the recipient to believe it was anthrax. Over 150,000 \nanthrax hoaxes were reported between September 2001 and August 2002.\n  In Massachusetts, one of these hoaxes was directed at a military \nfacility. Fire trucks and hazmat responders rushed to the scene at the \nAgawam armory, only to learn that the powder spread over the armory \nequipment was not a toxic substance.\n  Hoaxes about anthrax continue to be a serious problem. Earlier this \nweek, such a scare shut down a university campus in Missouri when a \nstudent claimed to have a bomb and anthrax. It was a false alarm, but \nauthorities had no choice except to make a serious response. They \nquarantined 23 people and evacuated 6,000 students from the campus and \na nearby elementary school. The emotional and financial costs \nassociated with these hoaxes puts an extraordinary strain on our \ncommunities and resources.\n  Progress has been made to pass Federal and State laws to give \nprosecutors the authority to charge perpetrators engaging in such \nreckless conduct. Without tough and comprehensive laws on the books, \nsuccessful and fair prosecutions are much more difficult.\n  In 2004, Congress enacted the first Federal terrorism hoax statute. \nIts purpose was to establish definitions and set serious penalties to \ndeal with the problem of hoax crimes, but events have moved the need \nfor additional authority. A significant number of prosecutions have \ntaken place for individuals who disrupt communities with terrorist \nhoaxes, but a disturbing pattern has also developed of new hoaxes not \ncovered by the original law.\n\n[[Page S2502]]\n\n  A few weeks ago in Boston, advertisers using so-called ``guerrilla \ntactics'' left strange packages near sites essential for our region's \ninfrastructure. A serious response obviously had to be made, but its \ncost was high. Our public safety officials did an outstanding job in \nresponding to the threat and discovering the hoax. Boston, Cambridge, \nSomerville and other affected local governments are struggling to deal \nwith the cost and lost productivity it caused.\n  The incident highlighted the need to close the gaps in existing \nfederal law on terrorist hoaxes. The current statute only punishes \nhoaxes involving an unduly restricted list of terrorist offenses. This \nlist does not include, for example, hoaxes related to taking hostages, \nto blowing up energy facilities, attacks on military bases, or attacks \non railways and mass-transit facilities, such as the London bombings.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will punish hoaxes involving \nany terrorist offense listed in current law. It also increases the \nmaximum penalty for hoaxes involving the death or injury of a U.S. \nsoldier during wartime.\n  One such incident involved a soldier from Flagstaff, Arizona who was \nthen serving in Iraq. On a Sunday morning a prank caller devastated the \nfamily of a 22-year-old in the Army, falsely telling them their son was \ndead. The call came only hours after the soldier had appeared in an \nArizona Daily Sun photo at a Support the Troops rally.\n  The hoax was a nightmare for the family. It took them a full day to \nget confirmation that their son was still alive in Iraq. As a member of \nthe family testified, ``As a result of this ordeal, my family had been \nput in an upheaval that is unimaginable. My mother, my brother, my \nsister and everybody in my family were placed in terror and \nimmeasurable pain. My niece even went into premature labor.''\n  The consequences of this hoax went beyond the soldier's family. The \nArmy had allowed him to call home from Iraq by satellite phone to \nreassure them that he was alive and uninjured. But another soldier had \nbeen killed bringing him the satellite phone to make the call.\n  As the son wrote to his uncle: ``I have seen things words can't \ndescribe and done things I don't want to. I lost some friends out here \nloading their bodies on the truck was the worst feeling in the world. \nOne guy died bringing me a satellite phone so I could call dad to let \nhim know I was alive. It made me think of Saving Private Ryan. Was it \nworth his life and the risk of three others to bring me a phone? I know \nit was a relief to all of you to hear I was OK. Now I feel I must make \nmy life worth his. I don't know if I can do that.''\n  The person who caused such a hoax deserves to be punished. This bill \nassures that effective penalties will be imposed for similar crimes in \nthe future.\n  The bill also expands civil liability to allow first responders and \nothers to seek reimbursement from a party who knows that first \nresponders are responding to such a hoax and fails to inform \nauthorities that no such event has occurred.\n  Finally, the bill clarifies that threatening communications are \npunishable under federal law even if they are directed at an \norganization rather than a person.\n  It's unconscionable in this post-9/11 world, for anyone to be \nperpetrating hoaxes that cause panic and drain already limited public \nsafety resources.\n  All of us remember where we were and what we were doing on 9/11. We \nwill never forget the lives that were lost and the heroism of the first \nresponders. We honor all those working so hard today to prevent future \nattacks. Hopefully, this bill will fulfill its purpose of preventing \nthe false alarms that can be so disruptive of our families and our \ncommunities in these difficult and dangerous times.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, the legislation that I am introducing \ntoday along with Senator's Kennedy and Kyl will install tougher \npenalties on those who commit terrorism hoaxes. This is a very \nimportant issue to me given the September 2001 bomb threat to the Mall \nof America and because St. Paul is hosting the 2008 Republican \nConvention.\n  We need to send a clear message to those planning a terrorism hoax \nthat they will pay for it dearly by spending a number of years in \nprison. Terrorizing the public through false threats is not a joke and \nshould be treated as criminal conduct. The threats may be fake but the \nconsequences are very real in costs to first responders, lost revenues \nand sometimes the loss of human life.\n  The problem is the current federal statute only punishes hoaxes \ninvolving an unduly restricted list of terrorist offenses. This list \ndoes not include: hoaxes related to the taking of hostages in order to \ncoerce the Federal Government; hoaxes related to blowing up an energy \nfacility; hoaxes related to attacks on military bases aimed at \nundermining national defense; or hoaxes related to attacks on railways \nand mass-transportation facilities, such as the recent London bombings.\n  The Kennedy-Coleman-Kyl legislation fills these gaps by expanding the \nhoax statute to punish hoaxes involving any offense included on the \nU.S. Code's official list of federal terrorist offenses. Specifically, \nthis bill: expands on the current terrorism hoax statute so this \npunishes hoaxes about any terrorist offense on the U.S. Code's official \nlist of terrorist offenses; increases the maximum penalties for hoaxes \nabout the death or injury of a U.S. soldier during wartime; expands \ncurrent law's civil liability provisions to allow first responders and \nothers to seek reimbursement from a party who perpetrates a hoax and \nbecomes aware that first responders believe that a terrorist offense is \ntaking place but fails to inform authorities that no such event has \noccurred; and clarifies that threatening communications are punishable \nunder federal law even if they are directed at an organization rather \nthan a natural person.\n  The bill increases the penalties for perpetrating a hoax about the \ndeath, injury, or capture of a U.S. soldier during wartime. Under the \nbill, the maximum penalty for such hoax would be 10 years' \nimprisonment, and a hoax resulting in serious bodily injury could be \npunished by up to 25 years' imprisonment. I urge my colleagues to pass \nthis bipartisan measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 736. A bill to provide for the regulation and Oversight of \nlaboratory tests; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator Smith \ntoday to introduce the Laboratory Test Improvement Act. Our goal is to \nensure the quality of clinical tests used every day in hospitals and \ndoctors' offices across the country. Physicians often base medical \ndecisions on the results of such tests, and patients deserve confidence \nthat they will not be wrongly diagnosed or given the wrong pill because \nof a faulty test.\n  In this era of rapid progression in the life sciences, we are \nlearning more and more about the human genome and the genetic basis of \ndisease. Genetic tests are now available for over a thousand different \ndiseases, and the number is continuing to grow. The tests are being \nused to diagnose illnesses, predict who is most susceptible to specific \ndiseases, and identify persons who carry a genetic disease that they \ncould pass on to their children.\n  Today, doctors often apply different treatments until they find one \nthat is effective and safe for a patient. But such a trial and error \nstrategy often delays effective treatment and may well cause avoidable \nadverse events. In many cases today, however, clinical tests can enable \ndoctors to avoid such errors. Through personalized medicine and the use \nof newly developed genetic tests, doctors are able to give a particular \ndrug only to patients in whom it is very likely to be effective and \nsafe, and can avoid giving it to patients who might suffer an adverse \nreaction.\n  As additional technologies are developed and our knowledge increases, \nclinical testing will become more and more important in guiding medical \ndecisions, and it is essential for us to see that the tests meet a high \nstandard. We know, however, that patients have received the wrong \nresults from some tests. In some cases, the claims associated with \ngenetic tests are clearly dubious.\n  Last year, Senator Smith chaired a hearing by the Special Committee \non Aging on a GAO report, which found that some genetic tests sold to \nthe public have no scientific merit. Our legislation will give health \nproviders and\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\npatients the best possible information about the analytical and \nclinical validity of all clinical tests. It is our responsibility to \nguarantee that such tests are accurate and reliable, and I urge our \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 737. A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 in order to \nmeasure, compare, and improve the quality of voter access to polls and \nvoter services in the administration of Federal elections in the \nStates; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President. I am proud to introduce the Voter Advocate \nand Democracy Index Act of 2007 with the goal of having the Act help \ninform voters and State officials on how well their States are doing on \na basic set of procedural standards for making polls accessible to \nvoters and making the right to vote as easy to exercise as possible.\n  The Act would establish an Office of the Voter Advocate within the \nElection Assistance Commission that would be charged with creating a \nDemocracy Index. The Index would rank States according to a system of \nmeasurable, basic state election practices. With that information, \nStates could identify weak spots in their process, and voters could \npush for better performance.\n  The concept is based on a proposal that Yale Law School Professor \nHeather Gerken published this January in Legal Times. It focuses on \nissues that matter to all voters: How long did voters spend in line? \nHow many ballots got discarded? How often did the balloting machinery \nbreak down?\n  The Act would constitute an important first step toward improving the \nhealth of our democracy. We are all familiar with the problems that \nhave recently plagued our elections: Long lines, lost ballots, voters \nimproperly turned away from the polls. These are basic failures of \nprocess. Until we fix them, we run the risk in every election that we \nwill once again experience the kind of chaos and uncertainty that \nparalyzed the Nation in 2000. We can do better. We must do better. But \nto do better, we need more than anecdotal information. We need better, \nnonpartisan, objective information.\n  This bill would provide that information. Some voters have personally \nexperienced problems in casting a ballot; others see stories on the \nnews about election results tainted by malfunctioning machines, \ninadequate registration lists, or poorly trained administrators. I \nbelieve that these issues are merely the visible symptoms of a deeper, \nsystemic problem in the way our election system is run. But voters need \na yardstick for evaluating the full extent of the problem and what \nneeds to be done to improve the election process in their State.\n  Toward that end, this bill would charge the Office of the Voter \nAdvocate with creating the Democracy Index and specifying the success \nor failure of States in meeting the criteria that the index is going to \nmeasure. The bill also ensures that the Office of the Voter Advocate \nwill draw upon the experience and knowledge of experts and citizens in \nthinking about what information voters would want to know in evaluating \nthe health of their State's election process. And it requires the \nOffice to establish a pilot program for the 2008 election, use the \nlessons learned from that experience, and make the Index a reality \nnationwide as soon as possible.\n  The Democracy Index would encourage healthy competition among States \nto improve their systems. It would allow states to engage in healthy \nexperimentation about how best to run an election. In short, the \nDemocracy Index will empower voters and encourage States to work toward \nthe goal we all share: an election system that makes us all proud.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Coleman):\n  S. 738. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to improve the Office \nof International Trade, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as I come to the floor today to speak, \nthere are countless small businesses in the Gulf Coast, right this \nmoment, that are open for business. The fact that they are open at all \nis a testament to the hard work and resolve of their owners, along with \nthe focus and commitment of community leaders, state and local \nofficials, as well as Congress and the White House. This is because, as \nyou know, the Gulf Coast was devastated in 2005 by two of the most \npowerful storms to ever hit the United States in recorded history--\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  I strongly believe that we cannot rebuild the Gulf Coast without our \nsmall businesses. Small businesses not only create jobs and pay taxes--\nthey provide the innovation and energy that drives our economy. In \nfact, before Katrina and Rita hit, there were more than 95,000 small \nbusinesses in Louisiana, employing about 850,000 people--more than half \nof my State's workforce. About 39,000 of these businesses have yet to \nresume normal operations so I intend to do everything I can in the \ncoming months to get them back up and running.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation to first help small \nbusinesses in the Gulf recover, as well as to provide assistance to \nbusinesses in other parts of the country. In particular, this \nlegislation is focused on promoting exports by U.S. small businesses. \nSmall businesses are important players in international trade, which is \nreflected in the fact that small businesses represent that 96 percent \nof all exporters of goods and services. In Louisiana, we have about \n2,000 declared exporters. However, there are many more businesses in my \nState who conduct Internet sales overseas, as well as those who focus \noperations on domestic sales but have some international buyers as \nwell. These businesses are exporters but in many cases they do not even \nrealize it!\n  Given the importance of these exporters to my state and to the rest \nof the country, I would like to improve their competitive edge in the \ninternational market and give them every resource they need to succeed. \nCertainly my first priority is to provide additional assistance to \naffected Gulf Coast small businesses. As they continue to recover, one \nof the main issues being faced by our small business is accessing \ncapital. Our exporters are no different. They need help accessing \nexport financing to cover export-related costs such as purchasing \nequipment, purchasing inventory, or financing production costs. This \nlegislation would help strengthen the SBA International Finance \nSpecialist program to help these small businesses access export \nfinancing.\n  Today I am introducing the Small Business International Trade \nEnhancements Act of 2007 to give all small businesses the opportunity \nto expand their operations into international markets. I am pleased to \nhave Senator Kerry, the Chair of the Senate Small Business Committee, \nas well as Senator Snowe, the Ranking Member, and my colleague Senator \nColeman, as cosponsors.\n  As I mentioned we have 2,000 exporters in Louisiana. However, there \nare many other businesses who are exporters, but they do not even \nrealize it. They may have overseas Internet sales, or they focus \noperations on domestic sales, but have some international buyers as \nwell. In fact, the Small Business Administration has stated that over \n96 percent of all exporters of goods and services are small businesses.\n  Given the importance of these exporters to my State and to the rest \nof the Gulf Coast, I would like to improve their competitive edge in \nthe international market and give them every resource they need to \nsucceed. As they continue to recover, one of the main issues being \nfaced by our small business is accessing capital. Our exporters are no \ndifferent. They need help accessing export financing to cover export-\nrelated costs such as purchasing equipment, purchasing inventory, or \nfinancing production costs.\n  To assist these businesses, fifteen SBA Finance Specialists operate \nout of 100 U.S. Export Assistance Centers administered by the \nDepartment of Commerce around the country. That is a record staffing \nlow for this program, down from a peak of 22 Finance Specialists in \n2000. To ensure that all smaller exporters nationwide will continue to \nhave access to export financing, this bill establishes a floor of 18 \nInternational Finance Specialists. I believe this will send a signal to \nour exporters that, despite current budget\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\ndeficits, we are committed to our exporters and want to provide them \nwith the necessary resources to compete internationally.\n  I realize that the need for export financing is not just limited to \nthe Gulf Coast. There are small businesses nationwide that are looking \nto find markets overseas. One tool that they can use is the SBA's \nInternational Trade Loan (ITL) program. International Trade Loans can \nhelp exporters develop and expand overseas markets; upgrade equipment \nor facilities; and assist exporters that are being hurt by import \ncompetition. Exporters can borrow up to $2 million, with $1,750,000 \nguaranteed by SBA.\n  However, as currently structured these loans are not user-friendly to \nlenders or borrowers and, as a result, are underutilized. Let me \nexplain what I mean. First, the $250,000 difference between the loan \ncap and the guarantee requires borrowers to take out a second SBA loan \nto take full advantage of the $2 million guarantee. ITLs can only be \nused to acquire fixed assets and not working capital, a common need for \nexporters. Furthermore, ITLs do not have the same collateral or \nrefinancing requirements as SBA 7(a) loans. Because of these issues, \nlenders do not use these loans.\n  This legislation will also reduce the paperwork by increasing the \nmaximum loan guarantee to $2,750,000 and the loan cap to $3,670,000 to \nbring it more in line with the 7(a) program. The bill also creates a \nmore flexible ITL by setting out that working capital is an eligible \nuse for loan proceeds, in addition to making the ITL consistent with \nregular 7(a) loans by allowing the same collateral and refinancing \nterms as with 7(a).\n  The SBA International Trade and Export Loans are valuable tools for \nexporters but they are useless if there is no one to assist borrowers \nwith identifying which loans are right for them. Local lending \ninstitutions that specialize in export financing can help but at a cost \nover less than $2 million per year, the current group of Finance \nSpecialists has obtained bank financing for more than $10 billion in \nU.S. exports since 1999. The $10 billion in export sales financed by \nthese specialists helped to create over 140,000 new, high-paying U.S. \njobs.\n  The Small Business International Trade Enhancements Act of 2007 is an \nimportant first step, not just for exporters in the Gulf Coast, but \nalso for small businesses nationwide who are looking to open markets \noverseas. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation since it \nwill help our exporters in the Gulf Coast recover and also give small \nbusinesses nationwide more options when they are seeking export \nfinancing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 738\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide disadvantaged children with access to \ndental services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation \nentitled the Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2007, along \nwith several of my colleagues. This legislation is designed to improve \nthe access and delivery of dental health services to our Nation's \nchildren through Medicaid, through the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, SCHIP, through the Indian Health Services, or IHS, \nand also through our Nation's safety net of community health centers.\n  The oral health problems facing children in this country are \nwidespread. They are closely associated with poverty. Tooth decay \nremains the single most common childhood disease nationwide. Although \npoor children are more than twice as likely to have cavities as \nwealthier children, experts report that they are far less likely to \nreceive treatment. The dramatic consequences of this lack of oral \nhealth care were underscored yesterday in the Washington Post article \ndiscussing the death of 12-year-old Deamonte Driver from complications \narising from a lack of dental care. I know Senator Cardin has spoken on \nthis same tragic incident.\n  A little over a month ago, Deamonte Driver came home complaining of a \ntoothache. Today, that young man is dead. What began as a simple \ntoothache developed into an abscessed tooth and, eventually, a brain \ninfection that killed him. Although his family attempted to access \ncare, they could not acquire meaningful oral health services either \nwhen they were on the Medicaid Program or while they were uninsured.\n  While this young man's death is shocking, the lack of access to \ndental care that it reflects is not unusual. The inspector general of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services reported that only 18 \npercent of the children who are eligible for Medicaid actually received \neven a single preventive dental service. The inspector general also \nreports that there is no State in the Union that provides preventive \nservices to more than 50 percent of the eligible children. The factors \nare complex, but the primary one is due to the limited participation by \ndentists in the Medicaid Program because of the very low reimbursement \nrates that are provided. Such issues played a central role in the death \nof this young man.\n  The Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2007 provides a \ncomprehensive strategy to address the underlying oral health issues \nthat led to Deamonte's death. First, the legislation provides grants to \nStates to improve dental services to children enrolled in Medicaid and \nSCHIP. Such grants will not only assure improved delivery of dental \nservices to children but also improved payment rates for dental \nservices that are provided through those two programs. The bill will \nalso include grants to federally qualified health centers, to county \nand local public health departments, to dental schools, Indian tribes, \ntribal corporation organizations, and others to increase the \navailability of primary dental care services in underserved areas.\n  The bill also provides critical bonus payments to dentists within the \nIndian Health Service who commit to work there for 2, 3, or 4 years. \nThe legislation also ensures SCHIP funds will be utilized to provide \ncoverage for dental services for low-income children who have access to \nlimited health insurance coverage that does not include dental \nservices. This is known as wraparound coverage, and it is crucial that \nwe provide for this.\n  In addition, the bill would make important changes to the way in \nwhich dental residents are counted for Medicare graduate medical \neducation or GME purposes to incentivize dental schools to train a \nlarger number of dentists.\n  Finally, the legislation also creates a comprehensive oral health \ninitiative aimed at reducing oral health disparities for vulnerable \npopulations such as low-income children and children with developmental \ndisabilities. Such activities will be administered through the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease \nControl, and a newly established chief dental officer for Medicaid and \nSCHIP. Such activities will also include school-based dental sealant \nprograms as well as basic oral health promotion.\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\n  I introduce the legislation in the hope that this Congress will act \nthis year to ensure that Deamonte's death does not repeat itself, that \nno more of America's children will suffer needlessly or even, as in \nthis case, die as a result of a lack of access to meaningful oral \nhealth care. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n  I would like to thank the American Dental Association, the American \nDental Education Association, the American Academy of Pediatric \nDentistry, the National Association of Community Health Centers, Inc., \nthe National Association of Children's Hospitals, the American Dental \nHygienists' Association, and the Children's Dental Health Project for \ntheir outstanding support and/or their technical advice on this \nlegislation. This bill is a result of their outstanding work.\n  In particular, I want to thank Dr. Burt Edelstein, Libby Mullin, and \nAnn De Biasi of the Children's Dental Health Project for their vast \nknowledge and technical assistance on this issue.

After two operations and more than six weeks of \n     hospital care, the Prince George's County boy died.\n       Deamonte's death and the ultimate cost of his care, which \n     could total more than $250,000, underscore an often-\n     overlooked concern in the debate over universal health \n     coverage: dental care.\n       Some poor children have no dental coverage at all. Others \n     travel three hours to find a dentist willing to take Medicaid \n     patients and accept the incumbent paperwork. And some, \n     including Deamonte's brother, get in for a tooth cleaning but \n     have trouble securing an oral surgeon to fix deeper problems.\n       In spite of efforts to change the system, fewer than one in \n     three children in Maryland's Medicaid program received any \n     dental service at all in 2005, the latest year for which \n     figures are available from the Federal Centers for Medicare \n     and Medicaid Services.\n       The figures were worse elsewhere in the region. In the \n     District, 29.3 percent got treatment, and in Virginia, 24.3 \n     percent were treated, although all three jurisdictions say \n     they have done a better job reaching children in recent \n     years.\n       ``I certainly hope the state agencies responsible for \n     making sure these children have dental care take note so that \n     Deamonte didn't die in vain,'' said Laurie Norris, a lawyer \n     for the Baltimore-based Public Justice Center who tried to \n     help the Driver family. ``They know there is a problem, and \n     they have not devoted adequate resources to solving it.''\n       Maryland officials emphasize that the delivery of basic \n     care has improved greatly since 1997, when the state \n     instituted a managed care program, and 1998, when legislation \n     that provided more money and set standards for access to \n     dental care for poor children was enacted.\n       About 900 of the state's 5,500 dentists accept Medicaid \n     patients, said Arthur Fridley, last year's president of the \n     Maryland State Dental Association. Referring patients to \n     specialists can be particularly difficult.\n       Fewer than 16 percent of Maryland's Medicaid children \n     received restorative services--such as filling cavities--in \n     2005, the most recent year for which figures are available.\n       For families such as the Drivers, the systemic problems are \n     often compounded by personal obstacles: lack of \n     transportation, bouts of homelessness and erratic telephone \n     and mail service.\n       The Driver children have never received routine dental \n     attention, said their mother, Alyce Driver. The bakery, \n     construction and home health-care jobs she has held have not \n     provided insurance. The children's Medicaid coverage had \n     temporarily lapsed at the time Deamonte was hospitalized. And \n     even with Medicaid's promise of dental care, the problem, she \n     said, was finding it.\n       When Deamonte got sick, his mother had not realized that \n     his tooth had been bothering him. Instead, she was focusing \n     on his younger brother, 10-year-old DaShawn, who ``complains \n     about his teeth all the time,'' she said.\n       DaShawn saw a dentist a couple of years ago, but the \n     dentist discontinued the treatments, she said, after the boy \n     squirmed too much in the chair. Then the family went through \n     a crisis and spent some time in an Adelphi homeless shelter. \n     From there, three of Driver's sons went to stay with their \n     grandparents in a two-bedroom mobile home in Clinton.\n       By September, several of DaShawn's teeth had become \n     abscessed. Driver began making calls about the boy's coverage \n     but grew frustrated. She turned to Norris, who was working \n     with homeless families in Prince George's.\n       Norris and her staff also ran into barriers: They said they \n     made more than two dozen calls before reaching an official at \n     the Driver family's Medicaid provider and a state supervising \n     nurse who helped them find a dentist.\n       On Oct. 5, DaShawn saw Arthur Fridley, who cleaned the \n     boy's teeth, took an X-ray and referred him to an oral \n     surgeon. But the surgeon could not see him until Nov. 21, and \n     that would be only for a consultation. Driver said she \n     learned that DaShawn would need six teeth extracted and made \n     an appointment for the earliest date available: Jan. 16.\n       But she had to cancel after learning Jan. 8 that the \n     children had lost their Medicaid coverage a month earlier. \n     She suspects that the paperwork to confirm their eligibility \n     was mailed to the shelter in Adelphi, where they no longer \n     live.\n       It was on Jan. 11 that Deamonte came home from school \n     complaining of a headache. At Southern Maryland Hospital \n     Center, his mother said, he got medicine for a headache, \n     sinusitis and a dental abscess. But the next day, he was much \n     sicker.\n       Eventually, he was rushed to Children's Hospital, where he \n     underwent emergency brain surgery. He began to have seizures \n     and had a second operation. The problem tooth was extracted.\n       After more than 2 weeks of care at Children's Hospital, the \n     Clinton seventh-grader began undergoing 6 weeks of additional \n     medical treatment as well as physical and occupational \n     therapy at another hospital. He seemed to be mending slowly, \n     doing math problems and enjoying visits with his brothers and \n     teachers from his school, the Foundation School in Largo.\n       On Saturday, their last day together, Deamonte refused to \n     eat but otherwise appeared happy, his mother said. They \n     played cards and watched a show on television, lying together \n     in his hospital bed. But after she left him that evening, he \n     called her.\n       ``Make sure you pray before you go to sleep,'' he told her.\n       The next morning at about 6, she got another call, this \n     time from the boy's grandmother. Deamonte was unresponsive. \n     She rushed back to the hospital.\n\n[[Page S2507]]\n\n       ``When I got there, my baby was gone,'' recounted his \n     mother.\n       She said doctors are still not sure what happened to her \n     son. His death certificate listed two conditions associated \n     with brain infections: ``meningoencephalitis'' and ``subdural \n     empyema.''\n       In spite of such modern innovations as the fluoridation of \n     drinking water, tooth decay is still the single most common \n     childhood disease nationwide, five times as common as asthma, \n     experts say. Poor children are more than twice as likely to \n     have cavities as their more affluent peers, research shows, \n     but far less likely to get treatment.\n       Serious and costly medical consequences are ``not \n     uncommon,'' said Norman Tinanoff, chief of pediatric \n     dentistry at the University of Maryland Dental School in \n     Baltimore. For instance, Deamonte's bill for two weeks at \n     Children's alone was expected to be between $200,000 and \n     $250,000.\n       The federal government requires states to provide oral \n     health services to children through Medicaid programs, but \n     the shortage of dentists who will treat indigent patients \n     remains a major barrier to care, according to the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures.\n       Access is worst in rural areas, where some families travel \n     hours for dental care, Tinanoff said. In the Maryland General \n     Assembly this year, lawmakers are considering a bill that \n     would set aside $2 million a year for the next three years to \n     expand public clinics where dental care remains a rarity for \n     the poor.\n       Providing such access, Tinanoff and others said, eventually \n     pays for itself, sparing children the pain and expense of a \n     medical crisis.\n       Reimbursement rates for dentists remain low nationally, \n     although Maryland, Virginia and the District have increased \n     their rates in recent years.\n       Dentists also cite administrative frustrations dealing with \n     the Medicaid bureaucracy and the difficulties of serving \n     poor, often transient patients, a study by the state \n     legislatures conference found.\n       ``Whatever we've got is broke,'' Fridley said. ``It has \n     nothing to do with access to care for these children.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 739\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish in the Department of Commerce an Under \nSecretary for United States Direct Investment, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Invest USA \nAct of 2007 with my colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar.\n  Our legislation creates a United States Direct Investment \nAdministration, USDIA, within the Department of Commerce, to be led by \nan Under Secretary of Commerce for United States Direct Investment. \nThis new agency will coordinate efforts to attract more foreign direct \ninvestment in the United States, thereby making our economy more \ncompetitive by encouraging multinational businesses to open new \nfacilities or expand existing operations here, rather than elsewhere.\n  Specifically, our legislation tasks the new agency with five \nprincipal duties. First, USDIA will collect and analyze data concerning \ndirect investment flows into both the United States and other \ncountries.\n  Second, USDIA will publish an annual direct investment report for \nCongress. This report sets forth the data that USDIA collects and \nanalyzes in the course of its work, identifying best practices in \nattracting direct investment at the Federal, State, and regional \nlevels, as well as those used by other advanced industrialized \ncountries.\n  Third, USDIA will publish an annual direct investment agenda to make \nstrategic policy recommendations based on the direct investment report. \nIt will also act as the lead agency within a broader interagency Direct \nInvestment Promotion Committee, which will advocate and implement \nUSDIA's strategic policy recommendations. For example, as part of this \nwork, it will create and maintain an internet-accessible database of \ndirect investment opportunities in the United States.\n  Fourth, the legislation requires USDIA to focus on direct investment \nin critical high-technology industries throughout the course of its \nwork.\n  The United States continues to be the premier place in the world to \nlocate a business. However, in an increasingly globalized world, where \nthe factors of production can easily migrate from country to country, \nwe can no longer passively rely on our inherent competitive advantages \nalone. We must actively publicize them.\n  Many countries, particularly those in Europe, have committed \nsignificant resources to recruiting foreign direct investment. For \nexample, in many cases, our competitors maintain offices in the United \nStates, where they regularly meet with American business leaders, \nencouraging them to consider locating facilities in their country.\n  Currently, the United States lacks any comparable program to entice \nmultinational businesses to invest and create jobs here. Instead, we \nrelegate direct investment promotion to economic development agencies \nat the State, regional, and local level. Although these local economic \ndevelopment agencies make valiant efforts to attract direct investment, \nour lack of a national strategy creates two problems.\n  First, too often, these local economic development agencies suffer \nfrom limited resources, which dwindle even further if the locality is \nsuffering from an economic downturn due to a plant closing or for other \nreasons. Second, the dominance of State and local agencies creates the \nimpression of an uncoordinated patchwork in the minds of foreign \nbusiness executives. Consequently, State and local economic development \nagencies are too often unable to perform their recruitment missions \neffectively. The Invest USA Act addresses these flaws by creating and \nfunding USDIA, which can act as a one-stop shop for multinational \nbusinesses seeking to establish new operations or expand existing ones.\n  Of course, we need to continue to focus on persuading U.S. businesses \nto stay in this country. But we also need to launch a concurrent, \nrobust effort to encourage multinational businesses to establish or \nmove facilities to our country. The end result is the same: more jobs \nfor U.S. workers.\n  According to the Organization for International Investment, direct \ninvestment in the U.S. totaled $128.6 billion in 2005, an increase of \n20 percent from the previous year, and according to the latest \navailable Government data, as of December 31, 2004, U.S. subsidiaries \nof foreign multinationals employed approximately 5.1 million American \nworkers, or 4.7 percent of the workforce. Moreover, according to the \nlatest available Department of Commerce data, average per-worker \ncompensation paid by U.S. subsidiaries of foreign multinationals in \n2004 was $63,428, over 32 percent higher than compensation at U.S. \ncompanies as a whole.\n  Senator Lugar and I believe that with a proactive, strategically \nfocused effort at the Federal level, we can do even better at \nattracting the best jobs to our country.

A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act to establish a grant program to ensure waterfront access \nfor commercial fishermen, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, all along our Nation's coasts there are \nharbors that were once full of the hustle and bustle associated with \nthe fishing industry. Unfortunately, there has been an erosion of the \nvital infrastructure, known as our working waterfronts, that is so \ncritical to our commercial fishing industries. To better preserve these \nwaterfront areas, I have drafted legislation that will help to protect \ncommercial access to our waterfronts and to support the fishing \nindustry's role in our maritime heritage.\n  When constituents have called asking me to help them in their efforts \nto stop the loss of their fishing businesses and the communities built \naround this industry, I realized more needed to be done to preserve and \nincrease waterfront access for the commercial fishing industry. \nCurrently, there is no Federal program to promote and protect the \nworking waterfronts other than identifying some grant programs that \nmight apply. There is an immediate need to protect our working \nwaterfronts since we are losing more of them every week, and quite \nsimply, once lost, these vital economic and community hubs of \ncommercial fishing activity cannot be replaced.\n  I rise today to re-introduce a bill I originally proposed in the \n109th Congress--the Working Waterfront Preservation Act. This \nlegislation would create a program to support our Nation's commercial \nfishing families and the coastal communities that are at risk of losing \ntheir fishing businesses.\n  I can illustrate the need for such a program by describing the loss \nof commercial waterfront access occurring in Maine. Only 25 of Maine's \n3,500 miles of coastline are devoted to commercial access. We are \ncontinually seeing portions of Maine's working waterfront being sold \noff to the highest bidder--with large vacation homes and condominiums \nrising in places that our fishing industry used to call home.\n\n  The reasons for the loss of Maine's working waterfront are complex. \nIn some cases, burdensome fishing regulations have led to a decrease in \nlandings, hindering the profitability of shore-side infrastructure, \nlike the Portland Fish Exchange. In other cases, soaring land values \nand rising taxes have made the current use of commercial land \nunprofitable. Property is being sold and quickly converted into private \nspaces and second homes that are no longer the center of economic \nactivity.\n  Maine's lack of commercial waterfront prompted the formation of a \n``Working Waterfront Coalition.'' This coalition is comprised of an \nimpressive number of industry associations, non- profit groups, and \nstate agencies, who came together to preserve Maine's working \nwaterfront. The coalition identified eighteen projects that would \nincrease Maine's available working waterfront. These eighteen sites \nwould create or preserve more than 875 jobs.\n  I'm pleased to note that the Working Waterfront Coalition has been \nsuccessful in contributing to the creation of two programs in Maine. \nThe first is a State tax incentive for property owners to keep their \nland in its current working waterfront condition. The second is a pilot \nprogram for grant funding to secure and preserve working waterfront \nareas. I am proud that the State of Maine has taken positive action to \nsave its waterfront infrastructure and is a model for other States in \nthe country facing this problem.\n  However, we must press on with this priority. The loss of commercial \nwaterfront access affects the fishing industry throughout all coastal \nStates. Pick up a newspaper in one of our coastal States, and you will \nread about this struggle. Fishermen in Galilee, RI are being pushed \naway from the waterfronts as their profitability shrinks and land \nvalues soar. The Los Angeles Times ran a story on the disappearance of \nworking waterfronts in Florida. That State has also since enacted a law \nto protect their working waterfronts. Washington State struggles to \nbalance working waterfronts with increased development pressure. \nAnother region of the country that this bill would benefit is the Gulf \nCoast. This legislation would assist the victims of Hurricane Katrina \nin rebuilding their shore-side infrastructure destroyed in the storm.\n\n  And modest federal investment could do so much to save these areas. \nPreservation of the working waterfront is essential to protect a way of \nlife that is unique to our coastal States and is vital to economic \ndevelopment along the coast. This bill targets this problem, as no \nFederal program exists to assist States like Maine, Florida, \nWashington, and Louisiana.\n  The Working Waterfront Preservation Act would assist by providing \nFederal grant funding to municipal and State governments, non-profit \norganizations, and fishermen's cooperatives for the purchase of \nproperty or easements or for the maintenance of working waterfront \nfacilities. The bill contains a $50 million authorization for grants \nthat would require a 25 percent local match. Applications for grants \nwould be considered by both the Department of Commerce and state \nfisheries agencies, which have the local expertise to understand the \nneeds of each coastal State. Grant recipients would agree not to \nconvert coastal properties to noncommercial uses, as a condition of \nreceiving federal assistance.\n  This legislation also has a tax component included. When properties \nor easements are purchased, sellers would only be taxed on half of the \ngain they receive from this sale. Taxing only half of the gain on \nconservation sales is a proposal that has been advanced by the \nPresident in all of his budget proposals. This is a vital aspect of my \nbill because it would diminish the pressure to quickly sell waterfront \nproperty that would then, most likely, be converted to noncommercial \nuses, and would increase the incentives for sellers to take part in \nthis grant program. This is especially important given that the \napplication process for federal grants does not keep pace with the \ncoastal real estate market.\n  This legislation is crucial for our Nation's commercial fisheries, \nwhich are coming under increasing pressures from many fronts. This new \ngrant program would preserve important commercial infrastructure and \npromote economic development along our coast. I am committed to \ncreating a Federal mechanism to preserve working waterfronts and will \npursue this legislation during the 110th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 744. A bill to provide greater public safety by making more \nspectrum available to public safety, to establish the Public Safety \nInteroperable Communications Working Group to provide standards for \npublic safety spectrum needs, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nSpectrum Availability for Emergency-Response and Law-Enforcement to \nImprove Vital Emergency Services Act, otherwise known as the SAVE LIVES \nAct. The bill would provide public safety with the ability to use an \nadditional\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\n30 MHz of radio spectrum for a new nationwide public safety state-of-\nthe-art broadband network. This would allow police, fire, sheriffs, and \nother medical and emergency professionals the ability to communicate \nusing a modern and reliable broadband network, thereby allowing for \ninteroperable communications between local, State and Federal first \nresponders during emergencies.\n  The 9/11 Commission's Final Report states that: ``Command and control \ndecisions were affected by the lack of knowledge of what was happening \n30, 60, 90, and 100 floors above'' due to the inability of police and \nfirefighters to communicate using their hand held radios. The Final \nReport recommended the ``expedited and increased assignment of radio \nspectrum to public safety entities'' to resolve the problem. This bill \nwould finally implement fully the recommendation.\n  Let me be clear: the Federal Government has made many strides in \ndeveloping a comprehensive, interoperable emergency communications \nplan, setting equipment standards, funding the purchase of \ninteroperable communications equipment, and belatedly making additional \nradio spectrum available. But none of this is enough. We will not solve \nour Nation's interoperability crisis until all emergency personnel \ninvolved in responding to an incident are able to communicate \nseamlessly, and that is what this legislation is intended to \naccomplish.\n  I have been working on this issue for many years. Ten years ago, \nwhile serving as Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, I \nintroduced the Law Enforcement and Public Safety Telecommunications \nEmpowerment Act, which would have provided public safety with 24 MHz in \nthe 700 MHz band and authorized 10 percent of proceeds from an auction \nof spectrum to commercial companies to be used to fund State and local \nlaw enforcement communications. Although my bill did not pass, Congress \ndid require this spectrum to be allocated to public safety in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Unfortunately, this spectrum was encumbered by television \nbroadcasters who refused to move despite broadcasters being given other \nspectrum in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The television \nbroadcasters persuaded some members of Congress to slip into the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 a provision that allowed for broadcasters \nto retain their new spectrum and use the spectrum dedicated to public \nsafety for an indefinite time.\n  Rightly, public safety fought the broadcasters' ``spectrum \nsquatting'' and asked Congress to set a firm date for broadcasters to \nprovide public safety spectrum. I was happy to support them in the \nfight.\n  During the 108th Congress, I introduced a bill that would have \nprovided public safety with this spectrum by January 1, 2008. The bill \nwas not considered by the Senate. I also introduced an amendment to the \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to set a firm \ndate for the delivery of this spectrum, but it was strongly opposed \nthanks to the broadcasters.\n  In October 2005, the Commerce Committee debated a firm date as part \nof the Budget Reconciliation Act of 2006. I offered an amendment to \nmake the spectrum available by January 2007, but it was shot down by a \nvote of 17-5. I then took an amendment to the floor which was defeated \nby a vote of 30-69. Congress did finally set the date of February 17, \n2009--date that is too late in my opinion.\n  I have not only been concerned about public safety not receiving \nspectrum in a timely manner, but also not receiving enough spectrum. In \n2004, I offered an amendment that was included in the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which required the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) to study the short-term and long-term spectrum needs of public \nsafety. In December 2005, the FCC delivered their report. While the \nreport did not contain a specific amount of spectrum necessary to aid \npublic safety interoperability, it did state, `` . . . . emergency \nresponse providers would benefit from the development of an integrated, \ninteroperable nationwide network capable of delivering broadband \nservices throughout the country.'' DHS has never provided its report to \nCongress.\n  The FCC's recommendation became all too apparent during the horrors \nof Hurricane Katrina. First responders in Louisiana were unable to \ncommunicate with each other during their response and recovery efforts \nbecause New Orleans and the three nearby parishes all used different \nradio equipment and frequencies. To make matters worse, Federal \nofficials responding to the area used an entirely different \ncommunications system than the local first responders, which hindered \nrelief efforts. New Orleans officials had purchased equipment that \nwould allow some patching between local and Federal radio systems, but \nthat equipment was rendered useless by flooding. Nonetheless, short \nterm solutions to link incompatible systems are not the right approach \nto this critical problem. A better approach is for this Nation and its \nrepresentatives to get serious about public safety communications by \ndeveloping an interoperable communications network for all local, \nstate, regional and Federal first responders that can carry voice and \ndata communications.\n  I believe the SAVE LIVES bill provides that comprehensive and serious \napproach. The bill would establish a national policy for public safety \nspectrum, directing that the 24 MHz allocated by Congress to public \nsafety in 1997 be used for state, local and regional interoperability \nand that the 30 MHz in the 700 MHz band be available as needed for a \nnational, interoperable public safety broadband network by local, \nState, regional and Federal first responders. These two networks would \nbe interoperable, thereby allowing local, State, regional and Federal \nfirst responders to communicate. Congress has deemed spectrum in the \n700 MHz band ``ideal'' for public safety communications because it can \ntravel great distances and penetrate thick walls.\n\n  The day before our Nation experienced the worst act of terrorism on \nour soil, the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee completed an \n850-page study of public safety spectrum requirements and recommended \nthat 97.5 MHz of additional spectrum be made available for public \nsafety. In 1997, Congress set aside 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz \nband for public safety use, but due to television broadcasters refusal \nto relocate from that spectrum, public safety will not have full use of \nthe spectrum until February 2009. However, public safety states that \nthe 24 MHz is not enough. Just last month, Fire Chief Charles Werner of \nVirginia testified before the Senate Commerce Committee that an \nadditional 70 MHz may be needed by 2011.\n  The bill also would establish a ``Public Safety Interoperable Working \nGroup'' (the Working Group) to establish user driven specifications for \npublic safety's use of the 30 MHz and then require the FCC to auction \nthe 30 MHz under a ``conditional license'' that requires any winning \nbidder to meet public safety's specifications to operate a national, \ninteroperable public safety broadband network. If there is no winning \nbidder, then the license to the 30 MHz will revert to public safety, \nwhich could then use the spectrum for a national, interoperable public \nsafety broadband network and work with the FCC to auction excess non-\nemergency capacity.\n  To ensure public safety is using the spectrum effectively and \nefficiently, the bill would require the FCC to review public safety's \nuse of the 24 MHz to determine whether it could handle a national \ninteroperable broadband network in addition to local, state and \nregional networks as technology improves. The bill would also require \nthe FCC, DHS and public safety to review the possibility of moving most \npublic safety communications to the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands thereby \nenhancing interoperability.\n  As required by Congress, the FCC is slated to auction spectrum in the \n700 MHz band by January 28, 2008. Except for the 24 MHz allocated to \npublic safety, the remaining spectrum will be auctioned to commercial \nproviders unless Congress dictates otherwise. Therefore any use of the \n30 MHz by public safety must be considered quickly by Congress as the \nFCC would need to begin developing the rules for a conditional license \nby early fall to ensure that the auction date is not delayed.\n  Late last year, the FCC stated, ``The availability of a nationwide, \ninteroperable, broadband communication network for public safety \nsubstantially\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\ncould enhance the ability of public safety entities to respond to \nemergency situations . . . yet only 2.6 MHz is designated for \nnationwide interoperable communications in the 700 MHz public safety \nband.'' This is unacceptable and that is why I believe the SAVE LIVES \nAct would solve the interoperability crisis that faces our country.\n  We cannot survive another disaster such as 9/11 or Katrina without \nreforming our Nation's interoperable communications. I fought for many \nyears to clear the 700 MHz spectrum for first responders and now that \nthere is a firm date for the availability of this spectrum, we should \nensure that a sufficient amount of spectrum is being provided to first \nresponders. Again, this spectrum is slated to be auctioned in January \n2008 to commercial entities, so if Congress does not act now to ensure \nthat public safety can have some reasonable access to this valuable \nspectrum, it will be auctioned off without any consideration to our \nNation's interoperability crisis and this opportunity will be lost \nforever.\n  I know some critics would rather all of this spectrum be auctioned \nsolely for commercial applications, such as wireless Internet surfing, \ninstant messaging and phone services. I can assure you, I do not lay \nawake at night wondering why my children can't surf the Internet on \ntheir cell phone from any location at any time, but I do worry about \nwhether we will be adequately prepared to respond to the next disaster.\n  I can only imagine how many lives could have been saved during 9/11 \nhad this spectrum been available and I can only imagine how many \nvictims of Hurricane Katrina could have been rescued sooner if only \npolice, fire fighters and other emergency personnel had been able to \ncommunicate with each other. But instead of imagining, we have an \nobligation to act. We can have a national, interoperable communications \nsystem available to first responders by 2009 if we act now to make this \nspectrum available to public safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the SAVE LIVES Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 745. A bill to provide for increased export assistance staff in \nareas in which the President declared a major disaster as a result of \nHurricane Katrina of 2005 and Hurricane Rita of 2005; to the Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as I come to the floor today to speak, \nthere are countless small businesses in the Gulf Coast, right this \nmoment, that are open for business. The fact that they are open at all \nis a testament to the hard work and resolve of their owners, along with \nthe focus and commitment of community leaders, state and local \nofficials, as well as Congress and the White House. This is because, as \nyou know, the Gulf Coast was devastated in 2005 by two of the most \npowerful storms to ever hit the United States in recorded history--\nHurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  I strongly believe that we cannot rebuild the Gulf Coast without our \nsmall businesses. Small businesses not only create jobs and pay taxes--\nthey provide the innovation and energy that drives our economy. In \nfact, before Katrina and Rita hit, there were more than 95,000 small \nbusinesses in Louisiana, employing about 850,000 people--more than half \nof my State's workforce. About 39,000 of these businesses have yet to \nresume normal operations so I intend to do everything I can in the \ncoming months to get them back up and running.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation to help provide the \nnecessary staff to help our small businesses in the Gulf recover from \nthe devastating storms of 2005. In particular, this legislation is \nfocused on promoting exports by small businesses Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama. Small businesses are important players in \ninternational trade, which is reflected in the fact that small \nbusinesses represent that 96 percent of all exporters of goods and \nservices In Louisiana, we have about 2,000 declared exporters. However, \nthere are many more businesses in my state who conduct Internet sales \noverseas, as well as those who focus operations on domestic sales but \nhave some international buyers as well. These businesses are exporters \nbut in many cases they do not even realize it!\n  Given the importance of these exporters to my State and to the rest \nof the country, I would like to improve their competitive edge in the \ninternational market and give them every resource they need to succeed. \nAs our businesses continue to recover, one of the main issues being \nfaced by our small businesses is accessing capital. They need help \naccessing export financing to cover export-related costs such as \npurchasing equipment, purchasing inventory, or financing production \ncosts.\n  To assist businesses with obtaining export financing, fifteen SBA \nFinance Specialists operate out of 100 U.S. Export Assistance Centers \nadministered by the Department of Commerce around the country. However, \ndespite the increased need for export financing in the Gulf Coast, \nthere is currently no International Finance Specialist located in any \nof the hardest hit States of Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. \nInstead there is one specialist in Texas with responsibility for Texas, \nOklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana and one specialist in Georgia \nresponsible for Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi. \nDue to the extensive territories they cover and limited travel budgets \nof the staff, these specialists must divide their time and cannot focus \non the needs of Gulf Coast small businesses.\n  With this in mind, this legislation would provide an SBA \nInternational Finance Specialist to the New Orleans U.S. Export \nAssistance Center with responsibility for Louisiana, Alabama, and \nMississippi. I believe this is a commonsense approach, since this \nposition in New Orleans has remained vacant since 2003 due to \nretirement and budget issues. So this is not a new position or a new \nhire, it is simply filling a position that has sat open for far too \nlong.\n\n  The Gulf Coast Export Recovery Act of 2007 would also address \nCommerce staffing issues for our New Orleans U.S. Export Assistance \nCenter. In this office, there is currently four full-time export \nassistance staff, along with one Foreign Service Officer. This office \nhas had two staffers leave the office since Katrina and I am concerned \nthat when this Foreign Service Officer leaves this fall, that there \nwill be no replacement. This understaffed office is struggling to keep \nup with the increasing demands from businesses for technical assistance \non finding overseas markets for local products, particularly businesses \nnear Baton Rouge and the River parishes. Staff in New Orleans cover \nsouth Louisiana as well as the coastal counties in Mississippi. With \nsuch a wide area to cover, and so few staff, they are doing a great job \nin providing services but obviously need additional help to fully \nservice our local businesses. The Small Business International Trade \nEnhancements Act of 2007 would provide one additional full-time staffer \nto this office to assist our businesses in the parishes of East Baton \nRouge, West Baton Rouge, Iberville, Pointe Coupee, St. Martin, St. \nLandry and Iberia. Many of our businesses from the New Orleans area are \nrelocating to these parishes so we need adequate staff to keep up with \nincreasing export needs in the area.\n  In closing, I should note that both of these provisions were included \nin the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill that was reported \nout of committee last Fall. Unfortunately, since that bill was not \nenacted, these provisions did not become law and our small business \nexporters have waited an additional 7 months for increased export \nassistance resources. I do not want them to have to wait another 7 \nmonths for this vital assistance. We are only asking for two full-time \nstaffers for an office, but these two staffers would make a world of \ndifference for the businesses, as well as for the understaffed office \ndown there. I believe both the Department of Commerce and the Small \nBusiness Administration are supportive of these staffing increases so I \nlook forward to working with them in the coming months to address these \nstaffing needs in New Orleans. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation since it will help our exporters in the Gulf Coast fully \nrecover and will help the country as a whole by increasing exports from \nthe Gulf Coast states.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 745\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A joint resolution to acknowledge a long history of \nofficial depredations and ill-conceived policies by the United States \nGovernment regarding Indian tribes and offer an apology to all Native \nPeoples on behalf of the United States; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n                              S.J.

and\n       (3) on numerous Indian reservations;\n       Whereas the United States Government condemned the \n     traditions, beliefs, and customs of the Native Peoples and \n     endeavored to assimilate them by such policies as the \n     redistribution of land under the General Allotment Act of \n     1887 and the forcible removal of Native children from their \n     families to faraway boarding schools where their Native \n     practices and languages were degraded and forbidden;\n       Whereas officials of the United States Government and \n     private United States citizens harmed Native Peoples by the \n     unlawful acquisition of recognized tribal land and the theft \n     of tribal resources and assets from recognized tribal land;\n       Whereas the policies of the United States Government toward \n     Indian tribes and the breaking of covenants with Indian \n     tribes have contributed to the severe social ills and \n     economic troubles in many Native communities today;\n       Whereas, despite the wrongs committed against Native \n     Peoples by the United States, the Native Peoples have \n     remained committed to the protection of this great land, as \n     evidenced by the fact that, on a per capita basis, more \n     Native people have served in the United States Armed Forces \n     and placed themselves in harm's way in defense of the United \n     States in every major military conflict than any other ethnic \n     group;\n       Whereas Indian tribes have actively influenced the public \n     life of the United States by continued cooperation with \n     Congress and the Department of the Interior, through the \n     involvement of Native individuals in official United States \n     Government positions, and by leadership of their own \n     sovereign Indian tribes;\n       Whereas Indian tribes are resilient and determined to \n     preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their \n     unique cultural identities;\n       Whereas the National Museum of the American Indian was \n     established within the Smithsonian Institution as a living \n     memorial to the Native Peoples and their traditions; and\n       Whereas Native Peoples are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and that among those are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND APOLOGY.\n\n       The United States, acting through Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship \n     the Indian tribes have with the United States and the solemn \n     covenant with the land we share;\n       (2) commends and honors the Native Peoples for the \n     thousands of years that they have stewarded and protected \n     this land;\n       (3) recognizes that there have been years of official \n     depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of \n     covenants by the United States Government regarding Indian \n     tribes;\n       (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States \n     to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, \n     maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by \n     citizens of the United States;\n       (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former \n     wrongs and its commitment to build on the positive \n     relationships of the past and present to move toward a \n     brighter future where all the people of this land live \n     reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward \n     and protect this land together;\n       (6) urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the \n     United States against Indian tribes in the history of the \n     United States in order to bring healing to this land by \n     providing a proper foundation for reconciliation between the \n     United States and Indian tribes; and\n       (7) commends the State governments that have begun \n     reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located \n     in their boundaries and encourages all State governments \n     similarly to work toward reconciling relationships with \n     Indian tribes within their boundaries.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 16\n\n       Whereas, for nearly two decades, the Government of Uganda \n     has been engaged in an armed conflict with the Lord's \n     Resistance Army (LRA) that has resulted in up to 200,000 \n     deaths from violence and disease and the displacement of more \n     than 1,600,000 civilians from eastern and northern Uganda.\n       Whereas former United Nations Undersecretary-General for \n     Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan \n     Egeland has called the crisis in northern Uganda ``the \n     biggest forgotten, neglected humanitarian emergency in the \n     world today'';\n       Whereas Joseph Kony, the leader of the LRA, and several of \n     his associates have been indicted by the International \n     Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, \n     including rape, murder, enslavement, sexual enslavement, and \n     the forced recruitment of an estimated 66,000 children;\n       Whereas the LRA is a severe and repeat violator of human \n     rights and has continued to attack civilians and humanitarian \n     aid workers despite a succession of ceasefire agreements;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State has labeled the LRA \n     ``vicious and cult-like'' and designates it as a terrorist \n     organization;\n       Whereas the 2005 Department of State report on the human \n     rights record of the Government of Uganda found that \n     ``security forces committed unlawful killings. . . and were \n     responsible for deaths as a result of torture'' along with \n     other ``serious problems,'' including repression of political \n     opposition, official impunity, and violence against women and \n     children;\n       Whereas, in the 2004 Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act \n     (Public Law 108-283; 118 Stat. 912), Congress declared its \n     support for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in northern \n     and eastern Uganda and called for the United States and the \n     international community to assist in rehabilitation, \n     reconstruction, and demobilization efforts;\n       Whereas the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, which was \n     mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan and signed by \n     representatives of the Government of Uganda and the LRA on \n     August 20, 2006, and extended on November 1, 2006, requires \n     both parties to cease all hostile military and media \n     offensives and asks the Sudan People's Liberation Army to \n     facilitate the safe assembly of LRA fighters in designated \n     areas for the duration of the peace talks;\n       Whereas the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement is set to \n     expire on February 28, 2007, and although both parties to the \n     agreement have indicated that they are willing to continue \n     with the peace talks, no date has been set for resumption of \n     the talks, and recent reports have suggested that both rebel \n     and Government forces are preparing to return to war;\n       Whereas a return to civil war would yield disastrous \n     results for the people of northern Uganda and for regional \n     stability, while peace in Uganda will bolster the fragile \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan and de-escalate \n     tensions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\n       Whereas continuing violence and instability obstruct the \n     delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of northern \n     Uganda and impede national and regional trade, development \n     and democratization efforts, and counter-terrorism \n     initiatives; and\n       Whereas the Senate unanimously passed Senate Resolution \n     366, 109th Congress, agreed to February 6, 2006, and Senate \n     Resolution 573, 109th Congress, agreed to September 19, 2006, \n     calling on Uganda, Sudan, the United States, and the \n     international community to bring justice and provide \n     humanitarian assistance to northern Uganda and to support the \n     successful transition from conflict to sustainable peace, \n     while the House of Representatives has not yet considered \n     comparable legislation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) disapproves of the LRA leadership's inconsistent \n     commitment to resolving the conflict in Uganda peacefully;\n       (2) urges the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and the \n     Government of Uganda to return to negotiations in order to \n     extend and expand upon the existing ceasefire and to recommit \n     to pursuing a political solution to this conflict;\n       (3) entreats all parties in the region to immediately cease \n     human rights violations and address, within the context of a \n     broader national reconciliation process in Uganda, issues of \n     accountability and impunity for\n\n[[Page S2517]]\n\n     those crimes against humanity already committed;\n       (4) presses leaders on both sides of the conflict in Uganda \n     to renounce any intentions and halt any preparations to \n     resume violence and to ensure that this message is clearly \n     conveyed to armed elements under their control; and\n       (5) calls on the Secretary of State, the Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development, and \n     the heads of other similar governmental agencies and \n     nongovernmental organizations within the international \n     community to continue and augment efforts to alleviate the \n     humanitarian crisis in northern Uganda and to support a \n     peaceful resolution to this crisis by publicly and forcefully \n     reiterating the preceding demands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2517-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 288.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``The American National Red \n     Cross Governance Modernization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Substantive changes to the Congressional Charter of The \n     American National Red Cross have not been made since 1947.\n       (2) In February 2006, the board of governors of The \n     American National Red Cross (the ``Board of Governors'') \n     commissioned an independent review and analysis of the Board \n     of Governors' role, composition, size, relationship with \n     management, governance relationship with chartered units of \n     The American National Red Cross, and whistleblower and audit \n     functions.\n       (3) In an October 2006 report of the Board of Governors, \n     entitled ``American Red Cross Governance for the 21st \n     Century'' (the ``Governance Report''), the Board of Governors \n     recommended changes to the Congressional Charter, bylaws, and \n     other governing documents of The American National Red Cross \n     to modernize and enhance the effectiveness of the Board of \n     Governors and governance structure of The American National \n     Red Cross.\n       (4) It is in the national interest to create a more \n     efficient governance structure of The American National Red \n     Cross and to enhance the Board of Governors' ability to \n     support the critical mission of The American National Red \n     Cross in the 21st century.\n       (5) It is in the national interest to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors as a governance and strategic \n     oversight board and for The American National Red Cross to \n     amend its bylaws, consistent with the recommendations \n     described in the Governance Report, to clarify the role of \n     the Board of Governors and to outline the areas of its \n     responsibility, including--\n       (A) reviewing and approving the mission statement for The \n     American National Red Cross;\n       (B) approving and overseeing the corporation's strategic \n     plan and maintaining strategic oversight of operational \n     matters;\n       (C) selecting, evaluating, and determining the level of \n     compensation of the corporation's chief executive officer;\n       (D) evaluating the performance and establishing the \n     compensation of the senior leadership team and providing for \n     management succession;\n       (E) overseeing the financial reporting and audit process, \n     internal controls, and legal compliance;\n       (F) holding management accountable for performance;\n       (G) providing oversight of the financial stability of the \n     corporation;\n       (H) ensuring the inclusiveness and diversity of the \n     corporation;\n       (I) providing oversight of the protection of the brand of \n     the corporation; and\n       (J) assisting with fundraising on behalf of the \n     corporation.\n       (6)(A) The selection of members of the Board of Governors \n     is a critical component of effective governance for The \n     American National Red Cross, and, as such, it is in the \n     national interest that The American National Red Cross amend \n     its bylaws to provide a method of selection consistent with \n     that described in the Governance Report.\n       (B) The new method of selection should replace the current \n     process by which--\n       (i) 30 chartered unit-elected members of the Board of \n     Governors are selected by a non-Board committee which \n     includes 2 members of the Board of Governors and other \n     individuals elected by the chartered units themselves;\n       (ii) 12 at-large members of the Board of Governors are \n     nominated by a Board committee and elected by the Board of \n     Governors; and\n       (iii) 8 members of the Board of Governors are appointed by \n     the President of the United States.\n       (C) The new method of selection described in the Governance \n     Report reflects the single category of members of the Board \n     of Governors that will result from the implementation of this \n     title:\n       (i) All Board members (except for the chairman of the Board \n     of Governors) would be nominated by a single committee of the \n     Board of Governors taking into account the criteria outlined \n     in the Governance Report to assure the expertise, skills, and \n     experience of a governing board.\n       (ii) The nominated members would be considered for approval \n     by the full Board of Governors and then submitted to The \n     American National Red Cross annual meeting of delegates for \n     election, in keeping with the standard corporate practice \n     whereby shareholders of a corporation elect members of a \n     board of directors at its annual meeting.\n       (7) The United States Supreme Court held The American \n     National Red Cross to be an instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it is in the national interest that the \n     Congressional Charter confirm that status and that any \n     changes to the Congressional Charter do not affect the rights \n     and obligations of The American National Red Cross to carry \n     out its purposes.\n       (8) Given the role of The American National Red Cross in \n     carrying out its services, programs, and activities, and \n     meeting its various obligations, the effectiveness of The \n     American National Red Cross will be promoted by the creation \n     of an organizational ombudsman who--\n       (A) will be a neutral or impartial dispute resolution \n     practitioner whose major function will be to provide \n     confidential and informal assistance to the many internal and \n     external stakeholders of The American National Red Cross;\n       (B) will report to the chief executive officer and the \n     audit committee of the Board of Governors; and\n       (C) will have access to anyone and any documents in The \n     American National Red Cross.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) charitable organizations are an indispensable part of \n     American society, but these organizations can only fulfill \n     their important roles by maintaining the trust of the \n     American public;\n       (2) trust is fostered by effective governance and \n     transparency, which are the principal goals of the \n     recommendations of the Board of Governors in the Governance \n     Report and this title;\n       (3) Federal and State action play an important role in \n     ensuring effective governance and transparency by setting \n     standards, rooting out violations, and informing the public; \n     and\n       (4) while The American National Red Cross is and will \n     remain a Federally chartered instrumentality of the United \n     States, and it has the rights and obligations consistent with \n     that status, The American National Red Cross nevertheless \n     should maintain appropriate communications with State \n     regulators of charitable organizations and should cooperate \n     with them as appropriate in specific matters as they arise \n     from time to time.\n\n     SEC. _03. ORGANIZATION.\n\n       Section 300101 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``a Federally chartered \n     instrumentality of the United States and'' before ``a body \n     corporate and politic''; and\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\n       (2) in subsection (b), by inserting at the end the \n     following new sentence: ``The corporation may conduct its \n     business and affairs, and otherwise hold itself out, as the \n     `American Red Cross' in any jurisdiction.''.\n\n     SEC. _04. PURPOSES.\n\n       Section 300102 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (4) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following paragraph:\n       ``(5) to conduct other activities consistent with the \n     foregoing purposes.''.\n\n     SEC. _05. MEMBERSHIP AND CHAPTERS.\n\n       Section 300103 of title 36, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, or as otherwise \n     provided,'' before ``in the bylaws'';\n       (2) in subsection (b)(1)--\n       (A) by striking ``board of governors'' and inserting \n     ``corporation''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``policies and'' before ``regulations \n     related''; and\n       (3) in subsection (b)(2)--\n       (A) by inserting ``policies and'' before ``regulations \n     shall require''; and\n       (B) by striking ``national convention'' and inserting \n     ``annual meeting''.\n\n     SEC. _06.

PROLIFERATION SECURITY INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress, \n     consistent with the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, that \n     the President should strive to expand and strengthen the \n     Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) announced by the \n     President on May 31, 2003, with a particular emphasis on the \n     following principles:\n       (1) The responsibility for ensuring the national security \n     of the United States rests exclusively with the Government of \n     the United States and should not be delegated in whole or in \n     part to any international organization, agency, or tribunal \n     or to the government of any other country.\n       (2) The freedom of the Government of the United States to \n     act as it deems appropriate to ensure the security of the \n     American people should not be limited by, or made dependent \n     upon, the action or inaction of any international \n     organization, agency, or tribunal or by the government of any \n     other country.\n       (3) The Constitution of the United States is the supreme \n     law of the land and cannot be subordinated to, or superseded \n     by, the decisions, rulings, or other acts of any \n     international organization, agency, or tribunal or by the \n     government of any other country.\n       (4) In carrying out its responsibility for ensuring the \n     national security of the United States, the Government of the \n     United States has sought and should continue to seek the \n     cooperation and support of international organizations, \n     agencies, and tribunals, including the United Nations and its \n     affiliated organizations and agencies, as well as the \n     governments of other countries, but no decision or act taken \n     by the Government of the United States regarding its \n     responsibility to provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general welfare, and secure the liberty of the American \n     people should be deemed to require authorization, permission, \n     or approval by any international organization, agency, or \n     tribunal or by the government of any other country.\n       (5) The United Nations Security Council should not be asked \n     to authorize the PSI under international law, and in order \n     for the United Nations to be helpful in combating terrorism \n     and proliferation, it should first--\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\n       (A) establish a comprehensive definition of terrorism that \n     condemns all acts by individuals, resistance movements or \n     other irregular military groups, or nations intended to cause \n     death or serious injury to civilians or non-combatants with \n     the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a \n     government to do or abstain from doing any act;\n       (B) fulfill the September 2005 commitment of the Summit of \n     World Leaders to establish a comprehensive convention against \n     terrorism;\n       (C) have the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee \n     establish a list of individuals, organizations, and states \n     that commit terrorist acts or support terrorist groups and \n     activities;\n       (D) prohibit states under sanction for human rights abuses \n     or terrorism by the United Nations Security Council from \n     running for seats on or chairing any United Nations body, \n     such as the Human Rights Council or the United Nations \n     Disarmament Commission;\n       (E) prohibit member states in violation of Chapter 7 of the \n     United Nations Charter and seen as a threat to international \n     security and peace from sitting as non-permanent members of \n     the United Nations Security Council; and\n       (F) prohibit giving United Nations credentials to \n     nongovernmental organizations that promote or condone \n     terrorism or terrorist groups.\n       (6) Formalizing the PSI into a multilateral regime would \n     severely hamper PSI's flexibility and ability to adapt to \n     changing conditions.\n       (b) Strengthening the Proliferation Security Initiative.--\n     The President is not authorized to--\n       (1) seek to subject the Proliferation Security Initiative \n     to any authority, oversight, or resolution of the United \n     Nations Security Council, international law, an international \n     organization, agency, or tribunal, or the government of any \n     country not participating in the Proliferation Security \n     Initiative; or\n       (2) formalize the Proliferation Security Initiative into a \n     multilateral regime.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 309.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating thereto be printed in the Record as if read, without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 16) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 16\n\n       Whereas, for nearly two decades, the Government of Uganda \n     has been engaged in an armed conflict with the Lord's \n     Resistance Army (LRA) that has resulted in up to 200,000 \n     deaths from violence and disease and the displacement of more \n     than 1,600,000 civilians from eastern and northern Uganda.\n       Whereas former United Nations Undersecretary-General for \n     Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan \n     Egeland has called the crisis in northern Uganda ``the \n     biggest forgotten, neglected humanitarian emergency in the \n     world today'';\n       Whereas Joseph Kony, the leader of the LRA, and several of \n     his associates have been indicted by the International \n     Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, \n     including rape, murder, enslavement, sexual enslavement, and \n     the forced recruitment of an estimated 66,000 children;\n       Whereas the LRA is a severe and repeat violator of human \n     rights and has continued to attack civilians and humanitarian \n     aid workers despite a succession of ceasefire agreements;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State has labeled the LRA \n     ``vicious and cult-like'' and designates it as a terrorist \n     organization;\n       Whereas the 2005 Department of State report on the human \n     rights record of the Government of Uganda found that \n     ``security forces committed unlawful killings . . . and were \n     responsible for deaths as a result of torture'' along with \n     other ``serious problems,'' including repression of political \n     opposition, official impunity, and violence against women and \n     children;\n       Whereas, in the 2004 Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act \n     (Public Law 108-283; 118 Stat. 912), Congress declared its \n     support for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in northern \n     and eastern Uganda and called for the United States and the \n     international community to assist in rehabilitation, \n     reconstruction, and demobilization efforts;\n       Whereas the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, which was \n     mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan and signed by \n     representatives of the Government of Uganda and the LRA on \n     August 20, 2006, and extended on November 1, 2006, requires \n     both parties to cease all hostile military and media \n     offensives and asks the Sudan People's Liberation Army to \n     facilitate the safe assembly of LRA fighters in designated \n     areas for the duration of the peace talks;\n       Whereas the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement is set to \n     expire on February 28, 2007, and although both parties to the \n     agreement have indicated that they are willing to continue \n     with the peace talks, no date has been set for resumption of \n     the talks, and recent reports have suggested that both rebel \n     and Government forces are preparing to return to war;\n       Whereas a return to civil war would yield disastrous \n     results for the people of northern Uganda and for regional \n     stability, while peace in Uganda will bolster the fragile \n     Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan and de-escalate \n     tensions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;\n       Whereas continuing violence and instability obstruct the \n     delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of northern \n     Uganda and impede national and regional trade, development \n     and democratization efforts, and counter-terrorism \n     initiatives; and\n       Whereas the Senate unanimously passed Senate Resolution \n     366, 109th Congress, agreed to February 6, 2006, and Senate \n     Resolution 573, 109th Congress, agreed to September 19, 2006, \n     calling on Uganda, Sudan, the United States, and the \n     international community to bring justice and provide \n     humanitarian assistance to northern Uganda and to support the \n     successful transition from conflict to sustainable peace, \n     while the House of Representatives has not yet considered \n     comparable legislation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) disapproves of the LRA leadership's inconsistent \n     commitment to resolving the conflict in Uganda peacefully;\n       (2) urges the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and the \n     Government of Uganda to return to negotiations in order to \n     extend and expand upon the existing ceasefire and to recommit \n     to pursuing a political solution to this conflict;\n       (3) entreats all parties in the region to immediately cease \n     human rights violations and\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\n     address, within the context of a broader national \n     reconciliation process in Uganda, issues of accountability \n     and impunity for those crimes against humanity already \n     committed;\n       (4) presses leaders on both sides of the conflict in Uganda \n     to renounce any intentions and halt any preparations to \n     resume violence and to ensure that this message is clearly \n     conveyed to armed elements under their control; and\n       (5) calls on the Secretary of State, the Administrator of \n     the United States Agency for International Development, and \n     the heads of other similar governmental agencies and \n     nongovernmental organizations within the international \n     community to continue and augment efforts to alleviate the \n     humanitarian crisis in northern Uganda and to support a \n     peaceful resolution to this crisis by publicly and forcefully \n     reiterating the preceding demands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/01/senate-section/article/S2541-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF A NATIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
