Madam President, as I indicated, we started this debate \nagain last evening. Both the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees have jurisdiction over this legislation. Senators \nRockefeller and Bond, Senators Leahy and Specter worked very hard on \ntheir particular aspects of this legislation.\n  We, under the regular order, in a case of sequential referral--that \nis what we have in this matter--the Intelligence Committee text is the \nunderlying bill, and the Judiciary Committee text is automatically \npending as a complete substitute.\n  Last night, Chairman Leahy, with the authorization of a majority of \nthe committee, sent a slightly modified version of the Judiciary \nCommittee amendment to the desk. We will have a vote on that amendment \nsometime today. The Judiciary Committee made what I believe to be some \nimportant improvements in this legislation, adding protections for the \nprivacy of law-abiding Americans.\n  This is a strong bill. I will support it. I encourage my colleagues \nto do so as well.\n  In the event the full Judiciary Committee bill is not accepted by the \nSenate, I hope we can adopt some of the individual improvements from \nthe Judiciary bill that is now in the form of an amendment.\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\n  Several of my colleagues, many of whom serve on the committees of \njurisdiction; that is, both committees, plan to offer pieces of the \nJudiciary Committee bill as separate amendments.\n  In addition to considering the procedures included in title I of the \nbill, we will also debate the question of whether telephone companies \nthat allegedly facilitated President Bush's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram should be granted retroactive immunity from civil lawsuits.\n  Senators Dodd and Feingold will seek to strike that immunity title. \nThey will seek to strike it in its entirety. I personally oppose \nimmunity and will support that amendment. But, of course, others \ndisagree. If this amendment is not adopted, there will be other \namendments to limit the immunity provisions in the Intelligence bill.\n  I hope there will not be extended time on these amendments. We can \nwork through this. Friday is tomorrow. We have to finish this \nlegislation, and we have to do it this week. It is an important piece \nof legislation. I have requested a 30-day extension. That is not going \nto be given. So everyone should understand, we have to go forward with \nthis legislation.\n  Senators Specter and Whitehouse have an amendment they plan to offer, \nas do Senators Feinstein and Nelson of Florida.\n  As I have said before, if there are Senators who do not like these \namendments and think they should be subjected to 60-vote thresholds, \nthese Senators are going to have to engage in an old-fashioned \nfilibuster. We are not going to automatically have these 60-vote \nmargins. These amendments are by and large germane. They should be \nadopted if a majority of the Senate supports them.\n  Finally, yesterday, as I have indicated, I sent a letter to the \nPresident asking for a brief extension. I have heard from many sources \nthat is not going to be granted.\n  The Senate will work as quickly as we can, but I think it is going to \nbe very difficult for both Houses to negotiate and pass a final bill \nprior to the February 1 expiration date. But that is what we have to \ndo, so we have no alternative.\n  Republicans have objected to my requests for a 30-day extension of \nthe act, as I have mentioned. This matter is too important for us to be \nbogged down in procedural matters at this time.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to \nprovide our intelligence professionals with the tools they need to \ncombat terrorism, while protecting the privacy of law-abiding American \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S226-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we may only be a few days into the \nsession, but it is not too early to note a change in tone from last \nJanuary. Talks are moving forward on an economic growth package between \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, the House Republican leader, and the \nSpeaker, and there is good reason to expect an important national \nsecurity achievement on FISA at the latest by next week.\n  I had hoped we would move to FISA first, since nothing could be more \nurgent than protecting this vital national security tool before its \nexpiration on February 1. Our first duty is to protect Americans from \nharm, and we know for a fact this law has helped us--helped us--detect \nand disrupt terrorist plots. It would be grossly irresponsible for \nCongress to weaken it or to let it lapse. And the notion that some in \nCongress would even consider filibustering this vital antiterror tool \nis difficult to comprehend.\n  Fortunately, common sense seems to have prevailed. I was encouraged \nto see that my good friend, the majority leader, believes we can pass a \nFISA bill with sufficient time to get it signed before it expires. I am \nvery pleased to see that the chairman of the Intelligence Committee \nbelieves the bipartisan version reported out of his committee last fall \nwill be the one that will ultimately pass, hopefully, by February 1. \nThis is good news not only because the Intelligence Committee's version \nis the best, but, most importantly, with some modification it is also \nthe only one the President will sign.\n  We have put this off long enough. Let's work to pass this bill. I \nknow the majority leader believes we should move forward on it as well. \nI certainly concur in his judgment on that matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S226-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO THE AMERICAN PRINTING HOUSE FOR THE BLIND\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise because yesterday marked the \n150th anniversary of the American Printing House for the Blind. Located \nin my hometown of Louisville, KY, the American Printing House for the \nBlind is the national source of reading materials and learning aids for \nover 10 million blind and visually impaired Americans. Thanks to this \nKentucky institution, they can now fully participate in the American \ndream.\n  Until the founding of APH, different schools for the blind across the \ncountry each prepared their own materials. But soon educators realized \nthe need for a national printing house to fill this role. Louisville \nwas chosen for its central location in the country and because it is \nsituated on the Ohio River.\n  On January 23, 1858, the Kentucky General Assembly passed an act to \ncharter the American Printing House. In 1879, the Federal Government \ndesignated APH the official source of learning materials for blind \nstudents across the Nation, and the facility has continued to receive \nFederal support since then. Thanks to that support, sales, and \ndonations as well, APH has been able to create some remarkable products \nthat have changed the lives of many blind and visually impaired \nAmericans.\n  The facility published its first book, ``Fables and Tales for \nChildren,'' in 1866, using the raised letters that were then the \nstandard. In 1893, they published their first books in Braille. Today, \nthey have helped the blind engage the 21st century with talking books, \nmagazines, and even a recorded talking encyclopedia.\n  They have developed computers to help the blind access the Internet \nor read recorded books. They have even created a sonar aid for the \nblind to use that can detect how far away objects are by emitting tones \nthat sound like chirping birds.\n  Before the American Printing House for the Blind existed to create \nall of these wonderful products, it was widely assumed that the blind \nand visually impaired just were not capable of learning as much as \neveryone else. Today, of course, we know that is completely untrue.\n  I want to share with my colleagues a letter APH received that \nillustrates the point very well.\n  A young fourth-grade girl in Nebraska named Ruthie was so grateful \nfor a computer software program called Math Flash, developed at APH, \nthat she wrote the facility to thank them. This is what she had to say:\n\n       I used to hate math because everyone else was smarter than \n     me. Math Flash makes it easy and fun because it has adding \n     and subtracting games that help me remember. I can practice \n     whatever I want with no help from my teacher or my mom. I \n     could even be a math teacher maybe.\n\n  When you realize that most teachers or parents would be ecstatic to \nhear of such a passion for learning in any student, whether sighted or \nvisually impaired, you begin to see the miracle the American Printing \nHouse for the Blind has made possible. They have opened up a world of \nknowledge and information to millions of Americans.\n  The city of Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky are proud to \nbe the home of the American Printing House for the Blind, which adds \nmuch to our community. The APH Museum attracts many visitors from \naround the globe every year to see important historical artifacts, such \nas Helen Keller's Bible in Braille.\n  I want to thank the Senate for its unanimous approval yesterday of a \nresolution I sponsored expressing this Nation's gratitude--gratitude--\nto the American Printing House for the Blind for its 150 years of \nservice to this Nation. Their efforts have been essential to allowing \nthe blind and visually impaired to be fully included in education.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S227-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S227]]\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                Chief Petty Officer Gregory J. Billiter\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a 15-\nyear veteran of the U.S. Navy who was lost in service to his country. \nThat man is CPO Gregory J. Billiter of Villa Hills, KY. He was 36 years \nold.\n  Chief Billiter was serving near Kirkuk, Iraq, as part of a Navy \nExplosive Ordnance disposal unit charged with defusing the many \nimprovised explosives and booby traps that terrorists have set in Iraq. \nHe was the tactical commander of the third vehicle in a five-vehicle \nconvoy patrolling the area. On April 6, 2007, his vehicle was struck by \nexplosives, tragically taking Chief Billiter's life.\n  Assigned to Explosive Ordnance Disposal Unit 11, based out of Whidbey \nIsland, WA, this was Chief Billiter's third tour of duty in Iraq. For \nbravery and valor while wearing the uniform, he received numerous \nmedals and awards, including the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \nDistinguishing Device for Valor and the Purple Heart.\n  To recount Chief Billiter's life and career is to recount one \nachievement after another, because Greg was no stranger to success. \n``The driving force in all those things was competition,'' says Barry \nBilliter, his father. ``He was very competitive.''\n\n       Growing up, Greg led his friends in whiffleball games, \n     racing Big Wheels, or swinging over the creek on a vine, \n     Tarzan-style. He played basketball and soccer in high school, \n     and whatever they played, Greg often declared himself the \n     winner or demanded a rematch. He was a ``dyed-in-the-wool'' \n     Cincinnati Bengals fan.\n\n  He was a good kid--the police only had to visit Greg's parents once. \nThat was the time Greg, his brother Jeff, and some neighborhood friends \nsat on a rock in the woods and refused to budge for the bulldozers that \nhad come to clear the way for a new shopping center.\n  ``Greg was all of 6 years old at the time,'' the Billiter family \nwrites in a letter about Greg sent to family and friends that they have \ngenerously shared with me. ``How was he ever able to get security \nclearance with that on his record?''\n  Greg attended St. Pius X and St. Joseph Elementary Schools. As a \nfourth-grader, one of his teachers told him he would never make it at \nCovington Latin School, a competitive private high school in northern \nKentucky. If anything could motivate Greg, it was a challenge. He \ngraduated from Covington Latin in 1987 at the age of 16.\n  Greg went to the University of Dayton and graduated with a bachelor's \ndegree in marketing at age 19. After college, Greg worked for a while \nat the Levi Strauss Company but was unfulfilled. So one day he came \nhome to his parents and announced he had joined the Navy, just like his \nfather, Barry, a Navy veteran. Greg entered basic training in January \n1992 in Orlando, FL, and graduated as the Honor Recruit.\n  He served aboard many ships, including the USS Durham, USS Duluth, \nUSS Carl Vinson, USS Ronald Reagan, and USS Nimitz. In 1994, he \nqualified for and finished Navy Seal training. After a knee injury, he \ncould no longer continue as a Seal but qualified as a surface warfare \nspecialist. Chief Billiter kept busy. He also qualified as a Naval \nparachutist, a scuba and MK-16 mixed gas diving supervisor, a \ndemolitions operations supervisor, and a helicopter rope suspension \ntactics specialist.\n  From 1997 to 2001, Greg served in Canton, OH, as a Naval recruiter. \nThen he transferred to specialize in explosive ordnance disposal and \nfound that defusing explosives was the job he had been looking for.\n  ``When he talked about it, his eyes would light up,'' says Greg's \naunt, Paula Snow. ``He loved the science of it.'' Explosive ordnance \ndisposal specialists are trained to deal with explosive threats on land \nor underwater, including anything chemical, biological, and even \nnuclear. Greg conducted numerous EOD missions throughout the world and \ntrained the foreign special operation units of France, Uruguay, Chile, \nPeru, and Qatar.\n  During his third tour in Iraq, Greg's team contributed to the \ncollection and destruction of over 2,500 ordnance items, totaling over \n5,800 pounds of net explosives weight. When he was off duty, he \norganized sports games, such as an Ultimate Frisbee competition of the \nolder sailors versus the younger ones. He competed in the Navy's \nIronman competition.\n  In 1994, while serving on board a ship home-ported in San Diego, Greg \nmet April, a middle-school science teacher in that city. She understood \na sailor's life well, having grown up the daughter of a Navy chief \ncorpsman.\n  Greg and April married in November 1996 at St. Joseph Church in \nCrescent Springs, KY. Together they had a son, Cooper John Billiter. \nGreg hoped little Cooper would grow up to play sports.\n  Greg will be forever loved and remembered by his family and loved \nones who are in my prayers now as I relate Greg's story to the Senate. \nThose family members include his wife, April; his son, Cooper; his \nmother, Pat; his father, Barry; his brothers Jeff, Kevin, and David \nBilliter; his sisters Beth Billiter and Jill New; his aunts Paula Snow \nand Barbara Horton; and his grandmothers Virginia Billiter and Clara \nBosch.\n  When Greg was a senior in high school, he attended a Senior Christian \nAwakening Retreat. For the first time, he told his parents: Thank you \nfor being such a good Mom and Dad and thank you for all the sacrifices \nyou have made for me.\n  This young man who learned the meaning of sacrifice at an early age \ngrew up to become a beloved husband and father himself who made the \nultimate sacrifice for his country. I want the Billiter family to know \nthat America and the U.S. Senate will always remember that sacrifice, \nand we salute CPO Gregory J. Billiter and his service to our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S227-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 2248, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2248) to amend the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978, to modify and streamline the \n     provisions of that Act, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, the Senate now returns to the \nconsideration of S. 2248, the FISA Amendments Act.\n  As I said in December when we debated the motion to proceed to this \nbill, I believe this legislation is critical to our Nation's security. \nThat phrase is thrown around a lot--``our Nation's security.'' It does \nhave meaning. To protect America from the panoply of threats we face \naround the world, we must know what our enemies are planning and what \nthey are doing. We get that information through our intelligence \nagencies, and one of the most useful sources for them is communications \nintelligence.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, gives the \nGovernment the authority, with court approval, to collect \ncommunications intelligence inside the United States. Unfortunately, \nthe law has not kept pace with the incredible advances in \ntelecommunications technology of the last 30 years.\n  As this debate proceeds over these coming days, it is important for \nall Members to understand why FISA exists and why it is necessary for \nus to update it. The Congress passed FISA to protect Americans inside \nthe United States from inappropriate eavesdropping by the Government. \nThe FISA statute created a system that allowed the Government to go to \na special court and show probable cause that someone inside the United \nStates was an agent of a foreign power. If it agreed, if the court \nagreed, the court then issued an order allowing the Government \nto collect the intelligence.\n\n  Over time, the flow of global communications changed. The nature of \nthese communications changed. The system of fiber optic cables carrying \ninternational communications grew, and wireless technology began to \ndominate our domestic system. This was a marked change from the \ncommunications architecture that existed in 1978, when FISA was \nstarted, when local\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\ncalls were transmitted over a wire and international ones usually went \nvia satellite.\n  As technology changed and America became the hub for international \ncommunication, our intelligence agencies were presented with collection \nopportunities that were never envisioned--never even thought about in \n1978. But because of the way that FISA was drafted, they were unable to \ntake advantage of the new opportunities to collect significant \nintelligence inside the United States against targets located overseas.\n  After September 11, 2001, the President chose to deal with the \nproblem unilaterally and created a warrantless surveillance program \nthat relied on, to my mind, questionable legal justification. I think \nthat was a mistake. I believe the President should have sought, and \nwould have received from Congress, the necessary changes to FISA to \naccommodate the international communications he wished and needed to \ntarget.\n  The public disclosure of the warrantless program ultimately led the \nPresident to seek approval from the FISA Court and then to seek \nadditional authority from the Congress, which is where we are.\n  Our first attempt to address this issue was the Protect America Act \npassed last August. That legislation allowed our intelligence community \nto undertake the collection needed to monitor terrorist communications, \nbut the PAA, as we shall call it, is flawed legislation that does not \nachieve the balance between protecting security and preserving our \ncivil liberties, which is so essential. It provided an expanse of new \nauthority to collect intelligence inside the United States, with little \ncourt involvement or oversight from the Congress.\n  But we had the foresight to include in the PAA--the Protect America \nAct--a 6-month sunset. That 6-month period allowed us the time we \nneeded to craft a bill that does achieve this important balance: \nsecurity and civil liberties. It gives the intelligence community the \nauthority it needs to keep us safe, and it puts in place the safeguards \nneeded to protect America's liberties. That is the bill the Senate is \nnow considering; i.e., S. 2248.\n  This bill was reported to the Senate last October on a strong \nbipartisan vote under Senator Bond and myself, Vice Chairman Bond and \nmyself, by a vote of 13 to 2. Vice Chairman Bond and I worked hard to \ncraft a bill that would garnish support from both sides of the aisle \nand that would have the support of the administration, leaders of the \nintelligence community and, most importantly, would achieve our twin \ngoals of protecting the security and privacy of Americans. I should say \nat this point we went to great lengths to check all our bases in this \nprocess. We didn't do this in a cocoon and we didn't do it in a \npartisan way. We reached out to the experts, whether they were inside \nthe administration or outside the administration. We wanted to do it so \nwe could make this legislation as effective as possible.\n  But, as with any legislation, this bill is not perfect. I have \nwelcomed the input from others as we have moved forward. On this point, \nI must particularly acknowledge the work of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. The Judiciary and Intelligence Committees shared \njurisdiction over FISA. The Judiciary Committee also happens to be led \nby two individuals with considerable knowledge and experience with \nthese issues from the perspective of both committees. It may not be \nknown to all, but Senator Pat Leahy served as vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee in the mid-1980s, and Senator Specter served as \nchairman in the mid-1990s. I appreciate the time and thought they have \nput into this legislation.\n  The Judiciary Committee considered the Intelligence Committee bill on \nsequential referral and has reported a proposed amendment to our bill. \nThat amendment is now the pending amendment. The Intelligence Committee \nbill and the Judiciary Committee amendment take a similar approach to \naddressing the underlying problems with FISA--not a huge difference. \nThe Judiciary Committee included several provisions that I think \nfurther improve the already robust protections for privacy contained in \nS. 2248. We were enriched by working with them.\n  I intend to support amendments to incorporate many of these changes \ninto the underlying bill, which is the Intelligence Committee bill, and \neven though I cannot support everything in the Judiciary Committee \nsubstitute amendment, nevertheless, there is very good material there.\n  Before I discuss possible amendments, let me take a few minutes to \nwalk through the bill before us today. I apologize, but I think this is \nnecessary as we begin this debate on what is a highly complicated and \nsomewhat arcane subject.\n  In crafting this legislation, the Intelligence Committee set out to \naccomplish four main goals.\n  First, we wanted to ensure that activities authorized by this bill \nare only directed at persons outside the United States. The bill \nrequires the FISA Court to approve targeting procedures designed to \naccurately make the determination of whether someone is outside the \nUnited States. For individuals inside the United States, the existing \nprocedures under FISA continue to apply. Individual court orders, FISA \norders, are still required.\n  Secondly, our bill improves the protection of information from or \nabout a U.S. person. Unlike the Protect America Act, this bill provides \nfor court review of the so-called minimization procedures. These are \nprocedures used to shield information about Americans who may be \noverheard or mentioned in the conversation of foreign targets.\n  Court review of these procedures is central to the protection \nafforded under FISA. But the FISA Court's role was left out of the \nProtect America Act.\n  Third, the bill includes a new protection for U.S. citizens outside \nthe United States. The Intelligence Committee rejects the proposition \nthat Americans lose their privacy rights because they travel or work \nelsewhere in the world.\n  Under current law, the intelligence community can target U.S. \ncitizens outside the U.S. solely on the authority of the Attorney \nGeneral. Our bill requires an order of the FISA Court before an \nAmerican can be targeted, regardless of the American's location. This \nis a concept that both committees endorsed, and it enjoys bipartisan \nsupport. Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell also endorsed \nthis in testimony before the Intelligence Committee. This is an area of \nlaw, however, that requires careful attention to avoid, as the Director \ndescribed, ``unintended consequences.''\n  Both the Intelligence Committee and Judiciary Committee approaches \nneed further refinement. Therefore, I believe we have reached an \nagreement on a bipartisan amendment that would reconcile the approaches \nof the two committees and resolve the concerns of the administration. \nVice Chairman Bond and I will offer this modification as part of the \nmanagers' amendment.\n  Finally, the Intelligence Committee bill adds significant new \noversight authority to collect inside the United States against foreign \ntargets. The new oversight will be conducted by all three branches of \nGovernment.\n  The bill includes a series of annual reports to Congress on the \nauthorized collection, including instances of noncompliance; inspector \ngeneral reviews by the Justice Department and the Intelligence \nCommittee; and FISA Court review and approval of acquisition and \nminimization procedures.\n  Beyond these steps to update FISA, the other major component of the \nbill passed by the Intelligence Committee--and, unfortunately, not \nincluded in the Judiciary Committee amendment--is liability relief for \ncompanies that may have helped the Government collect critical \nintelligence after the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n  I understand this is controversial. But everybody should know that \nthis is an issue the Intelligence Committee has considered very \ncarefully. We had a number of hearings on this subject. In reviewing \nthe record of correspondence from the administration to these \ncompanies, I and most members of the committee became convinced that \ncompanies acted in good faith. They relied on the legal conclusion of \nthe Nation's most senior law enforcement official, and they provided \nassistance because they wanted to help stop terrorist attacks.\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\n  The companies received letters, and I tried very hard to convince \nSteve Hadley--Director McConnell very much approved of this--to make it \npossible for every Member of the Senate to have those letters that the \ncompanies received from the National Security Agency, so Members could \nunderstand that this was not some kind of a game, that this wasn't \n``wordsmithing.'' What these letters stated was that the companies' \nassistance was ``required,'' that the requested assistance was based on \nan order of the President, and that the Attorney General had certified \nthe legality of the order. And then the NSA Director, as I say, \nrequired, compelled these companies--there were various uses of words, \nbut they were all very firm, leaving no wiggle room--to comply. And \nthey did. They did it because they were told to do so by the highest \nauthorities in the land. They did so because--I believe it is possible \nto say this--there are a lot of big corporations that are very \npatriotic.\n  Private companies should be allowed to rely on this assertion from \nthese high officials. They should be allowed to do that. Our \nlongstanding legal structure is specifically designed not to force a \nprivate company to second guess the Government in these circumstances. \nI know many colleagues on the other side believe that the President \nacted with his constitutional authority when he established this \nprogram. I believe the legal foundation for this program was \nquestionable at best and was part of an overarching legal framework \nthat sought to dramatically alter the balance of power between the \nbranches of power in favor of the executive. But that is a dispute that \nneeds to be settled between the President, the Congress, and the \ncourts. We should not allow private companies who simply wanted to come \nto the aid of their country, or were required or compelled to do so, to \nbe caught in the crossfire of this disagreement.\n  A bipartisan consensus of the Intelligence Committee supported the \nnarrowly drawn liability relief included in the bill. We did not \ninclude the open-ended immunity sought by the administration that would \nhave prevented suits against the Government, or Government officials \nwho knowingly broke the law.\n  The committee's liability relief provision applies only to companies \nwho may have participated in the warrantless surveillance program after \nSeptember 11, 2001, until January 2007, when the whole matter was \nplaced under FISA Court authority. That is why there can be no question \nabout prospective; it is retrospective.\n  The question of whether the President had the authority to launch the \nwarrantless surveillance program leads me to the issue of exclusivity. \nThis is whether FISA is the exclusive means by which the President may \nauthorize the surveillance of Americans for foreign intelligence \npurposes.\n  The President's justification for creating the warrantless \nsurveillance program relied in part on a claim that the legislation \nauthorizing the use of military force after 9/11 somehow gave him the \nauthority to ignore the FISA statute. I don't buy this argument.\n  The President also claims he has the authority, as Commander in \nChief, to approve surveillance even when statutes of this coequal \nbranch of Government would prohibit him specifically from so doing. No \nact of Congress by itself can finally resolve the debate between \nPresidential and congressional authority.\n\n  We can make it clear, however, which statutes authorize the use of \nelectronic surveillance. This is not academic. It is important to \nclarify this point for the future. When the Nation next faces a \nmilitary emergency, we don't want Congress to hesitate while it debates \nwhether its authorization to use force will have unintended \nconsequences, such as authorizing the President to spy on Americans.\n  To avoid this situation, both the Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees included provisions intended to clarify which statutes \nconstitute the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance. \nI have worked with Senator Feinstein, who serves on both committees, \nand Senator Leahy on an amendment that will bridge the differences \nbetween the two bills and will settle this issue in a way that I think \nclarifies the statute.\n  Another important provision is the sunset. This bill provides a \nsignificant new authority, and it is essential--because it is a \nsignificant new authority in what is still emerging in the collection \nof intelligence--that we carefully monitor the implementation of this \nauthority and revisit it to ensure it is working as we now envision.\n  The Intelligence Committee bill includes a 6-year sunset. The \nJudiciary Committee has a 4-year sunset. I will join with Senator \nCardin and others in support of an amendment to incorporate the \nJudiciary Committee 4-year sunset into the underlying bill. Four years \nwill ensure that the decision on permanency is made during the next \nPresidential term.\n  As we proceed with this debate, every Member should have the same two \ngoals we had in the Intelligence Committee: providing our intelligence \nprofessionals with the tools they need to keep us safe, and \nestablishing a system with sufficient safeguards to ensure that \nAmericans' civil liberties are protected over the long term. I think \nthe Intelligence Committee bill does that, and with a few changes it \nwill be even stronger.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson from Nebraska). The Senator from \nMissouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, again, we rise with a renewed consideration \nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act, or the FISA \nAmendments Act, of 2008.\n  I thank the chairman for his very powerful and thoughtful statement \non behalf of the original bill presented by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, with the managers' amendments that we will incorporate.\n  Simply put, this legislation gives the Intelligence Community the \ntools it needs right now, and over the next 6 years, to protect our \ncountry. The Protect America Act, passed by Congress in August of this \npast year, allowed the intelligence community to close critical \nintelligence gaps. I disagree that the Protect America Act was flawed. \nIt was a temporary measure. It didn't deal with all of the subjects we \nneeded to deal with, including protections for carriers alleged to \nparticipate. But it did not cut back on any of the basic protections in \nFISA, and it served to provide us the means in this 6-month period to \ncollect vitally needed intelligence on foreign subjects who might be \nplanning attacks either on our troops abroad or in the United States. \nBut this vital legislation expires in 1 week, and we must not let those \ngaps reopen.\n  We initially began debate on the FISA Amendments Act in December of \nlast year. As was their right, several Members of this body decided a \nfilibuster was a better course for our national security. So we \nlistened for hours to unfounded allegations about the terrorist \nsurveillance program and to mischaracterizations about the Intelligence \nCommittee's FISA bill. Ultimately, this bill was pulled from the floor \nand further debate was postponed until now.\n  Early this week, we returned to the Senate. Now, given that the \nProtect America Act expires in a few short days, one would have thought \nthat FISA would be the first up on the agenda. I don't want to minimize \nthe importance of Indian health legislation, or any other important \nlegislation that the Senate should consider, but let's be clear: If the \nintelligence community cannot protect this country from terrorist \nattacks, then it doesn't matter much what else we debate or pass. We \nhave to protect the country first and protect our troops and other \npersonnel abroad in order to have a country, and we must improve upon \nother legislation. But here we are, only a few days shy of the PAA's \nexpiration, and the drumbeat is there already by some stating we need \nmore time to consider the Intelligence Committee bill; we should just \ndo a short extension of the PAA. That is a bad idea. Some have called \nit flawed.\n\n  I believe it is important, but I believe the Intelligence Committee \nbill goes much further and does what we absolutely must do to make sure \nnot only that we have the ability to collect on foreign terrorists who \nare planning attacks here or abroad but also to protect the \nconstitutional rights, the privacy rights of Americans.\n  The Intelligence Committee spent over 9 months looking at FISA \nmodernization. We have held hearings. We have gone out to NSA and \nwatched its\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\nimplementation. We have reviewed the terrorist surveillance program. We \nhave looked at the implementation of the PAA. We have gone to review \nall the documents upon which the TSP--the terrorist surveillance \nprogram--was based, and we have come with a solid bipartisan bill. We \nare ready to act, and the intelligence community is waiting for us to \nact, and so are our allies abroad who have relied very heavily and \ncontinue to rely upon our collection ability to help keep their \ncountries safe. Every day, we hear about attacks that have been \ndisrupted by allies across the world. Without being specific in any \nareas, I think one can generally assume that our collections have \nhelped our allies protect themselves against attacks in their \ncountries.\n  There is no reason to extend the PAA, much as I liked it. We have a \nbill that is responsible, and it is more effective. It addresses \nconcerns about the PAA. It gives our intelligence operators the tools \nthey need, and it ensures that our private parties will continue to \ncooperate with the Government. I am pleased the majority leader and \nminority leader have come to agreement on this fact.\n  As the majority leader stated appropriately 2 days ago when he \nsupported moving to this legislation immediately--and I thank the \nmajority leader for that--we need to act now, and I hope we will be \nable to pass a solid FISA bill in short order. Some hope today. I join \nwith that hope. I am not an incurable optimist, but we can always hope.\n  We have before us the Senate Intelligence Committee bill, S. 2248, \nwhich was passed out of the committee by a 13-to-2 vote. We need \nbipartisan legislation. This is bipartisan. Nothing is ever going to be \nunanimous in an area that is this technical and this important, but we \npassed it 13 to 2. This bipartisan bill will give the intelligence \ncommunity the authority and flexibility it needs to track foreign \nterrorists quickly and efficiently.\n  In November, the Judiciary Committee reported a substitute on a \nstraight party-line vote. The substitute added numerous provisions that \nwere not fully vetted with the intelligence community. Regrettably, it \nignores significant concerns expressed by working-level officials in \nthe Department of Justice and the intelligence community--the very \noperators who know how this complex, technical, and overwhelmingly \nsupervised and reviewed system works. The Judiciary Committee also \nignored the concerns of its own minority members. As a result, this \ntotally partisan substitute changed the Intelligence Committee bill in \nways that will gut--gut--our intelligence surveillance capabilities. \nThis substitute amendment is what we will be considering first this \nmorning.\n  Last night, at the very last minute, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee filed a new substitute that modified the original Judiciary \nCommittee substitute. Regrettably, the Judiciary Committee did not \nshare this with my staff, and we only received the strikeout version, \none that shows the changes between the substitute that has been at the \ndesk for 2 months now and this last-minute switch. We received it from \nthe ranking member's staff late last night.\n  After a quick review, my staff and I can tell my colleagues that the \ncore problems remain, and although the DNI and the Department of \nJustice also have had little time to digest it, they have told us that \ntheir primary concerns remain. They cannot support this new substitute. \nIt does not get the job done.\n  Conversely, the Intelligence Committee's bipartisan bill was drafted \nafter months and months of studying the collection program. Members of \nour committee went out to the National Security Agency--we refer to it \nas NSA--to see how the program worked and to inspect the layers of \nprotection built into their collection methodologies to make sure the \nagency stayed within the bounds of law.\n  Over several months, Chairman Rockefeller and I put together an \nagreement with our committee on both sides which adds more protections \nto the constitutional rights and the privacy rights of American \ncitizens. I can be very proud and I think the Members of this body can \nbe very proud that we have extended and improved protections for \nAmerican citizens.\n  We worked with the intelligence community representatives and the \nDepartment of Justice lawyers to make sure our legislation would work \nand would not impede vital collection--more protection but keep the \nsystem working. I think that is where we ought to be, and that is where \nwe are in the underlying Intelligence Committee bill.\n\n  Most importantly, we fashioned a legislative solution that both \nDemocrats and Republicans could accept. I thank our Intelligence \nCommittee members and staffs for their efforts, long and hard work, to \ncome up with this bipartisan bill. Our bill has been publicly available \nfor scrutiny for over 3 months now, and it remains the most solid \nbipartisan way to move forward.\n  Two provisions of the bill, however, were added to the initial markup \nwithout the input of the intelligence community. As a result, both \nprovisions in the bill could cause unintended operational consequences, \nand they needed to be fixed. Chairman Rockefeller, Senator Whitehouse, \nSenator Wyden, and I worked together with the community to come up with \nsolutions to these problems, and I hope we can have broad support for a \nmanagers' amendment to remedy that situation. One of these provisions \nprovided important new protections, but it had to be reworked to \nprotect Americans abroad in a manner which was consistent with our \nstructure of laws and those of other countries.\n  The DNI has told us that with the managers' amendment fixing these \ntwo problems, the community will support our bill. That is important \nfor Chairman Rockefeller and me because we want to pass a bill that \nworks and will become law. It would do no good to pass a bill that some \nmay feel good about or may pass for good politics but does not work for \nthose who protect us in all of our intelligence agencies. So the DNI's \nsupport of this bill, in particular, is critical. Consequently, with \nthese fixes applied, we will also have a bill the President will sign \ninto law.\n  My intention as a floor manager--and I believe Chairman Rockefeller \nstands shoulder to shoulder with me in this--is to pass a bill that the \nDNI supports and that the President will sign. I believe we have that \nright now with the fixes to be applied.\n  If we attempt to change key painstakingly constructive provisions or \nto add bad provisions, however, we could hinder the intelligence \ncommunity's ability to do its job and jeopardize the DNI's support for \nthis bill and the chances of it becoming law. With the expiration of \nthe PAA in a few days, I believe this is not the path we should take in \nthe Senate. Anyone who has read FISA knows that it is very technical \nand each word matters. So it is imperative we do not add provisions \nwithout the input of the intelligence community, and we need to listen \nto their concerns. They are experts. They operate an incredibly \ntechnical and complicated system that is overlaid with legislation \ncarefully drafted to recognize their capabilities, their limitations, \nand, most importantly, protections for U.S. persons and American \ncitizens. We saw firsthand how difficult it is to deal with amendments \nthat are not cleared with the intelligence community to make sure they \nwork.\n  Let me just say that the Department of Justice and the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence have been very helpful throughout the \nprocess, but we should not mistake their willingness to provide \ntechnical support to avoid operational problems with support for \ncertain provisions. So while the DNI may have provided some technical \nsupport, there are several amendments that I believe, if added to our \nbill, could cause problems for the intelligence community, lose the \nsupport of the DNI and thus our ability to get this bill signed by the \nPresident.\n  First, I expect there to be some efforts to undo or modify the civil \nliberty provision in the Intelligence Committee's bill. Chairman \nRockefeller has already delivered a very strong and persuasive argument \nfor this liability protection. It has been said once very well by the \nchairman, but this being the Senate, it needs to be said again, and I \nwill be happy to do so.\n  This provision is essential to foreign targeting authorities. Without \nretroactive and prospective civil liability protection, it becomes much \nless likely that our private sector partners will be\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\nable or willing to assist us in the future. That means the intelligence \ncommunity would have to spend great time compelling telecommunications \nproviders in each instance who are reluctant for fears of civil \nlawsuits to assist, to work with us to track terrorists.\n  The committee studied this issue, and we reached a broad bipartisan \nconsensus that civil liability protection is for providers and not \nimmunity for Government officials. That was the appropriate action. I \nrepeat, the civil liability provision in this bill is for private \nparties who may have assisted the Government. There is no immunity or \nprotection for the Government itself.\n  Additionally, the concept of ``substitution,'' where the Government \nis substituted for the private party as a defendant in court, is not an \nacceptable alternative. That would allow litigation to continue, \nincluding discovery against the providers, thereby risking the \ndisclosure of our sensitive intelligence sources and methods.\n  At his confirmation hearing, I asked General Hayden, the nominee for \nthe head of the CIA, who had previously been the head of NSA, how badly \nthe disclosures of our intelligence collection methods had hurt us in \nthe battle to get the intelligence we need. General Hayden told us \nruefully that we are now applying the Darwinian theory to terrorists: \nWe are only capturing the dumb ones.\n  With substitution, we would not only be risking disclosure of sources \nand methods, we would also, however, embitter private parties against \nus whose cooperation becomes public, thus endangering their personnel, \ntheir facilities, and their business reputation here and abroad, with \ngrave consequences to those who had participated, as Chairman \nRockefeller said, in compliance with a Government directive from the \nhighest officials in the land, and we would put taxpayers' dollars at \nrisk for trial lawyers' coffers. We would also incur great expense in \ndefending those lawsuits. The orders were issued--and I will discuss \nmore about this later--under the President's article II constitutional \npower and responsibility to conduct foreign affairs.\n  Let me say a few words about an idea that came up shortly before the \ndebate in the summer. Some are suggesting that before civil liability \nprotection is granted, the FISA Court, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court--and I will refer to it as the FISC--the FISC or \nother court must determine that those providers who allegedly assisted \nthe Government with the terrorist surveillance program acted in good \nfaith and pursuant to an objectively reasonable belief that the \ndirectives were lawful.\n  As reflected in the Intelligence Committee report accompanying S. \n2248, the committee has already made this determination. We have \nstudied this issue extensively, and we concluded that civil liability \nprotection was the best and only solution. Why would Congress want to \nturn over its collective judgment to a single judge and pass a law \nstating that judge's ruling would be the final word on this issue? We \ndon't even know what that ruling would be. This does not make much \nsense to me. We already went through this problem with the judicial \nvariance on the FISC before, remember? The President's program was put \nunder FISA, and then changes within the court, different judges, led to \na problem with the intelligence gaps that spurred the need for short-\nterm legislation last August. Congress should not roll the dice on this \nissue, close our eyes, cross our fingers and say: Whatever judge \nhappens to be on call the day this issue comes up, well, that will be \nthe final word on this question. Remember, the FISC's function is to \napprove applications for electronic surveillance. It is not set up for \nnor has established competence in this area. It makes no sense.\n  The providers need civil liability protection, and they deserve it \nnow, not the prospect of further proving their good faith before yet \nanother court. The longer this litigation drags on, the more likely it \nis that our intelligence sources and methods will be disclosed and the \ncommunications providers' businesses will suffer and they, their \nfacilities, and their personnel will be at risk. It also becomes more \nlikely and understandable that these companies, on which both the law \nenforcement and the Intelligence Committee rely for critical and timely \ninformation, could refuse to assist us in times of our need because of \nvalid business reasons about the potential for further lawsuits. And I \nam not just talking about terrorist threats, I am talking about a \nprovider refusing to give information voluntarily to help find a \nkidnapped child or help to find those who sexually entrap children on \nthe Internet or proliferation or what have you. Should we be willing to \ntake this risk? I don't think so.\n\n  Now, let me move to some of the issues the Judiciary Committee \nmodified in our bill to the detriment of the overall product. Let me be \nclear, the new substitute that was filed last night is the same old \nwolf in different clothing. It does not alleviate any of these \nconcerns. The Intelligence Committee bill included, as part of our \ncompromise, a reiteration of the exclusive means provision in the \ncurrent law, which states that FISA is the ``exclusive means'' in \nstatute for conducting electronic surveillance. No statute that \nCongress ever passes can trump the President's article II powers. \nNumerous courts, and even the FISC itself, have reviewed this and \nstated the powers given to the President under the Constitution cannot \nbe extinguished by a law passed by Congress. Even though we have passed \na law on exclusive means, we have also passed a law called the \nAuthorization for the Use of Military Force, which has to be read in \nconjunction with FISA.\n  Clearly, even those who believe a statute can somehow impinge on the \narticle II constitutional powers of the President must recognize the \npowers of the President, if they were lessened by FISA, were \nreinvigorated by AUMF. Congress is making a statement in ``exclusive \nmeans'' that we want to see surveillance conducted under FISA. We have \nseen many attempts to broaden this language, but this is an area that \ncalls for extreme caution. Exclusivity is more than a policy statement, \nit has a real operational component.\n  As we now know from our own experience in drafting this provision, \nthe slightest word change can impede vital intelligence collection. I \nbelieve the Intelligence Committee's version addresses Members' views \nabout exclusivity and further strengthens that statement, while at the \nsame time preserving the ability to gather intelligence. Conversely, \nthe majority's Judiciary Committee substitute now requires an act of \nCongress after the next attack, potentially before our intelligence \nprofessionals can do what they need to protect us. There is no \nexception if the attack comes from al-Qaida or another terrorist \norganization.\n  Now, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that as we \nstand here today, we have no idea where or when the next attack may \ncome. Are we, each of us, willing to take the risk that Congress may \nnot be able to act; that for whatever reason Members cannot make it \nback to Washington, DC, we cannot get a bill passed and signed by the \nPresident, which would leave our intelligence community without the \nauthorities it needs to counter the threat or protect this country? I, \nfor one, don't want to be explaining that back home to my constituents \nin Missouri. It is another nice sounding idea politically to some that \nmakes no sense operationally and shuts down some potential intelligence \ncollection.\n  Moreover, the Judiciary Committee's bill, and the latest substitute, \nwould allow the FISC to assess compliance with the minimization \nprocedures used for the acquisition of foreign intelligence information \nfrom individuals outside the United States. Minimization procedures are \ndesigned to protect U.S. identities if communications of U.S. persons \nare accidentally swept up in a surveillance operation or if a U.S. \nperson is party to a conversation with a target--a lawful target--but \nthat U.S. person is not of intelligence interest him or herself. We \nminimize, suppress, don't even record the name of that U.S. person. If \nthere is no intelligence value, then that person is not at risk. To be \nat risk, that person would have to be receiving or instituting a call \nto a lawful target. That means that if somebody is calling a family \nmember abroad, a business activity abroad, then there is no reason to \nfear that even those conversations would be picked up. But if others \nare picked up that are of no intelligence value, they would be \nminimized or suppressed.\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\n  Giving the court the ability, supposedly, or the responsibility to \nassess compliance may sound like a good idea in the abstract, but when \nwe talk about foreign targeting, we are outside the FISC's expertise. \nThe FISC was created solely to issue orders for domestic surveillance \non a particular target. Congress, in 1978, recognized the court's \nexpertise over domestic matters but specifically left foreign \nsurveillance activities to the executive branch and the intelligence \ncommunity and the oversight of the intelligence committees. By now \nrequiring judicial review of minimization procedures for a foreign \ntarget, we would take a huge step back from a system that worked well \nfor almost 30 years. So there is a red line, and I need to draw it.\n  But that line is already drawn. As a practical matter, when the FISC \nassesses compliance with minimization procedures, it would be second-\nguessing trained analysts' decisions about which foreign terrorist to \ntrack and how to do that. The FISC knows what to look for when it \nissues a warrant to tap someone's phone in Virginia, but when it comes \nto analyzing intelligence leads and deciding which foreign terrorists \nor spies should be surveilled, the court is simply not competent to \nmake these judgments. This is what assessing compliance would have them \ndo. The court knows this. Let me point to the court's own words from \nits published opinion on December 11, over a month ago, in the case In \nre: Motion for Release of Court Records. There the FISC judges say they \nare:\n\n       Not expected or designed to become experts in foreign \n     intelligence activities, and do not make substantive \n     judgments on the propriety or need for a particular \n     surveillance. Even if a typical FISA judge had more expertise \n     in national security matters than a typical district court \n     judge, that expertise would still not equal that of the \n     Executive Branch, which is constitutionally entrusted with \n     protecting the national security.\n\n  That is a quote from the court which some want to give this \nresponsibility which they say they do not have. We need to heed the \nwords of the FISC and not require them to make judgments they \nthemselves believe are better left to the executive branch.\n  Let me repeat for my colleagues to hear clearly. The FISC, the FISA \nCourt itself, is virtually saying: Congress, don't do this. We are not \nthe right ones to make this determination. We should be wary to \ndisregard their own assessment of their own competency in this vital \nintelligence collection area.\n  Additionally, throughout this debate, we must remember we are talking \nabout foreign terrorists operating in foreign countries intent on \nharming us and our interests. Senator Leahy's new substitute slightly \nmodifies a requirement from the original substitute that the Department \nof Justice inspector general conduct a comprehensive review of the \nPresident's Terrorist Surveillance Program. That modification, however, \ndoes not address the underlying concerns with his provision. This \nreview simply is not necessary and is beyond the expertise of the DOJ \ninspector general.\n\n  The Intelligence Committee has had numerous briefings and hearings on \nthe TSP. We have spoken at length with lawyers from the Department of \nJustice and with the operators, and we have read document after \ndocument on which this program was based. We have spent more time on \nFISA than I ever dreamed possible or that I ever wanted to do. Yet I \nhave not heard one convincing argument as to why this review must be \nconducted. Again, it may look good politically, it may make good sound \nbites, but we have reviewed this program to death over the past year. \nYet another review is redundant, unnecessary, and because of that is \nwasteful.\n  Finally, as a part of my agreement with Chairman Rockefeller, we \nincluded a 6-year sunset in the bill. Personally, I think sunsets are a \nbad idea when we are talking about national security. The Attorney \nGeneral, General Mukasey, has stated repeatedly, ``There are no sunsets \nin our enemies' fatwas.'' I understand what he is getting at. The \nterrorists' desire to get after us is not limited. We should give our \nintelligence operators something they can hang their hat on when they \nretool their systems and move forward with intelligence collection.\n  If there is a debate about sunsets, I am considering saying we ought \nto get rid of even the 6-year sunset. I agreed to 6 years to get this \nbill moving, but shorter than that I don't believe is acceptable. If we \nprovide stricter, shorter term sunsets, that would tell the private \nentities and our intelligence communities that Congress's view on civil \nliability protection is only temporary and the power for our \nintelligence collection is only temporary. This new statute gives our \noperators confidence in the new statute. It gives our collaborating \nallies abroad confidence we will be there.\n  Let me make one thing clear. Our job in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, and the same on the House side, is to review intelligence \ncollection methods. We review it on a semiannual or even monthly basis. \nIf we find there is a problem with this bill, we should not have to \nwait until the sunset comes to change it. We see a problem, we need to \nfix it. We don't need to wait for 6 years or 4 years to fix it. If \nthere is a problem, let's start fixing it as soon as we find it.\n  A sunset does not prevent us from passing new legislation when we see \nfit. No sunset at all would put even greater pressure on us to make \nsure it is working properly. If in 1 year the bill was shown to be \ninadequate, we should act immediately to fix it, not wait until the \nsunset. So I don't like sunsets, but the 6 years was a compromise with \nthe chairman and other members of the committee to produce this bill.\n  The Judiciary Committee, in this new substitute, seeks to further \nshorten the time frame to 4 years. Our intelligence collectors, our \ntroops on the battlefield, the private parties who depend on this \nauthorization need certainty, not authorities that change depending on \nwhat year it is. A 4-year sunset would not give them the certainty they \nneed.\n  In conclusion, our intelligence collectors, our troops who are in \nharm's way, need this legislation, and our country needs this \nlegislation. But let me talk about the troops. In May, when I visited \nIraq, I talked directly with the commander of our Joint Special \nOperations Command, who told me the limitations under the old law, \nshutting down of the collection that occurred because of the new \ntechnology, so adequately described by the chairman, prevented him from \ncollecting key information he needed to protect our troops in the \ntheater, on the battlefield. My son happened to be one who was there at \nthe time. That got my attention. It had the attention of the troops and \nthe commanders. The commander told us he could kill or capture top al-\nQaida leaders, but he was not able to collect signals intelligence on \nthem. Does that make sense? No.\n  The bottom line in this story of FISA is terrorists were able to use \ntechnology and our own outdated laws to stay a step ahead of us. We \ncan't afford to give them that step. The Intelligence Committee's bill \ngives our intelligence operators and law enforcement officials the \ntools they need to conduct surveillance on foreign terrorists and \nforeign countries planning to conduct attacks inside the United States \nagainst our troops and against our allies. It is the balance we need to \nprotect our civil liberties without handcuffing our intelligence \nprofessionals.\n  I hope we can do the right thing--pass this bill, with the perfecting \nmanagers' amendment but without any additional changes that will \ncompromise its functionality and prevent it from becoming law. We need \na bill both Democrats and Republicans support, the DNI supports, that \nis good for the intelligence community, and that the President will \nsign into law.\n  That means we need to dispense with the Judiciary substitute that is \nimmediately before us and proceed with consideration of amendments to \nthe bipartisan Intelligence Committee bill. I look forward to making \nthis happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nmy remarks, the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, be recognized for his \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Leahy in his \neffort to replace the Senate Intelligence Committee bill with the \nversion passed by the Judiciary Committee. I am a member of both of \nthese\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\ncommittees. As a member of both committees, I have been deeply involved \nin the process of having looked at those two products.\n  Having been involved in helping shape them, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Judiciary Committee version of this legislation. Indeed, I \nhad hoped very much that the Senate would take up that bill to begin \nwith rather than the flawed Intelligence Committee bill.\n  In December, I along with 13 other Senators, urged the majority \nleader to make the Judiciary Committee bill the base bill on the Senate \nfloor. Unfortunately, our request was denied. So it is very \ndisappointing that we are now forced to fight an uphill battle of \noffering the Judiciary bill as an amendment.\n  I would like to lay out the reasons the Senate should support the \nJudiciary Committee bill rather than the Intelligence Committee bill. \nOne obvious reason is the Judiciary Committee bill, unlike the \nIntelligence Committee bill, does not contain unjustified retroactive \nimmunity for companies alleged to have participated in an illegal \nwiretapping program.\n  I do not want to spend a lot of time on this today because there will \nbe an opportunity to debate this issue as the Senate's consideration of \nthis legislation moves forward. But I will say that having spent the \nlast year and a half studying what happened at the NSA from 2001 to \n2006, I strongly oppose immunity.\n  Under current law, telecom companies already get immunity as long as \nthey follow certain requirements that are clearly spelled out in the \nlaw. I see no reason for Congress to change the rules this late in the \ngame.\n  Today, I would like to focus on the other significant parts of these \nbills, the part contained in title I of each bill that contains \nsweeping new changes to the FISA law for years to come. Let me start \noff by pointing out that there are a number of similarities between \ntitle I of the Intelligence Committee bill and title I of the Judiciary \nCommittee bill. Their basic structure is the same.\n  Title I of both bills authorize the Government to conduct \nsurveillance of individuals reasonably believed to be overseas without \ncourt approval for individualized warrants. Both bills authorize the \nGovernment to develop and implement procedures to govern that type of \nsurveillance and provide the procedures to the FISA Court for review \nafter they have gone into effect.\n  Now, let's be clear. These are extraordinary powers that both bills \ngive to the executive branch. And there is no difference between these \ntwo bills in terms of the intelligence they permit the Government to \nacquire. No difference between the bills as regards to the effort to go \nafter those who may be trying to do us harm in this respect. Rather, \nthe differences between these two bills comes in the form of critically \nimportant checks and balances on those powers.\n  The Judiciary bill contains a number of important changes to improve \ncourt oversight of these broad new executive branch authorities and to \nprotect the privacy of law-abiding Americans--the privacy of law-\nabiding Americans. The Intelligence Committee bill, on the other hand, \nleaves it up to the executive branch to police itself, an approach that \nhas all too often proven to be a bad idea throughout American history. \nI would say particularly under this administration.\n  Let me state as clearly as I can the differences between these two \nbills have nothing--nothing--to do with our ability to combat \nterrorism. They have everything to do with ensuring that the executive \nbranch follows the rule of law and does not unnecessarily listen in on \nthe private communications of Americans who are doing absolutely \nnothing wrong.\n  This debate is about whether the court should have an independent \noversight role and what protections should apply to the communications \nof Americans that somehow get swept up in these broad new surveillance \npowers. If you believe the courts should have a meaningful oversight \nrole with regard to Government surveillance, then you should support \nthe Judiciary bill.\n  If you believe that Congress should safeguard the communications of \nAmericans at home that could be swept up in a broad new surveillance \nprogram that is supposed to be focused on foreigners overseas, then you \nshould support the Judiciary bill. It is as simple as that.\n  That said, the Judiciary Committee bill is not perfect. More still \nneeds to be done to protect the privacy of Americans. That is why it \nshould be an easy decision to support the Judiciary Committee bill as \nour starting point on the floor of the Senate as we work on this \nlegislation.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that the process by which the \nJudiciary Committee considered, drafted, and amended and reported out \nits bill was an open one, allowing outside experts and the public at \nlarge the opportunity to review and comment. With regard to legislation \nso directly connected to the constitutional rights of Americans, the \nresult of this open process should be accorded great weight, especially \nin light of the Judiciary Committee's unique role and expertise in \nprotecting those rights.\n\n  I also point out that several of the administration's criticisms of \nthe Judiciary Committee bill have been based on technical drafting \nconcerns. But in the version that Chairman Leahy has brought to the \nSenate floor, he has made the changes necessary to address those \ntechnical concerns. So I hope we do not hear any arguments in this \nfloor debate about these issues that have already been addressed.\n  Exactly what are the differences between these two bills? First, the \nJudiciary bill gives the secret FISA Court more authority to operate as \nan independent check to the executive branch. For example, one \nprovision in the Judiciary bill fixes an enormous problem with the \nIntelligence Committee bill; that is, the complete lack of incentives \nfor the Government to target people overseas rather than to target \npeople in the United States.\n  The Judiciary bill solves this problem by giving the FISA Court the \ndiscretion to limit the use of information concerning Americans when \nthat information is obtained through procedures that the FISA Court \nultimately finds are not--are not--reasonably designed to target \npersons overseas.\n  Another provision of the Judiciary bill ensures that the FISA Court \nhas the authority to oversee compliance with what are called \nminimization procedures. Minimization procedures have been held up as \nthe primary protection in the Intelligence Committee bill for the \nprivacy of Americans whose communications get swept up in this new \nsurveillance authority.\n  Now, I do not think current minimization procedures are strong enough \nto do the job. But to the extent that minimization can help protect \nAmericans' privacy, its implementation surely needs to be overseen by \nthe court. So that means giving the court the authority to review \nwhether the Government is complying with the minimization rules and to \nask for the information it needs to make that assessment.\n  Now, without this provision from the Judiciary bill, the Government's \ndissemination and use of information on innocent law-abiding Americans \nwill occur without any checks and balances whatsoever, no checks and \nbalances at all.\n  Once again, ``trust us'' will have to do. Now, I believe in this \ncase, as in so many others, ``trust us'' is not enough. The Judiciary \nbill offers other types of oversight, as well. For one thing, it \nrequires relevant inspectors general to conduct a complete review of \nthe President's illegal wiretapping program, which, frankly, is long \noverdue.\n  It improves congressional access to FISA Court orders. The \nIntelligence Committee bill required the Congress to be provided with \norders, decisions, and opinions of the FISA Court--that includes \nsignificant interpretations of the law--within 45 days after they are \nissued.\n  Now, that is good as far as it goes. But the Judiciary Committee bill \nadds that Congress should be provided with the pleadings, the pleadings \nfiled with the court associated with the opinions that contain \nsignificant interpretations of law.\n  At times, the court's opinions merely reference and approve arguments \nmade in the Government's pleadings. In that case, the pleadings may be \ncritical to understanding the reasoning behind any particular decision. \nIt is not enough just to have the cursory court opinion.\n  It also requires that significant interpretations of law not \npreviously provided to Congress over the past 5 years\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\nbe provided. Congress needs to have the full story of how the law has \nbeen interpreted in the past in order to make the right decisions on \nwhat changes in the law should be made in the future.\n  The Judiciary bill also does a better job of protecting Americans \nfrom widespread warrantless wiretapping. First, it provides real \nprotection against what is called reverse targeting. It ensures that if \nthe Government is wiretapping a foreigner overseas in order to collect \nthe communications of the American with whom that foreign target is \ncommunicating, it gets a court order on the American. Specifically, the \nJudiciary Committee bill says the Government needs an individualized \ncourt order when a significant purpose of its surveillance is, in fact, \nlistening to an American at home.\n  The Director of National Intelligence himself said reverse targeting \nviolates the fourth amendment. All this provision that I am raising \ndoes is simply codify that principle. The administration continues to \noppose this provision.\n  I have a simple question: Why? Why is it opposed to a provision that \nprohibits a practice that its own Director of National Intelligence \nsays is unconstitutional?\n  The Judiciary Committee bill also prohibits something called bulk \ncollection. Now, that is this sweeping up of all communications between \nthe United States and overseas. The DNI said in public testimony that \nthis type of massive bulk collection would be--would be--permitted by \nthe Protect America Act that is currently in effect. But he has also \nsaid that what the Government is seeking to do with these authorities \nis something very different.\n\n  It is, he said:\n\n       Surgical. A telephone number is surgical. So, if you know \n     that number, you can select it out.\n\n  So if the DNI has said he does not need broader authorities, there \nshould be no objection to this modest provision which, again, simply \nholds the DNI to his word.\n  The prohibition against bulk collection ensures that the Government \nhas some--some--foreign intelligence interest in the communications \nthat it is collecting and not just vacuuming up every last \ncommunication between Americans and their friends and business \ncolleagues overseas.\n  Targets do not need to be known or named individuals; they can be \nphone numbers, which is how the DNI has described how the Government \ncollects. And the Government does not have to identify or explain its \ninterest in the targets to the FISA Court. It merely has to make a \ngeneral certification that individual targets exist.\n  As was already alluded to on the Senate floor, the Judiciary \nCommittee bill also has a sunset of 4 years rather than 6 years, \nensuring that Congress will reevaluate this law at least once before \nthe end of the next Presidential term. And, critically, it contains a \nstrong statement that Congress intends for FISA to be the exclusive \nmeans by which foreign intelligence surveillance is conducted. It also \ncloses purported statutory loopholes that the Justice Department relied \non to make its torture arguments that the congressional authorization \nfor the use of force in Afghanistan authorized the President's illegal \nwiretapping program. The Judiciary bill makes clear, once and for all, \nthat the President must follow the law.\n  For all of these reasons, the Senate should support the Judiciary \nCommittee's product. Let me repeat what I said at the outset. The \ndifferences between these two bills have nothing to do with our ability \nto combat terrorism. Nothing. They have everything to do with ensuring \nthat the executive branch adheres to the rule of law and does not \nnecessarily listen in on the private communications of Americans. The \nfact that the administration is so strongly resisting these commonsense \nprotections really says a lot. It ought to give pause to those who are \nconsidering opposing it.\n  It is time for Congress to stop being an enabler when it comes to \nthis administration's indifference to the rule of law and, instead, \nstart being a protector of the rights and freedoms of our citizens.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Judiciary Committee bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I, as the Senator from \nWisconsin, my colleague, have had difficulty as we sit side by side in \nthe Intelligence Committee with the issue of immunity.\n  First of all, I want to say that I think the intelligence community, \nheaded by Admiral McConnell, is doing an excellent job. They are \ncorrecting colossal mistakes. We had a colossal mistake on intelligence \non September 11. We had another colossal mistake of intelligence \nleading up to the Iraq war. And in order for us to protect ourselves, \nwe, in fact, have to have information in order to disrupt the plans to \nattack us, to harm the Nation.\n  So I give credit to Admiral McConnell, the Director of National \nIntelligence. I give credit to General Hayden, the head of the CIA, to \nSteve Kappes, the Deputy Director of the CIA. I think they are doing a \nterrific job.\n  I compliment the chairman and the vice chairman of our committee, and \nthey are within earshot, and I want them to hear how much this Senator \nappreciates their cooperation between each other to work in a \nbipartisan fashion. They are talking right now, so I am not sure they \nare hearing me. I want them to know my personal appreciation for how \nthey have taken a bipartisan approach. It is important that we thank \npeople for the work they are doing.\n\n  This legislation is an attempt to be crafted so that these folks can \nbetter perform their job but at the same time protecting the precious \ncivil liberties Americans have that make us unique from any other \nsociety on planet Earth. We want to protect those rights of privacy. I \nbelieve there are protections in this bill that will extend to \nAmericans, regardless of their physical location. One of the things we \namended in the Intelligence Committee was that it doesn't make any \ndifference, if an American is here in the United States or if they are \nabroad, if you are going after an American as a target, they ought to \nhave to go to the FISA Court to get a court order called a warrant, \nregardless of where that American is, if they are a target of \nsurveillance. That is important. It is important to support our \nconstitutional protections of privacy and that the Government can't \ncome and intrude in our lives. I think we have started off in the right \ndirection.\n  As the Senator from Wisconsin has said, I have a problem with the \nblanket immunity as well. I agree with Admiral McConnell. At the end of \nthe day, we have to have the cooperation of the 10 communications \ncompanies, and they should not have the threat of a spurious lawsuit \nhanging over their heads, thinking they are going to be dragged out in \npublic court over time as a means of trying to extract a pound of flesh \nfrom them. There should be every opportunity and encouragement for the \ntelecommunications companies to cooperate with the U.S. Government \nintelligence community for the protection of the country. The bill \nbefore us does, in fact, give that immunity for any of the surveillance \nthat did not have a warrant from the FISA Court from the period of \nSeptember 11, 2001, to January 17, 2007.\n  The problem I have with that is, I am not sure the telecommunications \ncompanies were attending to their knitting, as to whether they were \ngetting legal orders from the United States Government, not in the \nfirst year after September 11, not in the second year, perhaps not even \nin the third year after the attack on New York City and the Pentagon \nand the attempt on other facilities in Washington. I am talking about \nthis went on for a fourth year and a fifth year. I am not sure that, in \nfact, they had the legal basis to say that the Government, in fact, was \ncomplying with the law. Of course, I make that judgment, and my \njudgment is based on something I can't say here on the Senate floor, \nbecause it is not only highly classified; it is highly compartmented. I \nhave read the documents. I have a problem with that.\n  At the end of the day, if it means we have to pass the bill and it \nhas immunity in it, I am going to vote for the bill, because it is much \nmore important that we go ahead and have a procedure set out by which \nwe can try to protect ourselves from the bad guys and at the same time \nprotect the civil rights, the right of privacy of our citizens. That is \ncontained within the committee bill, and that is the way I voted in \ncommittee. I voted against the immunity,\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\nbut that amendment only got three votes. When it came to passage of the \nfinal bill, I voted for it, because that is in the interest of the \ncountry. If that is what I am confronted with here, that is the way I \nam going to vote and support the chairman and vice chairman of our \ncommittee.\n  Maybe it doesn't have to be as stark as Senator Feingold has said, \nthat it is either immunity or no immunity. Maybe what the issue \nultimately ought to be is somewhere in between. That is the Feinstein-\nNelson amendment that will be offered later in which it will put a \nreview of the telecommunications carriers' actions squarely under the \njurisdiction of the special Federal court set up to handle these top-\nsecret matters called the FISA Court. The court would review all \naspects of the telecommunications carriers' involvement and make a \ndecision on immunity based on three criteria. No. 1, if the court \ndecided that the telecommunications carrier did not provide the \nassistance as alleged, then, of course, the court would dismiss the \nlawsuit against the company. No. 2, if the assistance was provided, the \ncourt then would determine whether the documentation sent by the U.S. \nGovernment to the companies met the requirements of the law and was \nadequate. This law that would have to be met states that a \ntelecommunications carrier needs a court order or a written \ncertification from the Attorney General that no court order is \nrequired. It further has to state that all statutory requirements have \nbeen met. So then this FISA Court, in other words, would, in fact, \njudge that. If the conditions of the statute had been met, then the \ncompanies would be shielded from the lawsuit and the lawsuit would be \ndismissed.\n  Or the third criteria the court would look at: If the special Federal \ncourt, the FISA Court, found there was no certification given to the \ntelecommunications company, then the court would examine whether the \ncompany acted in good faith and with an objectively reasonable belief \nthat it was legal. If the court determined that, then the \nimmunity would be provided.\n\n  That seems to be a way in which the companies would be protected, and \nat the same time we can get to this issue of this third year, fourth \nyear, and fifth year that the United States Government is saying this \nis legal without a court order, when, in fact, it seems to me that the \nCEOs of those companies and the general counsels of those companies \nought to have been jumping up and down saying: Wait a minute. We want \nadditional information. The amendment to be offered by the Senator from \nCalifornia and me creates a series of three requirements that must be \nmet in order for the telecommunications companies to receive immunity. \nIt is going to preserve the rights of private citizens to make their \ncase in front of a judge without jeopardizing these highly sensitive \nkinds of not only top-secret but compartmented material that need to be \nclassified for the protection of the country.\n  Practically speaking, what is going to happen? We can't pass anything \naround here unless you get 60 votes. That is a huge threshold. As this \ncomes before the Senate, I doubt the Feingold amendment is going to get \n60 votes to cut off debate. I doubt the Feinstein amendment is going to \nget 60 votes. That brings us right back to the Intelligence Committee \nbill which is before us right now, in which case, on final passage, I \nam certainly going to vote for that. But there is another opportunity \nto address this specific issue. It is unlikely that the House of \nRepresentatives is going to pass this legislation with the immunity for \nthe companies. Therefore, there will be a huge difference between the \nSenate bill and the House bill, as the clock continues to tick down \ntoward the deadline in which agreement is going to have to be reached. \nIt seems to me the Feinstein-Nelson approach is a reasonable compromise \nat that point.\n  I hope in time we are going to be able to pass this, that we will \npass it before the deadline which, to my knowledge, is in a week or so, \nmaybe a week and a half. The majority leader says he is going to keep \nus in all weekend in order to get this passed. If I were he, I would do \nthe same. It is so critically important to our country that we pass \nthis legislation.\n  So on we go. Let the legislative process work itself out. Hopefully \nwe will get this thing passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The senior Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, may I ask the distinguished Senator from \nTexas to yield for a unanimous consent request and then she will be \nrecognized after that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Would the distinguished vice chairman be willing to \nyield for a parliamentary matter?\n  Mr. BOND. Please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 2 p.m. today be for debate prior to the vote in relation to the \nJudiciary Committee amendment, as modified, with no amendment in order \nto the amendment prior to the vote, with all time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Leahy and Bond or their designees, with the \n30 minutes prior to the vote divided as provided above, with Senator \nLeahy controlling the final 15 minutes and the vote will be at 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, since we have had two speakers on the \nmajority side, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hutchison and then \nSenator Brownback be recognized on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, Mr. President, let me say, while the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member of the Intelligence Committee are both on the floor, \nthat I believe the Intelligence Committee has done a fine job on this \nvery important legislation, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAmendments Act, that will modernize and allow our law enforcement \nofficials to have the tools they need to protect our country.\n  The Intelligence Committee voted the bill out on a bipartisan basis. \nIt was certainly debated and balanced within the committee. I think \nthis Senate should support the Intelligence Committee and all the work \nthey have done to prepare this very important legislation. So to \nSenator Rockefeller and Senator Bond, I say thank you for doing a great \njob.\n  I do rise today to support this bill. It is essential that we do so \nto protect our country. I was proud to join my colleagues last August \nin passing the Protect America Act. It will expire in 8 days--in 8 \ndays. The majority leader has said we are going to pass this \nlegislation this week out of the Senate. That is a good thing. The \nHouse needs a week to look at it and determine if they will pass it. I \nhope they will pass the same legislation that is before us from the \nIntelligence Committee and send it to the President without amendment.\n  Our enemies are not going to expire in 8 days. Al-Qaida, we know, \nuses cell phones and wireless Internet networks and countless other \ntechnologies that were not in place when the original FISA passed 30 \nyears ago. Thirty years ago, we did not have cell phones. Thirty years \nago, you would go to a court and say: We want to tap the phone line of \nthis number. Today, a cell phone can be thrown away before you can go \nto get a court order.\n  So in the act we passed last year, we determined that you could get a \ncourt order to intercept the communications between suspected \nterrorists and you can go to the person rather than to a phone number, \nwhich would be unusable by the time you could get a court order. So \nthat is one way we have begun to upgrade the technology to match the \nthreat. Because our enemy is very technologically capable. We must be \nable to meet that with law enforcement. Delays could mean the \ndifference between life and death.\n  Unless we take action, this protection of our ability to intercept \npotential plots against our country will go out of existence. We \ncannot, in good conscience, let that happen.\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\n  Let's talk about the litigation aspects because that is going to be \nthe first amendment we vote on. The first amendment we vote on is going \nto be out of the Judiciary Committee. There will be other amendments, I \nknow, that have already been discussed on the floor regarding \nlitigation against telecom companies.\n  After 9/11, the Federal Government requested that America's telecom \ncompanies share proprietary information to help prevent future \nterrorist attacks. After the existence of the national security program \nwas illegally leaked 2 years ago, America's telecom companies began to \nget hit with dozens of class action lawsuits that could expose them to \ncatastrophic liabilities.\n  Originally, the telecom companies had nothing to fear from those \nlawsuits because they had evidence that what they did was at the \nrequest of our law enforcement officials. But due to the sensitive \nnature of the Government's request of these companies, the law \nenforcement officials barred the telecom companies from the release of \ncertain documents that they needed for their trials. So we have created \na situation in which companies have cooperated with law enforcement to \nkeep our country safe, and then, when the lawsuits arose, they were not \nallowed to defend themselves. Now, some of my colleagues say: Well, \nthat is tough. They should have known better.\n  We are talking about the security of our country. The people who are \nin the business of telecommunications were asked to be patriotic \nAmericans. And they said yes. So if we do not give them protection for \nthese actions, as well as those going forward, we are going to put our \nbusinesses in an untenable situation. Either they can help law \nenforcement, be sued and hampered in their legal defense because they \nare not able to introduce certain types of evidence because of security \nreasons, or they can say no to law enforcement and put our country in \njeopardy.\n  Now, I will tell you that I have talked to the CEO of one of our \nmajor telecommunications companies. He has said: Senator, I am going to \ndo what is right for America. That is my first responsibility as a \ncitizen of this country. But, Senator, I don't think I should be put in \njeopardy for my shareholders and my consumers while being a patriotic \nAmerican.\n  The Senate must act responsibly. We must be able to go to a company \nand say: help our country. Because in the past a terrorist could \ncommunicate between two countries overseas, and we would have the right \nto intercept those messages. I wish I could say we have no enemies \ninside our country who would communicate with a terrorist outside our \ncountry, but we all know that is not the case. We all know there are \npeople in our country today plotting to kill innocent Americans. We \nknow because plots have been uncovered. And we know because that is \nwhat happened on 9/11. There were people inside our country who were \naiding and abetting, living in our country, and planning to kill \ninnocent Americans.\n  So we must have the capability to give protection to a \ntelecommunications company that would cooperate with our Federal law \nenforcement officials to intercept messages between al-Qaida in \nPakistan or Afghanistan or anywhere in the world communicating with a \nterrorist sympathizer in our own country. It is our responsibility to \ndo this for the safety and security of Americans.\n  We must pass this bill. We must pass it in the form that the \nIntelligence Committee did on a bipartisan basis. We must respect the \nwork that has been done by those who have heard hours and hours and \nhours of testimony and seen classified information about the threats to \nour country. We must do our part, along with the President, with the \nMembers of the House of Representatives, and with our law enforcement \nofficials to ensure that no stone is left unturned to uncover a plot \nagainst innocent Americans.\n  If that is not the duty of the U.S. Senate, Mr. President, I ask you, \nwhat is? That is our responsibility. That is why we were elected: to \nprotect our country. I hope this body, of which I am so proud to be a \nMember, will do the right thing and extend this act and give our law \nenforcement the tools they need to do the job we are asking them to do \nto protect America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I join my colleagues, particularly my colleague from Texas and my \ncolleague from Missouri, in supporting this bill and in opposition to \nthe Leahy amendment.\n  My colleague from Texas identified a number of the issues that are in \nthe amendment. I serve on the Judiciary Committee. It is a great \ncommittee. Senator Leahy does an excellent job leading the committee. \nBut on this particular issue it is my belief, as a Judiciary Committee \nmember, that we should recede to what the Intelligence Committee has \nput forward on a bipartisan basis and move forward with this bipartisan \nbill we have rather than going with, essentially, the substitute that \nthe Judiciary Committee came up with, which was put forward on a \npartisan basis.\n  My colleague from Texas noted we have 9 days until this legislation \nexpires. If we go with the Leahy substitute--as much as I respect \nSenator Leahy--the President is going to veto this bill and we are \ngoing to be in a nonfunctional position for a period of time while we \nget things put back together. There is no reason to do that. We have a \nbipartisan bill.\n  The Intelligence Committee bill passed with only two dissenting \nvotes. The Judiciary Committee substitute, in essence, that is being \nput forward--it has been modified and changed, but, in essence, it is \nwhat came forward from the Judiciary Committee--came out on a strictly \npartisan party-line basis.\n  Why wouldn't we go with the bipartisan bill that passed, I believe, \n13 to 2 rather than go with the partisan bill that will be vetoed and \nthen we will just be back here? We are not going to have the votes for \na veto override. We would then go without this needed law provision so \nwe can provide for the security of the country, as well as protect the \ncivil liberties and rights of individuals within America.\n  I want to note in particular on this issue of telecommunications \ncompanies and the information they provide, I think we need to provide \nsome level of immunity for companies to participate and work with the \nFederal Government on information that the Federal Government has \nlegitimately requested.\n  In case people think, ``Well, OK, you are just giving a pass to the \ntelecommunications companies,'' I want to read what the requirements \nare within the Intelligence Committee bill toward the \ntelecommunications companies. The telecommunications carriers face a \nseries of threats and lawsuits presently over their complying with what \nthe Federal Government required. But the Senate Intelligence Committee \nimmunity provisions do not just simply dismiss the cases outright. \nInstead, the bill sets forth a process for the Attorney General to \nsubmit a certification to the court that the telecom carriers either, \none, did not provide the Government the alleged assistance in the first \nplace, or, two, provided assistance pursuant to a valid request, \ndirective, or order indicating that the activity was authorized by the \nPresident and determined to be lawful. The court would then separately \nreview the Attorney General's certification for an abuse of discretion. \nThis multilevel certification and review process will ensure an \nunderlying assessment by the Government and the courts of the genesis \nof the carriers' role, if any.\n  The immunity provisions would not apply to the Government or \nGovernment officials. Cases against the Government regarding the \nalleged programs would continue. And the provisions would apply only to \ncivil and not criminal cases.\n  All in all, I think the Intelligence Committee bill strikes the right \nbalance between intelligence gathering and protections for civil \nliberties.\n  My point in bringing this out is that this is not some blanket waiver \ntoward telecommunications companies. It goes through a multilevel court \nand administrative review procedure that has to pass through both in \norder for the telecommunications company to be able to get this \nimmunity from liability exposure. It is not just the Attorney General; \nit is also the court that is involved with this as well.\n  I would hope my colleagues who have concerns about civil liberties \nwould\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\nlook at that and say: Well, this is going to be reviewed in both \nplaces. This should be sufficient to require them--the \ntelecommunications companies--to participate in this program, and to \ngive them the immunity from liability, if they do this according to the \nlaw as determined by both the Attorney General and as determined by the \ncourt.\n  That seems to me to be a good level and a good balance of our \nintelligence needs, which are significant, and our civil liberties \nguarantees and requirements, which are required--that we guarantee \ncivil liberties for the individual and that I want to see protected. \nBut at the same time I want to see our citizens protected as well. And \nwe have to be able to have some access to information of these \ncommunications--with intelligence, with terrorist organizations, \nindividuals--that may be taking place.\n  All in all, I think the Intelligence Committee has done an excellent \njob of striking that balance between providing for our security needs \nand guaranteeing civil liberties of the individual. It has provided a \nmultilayered process for this immunity to be able to be granted by \ndifferent entities within the Government. It has done so in a balanced \nfashion. It has done so in a bipartisan fashion. I don't know why, for \nthe life of me, we would want to go with something on a partisan basis \nthat is not going to get through the process, when we need the bill now \nand we have a good bill put forward by the Intelligence Committee.\n\n  So as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I would urge us to support \nthe Intelligence Committee and not support the Leahy substitute. As \nmuch respect as I have for the chairman, I do not think that is the way \nfor us to go in bringing this bill forward to closure for the good of \nthe country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will support the Judiciary Committee \nsubstitute to the FISA Amendments Act.\n  As a member of the committee, I wish to commend Chairman Leahy for \nhis leadership. I think we have struck the right balance to give the \nGovernment the power they need to keep us safe but to protect our \nprivacy, which we cherish so much as Americans.\n  I wish to commend the majority leader, Harry Reid, for bringing the \nFISA Amendments Act to the floor as one of our first items of business \nthis year. I wish to thank my colleague and friend from the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller. Though we may disagree on \nsome aspects of this bill, he has been a real leader on an issue of \ngreat complexity.\n  Last August, Congress responded to the administration's request to \napprove foreign surveillance legislation on an expedited basis. \nRemember, we didn't come to this issue because the administration felt \nthey needed to deal us into the picture. We came to this issue because \nthe New York Times finally published an article and told us about this \nwarrantless surveillance that was going on all across America for \nyears, surveillance that was not approved by Congress and was clearly \nnot allowed by law but continued by this administration with impunity \nuntil they were caught with their hands in the cookie jar by the New \nYork Times. Then they came to Congress and said: Well, why don't you \nwrite a law. Can we help you write a law?\n  After 9/11, I can remember Senator Rockefeller, Senator Leahy, \nSenator Specter, and so many others who rose to the occasion and said: \nWe will come together on a bipartisan basis to keep our country safe. \nWe lost 3,000 innocent people. We don't want that to ever happen again. \nWe passed the PATRIOT Act. It wasn't perfect, but it was bipartisan. It \nhad a sunset built into it. We tried to give this Government the tools \nto keep America safe. There wasn't a lot of grandstanding and \nspeechifying. We did our job.\n  Then what happened? The Bush administration decided, in so many \ndifferent aspects of this war on terrorism, to deal Congress and the \nAmerican people out of the picture from that point forward. We heard \nrumors about secret programs, and a handful of Members were briefed, I \nguess; I wasn't one of them. Then, it wasn't until the New York Times \ntold the whole story that we were kind of drawn into this situation, \nwhere we are trying to write a law to approve a course of conduct which \nthe administration was undertaking, at least to some degree, without \neven consulting or conferring with Congress in its constitutional \ncapacity.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee \nhave held a lot of hearings. They have debated how to write this law \nand voted on a lot of amendments. We are now facing the reality that \nthe Protect America Act, which was passed a short time ago, will expire \nnext Friday, February 1.\n  Under any circumstances, it would be difficult for the Senate to pass \na bill of this complexity, reconcile our differences with the House, \nand get it all wrapped up in a week. But the President has made it \nclear he is not going to sign this bill unless it includes an amnesty \nfor telephone companies that cooperated with the administration's \nwarrantless surveillance program. This is a difficult, controversial \nissue many Members feel very strongly about. I am one of them. The \nPresident insists that an amnesty provision for telephone companies be \nincluded, and I think that is going to make it impossible for us to \nmeet the February 1 deadline.\n  Senator Reid, the majority leader, has asked for a 30-day extension \nof the Protect America Act. Let's continue the current law for 30 days. \nLet's try to work out our differences. Let's do this in a responsible \nway. Senator McConnell on the Republican side objected--objected to \ncarrying on the current law for 30 days while we tried to work out our \ndifferences. That objection speaks volumes. Even though he opposed the \nProtect America Act, the majority leader I think was acting in good \nfaith and taking the sensible course of action: Let's try to work these \nthings out and not punish anybody in the process. The current law would \nstay in effect for another 30 days. The Republican Senate leadership, \nMitch McConnell, said no.\n  Well, that is unfortunate. The spokesperson for the White House said \non Tuesday:\n\n       The Protect America Act expires in just 10 days, yet after \n     nearly 6 months of delay, Congress still has not taken the \n     necessary action to keep our Nation safe. For the sake of our \n     national security, Congress must act now.\n\n  So said the White House 2 days ago.\n  I can't follow this logic. On the one hand, the White House claims we \nface grave national security threats if this program expires, and on \nthe other hand, when Senator Reid tries to extend the program for 30 \ndays, the Republican leadership objects. I am sorry, but that doesn't \nfollow.\n  It is worth recalling what brought us to this point. It is difficult \nto believe it has been over 6 years since the terrorists struck our \ncountry on 9/11. I will never forget that terrible day, and most \nAmericans will not either. And we will never forget what happened \nafterwards when Congress came together and tried to respond and make \nour country safe. Sadly, today Osama bin Laden is still on the loose, \nand al-Qaida is still around and may be growing in size.\n  I wish the administration had continued the spirit of bipartisanship \nof the PATRIOT Act. They would have had the full support of Congress \nand the American people. We showed that with the passage of the PATRIOT \nAct. But even as we were debating that important law, the \nadministration was secretly implementing torture and surveillance \npolicies totally inconsistent with the values of our Nation. They \ndidn't ask Congress to approve the warrantless wiretapping of innocent \nAmericans or torture techniques such as waterboarding. Instead, they \nbased their policies on the extreme view of some in the administration \nthat the President, as Commander in Chief, was not bound by the law.\n\n  They discarded the Geneva Conventions after decades of America saying \nthat was a significant underpinning of our relationship with the \ncivilized world. They rejected it. They called it obsolete, the Geneva \nConventions. They opened Guantanamo, which has become an international \nembarrassment. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell has joined so \nmany others in saying: Close this embarrassment. Yet they continue.\n  The Justice Department's infamous torture memo narrowly redefined \ntorture as limited only to pain equivalent to organ failure or death. \nSenator John\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\nMcCain, a man who was a prisoner of war during Vietnam for years and \nyears, spoke out and led a bipartisan fight to establish standards when \nit comes to the treatment of prisoners. I was happy to join him on a \nbill that had more than 90 votes, a strong bipartisan sentiment, a bill \nwhich sadly was watered down by a signing statement from this \nPresident, and I am afraid--though we may never know--I am afraid it \nhas been ignored at many levels by this administration.\n  We still fight the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan, and while we \nare doing it, the administration has launched a misleading propaganda \ncampaign leading perhaps to the greatest foreign policy blunder in \nAmerican history: the war in Iraq.\n  It is worth noting that in a new report issued this week, the Center \nfor Public Integrity concluded:\n\n       President George W. Bush and seven of his administration's \n     top officials, including Vice President Cheney, National \n     Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, and Defense Secretary \n     Rumsfeld, made at least 935 false statements in the two years \n     following September 11, 2001, about the national security \n     threat posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq. An exhaustive \n     examination of the record shows that the statements were part \n     of an orchestrated campaign that effectively galvanized \n     public opinion and in the process led the Nation to war under \n     decidedly false pretenses.\n\n  Is there any more grievous sin in a democracy than for leaders at the \nhighest level to mislead the people of a Democratic Nation into a war \nwith such tragic consequences? Almost 4,000 of our best and bravest--\ninnocent, hard-working, dedicated, and patriotic soldiers--have given \ntheir lives. Countless thousands have been injured because we were \nmisled into a war by this administration.\n  The administration brooked no dissent from their misleading campaign \nfor war or their misguided counterterrorism policies. If anyone raised \nan objection, they were branded as soft on terrorism. Who can forget \nJohn Ashcroft, our former Attorney General, blaming critics of the \nadministration for spreading ``phantoms of lost liberty'' and warning \n``your tactics only aid terrorists''?\n  Time and again, the administration and their allies pressured \nCongress to consider controversial proposals immediately before \nelections. Oh, that is when all the warning bells went off and the \nthreat level colors were changed. We were told there was a threat on \nthe way, and how were we to come to any other conclusion if we didn't \nsee the evidence? What a coincidence that most of those warnings came \nright before an election. It was Karl Rove's playbook and the \nadministration ran that play over and over and over again.\n  In 2002, the administration insisted Congress must vote to authorize \nthe war in Iraq before the election or our security would be at risk. \nWhy? White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card explained that ``from a \nmarketing point of view'' that was the right time to ``introduce new \nproducts.''\n  In 2004, the administration and its Republican allies in Congress \nclaimed it was imperative to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act before the \nelection or our security would be at risk. This despite the fact it \ndidn't expire until December 31, 2005. Congress chose this date for the \nexpress purpose of depoliticizing this debate.\n  For years, the administration insisted the President had unilateral \nauthority to detain enemy combatants and try them in military \ncommissions. Again and again our Supreme Court rejected the \nadministration's arguments. Suddenly, shortly before the 2006 election, \nthe administration changed course, insisting that Congress must vote to \nauthorize military commissions or our security would be at risk. In \nfact, the administration's bill included amnesty for administration \nofficials who had authorized illegal torture techniques. How will \nhistory judge us, granting amnesty to those who engaged in torture?\n  It is more than a year since Congress passed the Military Commissions \nAct. Despite their claims of urgency, the administration has failed to \nbring a single terrorist to trial.\n  In the 2006 election, the American people took a stand and rejected \nthe politics and policies of fear and they rejected this \nadministration's scare tactics. One would hope the administration would \nhave learned a lesson. But in 2008, another election year has arrived \nand, unfortunately, here we go again with an administration continuing \nto stake out divisive positions on terrorism.\n  The administration claimed Attorney General Mukasey would turn a new \npage at the Department of Justice, but he has refused to say even now \nwhether torture techniques known as waterboarding are illegal. During \nhis confirmation hearing, Judge Mukasey promised to review the \nadministration's classified interrogation techniques and assess their \nlegality. It has been 2 months since then and yesterday I wrote to the \nAttorney General to remind him about that commitment. He has had ample \ntime to study this issue.\n  Yesterday, the administration announced they were going to renominate \nSteven Bradbury to be head of the Office of Legal Counsel. This is the \noffice that issues binding legal opinions for the executive branch, \nincluding having issued the infamous torture memo. I have repeatedly \nurged President Bush to withdraw this nomination of Mr. Bradbury \nbecause of his involvement in authorizing the administration's \ncontroversial interrogation and surveillance policies.\n  Now, the administration claims our security is at risk in this \nelection year because Congress is allowing the Protect America Act to \nexpire, even though Senator Reid 2 days ago tried to extend it for a \nmonth, and the Republican leadership objected. Well, no surprise.\n  Yesterday, Vice President Cheney weighed in. He gave a speech \npraising the administration's counterterrorism efforts. He ignored the \nlessons of the last 6 years. He praised Guantanamo Bay, even though his \nPresident has called for closing it, and he praised what he called the \nCIA's ``tougher interrogation program.'' Well, there is a phrase that \nis loaded. He claimed the CIA's interrogation techniques comply with \nour treaty obligations, although the military's top lawyers and others \nsay they violate the Geneva Convention. He said Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, \nthe alleged mastermind of 9/11, had been subjected to the CIA's \n``tougher'' techniques. But the Vice President neglected to mention \nthat 6 years after 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the other 9/11 \nplanners still have not been put to trial. Some experts say it will be \nimpossible to convict him because he was subjected to waterboarding and \nother torture techniques.\n  The Vice President urged Congress to pass FISA legislation. Quoting \nPresident Bush, he said:\n\n       The lessons of September 11 have become dimmer and dimmer \n     in some people's minds.\n\n  Mr. Vice President, the American people haven't forgotten 9/11, and \nwe never will.\n  We also have not forgotten that Osama bin Laden is still free and the \nresources needed to track him down were diverted to a war in Iraq.\n  We have not forgotten that the war in Iraq has cost our Nation \nbillions and, tragically, the lives of almost 4,000.\n  We have not forgotten that instead of working with Congress to \nprosecute the war on terrorism in a bipartisan fashion that respects \nAmerican values, this administration chose to go it alone.\n  We will never, ever forget the blood, sweat, and tears shed by \ncountless American heroes, who fight even as we speak to defend what \nmakes America unique in the world. They fight not to defend any race, \nreligion, or ethnic group; they fight to defend a value--the value upon \nwhich our country was founded. We are a nation of laws, not men--not \nthis President, not any President.\n  In his speech yesterday, the Vice President noted:\n\n       The terrorists waging war against this country don't fight \n     according to the rules of warfare, or international law, or \n     moral standards, or basic humanity.\n\n  That is true, but America is a lot better than the terrorists.\n  Ironically, the Vice President also noted:\n\n       This cause is bigger than the quarrels of party and agendas \n     of politicians.\n\n  Well, that is true as well. I only wish the Vice President and the \nadministration would have heeded his own words and stopped politicizing \nso many national security issues.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the politics of fear and reject the \nscare tactics of this administration. Support the\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\nJudiciary Committee substitute, support the majority leader's request \nfor a 1-month extension in the Protect America Act. We can give the \nGovernment the power it needs to protect us, and we can still uphold \nthe rule of law and protect the precious liberties of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the pending legislation on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct and the so-called Leahy substitute. We are engaged here in the \ncontinuation of a historic debate. Confronted by terrorism on 9/11, the \nresponse has been made to legislate on the PATRIOT Act and the Protect \nAmerica Act, in order to deal effectively with the terrorists. At the \nsame time, there is great concern that there be an appropriate balance. \nWhile it is indisputable that our first duty is to protect America, it \nis also equally fundamental that the constitutional protections have to \nbe kept in mind at all times, and it requires a balance.\n  The beauty of the Constitution is the doctrine of separation of \npowers, so that no one branch has too much. This has been a classic \nconfrontation of the executive asserting its authority under article \nII, and disregarding statutes, such as the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, disregarding the statutory requirement that the \nMembers of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees be informed of \nactivities like electronic surveillance, with the President asserting \nthat authority under article II, saying that it supercedes a statute.\n  Congress has been ineffective on congressional oversight. The courts \nhave filled the void, undertaking very significant action. A key part \nof what we are considering here today is whether there will be \njurisdiction stricken on the pendency of many cases in the Federal \ncourts challenging what the telephone companies have allegedly done or \nwhether there will be continued access to the courts. It is my view, \nfor reasons which I will amplify in the course of this floor statement, \nthat there can be an accommodation to keep the courts open and to allow \nthe electronic surveillance to continue. That can be accomplished by an \namendment Senator Whitehouse and I intend to offer later today or \nperhaps tomorrow--at the first opportunity we have--where the \nlitigation against the telephone companies would proceed, but the U.S. \nGovernment would be substituted as the party defendant.\n  There is no doubt that the telephone companies have been good \ncitizens in whatever it is they have done. Yet there is nothing on the \nrecord as to what really happened. Whatever it is they have done, the \nindicators are that they have been good citizens, although, in the \ncourse of having the Federal Government substituted for the telephone \ncompanies, there will have to be evidence of compliance with the \ngovernmental request, a compliance in good faith.\n  The likelihood of verdicts being rendered, I think, in my legal \njudgment, is very remote. But that doesn't eliminate the requirement \nand the practice of keeping the courts open to make that determination.\n  The Specter-Whitehouse substitution amendment will place the \nGovernment in the shoes of the telephone companies to have the same \ndefenses--no more and no less. For example, the doctrine of \ngovernmental immunity would not be available to the Government. There \nhave been those who have criticized the Specter-Whitehouse amendment, \nwho have ignored the very basic proposition that the suits cannot be \ndismissed because of governmental immunity.\n  On the other hand, by the same token, the state secrets defense will \nbe available. In the lawsuits that are being prosecuted now against the \ntelephone companies, the government has intervened to assert the state \nsecrets doctrine. In fact, the Government has precluded the telephone \ncompanies from saying very much under that doctrine. When the \nGovernment is substituted for the telephone companies, the Government \nwill retain the defense of the state secrets doctrine.\n  Before going into the body of the argument in support of the Specter-\nWhitehouse substitute approach, I wish to comment briefly on the \nsubstitute offered by the Judiciary Committee and by our distinguished \nchairman, Senator Leahy, as the pending business.\n\n  I begin by commending Senator Leahy for his work on the committee. \nFor many years, we have worked together. His work as chairman has been \nexemplary, and there have been improvements that have been made by the \nmodified Leahy substitute. Improvements have been made in that it \nclarifies that when surveillance occurs overseas, the FISA Court's role \nis limited to assessing probable cause and not the means of collection. \nIt has further been improved by extending the length of emergency \nsurveillance to conform to the Intelligence Committee bill's 7 days \ninstead of 3 days. It has been improved by eliminating certain language \ncriticized by the administration--and I think justifiably--as being \noverly broad. But it does retain the basic concept that the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act is the exclusive statutory procedure. So \nyou preempt the Government argument that the Authorization for the Use \nof Military Force preempts and supersedes FISA. That argument has been \nmade by the administration. I think it is a vacuous argument. In any \nevent, this legislation would restate the proposition that the AUMF, or \nlegislation like that, would not supersede FISA.\n  The substitute offered by the distinguished chairman also has a \nchange which allows the continuation of surveillance pending en banc \nreview by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. It also improves \na provision calling for an inspector general review of the terrorist \nsurveillance program.\n  I think, in essence, the substitute provision Senator Leahy has \noffered is an improvement over the prior bill. I regret that I cannot \nsupport it because it leaves out the provision with respect to \nimmunity. While I do not like the provision with respect to immunity \nand think we can improve upon it, as I have said, by the approach of \nsubstituting the Federal Government for the telephone companies, I \nbelieve it is important to keep protecting the telephone companies in \nthe picture and to benefit from the activities which they are \nundertaking. Therefore, I will not be able to support the substitute \noffered by Senator Leahy.\n  It is my hope that the Specter-Whitehouse amendment will be adopted, \nsubstituting the Government. If that fails, then with reluctance I will \nsupport retroactive immunity. To repeat, I think that is not the \npreferable course.\n  In dealing with the fundamental proposition of keeping the courts \nopen, we have had an extended history in the past 2 or 3 years of the \nineffectiveness of dealing with the expanded executive authority with \ncongressional oversight. The PATRIOT Act reauthorization came out of \nthe Judiciary Committee in 2005. I chaired it and was managing the bill \non the floor of the Senate back in mid-December of 2005. I was very \nsurprised that morning to read in the New York Times that the Federal \nGovernment had been undertaking the terrorist surveillance program \nwithout notifying the Intelligence Committees, as required by the \nNational Security Act of 1947, and without notifying the chairman or \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee. That was more than a \nsurprise; it was a shock.\n  We were nearing the end of the consideration of the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization, and all of the indicators were that we would get it \npassed. Some appeared on the floor of the Senate that day to say that \nthey had intended to support the PATRIOT Act reauthorization, but no \nlonger, in light of the fact that there had been the terrorist \nsurveillance program, unknown to Congress, in violation of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act and in violation of the National Security \nAct of 1947.\n  Now, it may be that the President was correct in asserting that he \nhad article II power under the Constitution. If the President did have \npower under article II as Commander in Chief, then such power could not \nbe reduced by legislation. That is a basic constitutional principle. \nBut the determination of that really doesn't reside with the President \nalone.\n  I then introduced legislation to bring the terrorist surveillance \nprogram under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. I will not \ntake the time\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\nnow to go through the lengthy efforts made in that regard. Suffice it \nto say that congressional oversight was not satisfactory. Where there \nhas been a conflict between the Congress and the White House, the tools \navailable to the White House have rendered the congressional oversight \nineffective. When the Judiciary Committee has issued subpoenas, the \nsubpoenas have been ignored by the White House, and the enforcement \nprocedures are insufficient, really nugatory.\n  In the first place, if litigated, they take at least 2 years to have \na judicial decision. The law requires the U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Columbia to bring the action. The U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Columbia is part of the executive branch, and some in the \nDepartment of Justice have said forget about having the action brought. \nIt is theoretically possible to have a contempt citation on the floor \nof the Senate, but it is a practical impossibility. So the efforts at \nenforcement of congressional oversight through the subpoena process has \nbeen to no avail.\n  On the other hand, the courts have been effective. When the issue has \narisen as to the detention at Guantanamo, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States said in Hamdan that the Geneva Conventions applied, and \nin Rasul that habeas corpus was in effect, notwithstanding the fact \nGuantanamo was outside the territorial limit of the United States \nbecause the U.S. Government controlled Guantanamo.\n  Where the Congress has responded with legislation, the issue is now \nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States again in the Boumediene \ncase. The courts have been effective in asserting a balance, in \nasserting constitutional governance. A whole series of court cases have \nshown the effectiveness of the courts. For instance, in the Hepting \ncase that is pending on the terrorist surveillance program, the \ndistrict court rejected a blanket application of the state secrets \ndoctrine. In the Padilla case, the Supreme Court's decision to take up \nthe case led the government to file criminal charges. A New York case \ninvolving the national security letters, Doe v. Gonzalez, found that \ncertain NSL gag orders were unconstitutional in light of the First \nAmendment.\n  The Hamdan case involved a detainee by the U.S. Government. There the \nSupreme Court held that the President does not have a blank check to \ndeal with detainees and that Congress had a role to play.\n  In the Al-Haramain case, the Terrorist Surveillance Program was \nlitigated by an Islamic charity that allegedly had a TSP derived \ntranscript. The case Ninth Circuit decision upheld the government's \nassertion of the state secrets doctrine in that case.\n  I do not go into great length on these judicial decisions but to note \nthat when the court issues a order and insists on witnesses being \npresented on pain of having the case dismissed or on pain of having \nadverse action taken against the party who doesn't follow the court \norder, the courts have been effective. That is why, on a constitutional \nbalance, I think it is very important not to foreclose action by the \ncourts, not to, in effect, strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction of \nthe many pending cases which have been brought against the telephone \ncompanies, and it can be done in a practical way, preserving the \nimportance of law enforcement activities for whatever it is the \ntelephone companies are doing by substituting the Federal Government as \nthe party defendant.\n  I am especially concerned about this issue in the context of what \noccurred back in June of 2006, when the Judiciary Committee, while I \nwas chairing it, was trying to exercise congressional oversight, assert \na constitutional balance with the executive branch, and we were \nunsuccessful for a variety of reasons. Where the Federal Government had \nthe defense of executive privilege, it was impossible to move \neffectively on congressional oversight. But when it became known about \nthe alleged activities of the telephone companies, I sought, as \nchairman, to have subpoenas issued. The Vice President then contacted \nRepublican members of the Judiciary Committee, in effect, behind my \nback--the protocol is to call the chairman first; if not to call the \nchairman first, to call the chairman sometime--leading me to write a \nletter, dated June 7, 2006.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks this letter, dated June 7, 2006.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I did not like sending the Vice President \na lawyer's letter, three pages, single spaced. It starts off--and I \nwill read a short paragraph:\n\n       Dear Mr. Vice President, I am taking this unusual step in \n     writing to you to establish a public record. It is neither \n     pleasant nor easy to raise these issues with the \n     administration of my own party, but I do so because of their \n     importance.\n\n  And then I go into the issues of the expansion of executive authority \nin many directions, the refusal of the executive branch to accommodate \nlegitimate congressional oversight, and complain about the Vice \nPresident's activities in contacting Republican members of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  To have the record complete, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks the Vice \nPresident's response to me, dated June 8, 2006.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with that background, there is a \nparticular sensitivity on my part to having retroactive immunity which \nI think would be an open invitation in the future for the executive \nbranch to continue to ignore the statutes as the executive branch \napparently ignored the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that sets \nthe exclusive way of getting wiretapping, a statement of probable cause \nto a judge, to ignore the National Security Act of 1947 in failing to \nnotify the Intelligence Committees of the House and Senate as mandated, \npositively required, under that statute, to ignore that under the \nassertion of article II power. But the judicial branch of Government is \nthe ultimate arbiter. To move to close the courts is a very serious and \nunwise step, especially when the objective can be retained of the law \nenforcement tools and having the litigation continue, of having the \nU.S. Government as the party defendant. I don't believe there will be \nverdicts against the Government, but if there are, it is part of the \ncost of doing business, part of the cost of fighting terrorism, and it \nought to be borne by the U.S. Government, as opposed to being borne by \nthe telephone companies which presumably have been good citizens, \nsomething they have to establish under the Specter-Whitehouse amendment \nto have the Government step in as a substitute.\n\n  Where we stand at the present time is on the substitute offered by \nthe distinguished chairman. Again, I compliment him for the work he is \ndoing generally and specifically about our Judiciary Committee \nactivities on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I have noted a \nnumber of particulars where I think Senator Leahy's revised substitute \nhas made improvements. To repeat, I regret I cannot support it because \nit leaves out the immunity provision. Again, I do not like the immunity \nprovision and think we can improve it with the Specter-Whitehouse \namendment. But if I am unsuccessful on that, then I will have to, at \nleast speaking for myself, swallow the retroactive immunity provision \non a balance of my own judgment as to the importance of having that \nkind of electronic surveillance, whatever it is, go forward, even with \nthe retroactive immunity.\n  It is my hope, when we consider the ramifications, that we can \ncommand the majority in this body, work through the legislation with \nthe House of Representatives, and find a way to allow the Government to \nhave the advantages of the electronic surveillance but not foreclose \nthe courts by the remedy of having the Government substituted as the \nparty defendant.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2006.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     The Vice President,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: I am taking this unusual step in \n     writing to you to establish a public record. It is neither \n     pleasant\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\n     nor easy to raise these issues with the Administration of my \n     own party, but I do so because of their importance.\n       No one has been more supportive of a strong national \n     defense and tough action against terrorism than I. However, \n     the Administration's continuing position on the NSA \n     electronic surveillance program rejects the historical \n     constitutional practice of judicial approval of warrants \n     before wiretapping and denigrates the constitutional \n     authority and responsibility of the Congress and specifically \n     the Judiciary Committee to conduct oversight on \n     constitutional issues.\n       On March 16, 2006, I introduced legislation to authorize \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to rule on the \n     constitutionality of the Administration's electronic \n     surveillance program. Expert witnesses, including four former \n     judges of the FISA Court, supported the legislation as an \n     effective way to preserve the secrecy of the program and \n     protect civil rights. The FISA Court has an unblemished \n     record for keeping secrets and it has the obvious expertise \n     to rule on the issue. The FISA Court judges and other experts \n     concluded that the legislation satisfied the case-in-\n     controversy requirement and was not a prohibited advisory \n     opinion. Notwithstanding my repeated efforts to get the \n     Administration's position on this legislation, I have been \n     unable to get any response, including a ``no''.\n       The Administration's obligation to provide sufficient \n     information to the Judiciary Committee to allow the Committee \n     to perform its constitutional oversight is not satisfied by \n     the briefings to the Congressional Intelligence Committees. \n     On that subject, it should be noted that this Administration, \n     as well as previous Administrations, has failed to comply \n     with the requirements of the National Security Act of 1947 to \n     keep the House and Senate Intelligence Committees fully \n     informed. That statute has been ignored for decades when \n     Presidents have only informed the so-called ``Gang of \n     Eight,'' the Leaders of both Houses and the Chairmen and \n     Ranking Members on the Intelligence Committees. From my \n     experience as a member of the ``Gang of Eight'' when I \n     chaired the Intelligence Committee of the 104th Congress, \n     even that group gets very little information. It was only in \n     the face of pressure from the Senate Judiciary Committee that \n     the Administration reluctantly informed subcommittees of the \n     House and Senate Intelligence Committees and then agreed to \n     inform the full Intelligence Committee members in order to \n     get General Hayden confirmed.\n       When there were public disclosures about the telephone \n     companies turning over millions of customer records involving \n     allegedly billions of telephone calls, the Judiciary \n     Committee scheduled a hearing of the chief executive officers \n     of the four telephone companies involved. When some of the \n     companies requested subpoenas so they would not be \n     volunteers, we responded that we would honor that request. \n     Later, the companies indicated that if the hearing were \n     closed to the public, they would not need subpoenas.\n       I then sought Committee approval, which is necessary under \n     our rules, to have a closed session to protect the \n     confidentiality of any classified information and scheduled a \n     Judiciary Committee Executive Session for 2:30 P.M. yesterday \n     to get that approval.\n       I was advised yesterday that you had called Republican \n     members of the Judiciary Committee lobbying them to oppose \n     any Judiciary Committee hearing, even a closed one, with the \n     telephone companies. I was further advised that you told \n     those Republican members that the telephone companies had \n     been instructed not to provide any information to the \n     Committee as they were prohibited from disclosing classified \n     information.\n       I was surprised, to say the least, that you sought to \n     influence, really determine, the action of the Committee \n     without calling me first, or at least calling me at some \n     point. This was especially perplexing since we both attended \n     the Republican Senators caucus lunch yesterday and I walked \n     directly in front of you on at least two occasions enroute \n     from the buffet to my table.\n       At the request of Republican Committee members, I scheduled \n     a Republican members meeting at 2:00 P.M. yesterday in \n     advance of the 2:30 P.M. full Committee meeting. At that \n     time, I announced my plan to proceed with the hearing and to \n     invite the chief executive officers of the telephone \n     companies who would not be subject to the embarrassment of \n     being subpoenaed because that was no longer needed. I \n     emphasized my preference to have a closed hearing providing a \n     majority of the Committee agreed.\n       Senator Hatch then urged me to defer action on the \n     telephone companies hearing, saying that he would get \n     Administration support for my bill which he had long \n     supported. In the context of the doubt as to whether there \n     were the votes necessary for a closed hearing or to proceed \n     in any manner as to the telephone companies, I agreed to \n     Senator Hatch's proposal for a brief delay on the telephone \n     companies hearing to give him an opportunity to secure the \n     Administration's approval of the bill which he thought could \n     be done. When I announced this course of action at the full \n     Committee Executive Session, there was a very contentious \n     discussion which is available on the public record.\n       It has been my hope that there could be an accommodation \n     between Congress's Article I authority on oversight and the \n     President's constitutional authority under Article II. There \n     is no doubt that the NSA program violates the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act which sets forth the exclusive \n     procedure for domestic wiretaps which requires the approval \n     of the FISA Court. It may be that the President has inherent \n     authority under Article II to trump that statute but the \n     President does not have a blank check and the determination \n     on whether the President has such Article II power calls for \n     a balancing test which requires knowing what the surveillance \n     program constitutes.\n       If an accommodation cannot be reached with the \n     Administration, the Judiciary Committee will consider \n     confronting the issue with subpoenas and enforcement of that \n     compulsory process if it appears that a majority vote will be \n     forthcoming. The Committee would obviously have a much easier \n     time making our case for enforcement of subpoenas against the \n     telephone companies which do not have the plea of executive \n     privilege. That may ultimately be the course of least \n     resistance.\n       We press this issue in the context of repeated stances by \n     the Administration on expansion of Article II power, \n     frequently at the expense of Congress's Article I authority. \n     There are the Presidential signing statements where the \n     President seeks to cherry-pick which parts of the statute he \n     will follow. There has been the refusal of the Department of \n     Justice to provide the necessary clearances to permit its \n     Office of Professional Responsibility to determine the \n     propriety of the legal advice given by the Department of \n     Justice on the electronic surveillance program. There is the \n     recent Executive Branch search and seizure of Congressman \n     Jefferson's office. There are recent and repeated assertions \n     by the Department of Justice that it has the authority to \n     criminally prosecute newspapers and reporters under highly \n     questionable criminal statutes.\n       All of this is occurring in the context where the \n     Administration is continuing warrantless wiretaps in \n     violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and is \n     preventing the Senate Judiciary Committee from carrying out \n     its constitutional responsibility for Congressional oversight \n     on constitutional issues. I am available to try to work this \n     out with the Administration without the necessity of a \n     constitutional confrontation between Congress and the \n     President.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                           The Vice President,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2006.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your letter of \n     June 7, 2006 concerning the Terrorist Surveillance Program \n     (TSP) the Administration has described. The commitment in \n     your letter to work with the Administration in a non-\n     confrontational manner is most welcome and will, of course, \n     be reciprocated.\n       As recently as Tuesday of this week, I reiterated that, as \n     the Administration has said before, while there is no need \n     for any legislation to carry out the Terrorist Surveillance \n     Program, the Administration will listen to the ideas of \n     legislators about terrorist surveillance legislation and work \n     with them in good faith. Needless to say, that includes you, \n     Senator DeWine and others who have ideas for such \n     legislation. The President ultimately will have to make a \n     decision whether any particular legislation would strengthen \n     the ability of the Government to protect Americans against \n     terrorists, while protecting the rights of Americans, but we \n     believe the Congress and the Administration working together \n     can produce legislation to achieve that objective, if that is \n     the will of the Congress.\n       Having served in the executive branch as chief of staff for \n     one President and as Secretary of Defense for another, having \n     served in the legislative branch as a Representative from \n     Wyoming for a decade, and serving now in a unique position \n     under the Constitution with both executive functions and \n     legislative functions, I fully understand and respect the \n     separate constitutional roles of the Congress and the \n     Presidency. Under our constitutional separation between the \n     legislative powers granted to Congress and the executive \n     power vested exclusively in the Presidency, differences of \n     view may occur from time to time between the branches, but \n     the Government generally functions best when the legislative \n     branch and the executive branch work together. And I believe \n     that both branches agree that they should work together as \n     Congress decides whether and how to pursue further terrorist \n     surveillance legislation.\n       Your letter addressed four basic subjects: (1) the legal \n     basis for the TSP; (2) the Administration position on \n     legislation prepared by you relating to the TSP; (3) \n     provision of information to Congress about the TSP; and (4) \n     communications with Senators on the Judiciary Committee about \n     the TSP.\n       The executive branch has conducted the TSP, from its \n     inception on October 4, 2001 to the present, with great care \n     to operate within the law, with approval as to legality of \n     Presidential authorizations every 45 days or so by senior \n     Government attorneys. The Department of Justice has set forth \n     in detail in writing the constitutional and statutory basis, \n     and related judicial precedents, for warrantless electronic \n     surveillance under the TSP to protect against terrorism, and \n     that information has been made available to your Committe and \n     to the public.\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\n       Your letter indicated that you have repeatedly requested an \n     Administration position on legislation prepared by you \n     relating to the TSP program. If you would like a formal \n     Administration position on draft legislation, you may at any \n     time submit it to the Attorney General, the Director of \n     National Intelligence, or the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget (OMB) for processing, which will \n     produce a formal Administration position. Before you do so, \n     however, it might be more productive for executive branch \n     experts to meet with you, and perhaps Senator DeWine or other \n     Senators as appropriate, to review the various bills that \n     have been introduced and to share the Administration's \n     thoughts on terrorist surveillance legislation. Attorney \n     General Alberto R. Gonzales and Acting Assistant Attorney \n     General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven G. Bradbury \n     are key experts upon whom the executive branch would rely for \n     this purpose. I will ask them to contact you promptly so that \n     the cooperative effort can proceed apace.\n       Since the earliest days of the TSP, the executive branch \n     has ensured that, consistent with the protection of the \n     sensitive intelligence sources, methods and activities \n     involved, appropriate members of Congress were briefed \n     periodically on the program. The executive branch kept \n     principally the chairman and ranking members of the \n     congressional intelligence committees informed and later \n     included the congressional leadership. Today, the full \n     membership of both the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \n     (including four Senators on that Committee who also serve on \n     your Judiciary Committee) are fully briefed on the program. \n     As a matter of inter-branch comity and good executive-\n     legislative practice, and recognizing the vital importance of \n     protecting U.S. intelligence sources, methods and activities, \n     we believe that the country as a whole, and the Senate and \n     the House respectively, are best served by concentrating the \n     congressional handling of intelligence matters within the \n     intelligence committees of the Congress. The internal \n     organization of the two Houses is, of course, a matter for \n     the respective Houses. Recognizing the wisdom of the \n     concentration within the intelligence committees, the rules \n     of the Senate (S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress) and the \n     House (Rule X, cl. 11) creating the intellgence committees \n     mandated that the intelligence committees have cross-over \n     members who also serve on the judiciary, foreign/\n     international relations, armed services, and appropriations \n     committees.\n       Both in performing the legislative functions of the Vice \n     Presidency as President of the Senate and in performing \n     executive functions in support of the President, I have \n     frequent contact with Senators, both at their initiative and \n     mine. We have found such contacts helpful in maintaining good \n     relations between the executive and legislative branches and \n     in advancing legislation that serves the interests of the \n     American people. The respectful and candid exchange of views \n     is something to be encouraged rather than avoided. Indeed, \n     recognizing the importance of such communication, the first \n     step the Administration took, when it learned that you might \n     pursue use of compulsory process in an attempt to force \n     testimony that may involve extremely sensitive classified \n     information, was to have one of the Administration's most \n     senior officials, the Chief of Staff to the President of the \n     United States, contact you to discuss the matter. Thereafter, \n     I spoke with a number of other Members of the Senate \n     Leadership and the Judiciary Committee. These communications \n     are not unusual--they are the Government at work.\n       While there may continue to be areas of disagreement from \n     time to time, we should proceed in a practical way to build \n     on the areas of agreement. I believe that other Senators and \n     you, working with the executive branch, can find the way \n     forward to enactment of legislation that would strengthen the \n     ability of the Government to protect Americans against \n     terrorists while continuing to protect the rights of \n     Americans, if it is the judgment of Congress that such \n     legislation should be enacted. We look forward to working \n     with you, knowing of the good faith on all sides.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dick Cheney.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Connecticut has the \nfloor at this point, but I wonder if he will yield to me for about \nanother minute.\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania. I have enjoyed my work \nwith him. Of course, we have been friends from the time we first met \nwhen we were both young prosecutors.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Younger prosecutors.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I note that my amendment on the Judiciary Committee bill \ndoes not preclude a debate on the question of immunity for the \ntelecommunications carriers. It speaks to what the FISA Court can or \nshould do with this new surveillance authority.\n  If my amendment is voted down, several parts of it will be debated \nagain. Many parts of this amendment will be germane after cloture, and \nwe will be debating those as separate amendments. On the immunity \nissue, there will be an amendment by the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania and the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island on the \nissue of substitution. We will vote either up or down on that \namendment. My amendment is about the oversight of the FISA Court and \nCongress.\n  I understand the position of the Senator from Pennsylvania, but I \nhope he will look carefully at a number of the provisions in this bill. \nIf he is unable to vote for the overall amendment, I hope he will \nsupport many of its provisions in separate amendments.\n  I have taken the time of the Senator from Connecticut who has worked \nwith me and has been one of the leading voices on the important issue \nof oversight for electronic surveillance. We all want to be able to \ncollect as much intelligence as we can against those who would act \nagainst the United States of America, but we have also lived long \nenough to see the danger when there are not enough checks on the \ngovernment. We remember COINTELPRO and other circumstances where the \ngovernment has used the great resources of this country not against \nenemies but against Americans. No voice in this body has been stronger \non that issue than the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank both my colleague from Vermont, the \nchairman of the committee, and the Senator from Pennsylvania as well. I \narrived in this body in January of 1981 with a very engaged Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania as a new Member that day in January of 1981. The \nSenator from Vermont had already been here for a term. They do a \ntremendous job, and their voices are worth listening to on matters \naffecting civil liberties and the rule of law.\n  I spoke at some length last evening and back in December on the issue \nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendments and what I \nconsider to be the most egregious provision in the Intelligence \nCommittee bill: retroactive immunity for the telecommunications \ncompanies that may have helped this administration break the law. I \nhave objected to that immunity on very specific grounds because it \nwould cover an immense alleged violation of trust, privacy, and civil \nliberties.\n  But even more importantly, immunity is wrong because of what it \nrepresents: a fatal weakening of the rule of law that shuts out our \nindependent judiciary and concentrates all the power in the hands of \none branch--the executive branch.\n  We know there has been a pattern of behavior over the past 6 or 7 \nyears. As I said last evening on this floor, had this been the first \ninstance of an administration overreaching, candidly, I would have had \nsome difficulty in objecting to the Intelligence Committee's proposal. \nIf the alleged violation had been limited to a period of a few months, \n6 months, a year even after \n9/11, I might not have objected.\n  But all of us in this Chamber know there has been a 6 or 7 year \npattern of this administration's abuses against the rule of law and \ncivil liberties. And this alleged violation went on not for 6 months or \na year but for 5 years--and it would still be ongoing today had it not \nbeen for a whistleblower in an article in a major publication, which \nrevealed this program's ongoing activities to literally vacuum--and I \nam not exaggerating when I say ``vacuum''--every telephone \nconversation, fax, and e-mail of millions of people in this country. I \nwould object to retroactive immunity not just in this administration \nbut in any administration, Democratic or Republican, that sought \nimmunity to this extent, that sought to concentrate such power in the \nhands of the executive branch.\n\n  The Founders of this great Republic strenuously argued for a process \nthat concentrates power not in one branch but provides a balance of \nthat power, a tension, if you will, between the judicial, the \nlegislative, and the executive branches. To grant such power to one \nbranch, as this bill seeks to do, is a dangerous step. And it would be \nno matter which administration requested it.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as we have seen, was \nwritten precisely to resist that concentration.\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\nWhen we divide power responsibly, terrorist surveillance is not \nweakened; it is strengthened, Mr. President, made more judicious, more \nlegitimate, and less subject to the abuse that saps public trust. I \nfirmly believe any changes to this FISA bill must be in keeping with \nthe original spirit of shared powers and the respect of the rule of \nlaw.\n  If we act wisely, as every previous Congress has for 30 years when \namending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, then I think we can \nensure terrorist surveillance remains inside the law--not an exception \nto it. The Senate should pass a bill doing just that.\n  But the FISA Amendments Act, as it comes to us from the Intelligence \nCommittee, is not that bill, Mr. President. Its safeguards against \nabuse, against the needless targeting of ordinary American citizens, \nare far too weak. The power it concentrates in the hands of the \nexecutive branch is far too expansive. However, the Senate also has \nbefore it a version of a bill that embodies a far greater respect for \nthe rule of law, and that is the proposal before us at this hour, \noffered by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick \nLeahy of Vermont. Both versions of the bill--both versions--authorize \nthe American President to conduct overseas surveillance without \nindividual warrants.\n  Both of these bills allow the President of the United States to \nsubmit his procedures for this new kind of surveillance for the review \nof the FISA Court after those procedures are already in place. But only \none version of the bill balances these significant new powers with real \noversight from the Congress and the courts, and that is the Leahy \namendment.\n  That is the balance we need to strike. That is what every Congress \nhas done for three decades--for three decades--with over 35 different \nchanges to this bill, since its adoption in the late 1970s, passing \nevery Congress almost unanimously, with the approval of Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, balancing the tension between our determination to \nkeep us safe from those who would do us harm with our need to protect \nthe rule of law and the rights of the American people. That is the \ntension, that is the balance that we have struck over the last 30 \nyears.\n  After three decades of maintaining that long-held balance, we are \nabout to deviate from it. The intelligence version of this legislation, \nI am afraid, is a bill of token oversight and very weak protections for \ninnocent Americans. Specifically, the intelligence version of the bill \nfails on five specific counts.\n  First, its safeguards against the targeting of Americans--its \nminimization procedures--are insufficient. The Intelligence Committee \nbill significantly expands the President's surveillance power while \nleaving the checks on that power unchanged. The intelligence version \nprovides practically no deterrent against excessive domestic spying and \nno consequences if the court finds that the President's--any \nPresident's--minimization procedures are lacking. If his targeting \nprocedures are found lacking, the President hardly has to worry. They \nadministration can keep and share all the information it has obtained, \nand it can continue its actions all the way through the judicial review \nprocess, which can take months, if not years.\n  It should be clear to all of us that real oversight includes the \npower of enforcement. The Intelligence Committee's bill offers us the \nsemblance of judicial oversight--but not the real thing. Imagine, if \nyou will, a judge convicting a bank robber and then letting him keep \nthe loot he stole, as long as he promises to never, ever, ever do it \nagain. That might as well be the Intelligence version of the bill.\n  In fact, the Intelligence version would allow the President to \nimmediately target anyone on a whim. Wiretapping could start even \nbefore the court has approved it. In the Intelligence Committee bill, \noversight is exactly where the President likes it--after the fact. \nDon't get me wrong, Mr. President, when a President--any President--\nneeds immediate emergency authority to begin wiretapping, that \nPresident should have it. All of us, I think, agree with that. We find \nthat obvious.\n  The question is what to do in those cases that aren't emergencies--\nbecause not every case is an emergency. In those cases, I believe there \nis no reason that the court shouldn't give advice and approval \nbeforehand. President Bush disagrees. He believes in a permanent state \nof emergency.\n  Second, the Intelligence Committee bill fails to protect American \ncitizens from reverse targeting--the practice of targeting a foreign \nperson on false pretenses without a warrant in order to collect the \ninformation on an American on the other end of the conversation. \nReverse targeting, according to Admiral McConnell, the Director of \nNational Intelligence, says:\n\n       It is not legal. It would be a breach of the fourth \n     amendment.\n\n  That is according to the Director of National Intelligence. He is \nabsolutely correct, of course, which is why it is so vital the FISA \nbill before us contain strong enforceable protections against reverse \ntargeting. Unfortunately, the Intelligence Committee version doesn't \nhave one.\n  Third, the intelligence version, by purporting to end warrantless \nwiretapping of Americans, might actually allow it to continue unabated. \nThat is because the bill lacks strong exclusivity language--language \nstating that FISA is the only controlling law for foreign intelligence \nsurveillance. With that provision in place, surveillance has a place \ninside the rule of law. Without it, there is no such guarantee, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Who knows what specious rationale this or any administration might \ncook up for lawless spying? The last time, as we have seen, Alberto \nGonzalez--laughably, I might add, if it weren't so tragic--tried to \nfind grounds for warrantless wiretapping in the authorization of force \nagainst Afghanistan. Those are the legal lengths to which this \nadministration has proved willing and able to go to in order to achieve \nits goals.\n\n  As I mentioned last evening, Senator Daschle, the former majority \nleader, who was deeply involved in the negotiations of the \nauthorization language to use force in Afghanistan, wrote an op-ed \npiece absolutely debunking the argument that any part of that \nnegotiation included granting the administration the power to conduct \nwarrantless wiretaps. He was offended by the suggestion that somehow we \nin this Congress, on a vote of 98 to nothing, gave the administration \nthe power to conduct warrantless wiretappings. He was directly involved \nin those negotiations. It never, ever, ever came up. It is offensive \nthat Alberto Gonzalez argued that Afghanistan justified warrantless \nwiretapping is offensive--but it is a good example, Mr. President, of \nwhat can happen if you don't have exclusivity.\n  FISA is the vehicle, and has been for 30 years, by which we allow for \nwarrants to be granted to conduct surveillance when America is \nthreatened. What is next without strong exclusivity language? The \nIntelligence Committee version of the bill would leave that question \nhanging over our heads.\n  Fourth, Mr. President, unlike the Leahy amendment, the Intelligence \nCommittee version of the bill lacks strong protections against what is \ncalled ``bulk collection''--the warrantless collection of all overseas \ncommunications, a massive dragnet with the potential to sweep up \nthousands or even millions of Americans, without cause. Today, bulk \ncollection is not feasible. But Admiral McConnell said:\n\n       It would be authorized, if it were physically possible to \n     do so.\n\n  Before any administration has that chance, I think it is important \nthat we should clearly and expressly prohibit such an unprecedented \nviolation of privacy. The intelligence version fails to do so.\n  In fact, I would suggest that the previous collection of data by the \ntelecom industry, in fact, nearly approached such bulk collection: as \nwe now know, millions and millions and millions of faxes, of e-mails, \nand of phone conversations were swept up over 5 years, without any \nwarrants whatsoever.\n  Now, the legality of that is an unanswered question--but we are never \ngoing to know the answer if we grant retroactive immunity. We would \nshut the door forever on determining whether it was legal.\n  Even though global bulk collection is not yet feasible, we have \nalready seen a vacuum operation sweep up millions of conversations, e-\nmails, and faxes. So\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\nwe know the will for true bulk collection is there, and the Director of \nNational Intelligence has admitted as much. So failure of the \nIntelligence version of the bill to prohibit bulk collection ought to \ncause us all some concern.\n  Fifth, and finally, Mr. President, the intelligence committee version \nof the bill stays in effect until 2013, through the next Presidential \nterm and into the next one after that. Compare that to the 4-year \nsunset in the Leahy amendment. I believe that, when making such a \ndramatic change in the Nation's terrorist surveillance regime, we ought \nto err on the side of some caution. Once the new regime has been \ntested, once its effectiveness against terrorism and its compromises of \nprivacy have been weighed, we deserve to have this debate again. \nHopefully we will all be more informed when that happens; I trust that \nit will be a much less speculative debate.\n  And there is another advantage to coming back to this bill with \ngreater frequency. We are learning painfully that the abilities those \nwho would do us harm are growing more sophisticated year by year. We \nneed to be flexible, as well. To not allow for a review of this \nlegislation until 2013, except under extraordinary circumstances, locks \nus in place for far too long. We ought to come back and review whether \nwe are facing additional problems that didn't exist even a year ago, \ngiven the warp speed with technology changes globally. We shouldn't \nwait 6 years. Given the ever-changing terrorist threats we face, taking \nanother look at this bill sooner is in our security interest.\n  Mr. President, I said last evening that I admire the work of Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Bond, and the members of the Intelligence \nCommittee. And I know people say, ``Oh, you are just being collegial.'' \nBut this is not easy work. I know they struggle with these issues, and \nI don't want my criticism to be interpreted to suggest that I don't \nrespect the work they do. I clearly respect it.\n  But this is such a critical issue, and maybe I have more of a passion \nabout it, because it is so important. Once you begin to accept expanded \nexecutive power, it is so easy to move to the next step and the next \nstep--and we have to be so careful about that.\n  We are mere custodians, those of us who serve here, over our rights \nand the rule of law. We are relying on the work of those who have \npreceded us. And I think all of us admire immensely what various \nCongresses have done over three decades since the adoption of the \noriginal FISA bill, which was done in a bipartisan, almost unanimous \nfashion. But the issue we face today is historic. It is not something \nthat began just after 9/11. The tension between keeping us safe and \nprotecting our rights has been an ongoing debate for more than two \ncenturies, and it will be a continuous debate.\n  It will be a contentious debate. But striking that balance is what is \nso important. And the temptation to err on one side of that balance is \nso strong. James Madison warned more than two centuries ago that our \nwillingness to give up domestic rights is always contingent upon the \nfear of what happens abroad. So while all of us here want to make sure \nwe are doing everything to keep our country secure, we do not want to \nbe willing to give up the basic rule of law here, and denigrate the \nimportance of those rights.\n  It is very dangerous to confront the people of this country with a \nchoice between rights and security. It is a false choice. In truth, we \nbecome more secure when we protect our rights. We have learned that \nover the years. And if we forget that lesson now, I believe we will \ncome to deeply, deeply regret it.\n  This bill, the Intelligence Committee bill, reduces court oversight \nmerely to the point of symbolism. It allows the targeting of Americans \non false pretenses. It opens us up to new, twisted rationales for \nwarrantless wiretapping, the very thing it ought to prevent. It would \nallow bulk collection as soon as this administration--or any \nadministration--has the wherewithal to do it.\n  Mr. President, we are letting this debate become one of Republicans \nversus Democrats, liberals versus conservatives. But the Constitution \nis not a partisan document. It is a document which all of us embrace. \nIt deeply troubles me that we have allowed things to come to this point \ninstead of insisting that we can find the wisdom and the ability to \nkeep America safe without compromising the rule of law.\n  In sum, the Intelligence version is entirely too trusting a bill, and \nnot just for this administration. People say: If there were a Democrat \nsitting in the White House, you would not be saying this. Yes, I would. \nIf any Democrat tried to do this, I would speak just as passionately, \nmaybe more so, offended that someone I thought I shared some values \nwith was suggesting a similar course of action.\n  My concern with what we are doing is not just about the next year; it \nis for the years and years and years to come, for the precedent we are \nsetting, not only for this administration, but for all those that will \nfollow.\n  So my passion about this is not rooted in partisanship; it is rooted \nin my deep conviction that abandoning or undermining the rule of law--\nwe don't have the right to do that. We are temporary custodians of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  So the Intelligence version is too trusting, as I said. With its \nimmunity provisions, with its wiretapping provisions, it simply \nresponds to the executive branch's offer of ``trust me'' with an all-\ntoo-eager to say ``yes.''\n  I leave my colleagues with a simple question: Has that trust been \nearned, not just by this President, by any President? What would our \nFounders think? Why did they craft a system which insisted that there \nbe a judicial, a legislative, and an executive branch? If we walk away \nfrom that balance, then we walk away from the very trust we were \nendowed with by those who elected us to this office and the oath we \ntook here.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the substitute being offered by \nSenator Leahy.\n  Again, I commend Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond and members of \nthat committee who worked hard at it. There are a lot of good ideas, \noutside of immunity, in the Intelligence Committee version of the bill. \nI think we can improve it; and the Leahy amendment does that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, while I have great admiration and \nrespect for my friend from Connecticut, this is an issue upon which we \nsimply disagree.\n  I rise today in opposition to the Judiciary substitute amendment to \nS. 2248, the FISA Amendments Act.\n  This legislation would strike, in its entirety, the bipartisan bill \nvoted out of the Intelligence Committee by a 13-to-2 vote and replace \nit with a bill full of limitations on our foreign intelligence \ncollection.\n  There are serious differences between the Judiciary Committee's \nsubstitute and the bill voted out of the Intelligence Committee. The \nIntelligence Committee bill is the result of a long drafting process \nwhere the committee reviewed the classified mechanisms under which FISA \noperates. As a result, the bill reflects the minimum tools our \nintelligence community needs to improve our foreign intelligence \ncollection. Some of the provisions of the Judiciary bill seem to ignore \nthe needs of our intelligence analysts and instead seek to hamper our \nability to protect the Nation from hostile foreign intelligence \ncollection and terrorists.\n  I believe the Judiciary Committee bill is seriously flawed, and I \nwould like to highlight just two examples of how seriously flawed this \namendment is.\n  First, it seeks to impose an unreasonable new restriction on the use \nof foreign intelligence information.\n  If the FISA Court finds the minimization procedure is deficient in \nsome manner, information, including information not concerning U.S. \npersons obtained or derived from those acts, may not be kept. Our \nintelligence community analysts have used and complied with \nminimization standards for over 25 years. They know how to do it. They \nare familiar with when and how to minimize information in order to \nprotect the identity of U.S. persons.\n\n  It is important to point out that minimization is used when \ndisseminating important foreign intelligence. In other words, an \nintelligence analyst\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\nhas determined that the information contains relevant foreign \nintelligence. Under the Judiciary Committee provision, if the FISA \nCourt determines that the general proscriptions on how to minimize need \nimprovement, the intelligence community may not use any previously \ngathered intelligence. This allows the FISA Court to second-guess \ntrained analysts. The FISA Court's own opinion from December 11, 2007, \nrecognizes that the executive branch has the expertise in national \nsecurity matters, that the court should not make judgments as to which \nparticular surveillances should be conducted.\n  Second, the Judiciary Committee amendment contains no provision for \nretroactive or prospective immunity for communications providers.\n  After careful review of the President's terrorist surveillance \nprogram, a bipartisan majority of the Intelligence Committee believed \nthat providing our telecommunications service providers immunity for \ntheir assistance to the Government is absolutely necessary.\n  I think without question this is such a critical part of the bill \nthat came out of the Intelligence Committee for all of the right \nreasons. The Intelligence Committee heard testimony and reviewed the \nPresident's specific intelligence program. The President granted the \ncommittee members and staff access to the legal memoranda and other \ndocuments related to this program. As stated in the committee report \naccompanying this legislation, the committee determined:\n\n       That electronic communication service providers acted on a \n     good faith belief that the President's program, and their \n     assistance, was lawful.\n       The committee reviewed correspondence sent to the \n     electronic communication service providers stating that the \n     activities requested were authorized by the President and \n     determined by the Attorney General to be lawful, with the \n     exception of one letter covering a period of less than 60 \n     days, in which the Counsel to the President certified the \n     program's lawfulness.\n\n  The statement continues:\n\n       The committee concluded that granting liability relief to \n     the telecommunications providers was not only warranted, but \n     required to maintain the regular assistance our intelligence \n     and law enforcement professionals seek from them. Although I \n     believe that the President's program was lawful and \n     necessary, this bill makes no such determination. This is not \n     a review or commentary on the President's program.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support the determinations of the \nIntelligence Committee, which is charged with regularly reviewing the \nintelligence activities of the United States and all of the agencies \nincluded within the intelligence community. Providing our \ntelecommunications carriers with liability relief is the necessary and \nresponsible action for Congress to take.\n  The Government often needs assistance from the private sector in \norder to protect our national security, and in return, they should be \nable to rely on the Government's assurances that the assistance they \nprovide is lawful and necessary for our national security. As a result \nof this assistance, America's telecommunications carriers should not be \nsubject to costly legal battles.\n  This is not the last time that the private sector is going to be \nasked to come to the aid of the American people in protecting us on a \nmatter of national security. There will be other days when the private \nsector will be called upon by the Government to act in concert and in \npartnership to protect the American public. If we do not grant immunity \nin this particular instance, should we expect the private sector to be \ncooperative with us in the future? I think the answer to that is pretty \nclear.\n  That was the gist of the bipartisan discussion and agreement within \nthe Intelligence Committee about the main reason why, if no other \nreason, we should seriously look and give the immunity to the \ntelecommunications providers that may have been involved in this \nsituation.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Judiciary Committee substitute \namendment, which contains numerous problematic provisions which will \nhamper and try to micromanage our intelligence collection, and support \nthe carefully crafted bipartisan bill passed out of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent the time be equally divided on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will be speaking more at about 1:30 on the \nJudiciary Committee substitute, but I thought I would clarify a few \nconcerns that have been raised that I have heard. I know there are a \nnumber of Members coming down, and I do not want to hold them up, but I \ndo want to point out that my good friend, the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, was concerned that the President's terrorist surveillance \nprogram was not briefed to Members of Congress. It is my understanding \nit was briefed to the leadership of the Intelligence Committee and the \nleadership on both sides. Personally, I would have preferred that more \nMembers be briefed, but it is my understanding that when these leaders \nwere briefed, it was their view that in light of the urgency and the \nneed and the difficulties of explaining what we were going to do prior \nto--which could delay the implementation of the terrorist surveillance \nprogram, that it was a consensus of these meetings that the President \nshould not bring a measure before Congress modifying FISA to take \naccount of the new means of electronic surveillance and electronic \ncommunication.\n  Secondly, my good friend, the senior Senator from Connecticut, in his \ncomments urged that we ban reverse targeting. I would call his \nattention to section 703(b), subparagraph 2 and subparagraph 3, which \ndo explicitly ban targeting of overseas terrorist activities in order \nto gain information on U.S. persons. That is explicitly banned.\n  The Senator from Connecticut also spoke warmly of the exclusive test \nthat existed in FISA from the period from 1978 forward.\n  We have included in the bill the exclusive means test that worked for \nsome 30 years. That is in section 102. Without getting into classified \ninformation, we can say that this bill does not allow our intelligence \ncommunity to listen in on conversations or read mail unless those \npersons are afforded the protection of the Intelligence Committee bill. \nTo clarify that, the collection is carefully limited and overseen. \nThere have been comments that the collection efforts by the NSA are not \nsubject to oversight. I can only suggest to the people who have raised \nthose concerns to ask members of the Intelligence Committee how much \ntime we have spent looking into electronic surveillance. I can assure \nthem that we enjoy looking into all these issues. We do so on a \ncontinuing basis. We have done so extensively over the last 9 months. I \nam sure they can count on us continuing to exercise that oversight. The \nIntelligence Committee has been set up specifically to review all of \nthe intelligence collection methods of our intelligence community. They \ndo a great job. We look over their shoulders and suggest ways they can \nimprove the collection and analysis and also take steps to ensure they \nstay carefully within the boundaries of the Constitution and the laws \nthat apply to them. With respect to collection methods such as 12333, \nwe also oversee that as well.\n  So the people of America can be assured that the laws, the \nConstitution, and the regulations are being complied with. That is our \njob in the Intelligence Committee. We intend to continue to do so. I \ndidn't want to leave without clarification of the suggestion that some \nof these matters were not attended to.\n  I see my colleague from Utah. I thank him for his great work. He is \nnot only a valuable member of the Intelligence Committee but his work \non the Judiciary Committee reflects his keen understanding and devotion \nto ensuring that we do a proper job of oversight and legislation when \nit comes to these very important collection methods.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my dear colleague from Missouri for \nthe leadership he has provided, along with Senator Rockefeller, on the \nIntelligence Committee and throughout this process. We ought to be \nlistening to him. This is a very important bill,\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\none of the most important in the history of the country, and we have to \nget it right. I congratulate him and thank him for the hard work he has \ndone, and also Senator Rockefeller who, as chairman of the committee, \nled us in this matter.\n  As the only Republican on both the Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees, I have been very involved in the process of developing the \nFISA modernization bill with a unique understanding of the journey this \nbill has taken through the Senate. I continue to express my full \nsupport for the bill as passed out of the Intelligence Committee and \nencourage my colleagues to reject the risky and problematic Judiciary \nsubstitute amendment.\n  The seeds of discontent with the Judiciary substitute were sown from \nthe very beginning of that committee's consideration. Late in the \nafternoon the day before the markup, a Judiciary substitute amendment \nwas circulated that replaced the entire first title of the Intelligence \nCommittee-reported bill. This substitute included 10 Democratic \namendments and no Republican amendments. It was eventually adopted on a \nparty-line vote. Unfortunately, the careful bipartisan balance crafted \nby the Intelligence Committee was irrevocably altered and effectively \nnullified by partisan maneuvering. The Judiciary Committee was not able \nto coalesce to advance a compromise bill, as evidenced by the \nconsistent 10-to-9 party-line votes on amendments and final passage. \nThese votes typified the approach the Judiciary Committee undertook.\n  We know that this bill, like all national security legislation, needs \nbipartisan support to pass. The Judiciary substitute simply doesn't \nhave it. I remind my colleagues that on November 14, 2007, Attorney \nGeneral Mukasey and Director of National Intelligence McConnell sent a \nletter to the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee \nstating:\n\n       If the Judiciary substitute is part of a bill that is \n     presented to the President, we and the President's other \n     senior advisors will recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  In addition, on December 17, 2007, a statement of administration \npolicy was distributed for S. 2248 which stated:\n\n       If the Judiciary Committee substitute amendment is part of \n     a bill that is presented to the President, the Director of \n     National Intelligence, the Attorney General, and the \n     President's other senior advisors will recommend that he veto \n     the bill.\n\n  Both of these letters illustrate extensive problems with provisions \nincluded in the Judiciary substitute and in very specific terms. These \nwarnings from the very people in the Government who are asked to \nprotect us from terrorist threats should be heeded. We disregard these \nwarnings at our own peril.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\ns. 2248--to amend the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978, to \n  modernize and streamline the provisions of that act, and for other \n                                purposes\n\n                (Sen. Rockefeller (D-WV), Dec. 17, 2007)\n\n       Protection of the American people and American interests at \n     home and abroad requires access to timely, accurate, and \n     insightful intelligence on the capabilities, intentions, and \n     activities of foreign powers, including terrorists. The \n     Protect America Act of 2007 (PAA), which amended the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) this past \n     August, has greatly improved the Intelligence Community's \n     ability to protect the Nation from terrorist attacks and \n     other national security threats. The PAA has allowed us to \n     close intelligence gaps, and it has enabled our intelligence \n     professionals to collect foreign intelligence information \n     from targets overseas more efficiently and effectively. The \n     Intelligence Community has implemented the PAA under a robust \n     oversight regime that has protected the civil liberties and \n     privacy rights of Americans. Unfortunately, the benefits \n     conferred by the PAA are only temporary because the act \n     sunsets on February 1, 2008.\n       The Director of National Intelligence has frequently \n     discussed what the Intelligence Community needs in permanent \n     FISA legislation, including two key principles. First, \n     judicial authorization should not be required to gather \n     foreign intelligence from targets located in foreign \n     countries. Second, the law must provide liability protection \n     for the private sector.\n       The Senate is considering two bills to extend the core \n     authorities provided by the PAA and modernize FISA. In \n     October, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) \n     passed a consensus, bipartisan bill (S. 2248) that would \n     establish a sound foundation for our Intelligence Community's \n     efforts to target terrorists and other foreign intelligence \n     targets located overseas. Although the bill is not perfect \n     and its flaws must be addressed, it nevertheless represents a \n     bipartisan compromise that will ensure that the Intelligence \n     Community retains the authorities it needs to protect the \n     Nation. Indeed, the SSCI bill is an improvement over the PAA \n     in one essential way--it would provide retroactive liability \n     protection to electronic communication service providers that \n     are alleged to have assisted the Government with intelligence \n     activities in the aftermath of September 11th.\n       In sharp contrast to the SSCI's bipartisan approach to \n     modernizing FISA, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported an \n     amendment to the SSCI bill that would have devastating \n     consequences to the Intelligence Community's ability to \n     detect and prevent terrorist attacks and to protect the \n     Nation from other national security threats. The Judiciary \n     Committee proposal would degrade our foreign intelligence \n     collection capabilities. The Judiciary Committee's amendment \n     would impose unacceptable and potentially crippling burdens \n     on the collection of foreign intelligence information by \n     expanding FISA to restrict facets of foreign intelligence \n     collection never intended to be covered under the statute. \n     Furthermore, the Judiciary Committee amendment altogether \n     fails to address the critical issue of liability \n     protection. Accordingly. if the Judiciary Committee's \n     substitute amendment is part of a bill that is presented \n     to the President, the Director of National Intelligence, \n     the Attorney General, and the President's other senior \n     advisors will recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n\n            The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Bill\n\n       Building on the authorities and oversight protections \n     included in the PAA, the SSCI drafted S. 2248 to provide a \n     sound legal framework for essential foreign intelligence \n     collection in a manner consistent with the Fourth Amendment. \n     As in the PAA, S. 2248 permits the targeting of foreign \n     terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets outside the \n     United States based upon the approval of the Director of \n     National Intelligence and the Attorney General.\n       The SSCI drafted its bill in extensive coordination with \n     Intelligence Community and national security professionals--\n     those who are most familiar with the needs of the \n     Intelligence Community and the complexities of our \n     intelligence laws. The SSCI also heard testimony from privacy \n     experts in order to craft a balanced approach. As a result, \n     the SSCI bill recognizes the importance of clarity in laws \n     governing intelligence operations. Although the \n     Administration would strongly prefer that the provisions of \n     the PAA be made permanent without modification, the \n     Administration engaged in extensive consultation in the \n     interest of achieving permanent legislation in a bipartisan \n     manner.\n       The SSCI bill is not perfect, however. Indeed, certain \n     provisions represent a major modification of the PAA and will \n     create additional burdens for the Intelligence Community, \n     including by dramatically expanding the role of the FISA \n     Court in reviewing foreign intelligence operations targeted \n     at persons located outside the United States, a role never \n     envisioned when Congress created the FISA court.\n       In particular, the SSCI bill contains two provisions that \n     must be modified in order to avoid significant negative \n     impacts on intelligence operations. Both of these provisions \n     are also included in the Judiciary Committee substitute, \n     detailed further below.\n       First, as part of the debate over FISA modernization, \n     concerns have been raised regarding acquiring information \n     from U.S. persons outside the United States. Accordingly, the \n     SSCI bill provides for FISA Court approval of surveillance of \n     U.S. persons abroad. The Administration opposes this \n     provision. Under executive orders in place since before the \n     enactment of FISA in 1978, Attorney General approval is \n     required before foreign intelligence surveillance and \n     searches may be conducted against a U.S. person abroad under \n     circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation \n     of privacy. More specifically, section 2.5 of Executive Order \n     12333 requires that the Attorney General find probable cause \n     that the U.S. person target is a foreign power or an agent of \n     a foreign power. S. 2248 dramatically increases the role of \n     the FISA Court by requiring court approval of this probable \n     cause determination before an intelligence operation may be \n     conducted beyond the borders of the United States. This \n     provision imposes burdens on foreign intelligence collection \n     abroad that frequently do not exist even with respect to \n     searches and surveillance abroad for law enforcement \n     purposes. Were the Administration to consider accepting FISA \n     Court approval for foreign intelligence searches and \n     surveillance of U.S. persons overseas, technical corrections \n     would be necessary. The Administration appreciates the \n     efforts that have been made by Congress to address these \n     issues, but notes that while it may be willing to accept \n     that the FISA Court, rather than the Attorney General, \n     must make the required findings, limitations on the scope \n     of the collection currently allowed are unacceptable.\n       Second, the Senate Intelligence Committee bill contains a \n     requirement that intelligence analysts count ``the number of \n     persons located in the United States whose communications \n     were reviewed.'' This provision would likely be impossible to \n     implement. It\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\n     places potentially insurmountable burdens on intelligence \n     professionals without meaningfully protecting the privacy of \n     Americans, and takes scarce analytic resources away from \n     protecting our country. The Intelligence Community has \n     provided Congress with a detailed classified explanation of \n     this problem.\n       Although the Administration believes that the PAA achieved \n     foreign intelligence objectives with reasonable and robust \n     oversight protections, S. 2248, as drafted by the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee, provides a workable alternative and \n     improves on the PAA in one critical respect by providing \n     retroactive liability protection. The Senate Intelligence \n     Committee bill would achieve an effective legislative result \n     by returning FISA to its appropriate focus on the protection \n     of privacy interests of persons inside the United States, \n     while retaining our improved capability under PAA to collect \n     timely foreign intelligence information needed to protect the \n     Nation.\n\n\n                The Senate Judiciary Committee Proposal\n\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee amendment contains a number \n     of provisions that would have a devastating impact on our \n     foreign intelligence operations.\n       Among the provisions of greatest concern are:\n       An Overbroad Exclusive Means Provision That Threatens \n     Worldwide Foreign Intelligence Operations. Consistent with \n     current law, the exclusive means provision in the SSCI's bill \n     addresses only ``electronic surveillance'' and ``the \n     interception of domestic wire, oral, and electronic \n     communications.'' But the exclusive means provision in the \n     Judiciary Committee substitute goes much further and would \n     dramatically expand the scope of activities covered by that \n     provision. The Judiciary Committee substitute makes FISA the \n     exclusive means for acquiring ``communications information'' \n     for foreign intelligence purposes. The term ``communications \n     information'' is not defined and potentially covers a vast \n     array of information--and effectively bars the acquisition of \n     much of this information that is currently authorized under \n     other statues such as the National Security Act of 1947, as \n     amended. It is unprecedented to require specific statutory \n     authorization for every activity undertaken worldwide by the \n     Intelligence Community. In addition, the exclusivity \n     provision in the Judiciary Committee substitute ignores \n     FISA's complexity and its interrelationship with other \n     federal laws and, as a result, could operate to preclude the \n     Intelligence Community from using current tools and \n     authorities, or preclude Congress from acting quickly to give \n     the Intelligence Community the tools it may need in the \n     aftermath of a terrorist attack in the United States or in \n     response to a grave threat to the national security. In \n     short, the Judiciary Committee's exclusive means provision \n     would radically reshape the intelligence collection framework \n     and is unacceptable.\n       Limits on Foreign Intelligence Collection. The Judiciary \n     Committee substitute would require the Attorney General and \n     the Director of National Intelligence to certify for certain \n     acquisitions that they are ``limited to communications to \n     which at least one party is a specific individual target who \n     is reasonably believed to be located outside the United \n     States.'' This provision is unacceptable because it could \n     hamper U.S. intelligence operations that are currently \n     authorized to be conducted overseas and that could be \n     conducted more effectively from the United States without \n     harming U.S. privacy rights.\n       Significant Purpose Requirement. The Judiciary Committee \n     substitute would require a FISA court order if a \n     ``significant purpose'' of an acquisition targeting a person \n     abroad is to acquire the communications of a specific person \n     reasonably believed to be in the United States. If the \n     concern driving this proposal is so-called ``reverse \n     targeting''--circumstances in which the Government would \n     conduct surveillance of a person overseas when the \n     Government's actual target is a person in the United States \n     with whom the person overseas is communicating--that \n     situation is already addressed in FISA today: If the person \n     in the United States is the target, a significant purpose of \n     the acquisition must be to collect foreign intelligence \n     information, and an order from the FISA court is required. \n     Indeed, the SSCI bill codifies this longstanding Executive \n     Branch interpretation of FISA. The Judiciary Committee \n     substitute would place an unnecessary and debilitating burden \n     on our Intelligence Community's ability to conduct \n     surveillance without enhancing the protection of the privacy \n     of Americans.\n       Part of the value of the PAA, and any subsequent \n     legislation, is to enable the Intelligence Community to \n     collect expeditiously the communications of terrorists in \n     foreign countries who may contact an associate in the United \n     States. The Intelligence Community was heavily criticized by \n     numerous reviews after September 11, including by the \n     Congressional Joint Inquiry into September 11, regarding its \n     insufficient attention to detecting communications indicating \n     homeland attack plotting. To quote the Congressional Joint \n     Inquiry:\n       ``The Joint Inquiry has learned that one of the future \n     hijackers communicated with a known terrorist facility in the \n     Middle East while he was living in the United States. The \n     Intelligence Community did not identify the domestic origin \n     of those communications prior to September 11, 2001 so that \n     additional FBI investigative efforts could be coordinated. \n     Despite this country's substantial advantages, there was \n     insufficient focus on what many would have thought was among \n     the most critically important kinds of terrorist-related \n     communications, at least in terms of protecting the \n     Homeland.''\n       (S. Rept. No. 107-351, H. Rept. No. 107-792 at 36.) To be \n     clear, a ``significant purpose'' of Intelligence Community \n     activities is to detect communications that may provide \n     warning of homeland attacks and that may include \n     communication between a terrorist overseas who places a call \n     to associates in the United States. A provision that bars the \n     Intelligence Community from collecting these communications \n     is unacceptable, as Congress has stated previously.\n       Liability Protection. In contrast to the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee bill, the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     substitute would not protect electronic communication service \n     providers who are alleged to have assisted the Government \n     with communications intelligence activities in the aftermath \n     of September 11th from potentially debilitating lawsuits. \n     Providing liability protection to these companies is a just \n     result. In its Conference Report, the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee ``concluded that the providers . . . had a good \n     faith basis for responding to the requests for assistance \n     they received.'' The Committee further recognized that \n     ``the Intelligence Community cannot obtain the \n     intelligence it needs without assistance from these \n     companies.'' Companies in the future may be less willing \n     to assist the Government if they face the threat of \n     private lawsuits each time they are alleged to have \n     provided assistance. The Senate Intelligence Committee \n     concluded that: ``The possible reduction in intelligence \n     that might result from this delay is simply unacceptable \n     for the safety of our Nation.'' Allowing continued \n     litigation also risks the disclosure of highly classified \n     information regarding intelligence sources and methods. In \n     addition to providing an advantage to our adversaries by \n     revealing sources and methods during the course of \n     litigation, the potential disclosure of classified \n     information puts both the facilities and personnel of \n     electronic communication service providers and our \n     country's continued ability to protect our homeland at \n     risk. It is imperative that Congress provide liability \n     protection to those who cooperated with this country in \n     its hour of need.\n       The ramifications of the Judiciary Committee's decision to \n     afford no relief to private parties that cooperated in good \n     faith with the U.S. Government in the immediate aftermath of \n     the attacks of September 11 could extend well beyond the \n     particular issues and activities that have been of primary \n     interest and concern to the Committee. The Intelligence \n     Community, as well as law enforcement and homeland security \n     agencies, continue to rely on the voluntary cooperation and \n     assistance of private parties. A decision by the Senate to \n     abandon those who may have provided assistance after \n     September 11 will invariably be noted by those who may \n     someday be called upon again to help the Nation.\n       Mandates an Unnecessary Review of Historical Programs. The \n     Judiciary Committee substitute would require that inspectors \n     general of the Department of Justice and relevant \n     Intelligence Community agencies audit the Terrorist \n     Surveillance Program and ``any closely related intelligence \n     activities.'' If this ``audit'' is intended to look at \n     operational activities, there has been an ongoing oversight \n     activity by the Inspector General of the National Security \n     Agency (NSA) of operational activities and the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee has that material. Mandating a new and \n     undefined ``audit'' will divert significant operational \n     resources from current issues to redoing past audits. The \n     Administration understands, however, the ``audit'' may in \n     fact not be related to technical NSA operations. If it is the \n     case that in fact the Judiciary Committee is interested in \n     historical reviews of legal issues, the provision is \n     unnecessary. The Department of Justice Inspector General and \n     the Office of Professional Responsibility are already doing a \n     comprehensive review. In addition, the phrase ``closely \n     related intelligence activities'' would introduce substantial \n     ambiguities in the scope of this review. Finally, this \n     provision would require the inspectors general to acquire \n     ``all documents relevant to such programs'' and submit those \n     documents with its report to the congressional intelligence \n     and judiciary committees. The requirement to collect and \n     disseminate this wide range of highly classified documents--\n     including all those ``relevant'' to activities ``closely \n     related'' to the Terrorist Surveillance Program--\n     unnecessarily risks the disclosure of extremely sensitive \n     information about our intelligence activities, as does the \n     audit requirement itself. Taking such national security risks \n     for a backwards-looking purpose is unacceptable.\n       Allows for Dangerous Intelligence Gaps During the Pendency \n     of an Appeal. The Judiciary Committee substitute would delete \n     an important provision in the SSCI bill that enables the \n     Intelligence Community to collect foreign intelligence from \n     overseas terrorists and other foreign intelligence targets \n     during an appeal. Without that provision, we could lose vital \n     intelligence necessary to protect the Nation because of the \n     views of one judge.\n       Limits Dissemination of Foreign Intelligence Information. \n     The Judiciary Committee substitute would impose significant \n     new restrictions on the use of foreign intelligence \n     information, including information\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\n     not concerning United States persons, obtained or derived \n     from acquisitions using targeting procedures that the FISA \n     Court later found to be unsatisfactory for any reason. By \n     requiring analysts to go back to the databases and pull out \n     certain information, as well as to determine what other \n     information is derived from that information, this \n     requirement would place a difficult, and perhaps \n     insurmountable, burden on the Intelligence Community. \n     Moreover, this provision would degrade privacy protections, \n     as it would require analysts to locate and examine U.S. \n     person information that would otherwise not be reviewed.\n       Requires FISA Court Approval of All ``Targeting'' for \n     Foreign Intelligence Purposes. The Judiciary Committee \n     substitute potentially requires the FISA Court to approve \n     ``[a]ny targeting of persons reasonably believed to be \n     located outside the United States.'' Although we assume that \n     the Committee did not intend to require these procedures to \n     govern all ``targeting'' done of any person in the world for \n     any purpose--whether it is to gather human intelligence, \n     communications intelligence, or for other reasons--the text \n     as passed by the Committee contains no limitation. Such a \n     requirement would bring within the FISA Court a vast range of \n     overseas intelligence activities with little or no connection \n     to civil liberties and privacy rights of Americans.\n       Imposes Court Review of Compliance with Minimization \n     Procedures. The Judiciary Committee substitute would require \n     the FISA Court to review and assess compliance with \n     minimization procedures. Together with provisions discussed \n     above, this would constitute a massive expansion of the \n     Court's role in overseeing the Intelligence Community's \n     implementation of foreign intelligence collection abroad.\n       Amends FISA to Impose Burdensome Document Production \n     Requirements. The Judiciary Committee substitute would amend \n     FISA to require the Government to submit to oversight \n     committees a copy of any decision, order, or opinion issued \n     by the FISA Court or the FISA Court of Review that includes \n     significant construction or interpretation of any provision \n     of FISA, including any pleadings associated with those \n     documents, no later than 45 days after the document is \n     issued. The Judiciary Committee substitute also would require \n     the Government to retrieve historical documents of this \n     nature from the last five years. As drafted, this provision \n     could impose significant burdens on Department of Justice \n     staff assigned to support national security operational and \n     oversight missions.\n       Includes an Even Shorter Sunset Provision Than That \n     Contained in the SSCI Bill. The Judiciary Committee \n     substitute and the SSCI bill share the same flaw of failing \n     to achieve permanent FISA reform. The Judiciary Committee \n     substitute worsens this flaw, however, by shortening the \n     sunset provision in the SSCI bill from six years to four \n     years. Any sunset provision, but particularly one as short as \n     contemplated in the Judiciary Committee substitute, would \n     adversely impact the Intelligence Community's ability to \n     conduct its mission efficiently and effectively by \n     introducing uncertainty and requiring re-training of all \n     intelligence professionals on new policies and procedures \n     implementing ever-changing authorities. Moreover, over the \n     past year, in the interest of providing an extensive \n     legislative record and allowing public discussion on this \n     issue, the Intelligence Community has discussed in open \n     settings extraordinary information dealing with intelligence \n     operations. To repeat this process in several years will \n     unnecessarily highlight our intelligence sources and methods \n     to our adversaries. There is now a lengthy factual record \n     on the need for this legislation, and it is time to \n     provide the Intelligence Community the permanent stability \n     it needs.\n       Fails to Provide Procedures for Implementing Existing \n     Statutory Defenses. The Judiciary Committee substitute fails \n     to include the important provisions in the SSCI bill that \n     would establish procedures for implementing existing \n     statutory defenses and that would preempt state \n     investigations of assistance allegedly provided by an \n     electronic communication service provider to an element of \n     the Intelligence Community. These provisions are important to \n     ensure that electronic communication service providers can \n     take full advantage of existing liability protection and to \n     protect highly classified information.\n       Fails to Address Transition Procedures. Unlike the SSCI \n     bill, the Judiciary Committee bill contains no procedures \n     designed to ensure a smooth transition from the PAA to new \n     legislation, and for a potential transition resulting from an \n     expiration of the new legislation. This omission could result \n     in uncertainty regarding the continuing validity of \n     authorizations and directives under the Protect America Act \n     that are in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     legislation.\n       Fails to Include a Severability Provision. The Judiciary \n     Committee substitute, unlike the SSCI bill, lacks a \n     severability provision. Such a provision should be included \n     in the bill.\n       The Administration is prepared to continue to work with \n     Congress towards the passage of a permanent FISA \n     modernization bill that would strengthen the Nation's \n     intelligence capabilities while protecting the constitutional \n     rights of Americans, so that the President can sign such a \n     bill into law. The Senate Intelligence Committee bill \n     provides a solid foundation to meet the needs of our \n     Intelligence Community, but the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     bill represents a major step backwards from the PAA and would \n     compromise our Intelligence Community's ability to protect \n     the Nation. The Administration calls on Congress to forge \n     ahead and pass legislation that will protect our national \n     security, not weaken it in critical ways.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 14, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter presents the views of the \n     Administration on the proposed substitute amendment you \n     circulated to Title I of the FISA Amendments Act of 2007 (S. \n     2248), a bill ``to amend the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978, to modernize and streamline the \n     provisions of that act, and for other purposes.'' We have \n     appreciated the willingness of Congress to address the need \n     to modernize FISA permanently and to work with the \n     Administration to do so in a manner that allows the \n     intelligence community to collect the foreign intelligence \n     information necessary to protect the Nation while protecting \n     the civil liberties of Americans. With all respect, however, \n     we strongly oppose the proposed substitute amendment. If the \n     substitute is part of a bill that is presented to the \n     President, we and the President's other senior advisers will \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n       In August, Congress took an important step toward \n     modernizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \n     by enacting the Protect America Act of 2007 (PAA). The \n     Protect America Act has allowed us temporarily to close \n     intelligence gaps by enabling our intelligence professionals \n     to collect, without a court order, foreign intelligence \n     information from targets overseas. The intelligence community \n     has implemented the Protect America Act in a responsible way, \n     subject to extensive congressional oversight, to meet the \n     country's foreign intelligence needs while protecting civil \n     liberties. Unless reauthorized by Congress, however, the \n     authority provided in the Protect America Act will expire in \n     less than three months. In the face of the continued \n     terrorist threats to our Nation, we think it is vital that \n     Congress act to make the core authorities of the Protect \n     America Act permanent. Congressional action to provide \n     protection from private lawsuits against companies that are \n     alleged to have assisted the Government in the aftermath of \n     the September 11th terrorist attacks on America also is \n     critical to ensuring the Government can continue to receive \n     private sector help to protect the Nation.\n       In late October, the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence introduced a consensus, bipartisan bill (S. \n     2248) that would establish a firm, long-term foundation for \n     our intelligence community's efforts to target terrorists and \n     other foreign intelligence targets located overseas. While \n     the bill is not perfect, it contains many important \n     provisions, and was developed through a thoughtful process \n     that ensured that the intelligence community retains the core \n     authorities it needs to protect the Nation and that the bill \n     would not adversely impact critical intelligence operations. \n     Importantly, that bill would afford retroactive liability \n     protection to communication service providers that are \n     alleged to have assisted the Government with intelligence \n     activities in the aftermath of September 11th. The \n     Intelligence Committee recognized that ``without retroactive \n     immunity, the private sector might be unwilling to cooperate \n     with lawful Government requests in the future without \n     unnecessary court involvement and protracted litigation. \n     The possible reduction in intelligence that might result \n     from this delay is simply unacceptable for the safety of \n     Our Nation.'' The committee's measured judgment reflects \n     the principle that private citizens who respond in good \n     faith to a request for assistance by public officials \n     should not be held liable for their actions. The bill was \n     reported favorably out of committee on a 13-2 vote.\n       We respectfully submit that your substitute amendment to \n     Title I of the Senate Intelligence Committee's bill would \n     upset some important provisions in the Intelligence Committee \n     bill. The substitute also does not adequately address certain \n     provisions in the Intelligence Committee's bill that remain \n     in need of improvement. As a result, we have determined, with \n     all respect to your efforts, that the substitute would not \n     provide the intelligence community with the tools it needs \n     effectively to collect foreign intelligence information vital \n     for the security of the Nation.\n\n\n    I. Limitations on Intelligence Collection and National Security \n                             Investigations\n\n       The substitute would make several amendments to S. 2248 \n     that would have an adverse impact on our ability to collect \n     effectively the foreign intelligence information necessary to \n     protect the Nation. These amendments include the following:\n       Prohibits Intelligence and Law Enforcement Officials From \n     Using Valuable Investigative Tools. The substitute contains \n     an amendment to the ``exclusive means'' provision of FISA \n     that could severely harm our ability to conduct national \n     security investigations. As drafted, the provision would bar \n     the use of national security letters, Title III criminal \n     wiretaps, ad other well-established investigative tools to \n     collect information in national security investigations.\n       Threatens Critical Intellilgence Collection Activities. The \n     ``exclusive means'' provision also\n\n[[Page S249]]\n\n     could harm the national security by disrupting highly \n     classified intelligence activities. Among other things, \n     ambiguities in critical terms and formulations in the \n     provision--including the term ``communications information'' \n     (a term that is not defined in FISA) and the introduction of \n     the concept of targeting communications (as opposed to \n     persons)--could lead the statute to bar altogether or to \n     require court approval for overseas intelligence activities \n     that involve merely the incidental collection of United \n     States person information.\n       Limits Existing Provisions of Law that Protect \n     Communications Service Providers. The portion of the \n     substitute regarding protections to communication service \n     providers under Government certifications contains \n     ambiguities that could jeopardize our ability to secure the \n     assistance of these providers in the future. This could \n     hamper significantly the Government's efforts to obtain \n     necessary foreign intelligence information. As the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee noted in its report on S. 2248, \n     ``electronic communications service providers play an \n     important role in assisting intelligence officials in \n     national security activities. Indeed, the intelligence \n     community cannot obtain the intelligence it needs without \n     assistance from these companies.''\n       Allows for Dangerous Intelligence Gaps During the Pendency \n     of an Appeal. The substitute would delete an important \n     provision in the bipartisan Intelligence Committee bill that \n     would ensure that our intelligence professionals can continue \n     to collect intelligence from overseas terrorists and other \n     foreign intelligence targets during the pendency of an appeal \n     of a decision of the FISA Court. Without that provision, \n     whole categories of surveillances directed outside the United \n     States could be halted before review by the FISA Court of \n     Review.\n       Limits Dissemination of Foreign Intelligence Information. \n     The substitute would impose significant new restrictions on \n     the use of foreign intelligence information, including \n     information not concerning United States persons, obtained or \n     derived from acquisitions using targeting procedures that the \n     FISA Court later found to be unsatisfactory. By requiring \n     analysts to go back to the databases and pull out the \n     information, as well as to determine what other information \n     is derived from that information, this requirement would \n     place a difficult, and perhaps insurmountable, operational \n     burden on the intelligence community in implementing \n     authorities that target terrorists and other foreign \n     intelligence targets located overseas. This requirement also \n     strikes us as at odds with the mandate of the September 11th \n     Commission that the intelligence community should find and \n     link disparate pieces of foreign intelligence information. \n     The requirement also harms privacy interests by requiring \n     analysts to examine information that would otherwise be \n     discarded without being reviewed.\n       Imposes Court Review of Compliance with Minimization \n     Procedures. The substitute would allow the FISA Court to \n     review compliance with minimization procedures that are used \n     on a programmatic basis for the acquisition of foreign \n     intelligence information by targeting individuals reasonably \n     believed to be outside the United States. This could place \n     the FISA Court in a position where it would conduct \n     individualized review of the intelligence community's foreign \n     communications intelligence activities. While conferring such \n     authority on the court is understandable in the context of \n     traditional FISA collection, it is anomalous in this context, \n     where the court's role is in approving generally applicable \n     procedures rather than individual surveillances.\n       Strikes a Provision Designed to Make the FISA Process More \n     Efficient. The substitute would strike a provision from the \n     bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee bill that would \n     allow the second highest-ranking FBI official to certify \n     applications for electronic surveillance. Today, the only FBI \n     official who can certify FISA applications is the Director, a \n     restriction that can delay the initiation of surveillance \n     when the Director travels or is otherwise unavailable. It is \n     unclear why this provision from the Intelligence Committee \n     bill, which will enhance the efficiency of the FISA process \n     while ensuring high-level accountability, would be \n     objectionable.\n\n\n                 II. Necessary Improvements to S. 2248\n\n       The substitute also does not make needed improvements to \n     the Senate Intelligence Committee bill. These include:\n       Provision Pertaining to Surveillance of United States \n     Persons Abroad. The substitute does not make needed \n     improvements to the Committee bill, which would require for \n     the first time that a court order be obtained to surveil \n     United States persons abroad. In addition to being \n     problematic for policy reasons and imposing burdens on \n     foreign intelligence collection abroad that do not exist with \n     respect to collection for law enforcement purposes, the \n     provision continues to have serious technical problems. As \n     drafted, the provision would not allow for the surveillance, \n     even with a court finding, of certain critical foreign \n     intelligence targets, and would allow emergency surveillance \n     outside the United States for significantly less time than \n     the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee bill had \n     authorized for surveillance inside the United States.\n       Maintains a Sunset Provision. Rather than achieving \n     permanent FISA reform, the substitute maintains a six year \n     sunset provision. Indeed, several members on the Judiciary \n     Committee have indicated that they may propose amendments to \n     the bill that would shorten the sunset, leaving the \n     intelligence community and our private partners subject to an \n     uncertain legal framework for collecting intelligence from \n     overseas targets. Any sunset provision withholds from our \n     intelligence professionals the certainty and permanence they \n     need to conduct foreign intelligence collection to protect \n     Americans from terrorism and other threats to the national \n     security. The intelligence community operates much more \n     effectively when the rules governing our intelligence \n     professionals' ability to track our adversaries are \n     established and are not changing from year to year. Stability \n     of law, we submit, also allows the intelligence community to \n     invest resources appropriately. In our respectful view, a \n     sunset provision is unnecessary and would have an adverse \n     impact on the intelligence community's ability to conduct its \n     mission efficiently and effectively.\n       Fails to Remedy an Unrealistic Reporting Requirement. The \n     substitute fails to make needed amendments to a reporting \n     requirement in the Senate Intelligence Committee bill that \n     poses serious operational difficulties for the intelligence \n     community. The Intelligence Committee bill contains a \n     requirement that intelligence analysts count ``the number of \n     persons located in the United States whose communications \n     were reviewed.'' This provision would be impossible to \n     implement fully. The provision, in short, places potentially \n     insurmountable burdens on intelligence professionals without \n     meaningfully protecting the privacy of Americans. The \n     intelligence community has provided Congress with a further \n     classified discussion of this issue.\n       We also are concerned by other serious technical flaws in \n     the substitute that create uncertainty.\n       The Administration remains prepared to work with Congress \n     towards the passage of a permanent FISA modernization bill \n     that would strengthen the Nation's intelligence capabilities \n     while respecting and protecting the constitutional rights of \n     Americans, so that the President can sign such a bill into \n     law. We look forward to working with you and the Members of \n     the Judiciary Committee on these important issues.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. The \n     Office of Management and Budget has advised us that from the \n     perspective of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to the submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael B. Mukasey,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n     J.M. McConnell,\n                                Director of National Intelligence.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. On numerous occasions I have voiced very specific concerns \nwith the Judiciary substitute. I again want to list some of the reasons \nthat illustrate why I oppose this measure. One phrase that has been \nexpressed on the floor of the Senate is that the Judiciary substitute \nsupposedly ``strengthens'' oversight. That might sound like a good \ntalking point, but what does it mean? Does it mean that the \nIntelligence Committee version is weak on oversight? Based on their \nprevious statements, some of my colleagues seem to believe this. One of \nmy colleagues described the Intelligence Committee bill as ``a bill of \ntoken oversight and weak protections for innocent Americans.'' This \nsame colleague also stated that ``it really reduces court oversight \nnearly to the point of symbolism.'' Another colleague stated the bill \nwill allow the Government to ``review more Americans' communications \nwith less court supervision than ever before.''\n  The truth is actually much different. The Intelligence Committee bill \ncontains extensive new oversight provisions for the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court and Congress. I think it should be \nperfectly clear that it is a fallacy to claim that the Intelligence \nCommittee bill does not have adequate oversight. On the contrary, it \nhas a level of oversight that is unprecedented and quite possibly \nprovides the most comprehensive oversight of any historical bill \nrelating to foreign intelligence gatherings.\n  We have also heard the contention that this bill would provide broad \nnew surveillance authorities. Since I have discussed the expanded \noversight, I wish I could put up some charts that illustrate this so-\ncalled massive expansion of surveillance authority. The problem is that \nexpansion is not in the bill. It doesn't exist. Despite the phrase \nbeing repeated over and over, this bill simply contains no new broad \nand unprecedented surveillance authorities.\n  For the first time, the Federal Intelligence Court will review and \napprove targeting procedures used by the intelligence community. For \nthe first time since 1978--it wasn't done before--FISC will determine \nwhether the procedures\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\nare reasonably designed to ensure targeting is limited to persons \noutside the United States.\n  This bill simply accounts for the technological change in \ninternational communications from over the air to cable. It is the bare \nminimum, but it does give them what they need.\n  Given the amount of opposition to the Judiciary substitute, I wish to \nhighlight one of the controversial provisions added in the Judiciary \nCommittee relating to ``reverse targeting.''\n  One of the basic requirements of any FISA modernization proposal is \nthat we should not have any provisions which could be interpreted as \nrequiring warrants to target a foreign terrorist overseas. Quite \nsimply, foreign terrorists living overseas should never receive \nprotections provided by the fourth amendment to the Constitution. They \nnever have and they never should. Reverse targeting refers to the \npossibility, as alleged by critics of lawful Government surveillance, \nthat the Government could target a foreign person when the real \nintention is to target a U.S. person, thus circumventing the need to \nget a warrant for the U.S. person. Reverse targeting has always been \nunlawful in order to protect the communications of U.S. persons. \nContrary to what most people believe, the legitimate definition of U.S. \npersons is not limited to U.S. citizens.\n  What is a United States person? ``An alien lawfully admitted for \npermanent residence'' and ``a corporation which is incorporated in the \nUnited States.''\n  So from an intelligence-gathering standpoint, reverse targeting makes \nno sense. From an efficiency standpoint, if the Government were \ninterested in targeting an American, it would apply for a warrant to \nlisten to all of the American's conversations, not just conversations \nwith terrorists overseas. But let's not let logic get in the way of \ngood conspiracy theory.\n  Even though reverse targeting is already considered unlawful, a \nprovision is included in the Intelligence bill which makes it explicit. \nThis provision is clearly written and universally supported. However, \nthe Judiciary Committee passed an amendment by a 10-to-9 party-line \nvote which altered the clear language of this provision. Where before \nthe provision said you cannot target a foreign person if the \n``purpose'' is to target a U.S. person, the new language adds the \nambiguous term ``significant purpose.'' If this amendment became law, \nan analyst would now have to ask himself the following question when \ntargeting a terrorist overseas: Is a ``significant purpose'' of why I \nam targeting this foreign terrorist overseas the fact that the \nterrorist may call, A, an airline in America to make flight \nreservations or, B, a terrorist with a green card living in the USA? If \nthe answer is yes, then the language in this amendment would require a \nwarrant to listen to that foreign terrorist overseas. Do foreign \nterrorists overseas deserve protections from the courts in the United \nStates? Of course not. The ambiguous and unnecessary text of this \namendment should not be left up to judicial interpretation. Enactment \nof this amendment could lead to our analysts seeking warrants when \ntargeting any foreign terrorist, since the analyst may be afraid he or \nshe is otherwise breaking our new law.\n  Now we should remember that the Intelligence Committee spent months \nworking on a bipartisan compromise bill. This amendment I have been \ntalking about was not in the Intelligence bill. So people should assume \nthat the Judiciary Committee spent a great deal of time debating this \namendment, right? Wrong. The Judiciary Committee spent 7 minutes \ndebating this amendment before it was adopted on a 10-to-9 party-line \nvote. Let me repeat that number: 7 minutes.\n  Now, the inclusion of this amendment alone would cause me to vote \nagainst this Judiciary substitute. But there are many more provisions \nthat were added via party-line vote which I strongly oppose.\n  The Judiciary Committee also adopted an amendment to shorten the \nlength of the sunset in the Intelligence Committee's bill. There are a \nfew quick things we should realize when talking about sunsets.\n  It takes a great deal of time to ensure that all of our intelligence \nagencies and personnel are fully trained in any new authorities and \nrestrictions brought about by congressional action. This is not \nsomething that happens overnight. We cannot just wave a magic wand and \nhave our Nation's intelligence personnel instantaneously cognizant of \nevery administrative alteration imposed by Congress. Like so many \nthings in life, adjusting for these new mechanisms takes time and \npractice.\n  While certain modifications are necessary, do we want to make it a \nhabit of consistently changing the rules? I do not think so. Don't we \nwant our analysts to spend their time actually tracking terrorists? Or \nis their time better spent navigating administrative procedures that \nmay constantly be in flux? I can tell you clearly what I want, and that \nis for our analysts to use lawful tools to keep our families safe. I do \nnot want to see them unnecessarily diverting their attention by burying \ntheir heads in administrative manuals whenever the political winds \nblow. After all of the efforts to finally write a bill that provides a \nlegal regime that governs contemporary technological capabilities, I am \ncertainly not alone in my opposition to this sunset provision. In fact, \nmy views are completely in line with what this body has done in the \npast when amending FISA. Remembering that FISA itself had no sunset--\nthe 1978 bill had no sunset--let's look at how Congress has previously \nlegislated in this area: Sunsets are not common in previous laws \namending FISA. Other than the PATRIOT Act and the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization, seven of the eight public laws amending FISA had no \nsunsets on FISA provisions, and the remaining public law had a sunset \non only one of the provisions.\n  Now this statistic speaks for itself. What is so different about this \nbill? I do realize that it contains massive new oversight which could \npossibly hinder our collection efforts, and that we may need to revisit \nit for this reason. However, if this is the case, we obviously do not \nneed a sunset to do this. We can legislate in this area whenever we \nwant to.\n  The fact that the Judiciary Committee shortened the length of an \nalready unnecessary sunset is yet another example of why I will oppose \nthe Judiciary substitute amendment.\n  We all realize that the Judiciary Committee's bill also removed the \nbipartisan immunity provision. I have come to the floor on numerous \noccasions to articulate why this provision is so vital and so \nnecessary. I will do so again when we debate the misguided amendment to \nstrike this bipartisan compromise provision.\n  We are enacting national security legislation, and it is our \nresponsibility to ensure that this bill does not lead to unintended \nconsequences which provide protections to terrorists. I have no doubt \nthat provisions in the Judiciary Committee substitute could \nsignificantly harm--significantly harm--our national security. I am not \nwilling to take that chance. I am not willing to support a bill which \nraises operational hurdles that impede collection of foreign \nintelligence. I am not willing to support initiatives that would allow \nour collections to go dark during the appeal of a ruling from one \njudge. I am not willing to support a bill which handcuffs our \nintelligence agencies. I am not willing to support a bill which \nprovides excessive and obtrusive oversight that placates fringe \npolitical groups at the possible expense of national security. The \nstakes are too high. The damage that can be done if we get this wrong \nis too great.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n30 seconds to finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will never apologize for voting in favor of provisions \nwhich protect national security and civil liberties. During the \nremainder of this debate, I will continue to support initiatives that \nproperly protect the lives and liberty of Americans. I am hopeful my \ncolleagues will do the same. And I hope we will table this Judiciary \nCommittee partisan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will speak later on the floor on the \nFISA amendment. I want to say that I think the Judiciary Committee \namendment\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\nis careful and balanced and takes into account both security and \nliberty. I also note, my colleague from Utah talked about the fact that \nevery citizen would need a warrant in terms of wiretapping. There \nalways has been, and will be in this bill, an emergency exception. So \nif we have to quickly find someone, there will be an ability to \nwiretap, and then go get the warrant. We do insist, however--and this \nis one of the big differences on oversight--to make sure those \nemergency provisions and the other provisions are being used according \nto law, and it is not willy-nilly, whatever anybody wants at any time \nin any place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Schumer are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthe substitute amendment and pass the FISA bill reported by the \nJudiciary Committee. Since I introduced the original FISA legislation \nover 30 years ago, I have worked to amend the FISA law many times and I \nbelieve that only the bill reported by the Judiciary Committee is \nfaithful to the traditional balance FISA has struck. FISA remains an \nessential tool in our battle against America's enemies, and the bills \nintroduced by both the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence \nCommittee give the executive branch vast authority to conduct \nelectronic surveillance that may involve Americans. But the \nIntelligence Committee bill lacks safeguards to provide oversight and \nprevent abuse, and Americans deserve better. The Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act is one of our landmark statutes. For three decades it \nhas regulated Government surveillance in a way that protects both our \nnational security and our civil liberties and prevents the Government \nfrom abusing its powers. It is because FISA enhances both security and \nliberty that it has won such broad support over the years from \nPresidents, Members of Congress, and the public alike. It is important \nto remember that before this administration, no administration had ever \nresisted FISA, much less systematically violated it.\n  When the Bush administration finally came to Congress to amend FISA \nafter its warrantless wiretapping program was exposed, it did so not in \nthe spirit of partnership but to bully us into obeying its wishes. The \nProtect America Act was negotiated in secret at the last minute. The \nadministration issued dire threats that failure to enact a bill before \nthe August recess would lead to disaster. Few, if any, knew what the \nlanguage would actually do. The result of this flawed process was \nflawed legislation which virtually everyone now acknowledges must be \nsubstantially revised.\n  I commend the members of the Intelligence Committee for their \ndiligent efforts to put together a new bill. They have taken their \nduties seriously and they have made notable improvements to the Protect \nAmerica Act. But their bill is deeply flawed and I am opposed to \nenacting it in its current form. This bill fails to protect America's \nconstitutional rights and fundamental freedoms. It is not just that the \nIntelligence Committee bill gives retroactive immunity to telecoms, \nwhich I strongly oppose; there are also many problems with title I of \nthe Intelligence Committee bill.\n  First: It redefines ``electronic surveillance,'' a key term in FISA, \nin a way that is unnecessary and may have unintended consequences. We \nhave still not heard a single good argument for why this change is \nneeded.\n  Second: Court review occurs only after the fact with no consequences \nif the court rejects the Government's targeting of minimization \nprocedures. This is a far cry from the traditional role played by the \nFISA Court.\n  Third: It is not as clear as it should be that FISA and the criminal \nwiretap law are the sole legal means by which the Government may \nconduct electronic surveillance. This leaves open the possibility that \nfuture administrations will claim that they are not bound by FISA.\n  Fourth: Its sunset provision is December 31, 2013. For legislation as \ncomplicated, important, and controversial as this, Congress should \nevaluate it much sooner. After all, the principal argument in support \nof reforming FISA is that technology has evolved rapidly and the law \nmust change to take this into account. Because this legislation will \nmake major untested changes to the FISA system and the pace of \ntechnology change will only increase, we should evaluate it sooner \nrather than later.\n  The bill purports to eliminate the ``reverse targeting'' of \nAmericans, but does not actually contain language to do so. Reverse \ntargeting can occur if the Government wiretaps someone abroad because \nit wants to listen to a correspondent in the United States, thereby \nevading the traditional warrant requirement for domestic surveillance. \nThe Intelligence Committee bill has nothing similar to the House bill's \nprovision on reverse targeting which prohibits use of the authorities \nif ``a significant purpose'' is targeting someone in the United States.\n  Mr. President, this legislation does not fully close the loophole \nleft open by the Protect America Act, allowing warrantless interception \nof purely domestic communications. The administration has acknowledged \nthat when it knows ahead of time that both the person making the call \nand the person receiving the call are located inside the United States, \nit should have to get a court order before it can listen in on that \ncall. But the language of the bill doesn't clearly require it.\n  It does not require an independent review and report on the \nadministration's domestic warrantless eavesdropping program. Only \nthrough such a process will we ever learn what happened and achieve \naccountability and closure on this episode. It is enormously important, \nMr. President, that we find out exactly what happened during this \nperiod of our history.\n  Add it all up, and the sum is clear: This bill is inconsistent with \nthe way FISA was meant to work and with the way FISA has always worked.\n  Fortunately, the Judiciary Committee's FISA bill shows that there is \na better way, one that is faithful to the traditional FISA balance. The \nJudiciary Committee bill shares the same basic structure, but it \naddresses all of the problems I listed earlier. The Judiciary Committee \nbill was negotiated in public, which allowed outside groups and experts \nto give critical feedback. It was also negotiated later in time than \nthe Intelligence bill, meaning we had the benefit of reviewing their \nwork.\n  Like the Intelligence Committee's bill, the Judiciary Committee's \nversion also gives the executive branch significantly greater authority \nto conduct electronic surveillance than it has ever had before. Make no \nmistake, it, too, grants substantial power to the intelligence \ncommunity. But unlike the Intelligence Committee's bill, the Judiciary \nCommittee's version sets reasonable limits to protect innocent \nAmericans from being spied on by their Government without \njustification.\n  No one should underestimate the importance of title I of FISA. The \nrules governing electronic surveillance affect every American. They are \nthe only thing that stands between the freedom of Americans to make a \nphone call, send an e-mail, and search the Internet, and the ability of \nthe Government to listen in on that call, read that e-mail, and review \nthat Internet search.\n  In our information age, title I of FISA provides Americans essential \nprotections against Government tyranny and abuse. We have a choice. We \ncan adopt the Judiciary Committee's bill and preserve those protections \nor we can adopt the Intelligence Committee's version of title I and \nabandon them.\n  As I have said before, I also strongly oppose title II of the \nIntelligence Committee bill, which grants retroactive immunity to the \nphone companies. At the appropriate time, I will come to the floor and \nexplain why we must strike title II.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the bipartisan\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\nFISA legislation passed by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \nThis legislation, which was passed by the Intelligence Committee on a \n13-2 vote, will give the intelligence community the tools it needs to \neffectively protect our Nation. It is not a perfect bill, but it is the \nbalanced product of months of hard work by the Intelligence Committee \nmembers and their staff.\n  On the other hand, the substitute amendment proposed by the Judiciary \nCommittee would have substantially weakened the Intelligence Committee \nlegislation and our nation's ability to protect itself. Unlike the \nbipartisan Intelligence Committee bill, the Judiciary Committee \nlegislation was passed on a series of party-line 10-9 votes. The \nsubstitute would have added onerous and unnecessary hurdles to the \ncollection of vital national security intelligence. It would have \nhamstrung our intelligence community at a very dangerous time in our \ncountry's history. I am pleased that the Senate quickly rejected the \nJudiciary Committee substitute. It would have been foolhardy for the \nSenate to hinder America's ability to protect itself from terrorists \nand other threats by gutting the Intelligence Committee bill.\n  Perhaps the biggest failure of the Judiciary substitute is its lack \nof a retroactive immunity provision for electronic communication \nservice providers who are alleged to have assisted the government with \nintelligence activities in the aftermath of September 11. The \ntelecommunications companies that lawfully responded to written \nrequests from their government to help protect the nation need and \ndeserve immunity from frivolous lawsuits that seek hundreds of billions \nof dollars in damages.\n  The Intelligence Committee bill includes a responsible retroactive \nimmunity provision to protect the telecommunications companies that \naided the government in the wake of the September 11 attacks. However, \nit leaves legal actions against the government and government officials \nuntouched. The Judiciary Committee substitute does not address the \ncritical need for retroactive immunity for cooperating companies and \nwould risk a future where companies refuse to cooperate with vital \ngovernment intelligence operations, lest they risk massive legal \nliability. Without immunity, our Nation faces a substantial decrease in \nfuture intelligence. Such a decrease would endanger American lives and \nis simply unacceptable.\n  Again, while not a perfect bill, the Intelligence Committee \nlegislation would appropriately balance national security and \nindividual civil liberties. Our intelligence community must be able to \ngather the information necessary to effectively protect the country. \nThe Intelligence Committee bill is a bipartisan compromise with \neffective safeguards. The Senate should quickly pass this legislation \nto give the intelligence community the tools it needs to protect \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given the \nfull 15 minutes that was allotted to us before the 2 o'clock vote. I \nhave some remarks, and I believe Senator Rockefeller, if we need that, \nwould like the full 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, last night, as I was preparing to leave my \noffice, I learned, with surprise, that Senator Leahy had made \nsignificant modifications to the pending Judiciary Committee \nsubstitute.\n  Our study during the night of these modifications revealed that the \npartisan, Democratic-only Judiciary Committee substitute remains deeply \nflawed.\n  While some aspects of the modified substitute have been cleaned up--\nand, in fact, appear to borrow language that Senator Rockefeller and I \nhave been negotiating over the past several months as part of our \nperfecting managers' amendment--the substitute contains many \nproblematic provisions that I cannot support.\n  In contrast to the underlying Intelligence Committee bill, I doubt \nthat the problematic provisions in the modified substitute were vetted \nwith the Republican Judiciary Committee members, the intelligence \ncommunity, or the Department of Justice.\n  It should be no surprise, then, that the DNI and the Department of \nJustice continue to oppose the modified substitute.\n  Let me clarify some matters that were brought up by the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts. First, the Protect America Act, \nwhich expires on February 1, was not negotiated in secret. The DNI \nasked the Intelligence Committee in April to consider a bill he set up. \nHe came before our committee and testified openly in May. He came \nbefore the Senate in a classified meeting in S-407 in June. When we had \nnot been able to get a markup in the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence and time was running short, he offered a stripped-down \nversion that would allow intelligence collection to continue. We were \nunable to get a markup, so we filed with Leader McConnell the bill on \nWednesday. That bill sat on the floor Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n  There were secret negotiations, but those were on the majority side. \nThe chairmen of several committees worked without informing the members \nof the Intelligence Committee or, to my knowledge, any Republicans on \nany of the committees, and they finally presented that to us less than \nan hour before we went to the floor. So that was negotiated in secret. \nIt was unacceptable, and it did not allow intelligence collection to \ncontinue. I am glad to say, on a bipartisan basis, we rejected the \nsecretly negotiated bill and passed the Protect America Act.\n  The Protect America Act did not expand on the authorities of FISA, \nother than to clarify the means of collection, which previously were by \nradio. Most communications overseas are by radio. Many communications \nwere going through America. This bill before us today, the Intelligence \nCommittee bill, does not, as my friend said, expand on the powers of \nthe intelligence community to collect. In fact, they impose more \nrestrictions to guarantee the privacy rights and the constitutional \nrights of Americans. Those are in the bill. Those were negotiated. We \npushed the DNI and the Department of Justice lawyers as far as we could \nto build in additional protections. Those are in the bill.\n  Now, if one reads the bill, you would see that reverse targeting is \nprohibited in section 703(b), subparagraphs 2 and 3. It does strengthen \nthe privacy protections. That is why the Senate Intelligence Committee \nbill is the bill that we should pass.\n  Moving back to the Judiciary Committee substitute, there is no \nprovision for retroactive or prospective immunity for communications \nproviders or for preemption of State investigations into providers' \nalleged assistance to the Government in relation to the terrorist \nsurveillance program.\n  The distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Rockefeller, \nlaid out at length, and very forcefully, why this protection is needed. \nThis protection is needed to assure that we can have the continued \nassistance of carriers who might be called on not only in terrorist \nmatters but on many domestic crimes to provide assistance. Furthermore, \nif we don't have that protection, if these lawsuits continue, it is \nquite likely that the court proceedings will get into details further \non how the collection of electronic information and communications is \naccomplished. Every time we talk about that and lay out more, we give \nmore information and more guidance to the terrorists themselves on how \nto avoid our surveillance. We don't want to be in that position.\n  The next problem with the substitute from the Judiciary Committee is \nthat, unlike the managers' amendment that Senator Rockefeller and I \nintend to offer for the Senate's consideration, the new substitute \ndoesn't fix the reporting problems of the Wyden amendment, which had a \ngreat objective--and I agreed with the objective--but it is unworkable. \nWe are going to make it workable in our bill.\n\n  Furthermore, it requires the intelligence community to perform the \nimpossible task of estimating and recording U.S. person communications \nin its possession. Anybody who wants to know why that is so, we would \nbe happy to meet with them in a closed meeting and explain why that is \nnot workable. It would be an impossible burden, one we cannot undertake \non the committee.\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\n  Next, the substitute modifies the exclusive means provision from the \noriginal substitute, but it is still problematic and requires an \nexpress statutory authorization. That presumes that after the next \nattack Congress will be in a position to act quickly to pass necessary \nauthorizations. I don't think we want to impose that provision.\n  The underlying Intelligence Committee bill provides the same \nexclusive means, directions, and limitations that were in the FISA bill \ninitially.\n  Another problem with the Judiciary Committee bill is that it places a \nprovision in the Intelligence Committee bill that would have allowed \ncollection to continue until the FISA Court of review has--if they had \ngotten an unfavorable ruling from one judge, it allows collection to \ncontinue until the court of review rules on it. This is a real problem \nif there is one unfavorable opinion that might put us deaf to \ncollections that are necessary.\n  The Intelligence Committee determined that anything except an \nautomatic stay through the FISA Court of review could jeopardize our \nintelligence collection. This was already a compromise from the full \nautomatic stay that was in the Protect America Act.\n  Next, the substitute would impose unreasonable new restrictions on \nthe use of foreign intelligence information, including information not \nconcerning U.S. persons, obtained or derived from acquisitions using \ntargeting procedures that the FISA Court found to be deficient in some \nmanner, throwing out vital terrorist information because we didn't \nprotect the constitutional rights or there were some procedural flaws \nin targeting a foreign terrorist in a foreign land.\n  It creates a superexclusionary rule in the foreign intelligence arena \nthat is at odds with the 9/11 Commission's mandate for the intelligence \ncommunity to find and link disparate pieces of foreign intelligence \ninformation.\n  Read what they said. It was important. They said we are not sharing \ninformation, and we need to share information within the community if \nwe are going to have a chance to prevent the next 9/11.\n  On reverse targeting, the substitute changes the bright-line reverse \ntargeting provision in S. 2248 to a new rule that changes ``the \npurpose'' to ``a significant purpose.'' This change is a significant \nconcern to the DNI and DOJ. They told us it creates so much uncertainty \nin the appropriate legal standard for collection, and it may confuse \nanalysts trying to follow the standards. This could inadvertently lead \nto less robust intelligence collection.\n  Under the bulk collection, while the new substitute modifies the bulk \ncollection prohibition in the original Judiciary Committee substitute, \nit doesn't solve the problem. This provision could have significant \nunintended operational consequences, and it is unnecessary given \nrestrictions in S. 2248 about intentionally targeting persons in the \nUnited States.\n  As I said, for example, if a general is about to order troops into \nFallujah, this prohibition could impede the ability of the intelligence \ncommunity to listen to calls coming into and out of that city without a \ncourt order.\n  The FISA Court would be commanded, under the Judiciary Committee's \nsubstitute, to assess compliance with minimization procedures used for \nthe acquisition of foreign intelligence information from individuals \noutside the United States. As I reported earlier in my floor speech, \nthere is a FISA Court opinion, In Re: Motion For Release, December 11, \nstating:\n\n       The Court recognizes the executive branch has the expertise \n     in national security, and the Court should not be making \n     judgments as to which particular surveillance unit should be \n     conducted.\n\n  Finally, it replaces a 6-year sunset with a 4-year sunset. As the \nSenator from Massachusetts said, this bill ought to be reviewed \ncontinually. Exactly. That is what the intelligence community should \ndo. We should not have a provision that would sunset the authority for \nour collection of vital information. But we should have continuing \noversight which the Intelligence Committees have provided and will \ncontinue to provide to make sure that collection is proceeding in a \nmanner consistent with the Constitution, with the laws, and the \nregulations overseeing it.\n\n  We provide a robust oversight of the NSA collection. That collection \nmust be done in a manner consistent with the guidelines that Congress \nhas laid down, the Constitution has laid down, and the administration \nhas laid down. If there is any problem with that, then it is up to the \nIntelligence Committees of both Houses to bring before the Congress, if \nwe cannot correct it by interceding with the people in the agency, a \nbill to change it.\n  I see my chairman, Senator Rockefeller, is here. I will be glad to \nyield the remaining 3 minutes of my time to the distinguished chairman \nof the committee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri controls 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Vermont controls 14 minutes.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to \ndescribe to the Senate my views on the amendment reported by the \nJudiciary Committee, and why I will be opposing the amendment when we \nvote at 2.\n  First, I wish to repeat a few comments I made in my opening remarks \nwhen we debated the motion to proceed to S. 2248 in December.\n  From the beginning of the Senate's consideration of foreign \nintelligence surveillance legislation in 1976, the resulting law--the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978--has been the joint \nresponsibility of both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. FISA \nis, after all, a law that concerns both intelligence collection and \njudicial proceedings.\n  The bill now before the Senate, S. 2248, was reported to the Senate \nby the Intelligence Committee last October, and then sequentially \nreported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee in November.\n  As a parliamentary matter, the measure as reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee is the pending amendment to the bill reported by the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I agree with a number of the recommendations of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I have been pleased to work with members of the Judiciary \nCommittee on modifications that address particular concerns that had \nbeen raised by the administration.\n  I will accordingly support individual amendments to add those \nrecommendations, as modified when necessary, to S. 2248. These include \na strengthened exclusivity provision, a 4-year sunset, court review of \ncompliance with minimization procedures, and an inspectors general \nreport on the President's warrantless surveillance program in order to \nensure there is a comprehensive historical record of that experience.\n  While I support many aspects of the Judiciary amendment, I cannot \nagree with recommendations of the Judiciary Committee that may have an \nadverse impact on U.S. intelligence collection or collection analysis, \nand that are not warranted by a realistic concern about U.S. privacy \ninterests.\n  If any of those provisions are offered as individual amendments, I \nwill, of course, study them, but must reserve the right to oppose them.\n  I will illustrate my concern by describing two provisions of the \nJudiciary amendment.\n  The Judiciary Committee substitute contains a ``significant purpose'' \nrequirement. This has been described as a way to prevent reverse \ntargeting--that is, conducting surveillance of a person overseas when \nthe real target of the surveillance is a person within the United \nStates.\n  The Intelligence Committee bill already explicitly codifies the \nexisting prohibition on reverse targeting. What the Judiciary Committee \nsubstitute actually does is turn the reverse targeting prohibition on \nits head. I fear it would impose a new affirmative requirement that the \ngovernment must seek a FISA Court order when in the course of targeting \na foreign person outside the United States the government incidentally \ncollects the communications of U.S. persons.\n  This is unworkable and would create untenable gaps in our \nintelligence coverage without significantly enhancing the privacy of \nAmericans. Incidental communications with or about Americans should be \nhandled properly, through minimization--a process that\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\nis strengthened in our bill. But the fact that there may also be a \nforeign intelligence interest when a foreign target is in contact with \nthe United States should not be the cause of making it more difficult \nto undertake the surveillance of the foreign target.\n  The Judiciary Amendment also includes a provision altering the \nconsequences of a FISA Court determination that there is a deficiency \nin the Government's targeting or minimization procedures under the new \nforeign targeting authority that will be enacted in S. 2248. Upon such \na court determination, the Intelligence Committee bill would require \nthe Government to either correct the deficiency or cease new \nacquisition.\n  The Judiciary Committee provision goes beyond the requirement that \ndeficiencies be corrected or new acquisitions ceased. It would take the \nfurther step of preventing all use of information already acquired \nunder the new procedure that concerns U.S. persons, unless the Attorney \nGeneral determines that the information indicates a threat of death or \nserious bodily harm.\n  The provision is impractical. And it creates risks that we will lose \nvaluable intelligence.\n  The Judiciary Committee provision would require intelligence analysts \nto go through all of the intelligence that had been collected under the \nnew process--presumably a very large collection of materials--to \nidentify information that might be subject to the restriction and make \nsure that it had been not used in disseminated intelligence.\n  Even for minor deficiencies in procedures, this provision would \ntherefore require the Intelligence Community to discard information \nthat might constitute significant intelligence, and to focus its \nanalytical resources on satisfying this provision rather than \ncollecting and analyzing new intelligence. In my view, this allocation \nof resources makes no sense.\n  At the end of our debate this morning, the Senate will be asked to \nvote on the pending Judiciary Committee amendment as a whole, either by \nway of a tabling motion or directly on the amendment.\n  Although, as I have indicated, there are parts of the Judiciary \namendment that I look forward to supporting, there are two reasons, \nwith all respect to the members of the Judiciary Committee, why I \ncannot support the pending substitute amendment as a whole.\n  The first is that the form, and consequently the effect of the \namendment, goes beyond what the members of the Judiciary Committee \ndecided during their deliberations, and guts key parts of S. 2248 \nbeyond any reasons agreed to by a majority of the Judiciary Committee.\n  S. 2248 has two substantive titles, in addition to a third title on \ntransition procedures.\n  The first title addresses intelligence collection; it is the direct \nreplacement of the Protect America Act.\n  The second title addresses the many lawsuits against telephone and \ninternet companies for their alleged cooperation with the Government.\n  At its markup, the Judiciary Committee rejected, by a clear 7-to-12 \nvote, an amendment to strike title II on liability protection. \nPreviously, the Intelligence Committee had voted against striking title \nII by a 3-to-12 vote. In short, while there may be good ideas, that \ncertainly merit debate, about improving title II, there has not been \nmajority support in the Senate for striking it.\n  Yet, notwithstanding the lack of support in either the Judiciary or \nIntelligence Committee for striking title II, the form in which the \nJudiciary Committee reported its amendment would do just that.\n  We will welcome a debate about improving title II, but on behalf of \nthe Intelligence Committee--which voted overwhelmingly for title II--I \nmust defend keeping title II in the base text before the Senate. For \nthat reason alone, I must oppose the Judiciary amendment, even as I \nsupport individual elements of it.\n  Second, as I have previously mentioned, even with respect to title I, \nthere are portions of the Judiciary amendment that I must oppose on the \nground that they will have an adverse impact on intelligence collection \nor the use of intelligence that is not warranted by a realistic concern \nabout U.S. privacy interests.\n  Accordingly, with great respect for my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I will vote against the Judiciary amendment. I also look \nforward to joining them in urging the adoption of specific amendments \nto improve the Intelligence Committee bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, obviously I disagree with the description \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee's amendment. I spoke on this \nyesterday, but I am going to take a few minutes to describe what is in \nthe Judiciary Committee's bill.\n  I support the Judiciary Committee amendment to the FISA Amendments \nAct of 2007. The Judiciary Committee amendment would make important \nimprovements to the Intelligence Committee bill, at the same time \nmaintaining its structure and its authority.\n  The so-called Protect America Act was rushed through the Senate last \nsummer in an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. We even saw a key \nmember of the administration make commitments to numerous Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats, on that bill and then break his word, first \nto us and then on national television.\n  It was a bad bill that has provided sweeping new powers to the \nGovernment. It imposes no checks on the Government and provides no \noversight or protection for Americans' privacy.\n  The Intelligence Committee did important work last fall in crafting a \nbill that begins to walk back from the excesses of the Protect America \nAct. I commend both Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond for that. But \ntwo committees in the Senate have jurisdiction over FISA the \nIntelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee.\n  The Intelligence Committee acted first to establish a good structure \nfor conducting critical overseas surveillance. The Judiciary \nCommittee's amendment maintains that structure and the authority for \nsurveillance. But in my view and in the view of many Senators, the \nIntelligence Committee bill does not do enough to protect the rights of \nAmericans. Indeed, many members of the Intelligence Committee voted for \nthat bill knowing that the Judiciary Committee would have an \nopportunity to improve it, and they expected us to do that.\n  FISA is among the most important pieces of legislation this Congress \nhas passed. It is there to provide a mechanism to conduct surveillance, \nit is critical to our security, but also protect the privacy and civil \nliberties of all Americans.\n  Let's be clear, this new authority expands FISA to allow more \nflexibility to conduct surveillance. If we are going to expand \nsurveillance, we have to take great care to protect American civil \nliberties, and that is what the Judiciary Committee adds.\n  I praise the members who serve on both the Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees--Senators Feinstein, Feingold, and Whitehouse, who \ncontributed so much to the Judiciary Committee's efforts to improve \nthis legislation. These Senators and others on the Judiciary Committee \nworked hard to craft amendments that preserve the basic structure and \nauthority in the bill reported by the Select Committee on Intelligence, \nwhile adding crucial protections for Americans.\n  The Judiciary Committee bill makes about 12 changes to the \nIntelligence Committee bill. Let me address a few of them.\n  First, the Judiciary Committee bill contains a very strong \nexclusivity provision. This provision makes clear that the Government \ncannot claim authority to operate outside the law--outside of FISA--\nfrom measures that were never intended to provide such exceptional \nauthority.\n  This administration argues that the Authorization for the Use of \nMilitary Force, passed after September 11, provided the justification \nfor conducting warrantless surveillance of Americans for more than five \nyears. No, what it did was authorize going into Afghanistan to get \nOsama bin Laden--the man who masterminded the attacks on 9/11. Not only \ndid the administration fail to do that, it took our troops out of \nAfghanistan--when they had bin Laden cornered--to invade Iraq.\n  When we authorized going after Osama bin Laden, we did not authorize \nexplicitly or implicitly the warrantless\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\nwiretapping of Americans. Yet this administration still clings to this \nphony legal argument. The Judiciary Committee bill would prevent that \ndangerous contention with strong language reaffirming that FISA is the \nexclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance for foreign \nintelligence purposes. The Senate Intelligence Committee's bill would \ndo nothing to preclude the AUMF argument in the future.\n  We also provide a more meaningful role for the FISA Court in this new \nsurveillance. This court is a critical independent check on Government \nexcess in the sensitive area of electronic surveillance.\n  The fundamental purpose of many of the Judiciary Committee changes is \nto ensure that this important independent check remains meaningful, \nwhile maintaining the flexibility of ``blanket'' orders, which we all \nagree are necessary. The Intelligence Committee bill would give the \nFISA Court only a very limited role in overseeing surveillance.\n  The Judiciary Committee bill would give the FISA Court the authority \nit needs to assess the Government's compliance with minimization \nprocedures. It would allow the Court to request additional information \nfrom the Government, and allow the Court to enforce compliance with its \norders. The amendment would also give the court discretion to impose \nrestrictions on the use and dissemination of Americans' information if \nit is collected unlawfully.\n  The Judiciary bill would make other important changes. It reduces the \nsunset for this new law from 6 years to 4 years. This was Senator \nCardin's amendment. There is too much here that is new and untested to \nallow the authorities go longer than even the next President's term \nbefore requiring a thorough review. It clarifies that the bill does not \nallow bulk collection that would simply sweep up all calls into and out \nof the United States. It also clarifies that the Government may not use \nthis new authority to target Americans indirectly if they are not \nallowed to do it directly. The administration says it would never do \nthis. They have no credibility. The Judiciary Committee's bill would \nmake sure they keep their word.\n\n  Finally, the Judiciary Committee bill includes a requirement that \ninspectors general, including the Department of Justice inspector \ngeneral, conduct a thorough review of the so-called Terrorist \nSurveillance Program and report back to the Congress and, to the extent \nit can in an unclassified version, to the American people.\n  The Department of Justice inspector general will have the \nresponsibility to look at, among other things, the process at the \nDepartment of Justice that limited knowledge and review of important \nlegal decisions to a tiny group of like-minded individuals, at great \ncost to the rule of law and American values. This is a key measure that \nwould finally require accountability for this administration. We have \nnot yet had anything close to a comprehensive examination of what \nhappened and how it happened. We cannot expect to learn from mistakes \nif we refuse to allow them to be examined.\n  I strongly oppose a provision in the Intelligence Committee bill that \nwould grant blanket retroactive immunity to telecommunications carriers \nfor their warrantless surveillance activities from 2001 through earlier \nthis year. That provision goes even beyond the so-called Protect \nAmerica Act. It would insulate this administration from accountability \nfor its lawbreaking. The Judiciary Committee bill does not have that \nprovision. I know that will be a separate debate on this floor.\n  With the authority of a majority of the Judiciary Committee members, \nI made a few changes to the amendment as we reported it in November. \nThere are no major additions or deletions. The original 12 changes are \nstill there. The revised version makes some changes to address \ntechnical issues and concerns the administration raised about our \nsubstitute. We have considered the Statement of Administration Policy \nfrom last December and we have talked with the administration. We have \nlistened and made changes that we think address some legitimate \nconcerns.\n  For example, we have revised the exclusivity provision. The provision \nin the earlier version of the Judiciary Committee amendment could have \nbeen read to extend the scope of FISA in a way that was not intended. \nWe corrected that.\n  Another concern we addressed was about the issue of staying FISA \nCourt decisions pending appeal. The Intelligence Committee bill would \nautomatically stay FISA Court decisions, thereby requiring possibly \nillegal surveillance to continue throughout a lengthy appeal process. \nThe original Judiciary Committee amendment left the decision about a \nstay to the discretion of the FISA Court judges--which is how it is \ntypically done in courts. The administration was concerned that this \nleft too much power to stop surveillance in the hands of a lone judge. \nWe listened and made a change that would permit the stay decision to be \nmade--promptly--by a panel of the FISA Court of Review.\n  Another change we made to address an administration concern was the \nimportant IG audit provision. That provision now makes it clear that no \ndepartment inspector general has the authority to conduct a review of \nanother department.\n  These revisions make the Judiciary Committee's product stronger. I \nthink overall the Judiciary Committee's bill dramatically improves the \nIntelligence Committee bill. As the distinguished chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee said, we included a number of items he supports. \nIf this gets voted down, these are changes that Senators will have to \noffer piece by piece, and will. Most of it will be germane after \ncloture. If we really want to conclude this FISA debate quickly, \nadopting this amendment will save the Senate countless hours of debate. \nI urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Now, Mr. President, \nwhat is the parliamentary situation?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 2 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me just talk about this a little bit.\n  Incidentally, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BOND. I am going to offer a motion to table, but yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we all want to be able to collect \nintelligence on terrorists. When I came here, during the Cold War, we \nwanted to be sure we could collect on our adversaries. We still want to \nbe sure we can do that. That is why I have voted for dozens of changes \nto FISA over the years, requested by both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. I voted for them because the administrations made a \nclear and convincing case each time that we needed a change to keep up \nwith the technology or to keep up with a changing threat.\n  But let's not be so frightened by terrorists that we go back to the \nsituation we had during the Watergate era, when we found our Government \nwas spying on people who disagreed with it. The government spied on \npeople who had legitimate concerns about, for example, the war in \nVietnam or the excesses of J. Edgar Hoover. The government could do \nthat back then because there were no checks and there was no oversight. \nWe do not want to go back to that time. We can do our intelligence \ngathering and protect Americans at the same time.\n  Now, Mr. President, has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is that the only time anybody has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to table, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the Judiciary \nCommittee substitute, as modified. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton)\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\nand the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Graham) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb).

I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there will be an amendment offered by \nSenators Rockefeller and Bond. It is a substitute that will be pending \nfor a while. What we are going to try to do over here, I have spoken to \na number of Members who want to offer amendments relating to title I. \nWe are working out an order in which they will be offered. What we \nwould like to do is have a number of them offered, debated, and have a \ntime this afternoon that we can vote on all of them in succession. We \nwill try to finish all the title I amendments, and then we will move to \ntitle II. We hope there isn't a lot of time spent on each amendment, \nbut Members have a right to take whatever time they want. In an effort \nto make this more understandable, rather than jumping back and forth, \ntitle I and title II, on this side we will try to offer amendments as \nthey relate to title I.\n  We understand there is no requirement to do this. But if there are \namendments the minority wants to offer, we will certainly be \ncooperative and make sure we have the ability to go back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and I call up amendment----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin has been very \npatient. As soon as Senators Rockefeller and Bond finish offering their \nsubstitute, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feingold have the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will object momentarily. I wish to discuss the \nmatter with the majority leader. Let's have Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Bond go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3911\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Bond and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for \n     himself and Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 3911.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the distinguished vice chairman, \nSenator Bond, and I have joined in a bipartisan amendment to S. 2248, \nthe FISA Amendments Act of 2008. The Rockefeller-Bond amendment \nperfects various details of the underlying bill but its main purpose is \nto provide explicit statutory protection, for the first time in the 30 \nyears of FISA, for Americans who are outside the United States.\n  The amendment stands for the simple proposition that Americans, \nwhether they are working, studying, traveling or serving in our Armed \nForces outside the United States, do not lose their rights as Americans \nwhen it comes to the actions of their own Government. In 1791, when the \nBill of Rights was ratified, including, of course, the fourth \namendment, which protects our people from unreasonable search and \nseizure, there were 4 million Americans. That was it. Now that very \nnumber of Americans, 4 million, lives outside the United States and, of \ncourse, many millions more travel each year outside the United States.\n  Because this amendment is so important and because it has gone \nthrough so much development to reach the point at which we have now \narrived, I would like to take, frankly, a few minutes to describe its \norigin and evolution, with the forbearance of my colleagues.\n  The protection of Americans outside the United States may have been \nthe single most important piece of business left undone by the original \nFISA statute created in 1978. To fill that void, President Reagan \nissued an executive order, Executive Order 12333, that addresses the \nuse of intelligence techniques such as electronic surveillance or \nunconsented searches against Americans abroad.\n  Executive Order 12333 requires that intelligence agencies have \nprocedures and that those procedures protect the constitutional rights \nof Americans overseas. It also requires the Attorney General to \ndetermine that there is probable cause to conclude that the American \noverseas is an agent of a foreign power before the U.S. Government \nundertakes electronic surveillance or conducts searches abroad against \nthat person. That was good but insufficient. In our country of laws, we \ndo not usually leave it, outside of an emergency, to any Attorney \nGeneral to decide alone whether there is probable cause for a search. \nThat is a decision which we entrust to neutral judges.\n  Our bipartisan amendment--Senator Bond's and mine--makes sure \nAmericans do not lose that important protection by setting foot outside \nthe United States.\n  Vice Chairman Bond and I took the first step when we included, in our \nOctober Intelligence Committee mark, a provision concerning acquisition \nby the intelligence community of the communications of U.S. persons \nabroad.\n  We focused our proposal on the circumstance when the Government is \nseeking those communications from electronic communication providers \nwithin the United States. We did not address the targeting of U.S. \npersons overseas by intelligence community collection methods that are \nemployed outside the United States.\n  The provision before the Intelligence Committee in its October markup \nwould have allowed the Attorney General to determine that a U.S. person \noutside the United States was a foreign power, agent of a foreign \npower, or an officer or employee of a foreign power, and then target \nthat person for collection. Under our proposal, the Attorney General \nwould then have been required to submit that probable cause \ndetermination to the FISA Court for review.\n  But as the chairmen and ranking members of committees sometimes learn \nfrom their full membership of\n\n[[Page S257]]\n\ntheir committees, important ideas may require broad solutions.\n  During our committee markup, Senator Wyden offered an amendment on \ntargeting U.S. persons abroad that substituted two new sections in \nplace of the language described above on targeting U.S. persons abroad.\n  First, the Wyden amendment required the Government to obtain a \nstandard FISA order for electronic surveillance--known as a title I \norder--before the Government could target U.S. persons outside the \nUnited States by seeking their communications from providers in the \nUnited States.\n  Thus, rather than the new procedure described in our chairman and \nvice chairman mark, the amendment required a title I FISA application \nand order whenever the collection against an American abroad occurred \nwith the assistance of a provider in the United States.\n  Second, the Wyden amendment required that the Government, when acting \noutside the United States, obtain a FISA Court order before targeting \nthe communications of U.S. persons located outside the United States.\n  Specifically, it required a FISA Court order that there was probable \ncause to believe that the U.S. person who was the target of \nsurveillance was, in fact, a foreign power or an agent of a foreign \npower before the Government employed surveillance techniques outside \nthe United States. This second part of the Wyden amendment implemented \nan entirely new concept of law.\n  A court order has never before been required for foreign intelligence \ncollection that is conducted entirely outside the United States, even \nif that collection involves U.S. persons. But while new, it quickly \nbecame evident it was an idea whose time had come. The Wyden amendment \npassed the committee with a vote of 9 to 6.\n  Yet, as often is the case for an initial amendment of such magnitude, \nit was also immediately clear that further work needed to be done \nbefore the proposal became law to make sure it worked well in practice.\n  During the markup, Senator Whitehouse, who is a member of the \nJudiciary Committee--and in his first year in this body has already \nemerged as a leading legal voice among us--stated he would be willing \nto work on the language of the amendment in the Judiciary Committee, on \nwhich he also serves, during the sequential referral process to ensure \nthat it achieved its desired goal and did not result in unintended \ndecreases in collection.\n  Senator Whitehouse, working with the Department of Justice, was \nlargely responsible for the changes made to the provision on U.S. \npersons outside the United States that is included in the Judiciary \nCommittee substitute amendment. It is a good amendment.\n  He focused his efforts to changes on the second part of the section, \nthe portion relating to collection of electronic communications outside \nthe United States. The provision requiring a traditional FISA \nelectronic surveillance application for collection inside the United \nStates remained mostly unchanged in the Judiciary Committee markup.\n  The Judiciary Committee amendment makes some necessary technical \nfixes to the section on collection outside the United States. It \nstressed that the FISA Court would only be permitted to assess the \nquestion of probable cause for collection outside the United States, \nnot the methods of acquisition of the information, as any such inquiry \nmight delve into very sensitive intelligence matters.\n  The Judiciary Committee section on collection outside the United \nStates also made three other important changes:\n  First, the addition of emergency procedures, similar to those \nincluded in other parts of FISA, that would allow the Attorney General \nto acquire the information as long as a subsequent order is obtained; \nsecond, a more explicit, individualized review of minimization \nprocedures; and, third, the addition of procedures to transition \ncurrent acquisitions under Executive Order 12333 over to the new \nprocedure.\n  The managers' amendment, offered by Senator Bond and myself, now \nseeks to complete this process by fully integrating the new procedure \ninto the overall reforms contained in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 \nand does so in a manner that maintains an effective system of \nintelligence collection.\n  In the course of doing that, we have sought to resolve, in \nconjunction with the Department of Justice and the intelligence \ncommunity, several problems identified with the Judiciary Committee \nsubstitute.\n  The most significant changes in the managers' amendment have been \nmade to the first part of the Wyden amendment: the requirement that the \nGovernment obtain standard electronic surveillance--title I--orders for \nthe targeting of U.S. persons abroad that occurs within the United \nStates.\n  That provision, as of this moment, remains a part of our base bill \nand will remain so until an amendment is adopted. As I will discuss in \nmore detail, our proposed changes are required because the language of \nthis provision, as reported out of both the Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees, would prevent certain types of important foreign \nintelligence collection.\n  First, the definition ``agent of a foreign power'' in FISA, which \nrequires a U.S. person to have engaged in certain types of wrongdoing, \nis different than the definition of ``agent of a foreign power'' that \nhas traditionally been used in overseas collection against Americans.\n\n  The Director of National Intelligence has therefore proposed, and we \nagree, that collection against a U.S. person abroad should be expanded \nbeyond ``agent of a foreign power'' to ``an officer or employee of a \nforeign power,'' to cover the types of collection that have \ntraditionally been allowed against U.S. persons overseas.\n  For example, the notorious Charles Taylor, the former President of \nLiberia, who is now charged with crimes against humanity, is an \nAmerican who was an officer of a foreign power.\n  Second, the Judiciary Committee provision did not deal with the issue \nof stored electronic communications or stored electronic data, the \ncollection of which is dealt with under title III rather than title I \nof FISA and which are an important part of the acquisition system that \nis established by the new title VII that S. 2248 will add to FISA.\n  To address this issue, the managers' amendment that Senator Bond and \nI are proposing, after extensive technical consultations with the \nintelligence community and the Department of Justice, adds two sections \nto the new title VII in our committee's bill, and, in so doing, \naddresses the intelligence collection concerns identified by the \nDirector of National Intelligence.\n  By placing all the relevant detail for collection against U.S. \npersons overseas in the same new title of FISA--title VII--that \nincludes all other procedures for persons outside the United States, \nthe managers' amendment provides a comprehensive, consolidated roadmap \nfor all those in the intelligence community, the Department of Justice, \nand the FISA Court who will have the responsibility to implement our \namendment.\n  In conclusion, I would like to underscore some major points.\n  As is evident from everything I have described, it is important to \nthank two members of our committee for their work on this issue of \ntargeting Americans overseas.\n  Senator Wyden, obviously, is one of those. I wish to recognize his \nleadership at all times in this area. He recognized the importance of \nthe issue and successfully offered an amendment at the Intelligence \nCommittee mark-up that broadened the protections contained in our bill.\n  Senator Whitehouse has been indispensable contributor to the effort \non this provision as well, quietly working out problems and making \nthings work better. His work goes a long way toward ensuring that the \nprovision can be successfully implemented by the intelligence \ncommunity, which is key.\n  By adopting this amendment on a bipartisan basis, the Intelligence \nCommittee--and now the vice chairman and myself in our managers' \namendment--seek to ensure that Americans are protected from unwarranted \nsurveillance, whether they are inside or outside the United States.\n  This is a significant new protection for U.S. persons. When the \nUnited States conducts foreign intelligence collection overseas on a \nU.S. person located outside the United States, currently only the \nAttorney General, not a court, makes a probable cause determination. I \nhave said that. U.S. citizens have never before been entitled by\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\nstatute to court protection in this area. Now, hopefully, they will be.\n  Our bipartisan goal is clear: A court must be involved when U.S. \npersons are targeted for surveillance, no matter where those persons \nare located or how they are targeted.\n  We are also in agreement that our original committee provision and \nthe work of the Judiciary Committee needed refinement to ensure it did \nnot have unintended consequences that might limit the collection of \nforeign intelligence information. The purpose of our amendment is to \nmake sure we do not reduce the scope of any current intelligence \ncollection.\n  Our managers' amendment accomplishes this goal. Under the managers' \namendment, if a U.S. person is targeted overseas by using a \ncommunications provider within the United States, FISA will now require \nthat the Government submit an application to the FISA Court and obtain \na FISA Court order. Although the process to obtain the order is \ntailored to address some of the operational concerns relevant to the \nissue of collection on U.S. persons located outside the United States, \nand consolidated in a new title of FISA, the procedures are as robust \nand protective of the privacy rights of U.S. persons as existing FISA \nprocedures.\n  If the acquisition occurs outside the United States, FISA will now \nrequire that the FISA Court issue an order finding that there is \nprobable cause to believe the U.S. person who is the target of the \nacquisition is an agent, officer or employee of a foreign power, \nwithout involving the FISA Court in the methods of overseas collection.\n  Those methods of overseas collection will continue to be governed by \napplicable executive branch directives, such as Executive Order 12333, \nwhich impose limits on intelligence agencies in order to protect the \nconstitutional rights and other legal rights of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his extensive \ndiscussion of this measure. This is one of the significant additions we \nare making to the preexisting FISA law. It is something that was \nbrought up and discussed in the committee. There was general agreement \nthat an American or a U.S. person who goes abroad ought to be provided \nsome form of protection. We discussed it at length.\n  The objective was provided in a very brief statement in the amendment \nthat appeared before the committee. I was very concerned about it \nbecause I knew just enough about the FISA law to be thoroughly confused \nabout how it would work. I voted against it but expressed my desire and \nwillingness to work with the sponsor of this amendment and the other \nmembers of the committee because it was a good idea.\n  Well, we found out how complicated it is to amend and to change the \nFISA law because of the many working parts, not only within the law but \nwithin the actual means of interception.\n  Well, we worked for better than a month on a bipartisan basis with \nthe proponents of this measure--and I consider myself a proponent of \nthis measure--with the intelligence community, lawyers for the \nDepartment of Justice, and we came up with a simple little 25-page \nstatutory provision. It is now included in the managers' amendment.\n  Should anyone think it is simple to amend FISA, I suggest you begin \nreading at page 5 of the measure before us, and read through page 29, I \nbelieve it is, to show how it is accomplished. Nevertheless, this puts \nin a new layer of protection for U.S. persons. Obviously, we are \nconcerned. Those are American citizens who are abroad.\n  There were questions raised: Well, if I go abroad, can the \nintelligence community tap my phone without a court order? Well, first \nof all, the intelligence community is not going to be tapping anybody's \nphone or trying to listen in on any--intercept any conversations unless \nthey have good, solid information that that phone is in a terrorist's \nhands. They have to have intel before they even look at that \nconversation. That intel could come in many forms which I won't \ndescribe here, but that--first of all, if you are abroad, you would not \nhave been targeted unless you had certain reasonable connections with a \nterrorist activity or a terrorist who would give the Attorney General \nand the intelligence community the basis for asserting that there was a \nterrorist content to the phone conversation.\n  Now, why do they do this? Because they have more communications than \nthey can handle. They have more terrorist communications almost than it \nis possible to keep up with. The last thing they want to do is target a \nconversation of a U.S. person or an American abroad who doesn't have \nany connection to terrorist activities. So previously, only if there \nwas one of the connections that would give reasonable grounds to lead \nthe Attorney General to say that there was valuable foreign \nintelligence collection would you collect on it. But now, if that is an \nAmerican citizen or, more broadly, a U.S. person, they have to go to \nthe intelligence court, the FISC, to get an order--two different kinds \nof orders depending upon how the collection is going to occur--and get \nan order finding that there is probable cause to believe, as the \nchairman has said, that this person is an agent, officer, employee of a \nforeign power and has foreign intelligence information that may be \ncommunicated.\n  So this is a protection that I hope those concerned about the use of \nelectronic surveillance will understand is a significant step we have \ntaken toward protecting the rights of American citizens. But I point \nout the fact that it took us a month and about 24 or 25 pages to \naccomplish it. But with that being said, I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support it. This is a major new expansion of \nprotection for American citizens, U.S. persons, and this is one of the \nprivacy constitutional right protections added by this bill that was \nnever there before. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3909 to No. 3911\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3909.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3909 to amendment No. 3911.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require that certain records be submitted to Congress)\n\n       Strike subsection (b) of section 103, and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Reports by Attorney General on Certain Other Orders.--\n     Such section 601 is further amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Submissions to Congress.--The Attorney General shall \n     submit to the committees of Congress referred to in \n     subsection (a)--\n       ``(1) a copy of any decision, order, or opinion issued by \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review that includes \n     significant construction or interpretation of any provision \n     of this Act, and any pleadings associated with such decision, \n     order, or opinion, not later than 45 days after such \n     decision, order, or opinion is issued; and\n       ``(2) a copy of any such decision, order, or opinion, and \n     the pleadings associated with such decision, order, or \n     opinion, that was issued during the 5-year period ending on \n     the date of the enactment of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 \n     and not previously submitted in a report under subsection \n     (a).''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDodd be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is a straightforward \nreporting requirement that is critical if Congress is to understand how \nthe foreign intelligence surveillance laws it passes, including this \none, are being interpreted and applied. The issue is very simple. If \nthe FISA Court makes a significant interpretation of the law, I think \nCongress should know about it. Congress can't conduct oversight of \nintelligence unless it knows what the court is and is not permitting \nthe administration to do. Congress can't pass new legislation without \nknowing how the court has interpreted current law.\n  This issue is absolutely fundamental to our constitutional system. \nCongress has a responsibility to understand the impact of the laws it \nis passing. The courts should have the assurance that when they \ninterpret the law, those interpretations will be communicated to the \nlegislature. This isn't some unusual idea; this is how our system of\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\ngovernment has operated from its inception.\n  Specifically, this amendment does two things. First, it requires that \nwhen the court issues an opinion that includes a significant legal \ninterpretation, the Government must provide the Government's pleadings \nassociated with that decision to Congress. Now, these pleadings are \noften critical to understanding the legal interpretations of the court. \nThis is in part because at times the court's opinions merely reference \nand approve the Government's arguments made in those pleadings. So it \nis really necessary to be able to review the pleadings themselves if \nyou are going to understand the court's decision. They are also \nnecessary to understand how the Government interprets and seeks to \nimplement the law.\n  Neither Congress's oversight of the intelligence community nor any \nresponsible legislating in the area of foreign intelligence \nsurveillance can be effective without these documents. Yet, even today, \nas Congress considers this FISA legislation, the administration \ncontinues to refuse to provide Congress with important FISA Court \npleadings.\n  The other reason is this: The amendment requires that the Government \nprovide Congress with FISA Court orders that include significant \ninterpretations of law over the last 5 years. Now, this is necessary \nbecause there was an enormous loophole in previous statutory reporting \nrequirements that would be closed for the first time by this \nIntelligence Committee bill.\n  The Government didn't previously have to provide Congress with \nsignificant interpretations of law if they were included in court \norders rather than court decisions or opinions. But we know from the \nadministration's public announcement in January about the President's \nwiretapping program that such legal interpretations are, in fact, found \nin orders. For Congress to have any sense of how the court has \ninterpreted the FISA statute, therefore, it is critical to understand \nrecent jurisprudence. Congress needs to have access to FISA Court \norders not just going forward but for the past 5 years as well.\n  This is not theoretical. The administration has refused to provide to \nCongress orders containing significant interpretations of law, and that \nis just what we know of. Without this amendment, we might never know \nwhat other important legal interpretations are out there.\n  To be clear, I first offered an amendment to require that FISA Court \norders and other documents be provided to Congress through the \nintelligence authorization bill. It was approved on a bipartisan basis. \nIt was later removed from the authorization bill, and only a watered-\ndown version was included in the Intelligence Committee FISA bill. What \nmy amendment today does is merely put the language back that has \nalready been given the support of a bipartisan majority of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  The most appropriate arrangement for Congress to obtain information \nrelated to the FISA Court would be for the court to provide it \ndirectly, without the involvement of the executive branch. So granting \nthe executive branch any role in an exchange between the two other \nbranches of Government, which is what my amendment actually allows, is, \nin fact, already a compromise.\n  But this amendment is a direct response to the administration's \nassertion that it can withhold FISA Court opinions and documents that \ninclude significant interpretations of law from Congress--not letting \nus read these things. Imagine if the administration tried to keep \nSupreme Court decisions from Congress. Even worse, imagine if the \nadministration tried to keep from Congress a decision like Hamdan v. \nRumsfeld, which rejected the administration's military commissions, \njust as Congress was considering the Military Commissions Act. Congress \nwouldn't stand for it. Yet that is exactly what is happening in the \nworld of intelligence.\n  There are really no serious, substantive reasons to oppose this \namendment. Orders and pleadings will be provided to the Intelligence \nCommittee in a classified and, if necessary, redacted manner, just as \nFISA Court decisions are now. This is the furthest thing from an \nonerous reporting requirement. If there are FISA Court orders that \ninclude significant interpretations of law, Government lawyers \ncertainly know what they are and where to find them.\n  It is sometimes said that intelligence in technical terms ``belongs'' \nto the executive branch. I disagree. But in any case, such an argument \nsimply doesn't apply here. This amendment relates to the documents of \nan article III court. Just last month, that court confirmed in a rare \npublic opinion that it has ``inherent power'' over its own records--in \nother words, they do not belong to the executive branch.\n  Finally, let me stress the scope of the information Congress needs \nbefore it can conduct effective oversight and legislative \nresponsibility.\n  While the public is understandably focused on the FISA Court's \ninvolvement with regard to the President's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram, the FISA Court is actually responsible for interpreting all of \nthe FISA statutes. Now, that includes the electronic surveillance \nissues we are considering here today but also physical searches of \nAmericans' homes and the collection of sensitive business records, \nincluding library and medical records. Just as Congress should know how \nthe Protect America Act and this FISA bill will be interpreted, it \nshould have similar information with regard to the FISA provisions \nrelated to the PATRIOT Act and any other legislation that governs \nsurveillance and affects the rights of Americans.\n  This simple reporting requirement is critical to congressional \noversight, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I support Senator Feingold's amendment to \nprovide Congress with additional materials from the FISA Court to \nenable Congress to conduct more effective oversight. This amendment is \none of the many improvements to the Senate Intelligence bill adopted by \nthe Judiciary Committee and included in the Judiciary Committee's \nsubstitute amendment. Regrettably, that substitute was tabled by the \nfull Senate earlier today. But I urge Senators to reconsider their \nvotes with respect to this simple but critically important reporting \nrequirement.\n  Under current law, semi-annual reporting requirements allow the \ngovernment to wait up to a year before informing the Congress about \nimportant interpretations of law made by the FISA Court. The Senate \nIntelligence bill took a step in the right direction by requiring that \nCongress be provided with the orders, decisions and opinions of the \nFISA Court that include significant interpretation of law within 45 \ndays after they are issued.\n  Senator Feingold's amendment would go a step further to ensure sound \noversight by Congress of the activities of the FISA Court. It would \nrequire that, when the FISA Court issues an opinion containing a \nsignificant legal interpretation, the government must provide Congress \nwith the government's pleadings related to the case. This is critically \nimportant because, where the FISA Court simply adopts the government's \nreasoning in one of its decision, Congress will have no way of knowing \nthe true basis for the court's ruling without access to the \ngovernment's pleadings.\n  The Feingold amendment would also require that Congress now be \nprovided with any significant interpretations of law by the FISA Court \nthat were not provided to Congress over the past 5 years. Access to \npast jurisprudence, as well as current decisions, is critical to \nCongress's understanding of how FISA is being interpreted and \nimplemented.\n  Opponents of this amendment say that it may create additional \n``paperwork.'' But if Congress can be better informed about the \nworkings of the FISA Court--a court Congress created--and can more \neffectively oversee the government's advocacy in that Court, then any \nincremental additional paperwork is clearly in the best interests of \nthe American public. Opponents also say that the pleadings may reveal \nsources and methods, and therefore cannot be turned over to the \nCongress. This is a red herring. As Senator Feingold has stated \nrepeatedly, this amendment is not intended to compel disclosure of this \nkind of information, and nothing in the amendment could be construed to \nchange the time-tested practice of redacting information that could \nreveal sources and methods.\n  I urge all Senators to support the Feingold amendment, and to reject \nany attempts to water down this important reporting requirement by way \nof second-degree amendments.\n\n[[Page S260]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this measure has been considered in the \nIntelligence Committee. I believed it was not necessary to require \nadditional paperwork, but also I think it is important to note that \nsome of the charges made about the powers given to the intelligence \ncommunity are way out of bounds.\n  This measure before us does, in fact, put further constraints on the \nintelligence community. There are powers that exist in both the \nintelligence community and in law enforcement agencies which may not be \naffected here. But to say this offers broad new means of getting into \nbusiness records and other personal effects of individuals--this is a \nbill devoted to electronic surveillance. The reason we needed to do the \nbill on electronic surveillance was the fact that the means of \nelectronic surveillance have changed, and the old FISA law did not \npermit the kind of collection that previously was permitted when \ncommunications outside the United States were by radio rather than by \ncable.\n  The whole purpose of this bill is to ensure that there are procedures \nin place to permit surveillance targeting people reasonably believed to \nbe outside the United States who have connections with terrorist \nactivities, so that they are an agent or an employee or an officer of a \nforeign power and have legitimate foreign intelligence information. \nThat is the test. That is what this does. Arguments about the nature of \nforeign intelligence surveillance should be limited to this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senator from Wisconsin \na question. As I read the amendment, it is silent with respect to the \nability of the administration to--or the appropriate authorities to \nredact material in the interests of protecting their sources and \nmethods. Is it assumed in the amendment that the authority to redact \nwould exist?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Not only is it assumed, but I just stated specifically \non the floor a few minutes ago that it would exist.\n  Mr. KYL. I thought I had heard the Senator indicate that redaction \nwould be permitted, and that is the intent of the amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3916 to Amendment No. 3909\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3916 to amendment No. 3909.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1, line 8, strike all after ``subsection (a)'' \n     through page 2, line 14, and insert the following: ``, with \n     due regard to the protection of the national security of the \n     United States--\n       ``(1) a copy of any decision, order, or opinion issued by \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court of review that includes \n     significant construction or interpretation of any provision \n     of this Act, not later than 45 days after such decision, \n     order, or opinion is issued; and\n       ``(2) a copy of any such decision, order, or opinion that \n     was issued during the 5-year period ending on the date of the \n     enactment of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 and not \n     previously submitted in a report under subsection (a).''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as the sponsor of the first-degree amendment \nhas noted, this was debated and it was adopted on I believe a 10-to-5 \nor 9-to-6 vote in the committee, but we found out there were \nsubstantial problems with this amendment to which the intelligence \ncommunity objected. We modified it to the provisions that are now in \nthe current managers' amendment and the underlying bill.\n  The major problem with this amendment is the pleadings. Pleadings \nhave historically been protected during any litigation involving FISA. \nCongress has only received limited access to certain pleadings, certain \nactions for audit purposes in controlled circumstances.\n  This amendment I have offered incorporates the national security \nprotection, which the author of the underlying amendment suggested, and \nit does provide for the 5 years of back opinions from the FISC. This \ngives the 5 years. We have had semiannual reports from the FISC on all \nof the opinions handed down in the previous 6 months.\n  It is somewhat burdensome, but I have been negotiating with the \nDepartment of Justice lawyers. They say while it is burdensome, this is \nnot objectionable. They prefer not to have it, but the one thing on \nwhich they are standing firm and believe they cannot accept is to \nrequire turning over the pleadings.\n  The pleadings are actually some of the most sensitive intelligence \ninformation we have because in those pleadings the Government has to \ndescribe the facilities to be used, the targets of the collection, the \ninformation, and how the information is going to be collected, who gave \nthem the information, how they got it. This is the ultimate description \nof sources and methods. Any time the sources and methods or the assets \nare disclosed, it is possibly a death sentence to someone who is \nworking with us undercover or as an agent. The Department of Justice \nbelieves this information is so sensitive that it has to be kept \nextremely closely held within the court and the people who must see it \nto issue the order. Without that protection, they believe that our most \nsensitive assets, our means of collection, where the facilities are, \nthe whole framework of our intelligence system could be brought down. \nThe opinions themselves go into legal reasoning; they give the \njustifications. They are the end product of the work of the FISC.\n  What the Department of Justice says the intelligence community is \nunwilling to give is to lay out and submit to Congress the whole list \nof information of sources, methods, facilities, targets, the names of \nassets, or the identification of assets that could result in death for \nthe informant, the agents, or the assets.\n  We have accepted a portion of the amendment proposed by the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin. This accepts another portion, but that final portion is \nobjectionable and is a red line. I urge my colleagues not to support \nthe amendment which turns over the very most secret sources and methods \nwhich the intelligence community cannot afford to share.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the second-degree \namendment. This is a classic example of people hiding behind a tragedy \nin this country to make arguments that have no merit. This argument, \nthat the provision of pleadings, legal arguments by the Government, \nwill somehow compromise sources and methods and bring down the \nintelligence system, has no merit.\n  When the Senator from Arizona asked me specifically whether my \namendment allows for certain sensitive information to be redacted, my \nanswer was yes, and he didn't respond. In fact, I had already stated \nthat in my opening statement. Everything the Senator from Missouri \nreferred to--confidential information, sensitive information about \nindividuals we are going after, critical intelligence--all of that can \nbe redacted. What the Senator wants to help the administration do is \nprevent Members of Congress--and by the way, these are kept classified; \nit is only people who have certain clearances who can see them--from \nseeing the pleadings provided to an article III court. That is the \nbasis for their arguments.\n  As I pointed out in my statement, a lot of times the court just \nrefers to the pleadings in its orders. So if we don't have the \npleadings, we have no idea what the order is about.\n  Listen very carefully because this kind of argument is going to be \nused with regard to every aspect of this bill.\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\nEverything is a red line. I want to tell you something, Mr. President, \nit is not a red line for the duly elected representatives of the people \nof this country in a classified setting to be able to review documents \nfrom a court proceeding. That is a ridiculous notion and disrespectful \nto the United States Congress that has an oversight role.\n  I was involved in the debate, as the Senator from Missouri knows, in \nthe Intelligence Committee. We won fair and square on this vote by a \nmajority bipartisan vote when it was first offered to the Intelligence \nAuthorization bill. Because of various issues and pressures relating to \nother matters, we later had to compromise, and ultimately they said, \nwhy don't you do it on the FISA bill, which is exactly what I am doing. \nBut the idea that somehow this endangers America to allow certain \nMembers of Congress and a few staff members who have been cleared to \nlook at the pleadings of the Government in a court proceeding takes \nthis way too far.\n  There are no substantive arguments against doing this, and I urge \nSenators to reject the second-degree amendment and adopt the underlying \namendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \nmanagers' amendment, as offered earlier by the distinguished chairman \nand vice chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to commend the distinguished \nchairman of the committee and the distinguished vice chairman because \nthey have worked with me many hours on this issue. It is an \nextraordinarily important issue as it relates to the rights of \nAmericans in the digital age, and I appreciate the involvement the \nchairman and vice chairman have had with me on this matter.\n  What this debate is all about, and I know it is very hard to follow \nthe complicated legal language that is associated with this discussion, \nis the proposition that Americans ought to have the same rights \noverseas that they have inside the United States. Now, the chairman and \nthe vice chairman have worked with me through the last few weeks to \nensure that we can embed this basic proposition in this FISA \nlegislation and do it in a way that is not going to have any unintended \nconsequences or any impact on our national security.\n  I have long felt, literally for decades, that the FISA law has \nrepresented the ultimate balance between America's need to fight \nterrorism ferociously and to protect the constitutional rights of our \npeople, and it is a balance that should not be eliminated because an \nAmerican leaves U.S. soil. It ought to always mean something to be an \nAmerican, and that ought to apply even outside the United States. Now, \nunder current law, before conducting surveillance on an American \ncitizen within the United States, the Government must establish \nprobable cause before a criminal court for law enforcement cases or \nbefore the FISA Court for intelligence cases.\n  So what this means is the U.S. Government needs a court-approved \nwarrant to deliberately tap the phone conversations of a person living \nin Medford, OR; or Kansas City, MO; or Arlington, VA; or anywhere else. \nThis protection, however, is not extended to Americans who are outside \nthe United States. So if the U.S. Government wants to deliberately tap \nthe phone conversations of the same Americans on business in India or \nserving their country in Iraq, the Attorney General can personally \napprove the surveillance by making his own unilateral determination of \nprobable cause.\n  During the Senate Intelligence Committee's consideration of \nlegislation that would revise FISA, I offered the amendment that has \nbeen discussed by the distinguished chairman and the vice chairman to \nrequire the Government to secure a warrant from the FISA Court before \ntargeting an American overseas.\n  This amendment was cosponsored by our colleagues, the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Feingold, and the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nWhitehouse. It was, as the chairman of the committee has noted, \napproved on a bipartisan basis. It has largely been incorporated into \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee approach as well.\n  Since then the administration has raised concerns about this issue. \nThere have been concerns raised by several others. And we have sought \nto address those through many hours of negotiations so that we can make \nsure in the digital age, when Americans travel so frequently, we are \nnot seeing their rights go in the trash can when they travel outside \nU.S. soil.\n  We have almost reached a final agreement on this important issue, but \nI wanted to take just a minute. I see the distinguished chairman on the \nSenate floor and the distinguished vice chairman. I would like to just \noutline very briefly for them what my remaining concern is because my \nhope is we can work this out.\n  I would also like to say that throughout this day the Justice \nDepartment, as we have been looking at it, has been talking to our \nstaffs as well. I think they have been very cooperative also.\n  The issue that is outstanding, I would say to my colleagues, is the \nmanagers' amendment does not require the Government to specify what \nfacilities it is targeting, even in situations where the Government has \nhistorically been required to do so. So one automatically thinks of a \nhypothetical kind of situation that goes something like this: Under \ncurrent law, the Government has to specify, for example, that it is \ngoing to do surveillance on an apartment dweller on a military base \noverseas. That is something that has to be approved with specificity, \nand that is required under current law.\n  What I am troubled about is the hypothetical possibility. That is \nwhat we are dealing with now, hypothetical possibilities. And if the \nlanguage is not written carefully with respect to facilities--and my \nconcern is that it has not yet been dealt with adequately--the \nGovernment could, in effect, do surveillance on that military base for \nall of the apartment dwellers in the building or conceivably all of the \npeople on the military base at large.\n  Now, my friend, the distinguished vice chairman of the committee, \nclearly does not want to see that happen, nor does the chairman of the \nfull committee. So what I have been trying to do, and had some \ndiscussion with the Justice Department about, is to try to persuade the \nJustice Department to take the precise language they have found \nacceptable in title I and move it over to the title VII that we have \nall been working on in a cooperative kind of fashion. It deals with \nwhat is called the after acquisition issue, to again make sure we are \nable to stay on top of the serious threats our country faces but not at \nthe same time overreach and sweep all kinds of individuals like, say, \nan apartment dweller on a military base oversees into a surveillance \nprogram.\n  So I am going to continue, and I want to make this clear to the vice \nchairman who is on the Senate floor, and the chairman who has had to \nleave the floor for a few minutes, that I want to continue to work with \nthem. This is an important issue. In the digital age, it makes no sense \nfor Americans' rights and freedoms to be limited by physical geography. \nThat is what we got bipartisan support for in the Intelligence \nCommittee. Suffice it to say, there is a history of support for this \nkind of approach. During the initial consideration of the first FISA \nAct back in 1978, many Members of Congress argued for the inclusion of \nprotections for Americans overseas.\n  All of the committees that debated the bill noted the significance of \nthe issue. But at that time there was a judgment made that it was best \nto deal with this matter by separate legislation.\n  For example, the Senate Intelligence Committee in the 1978 report on \nFISA stated:\n\n       Further legislation may be necessary to protect the rights \n     of Americans abroad from the improper electronic surveillance \n     by their Government.\n\n  It seems to me, 30 years later, it is time to take action. So we are \ngoing to continue these discussions. I want to\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\nexpress my appreciation to the vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee and his staff. They have put many hours into this matter \nworking with us and clearly have sought to make sure that we can \nmodernize this particular part of the FISA statute, and do it without \nwhat all of us have said are the unintended consequences or potential \nimpact on national security.\n  I think we are there once we deal with this remaining issue. I think \nit would be very hard for any of us to explain how it is that current \nlaw has to specify what facilities are being targeted and then, now, in \nthe name of the so-called reform approach, adopt something that \nhypothetically--again, I talk only hypothetically about it--might sweep \nsome, for example, soldiers on a military base overseas into a \nsurveillance program. I do not want that. The distinguished vice \nchairman of our committee, Senator Bond, does not want that.\n  So we are going to keep working on this matter. I see my friend from \nMissouri has indicated his desire to speak. As always, I am anxious to \nhear his thoughts on it and to work with him.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a few, perhaps up to 10 additional \nminutes after the vice chairman has had a chance to address us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Oregon. As \nusual, he states objectives that he and I agree with. We both have the \nsame desire, to protect American citizens, U.S. persons, certainly \nmilitary men and women and their families on military bases.\n  I would say to my friend, under the clear provisions of section 703 \nand 704, if they are an American military person overseas, the first \ntest would be: Are you an officer or an employee of a foreign \ngovernment?\n  Obviously, they are employees of our Government. But you would have \nto be acting as an agent of a foreign power, and, furthermore, there \nwould have to be intelligence information provided showing that there \nwas reasonable grounds to believe there was intelligence information.\n  Now, there could be the situation, as there has been in the past--it \nhas happened within the CIA; it has happened within the military--that \nsome person may turn into an agent of a foreign power even though they \nare wearing our uniform. That is a very rare situation. But in that \ninstance, then, you would be able, if you had intelligence information, \nto suggest this person was acting as an agent and had the appropriate \nforeign intelligence.\n  Absent that, nobody is going to sweep them up, nobody is going to \nlisten in, nobody is going to listen in to their phone calls back home \nto their families or their families' calls to them.\n  Now, my colleague mentioned some other questions about collection. \nAnd this is a very important discussion, a complicated discussion, but \nregrettably a classified discussion. So let me suggest to him that we \nunderstand. He has talked to the Department of Justice. I believe they \nhave had some confidential discussions. We would be happy to have more \nwith him. I regret we cannot have them on the floor of the Senate \nbecause they go into matters which are classified.\n  But he and I share the same objective. We have slightly different \nways of getting there. There are certain items I think have to be \ndiscussed off the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I will be very brief in terms of \nresponding to the distinguished vice chair. I also note the person we \nlook to for counsel on these matters, Senator Whitehouse, is here. I \nwant to express my appreciation to him for all of his assistance. If \nanyone is capable of, once again, stepping in and bringing together all \nof the parties--Senator Bond, the Bush administration, Senator \nRockefeller, myself--Senator Whitehouse is that person. He has done it \nrepeatedly, and we thank him for all of his help.\n  On the one remaining issue, just to be very brief in terms of \nresponding to the vice chairman, the vice chairman is spot on with \nrespect to the fact that in most respects, the language of our joint \nefforts does seek to zero in only on the legitimate targets. And that \nis all to the good.\n  What we are concerned about, and again, steering clear of anything \nclassified, is some of the technical issues with respect to the \ndefinition of ``facilities,'' which lead us to be concerned that others \ncould be swept in. That is what we still need to resolve.\n  So let's do this. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island wants \nto have a chance to speak on this issue. This is not going to be the \nlast word on the subject. But I would say this is an opportunity, after \nmonths and months of discussion, to get it right in terms of \nmodernizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Thirty years ago, it was a big issue. It is an even bigger issue \ntoday. I think a business person, for example, in Kansas City, MO, or \nPortland, OR, or anywhere else, when they travel the globe and are \ndoing business, speaking to loved ones, they have an expectation that \ntheir rights are not thrown into the trash can when they leave the soil \nof the United States.\n  We have taken steps to ensure, under the efforts of Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Bond, myself and others, we have gone a long way \nto extending the overseas protections for our people that they have \nhere. We are not quite there yet. We have one issue left to deal with, \nand it is an important issue.\n  We are going to continue to have these discussions, and they will \ncertainly be good-faith discussions. I hope we can persuade all \nparties, and particularly those in the administration, to support our \nefforts to deal with this one remaining matter, which literally is a \nquestion--we have staff on the floor--of importing language that the \nadministration says works in other parts of this legislation, into this \narea which we think is substantially the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nOregon for his very kind words, probably too kind words, but that is \none of the glorious conventions of this body.\n  I salute his leadership in this area because perhaps the most \nsignificant thing that has been accomplished so far in this FISA \ndispute, that has been accomplished in a bipartisan fashion, in a \nmanner in which great credit reflects on Vice Chairman Bond who is here \non the Senate floor, is consensus has been reached that when an \nAmerican travels overseas, the rights they believe they enjoy here in \nthese United States, the rights the Constitution guarantees them here \nin these United States, travel with them and cannot be overruled at the \nwhim of the very same branch of Government that seeks the surveillance. \nAnd the reason that was able to take place is because the Senator from \nOregon had the foresight to put together the amendment that he and \nSenator Feingold and I argued for in the Intelligence Committee. I \nexpress my personal appreciation to him for his wisdom in that regard.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside in \norder that I might call up amendment No. 3908.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I must object to that. I do commend the \nSenator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Oregon for their \nleadership on the issues which they have addressed. They have made a \nstrong push, and they worked with us through the 20-plus pages of \nconstruction to get a workable means of achieving the goal they so \neloquently champion. We will continue to work with them on those \nefforts dealing with the items the Senator from Oregon addressed. \nHowever, I must object to setting aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am disappointed to hear that. The \nSenator, of course, clearly has that right. As everyone in this body \nknows, we are facing a deadline of February 1 to conclude this \nlegislation. There is considerable other business related to the \nstimulus package, given our economic concerns in this country, and I \nwould hope now that the FISA bill has been called up, that we are on \nthis bill here on the floor, that amendments to the title I provisions \nwe are\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\nworking on now could be called up and considered. It would certainly \nmove things along in the process if they could be called up and debated \nso that when it came time for a vote, we could move more expeditiously \nthrough the process. I hope very much this is not a signal that it is \nanyone's intention to slow down this process.\n  We saw in August how unfortunate the result can be when this body's \ntime to give a major issue such as this significant attention is \ncompressed. Indeed, I refer to that unfortunate August situation as \n``the August stampede.'' I don't think we reflected great credit on \nthis institution when we did what we did back then.\n  The effort we are undertaking now is an effort, in fact, to remedy \nsome of those concerns. There has been significant bipartisan effort to \nget us to this point. While there are clearly remaining points of \ndisagreement, I would think it would be in everyone's interest to work \nthrough those issues and to give these different amendments a chance to \nbe voted on. For instance, the amendment I had hoped to call up is one \nthat is supported not only by myself but Chairman Rockefeller, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee. It is supported \nby Chairman Leahy, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. It is supported by Senator Schumer, the distinguished \nSenator from New York. It is supported by Senator Feingold, the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin who serves, like myself, on both \nthe Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. It addresses a very \nimportant issue to this body which is the terms on which we will allow \nthis administration to spy on Americans.\n  It is an amendment that a lot of work has gone into. It reflects a \nconvergence of ideas that was developed by Senator Schumer and Senator \nFeingold in the Judiciary Committee, that we developed in the \nIntelligence Committee, again, through an often bipartisan process. \nSenator Feingold played a critical role in both committees in advancing \nthis issue. We have worked very carefully with the Department of \nJustice to incorporate changes that they have recommended as technical \nassistance. It is a meaningful, worthy, well-thought-out amendment that \nmerits consideration and discussion on the floor. It relates to an \nissue that is a fairly simple one but in order to understand it, you \nhave to have a basic understanding, at least, of wiretap surveillance.\n  As United States Attorney and as Rhode Island's Attorney General, I \noversaw wiretap and surveillance investigations, and I am familiar with \nthe procedures. With any electronic surveillance, whether it is in a \ndomestic law enforcement context or intelligence gathering on \ninternational terrorism, what you find is that information about \nAmericans is intercepted incidentally. You have, as all the prosecutors \nin this body well know, including the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nthe target of your investigation. The target has certain rights; a \nwarrant requirement under the Constitution, for instance. But what you \nfind is that once you have surveillance up on your target, they \nobviously talk to other people. Those other people who are incidentally \nintercepted in the surveillance also have rights as well.\n  In domestic law enforcement, there are clear and established \nprocedures for what is called minimizing the interception of the \nconversations to the extent that they touch on the incidentally \nintercepted person who is not the target of the surveillance. The \nminimization procedures govern the collection and the retention of this \ninformation to ensure that the privacy of innocent Americans is \nprotected. These are sensible measures. I have been in the trailers \nwith the FBI agents as they are switching on and off to honor the \nminimization procedures. But one of the key elements of these \nminimization procedures is the knowledge on the part of the surveilling \nagency that they are subject to court oversight. That is natural in the \ndomestic law enforcement context. You are operating under a court order \nto begin with. In the domestic context, it happens as a simple \nconsequence of there being a court order in the first place.\n\n  When you are dealing with Americans abroad and when they are swept up \nin international surveillance for national security purposes, the \nsituation can be different. We have had to provide for these \nminimization procedures. Under the Senate Intelligence bill, the court, \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, is now being given the \nauthority to approve the minimization procedures when an American is \nlistened to incidentally in surveillance that targets another \nindividual. The court has the authority to approve the procedures. But \nwhat was missing is that the court did not have the authority to \ndetermine whether the procedures it has approved are actually being \nfollowed. You would think that would be obvious. If you are going to \nset it up so that the court can approve minimization procedures, should \nit not follow as a matter of simple logic that the court should have \nthe authority to see whether the procedures the court approved are in \nfact being followed?\n  We have worked very carefully with Vice Chairman Bond, with Chairman \nRockefeller, with the technical folks at the Director of National \nIntelligence Office, and at the Department of Justice. At present, we \nhave a situation in which it has been agreed that the court will have \nthe power to determine whether its rules are being followed if the \ntarget of the surveillance is an American in the United States. We have \nalso reached agreement that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nwill have the authority to determine whether its rules are being \nfollowed if the target is an American overseas. The issue that remains \ninvolves those cases in which the target is a foreign person but they \nare in touch with a U.S. person, an American, who is being incidentally \nintercepted because they are in touch with a foreign target--because \nthe foreign target has called them, because the foreign target is \ndiscussing them, because they have called the foreign target, whatever.\n  I cannot for the life of me understand why this is a difference that \nwe are obliged to come to the Senate floor to decide. It would seem to \nme that when the purpose of the exercise is enforcing minimization \nprocedures that benefit the U.S. person who is incidentally \nintercepted, it should not matter whether the target is an American in \nthe United States or an American overseas or a foreign person. The \nperson we are trying to protect is the U.S. person incidentally swept \ninto the surveillance. So the purpose of this amendment, if I were to \nbe permitted to call it up, would be to see to it that the court, which \nhas the authority to determine the minimization procedures when there \nis a foreign target who talks to a United States person, should have \nwhat would seem to me obviously consequent authority to determine \nwhether those rules it has approved are being followed.\n  It may even be that it is so inherent in the nature of a court that \nsubsequent litigation would determine that in fact the court does have \nthat right. It comes, in its very nature as an article III court, to \nhave the authority to determine whether its rules and whether its \norders are being followed. But rather than force it to that point, it \nwould be better if we simply cleared up the matter here.\n  Again, I regret that merely calling up the amendment at this point is \nbeing objected to. I hope this is not a signal that we are trying to \nrecreate, to put it mildly, the hectic atmosphere of the August \nstampede. I would like as quickly as possible to work through the \namendments that relate to title I. There are a number of them. I expect \nwe will be staying rather late if we can't start working through them \nnow. But when the time comes, I will come back to the floor and again \nseek permission to call up this amendment; I hope at that time with \nmore success.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, we too want to move through this bill. \nThis amendment, sponsored by the Senator from Rhode Island, was \nincluded in the Judiciary Committee substitute for the Intelligence \nCommittee bill. We defeated that.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee has said we are going to come \nback and vote on all of these amendments one by one. At this point I \nthink it is appropriate that the leaders are discussing or will discuss \nhow we are going to proceed. In the meantime, we are not going to set \naside amendments\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nuntil we have some direction from the leadership on how they wish to \nhandle these amendments.\n  On the substance of the amendment, earlier today in discussing the \nJudiciary Committee substitute, I pointed out that the FISA Court, or \nthe FISC as it is called, has said: We are not going to get into this \narea. We don't want to get into the business of trying to oversee how \nforeign intelligence is collected. That means whether it is collected \nor whether there is incidental collection, those challenges are \nsignificantly different from the challenges that the FBI would face in \ncarrying out their court order.\n  But it should be noted, as I believe the Senator from Rhode Island \nhas, that the FISA court order, the FISC, will set out the requirement \nthat minimization procedures be followed. There will be significant \nreview and oversight of those because the person conducting the \nsurveillance has a supervisor who will look over their shoulder. That \nsupervisor knows there will be a representative of the inspector \ngeneral who is watching, who is looking for any problems. That \ninspector general knows there will be a lawyer from the Department of \nJustice overseeing it to assure there is compliance.\n  We have an Intelligence Committee with a very able staff, some of \nwhom understand very well how the NSA programs work, whether it is \nunder the FISC or under the previous time. It is our job, under our \nchallenge, our charter, as an oversight committee of the intelligence \ncommunity, to make sure these laws are followed. So I will say that \nwhen the FISC was challenged to take on a broader role in handling \nforeign intelligence, they stated in the December 17 released opinion, \nIn re Motion for Release of Court Records, at the very bottom of page \n19, footnote 31, the appellant claimed that the court could conduct a \nreview because it is a ``specialized body with considerable expertise \nin the area of national security.'' The FISC itself said that this \noverstates the FISC's expertise:\n\n       Although the FISC handles a great deal of classified \n     material, FISC judges do not make classification decisions \n     and are not intended to become national security experts. . . \n     . (FISC judges are not expected or desired to become experts \n     in foreign policy matters or foreign intelligence activities, \n     and do not make substantive judgments on the propriety or \n     need for a particular surveillance). Furthermore, even if a \n     typical FISC judge had more expertise in national security \n     matters than a typical district court judge, that expertise \n     would still not equal that of the Executive Branch, which is \n     constitutionally entrusted with protecting the national \n     security.\n\n  They cite a case, which says:\n\n        . . . (``a reviewing court must recognize that the \n     Executive departments responsible for national defense and \n     foreign policy matters have unique insights'' into national \n     security harms that might follow from disclosure). . . .\n\n  At the end it says:\n\n       For these reasons, the more searching review requested by \n     the [appellant in that case] would be inappropriate.\n\n  So while there are court orders that the minimization procedures be \nfollowed, there is an existing framework for significant oversight, and \nthere is the oversight not only by the executive branch but by the \nlegislative branch, and the FISC says that is not the business they are \nto get into.\n  We will have an opportunity to revisit this when the matter is \nbrought up. But I wanted to advise my good friend, a diligent worker on \nthe Intelligence Committee, why we had argued against that provision in \nthe amendment or the substitute that the Judiciary Committee proposed.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the very distinguished vice \nchairman of the committee for his description of his views on this \nmatter. I know they are honestly held and founded in his beliefs.\n  I do take some issue with his recollection of the travel of this in \nthe Intelligence Committee. I thought I heard the distinguished vice \nchairman say this amendment had been voted down in the Intelligence \nCommittee. It is my recollection that I withdrew it because there were \ntechnical concerns that were described by some of the officials from \nthe Office of National Intelligence and from the Department of Justice \nwho were present.\n  Indeed, it was that withdrawal and willingness to work to try to find \na better amendment that resulted in the very commendable process by \nwhich the distinguished vice chairman agreed to allow the court to \noversee compliance with its own rule in those two circumstances I \nmentioned earlier: where the target is an American, either overseas or \nat home.\n  Other than that, the only other point I would add is that I think it \nis probably a situation unique in the annals of American law that an \nAmerican court would be provided the authority to approve a rule or \nmake an order but denied the authority to determine whether it was \ncomplied with. I can certainly think of no situation in our law or in \nour history where that has ever been the case.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from Maryland seeks the floor. I \nyield the floor, and I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside so I can offer amendment No. 3859.\n  Mr. BOND. I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I may respond to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland--I apologize to the Senator from Maryland--I say to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, what I said was his provision was in the Judiciary \nsubstitute that we defeated. We did not deal with his amendment in the \nIntelligence Committee. We discussed it. He offered it, and it was \naccepted in the Judiciary substitute. That amendment was defeated.\n  What I raised was the concern that our leadership has about going \nback and revisiting all the elements of the Judiciary substitute.\n  I thank the Chair, and my apologies and thanks to my colleague from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me point out to the cochair of the \nIntelligence Committee and the distinguished Republican whip on the \nfloor why I asked for this amendment to be called up. I hope there will \nbe a time when we will have a chance to vote on this amendment. It is \none I hope would gain some broad support in this body.\n  What this amendment would do is to change the automatic termination \ndate that is in the statute, the bill now--which is at 6 years--to 4 \nyears. I know there are some Members of this body who are opposed to \nany termination date. The administration is opposed to a termination \ndate.\n\n  I applaud the Intelligence Committee for including a termination \ndate, a sunset in the legislation, recognizing it is our responsibility \nto make sure we are included in the appropriate oversight with the \nexecutive branch. Knowing the history of this legislation, knowing how \nquickly technology changes, it is important that Congress be intimately \ninvolved in reviewing the operations of this statute, the changing \ntechnology, and that we have the full attention and cooperation not \nonly of the intelligence community but also the White House and the \nexecutive branch of Government.\n  The reason why I believe the 4 years is much more preferable than 6--\nI urge my colleagues to please follow this debate--with a 4-year \nsunset, it will be a requirement of the next administration to be \ninvolved in this FISA statute. They are not going to be able to sit \nback for their entire term and say: Gee, we have this authority; there \nis no need to make the information readily available to Congress.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, it was not easy to get information from \nthe executive branch on the use of their authority, of which for some \nwe recently found out the full extent of the use of their authority. So \nif we keep a 6-year sunset, there will be no legal need for the next \nadministration to work with Congress to make sure there is broad \nsupport for what the administration is doing, to make sure we do not \nhave another situation where there was the use of power by the \nexecutive branch that, quite frankly, we did not know about, and that \nwe will at least know whether the technology is the right technology. \nWe will have much better attention.\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\n  So for the purposes of our oversight, our responsibility as the \nlegislative branch of Government, we should make it clear to the next \nadministration: Sure, you have plenty of time under this authority. You \ndo not have to worry about this authority terminating. You have almost \nyour entire term in office. But we want you to focus on it, and make \nsure we are not only protecting the rights of Americans, that we are \nnot only making sure the intelligence community has the tools it needs, \nbut we are making sure that as technology changes during the next \nyears--and technology is changing very quickly--we are all engaged in \nthe subject.\n  We are ready to take action as the legislative branch of Government \nto make sure we are working with the executive branch to give the \nintelligence community the tools it needs to gather the information on \nforeign targets, and that they are also doing it in ways, as the \nchairman and vice chairman of the committee and the committee have \nsaid, that respect the rights of Americans and the civil liberties of \nthe people of our Nation.\n  It is for that reason that I urge we find a time to take this up. I \ntook this few moments now in the hopes that when we come back to this \namendment we will not quite need as much time. I do hope the Members \nwill understand this is being offered so we in the Congress can carry \nout our responsibility.\n  It is interesting that there were several debates on the floor of \nthis body when the original PATRIOT Act was passed and the Protect \nAmerica Act was passed to make sure there were sunsets in it. We are \nnow amending the bill today. The chairman and vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee just brought forward a set of amendments, and as \nI listened to the chairman and vice chairman talk, they said: We want \nto make sure we get it right.\n  There were a lot of technical changes made as of today. I do not \nthink anyone here feels totally comfortable that we got it right. We \nare going to have to stay engaged on this subject. I think it is \ncritically important we have the attention of the next administration \nto make sure we can do the right thing for the people of this Nation to \nkeep them safe and to protect their civil liberties.\n  So that is the reason I intend to offer this amendment. It was in the \nJudiciary Committee substitute. We debated it in the committee. We had \na good debate in the Judiciary Committee. Senator Kennedy had offered a \n2-year sunset. We talked about that also. There are others who have \nbeen interested in this. I am not alone in this request. I know I am \njoined by Senator Mikulski as a cosponsor of this amendment, who serves \non the Intelligence Committee, and was part of getting that bill \ntogether. I know Senator Rockefeller is sympathetic and supportive of \nthis issue, as is Senator Leahy.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a careful \nlook at this amendment when we come back to it. Hopefully, I will have \nyour support.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I \nmay, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized following the remarks \nof Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 2551 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy and I have offered an \nimportant amendment to ensure that there will be some measure of \naccountability for the unlawful actions of this administration in the \nyears following 9/11. Regrettably, those opposing this commonsense \nreview have so far succeeded in stopping the full Senate from even \nconsidering its merits.\n  It is a sad day for the American public when its elected officials \nstonewall a measure designed to shed light on the Government's efforts \nto unlawfully spy on its own citizens. I urge Senators across the aisle \nto allow this amendment to be called up, debated, and given an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  As we all now know from press accounts, in the years after 9/11, the \nGovernment secretly conducted surveillance on its own citizens on a \nmassive scale through what has become known as the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program, TSP. It was done completely outside of FISA, the \nlaw specifically drafted to regulate such conduct. And it was done \nwithout the consent or even the knowledge of the Congress. It is \ncrucial that Congress and the American people understand why and how \nthese decisions were made, both in the months after 9/11, and in the \nseveral years following that difficult time. This inspector general \nreview amendment will provide that accountability.\n  This review would be conducted jointly by the Offices of Inspectors \nGeneral of each component of the intelligence community that may have \nplayed any role in the TSP, including the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Justice. It will examine the circumstances that led to \nthe approval of the TSP, as well as any procedural irregularities that \nmay have taken place within the Department of Justice Office of Legal \nCounsel--the part of the Justice Department that is supposed to give \nunvarnished legal advice to the President. It will result in a final \nreport to be submitted to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees in \nthe House and Senate within 180 days, containing recommendations and a \nclassified annex. There has been no such comprehensive review to date.\n  This amendment is particularly important because the administration \nand some of its allies in Congress are relentlessly arguing for \nretroactive immunity for the 40 or so lawsuits against those \ntelecommunications companies that may have assisted in conducting this \nsecret surveillance. They are trying to shut down avenues for \ninvestigating and determining whether their actions were lawful. This \namendment will ensure that there will be an objective assessment of the \nlawfulness of the secret spying program and the manner in which the \nGovernment approved and carried out the program.\n  Critics of the amendment claim that Congress has already conducted \nsufficient oversight of the TSP, and that no further review is \nwarranted. That is simply not true. Only a small number of Senators and \nRepresentatives have been granted access to classified documents \nrelated to the TSP. Those of us who have been granted access can \nprovide a measure of oversight by reading through documents to try to \npiece together how the Government decided to spy on its own citizens, \nfor years, and how the Justice Department came to bless this unlawful \nconduct. But the documents don't tell the full story. As we learned \nfrom Jack Goldsmith, the former head of the Office of Legal Counsel, \nthe President's program was a ``legal mess'' when he took over. It is \ncrucial to understand how this ``legal mess'' got approved in the first \nplace. Who was responsible? Were the normal procedures followed at the \nOffice of Legal Counsel? And, perhaps most importantly, how can we stop \nsomething like this from ever happening again?\n  This amendment is one of the many improvements to the Senate \nIntelligence bill that were adopted by the Judiciary Committee and \nincluded in the Judiciary Committee's substitute amendment. \nRegrettably, that substitute was tabled by the Senate earlier today. I \nurge Senators to reconsider their votes with respect to this simple but \ncritically important accountability measure.\n  If the critics succeed in quashing not only the outstanding lawsuits \nseeking accountability, but also congressional efforts to arrive at the \ntruth through a comprehensive review of the TSP, the American public \nwill never forgive us. This administration is hoping it will end its \ntime in office without any meaningful review of its more than 5 years \nof illegal surveillance. We must not let this happen. I urge all \nSenators to support this commonsense amendment to ensure \naccountability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is one of the managers on the floor? Yes. I \nhave been in contact with the distinguished Republican leader. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be recognized for 5 minutes for \npurposes of offering an amendment, and following his 5 minutes, that \nSenator Feinstein be recognized for 5 minutes, and following their \nstatements and their attempt to offer amendments, that I then be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. I didn't hear the last half.\n  Mr. REID. Following their 5-minute statements, I be recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as propounded, I object to the request, but I \nhave no objection to Members each asking consent to which there would \nbe no objection and certainly not to their speaking for whatever length \nof time or whatever order the leader would desire.\n  Mr. REID. So you have no objection to Senator Kennedy being \nrecognized for 5 minutes and Senator Feinstein being recognized for 5 \nminutes?\n  Mr. KYL. Absolutely no objection to that.\n  Mr. REID. And then following their statement, that I be recognized?\n  Mr. KYL. I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I hope the \nSenate will permit us to take action on an amendment I will offer on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Leahy and others. This amendment we have \nprepared is very simple, but it is absolutely critical to this bill.\n  The amendment would require the inspectors general of the Department \nof Justice and the National Security Agency and other relevant offices \nto work together to review the Bush administration's warrantless \nwiretapping program. The inspectors general will analyze this program \nand then issue a report on what they find. Members of Congress will \nreceive a classified version of the report. The public will receive an \nunclassified version of the report.\n  Simply put, there is no other way to put this episode behind us. \nCourt cases looking into the administration's warrantless wiretapping \nhave been stymied by concerns about standing, mootness, and the state \nsecrets privilege. If Congress grants retroactive immunity, some of \nthese cases will be eliminated altogether.\n  But either way, court cases are no substitute for an inspector \ngeneral review when it comes to finding and reporting the facts. \nTraditional rulings will tell us whether any laws were broken and which \nones. The inspector general review will tell us why and how this \nhappened, and it will help us avoid a similar lapse in the future.\n  The administration has decided to share documents with the Senate \nJudiciary Committee but not with the House Intelligence Committee, or \nthe Judiciary Committee whose FISA bill it doesn't like. It has refused \nto share any documents with other Members of the House and Senate who \nare now expected to vote on this legislation. So where are we now?\n  We know that for 5 years the Bush administration conducted a massive \nprogram of warrantless surveillance that may have violated the rights \nof literally millions of innocent Americans. What we do not know is how \nthis program was started, why it was started, what it covered, how many \nAmericans were spied on, or what happened to the information it \ncollected. We are being kept in the dark about one of the most \nsignificant and outrageous constitutional violations by the executive \nbranch in modern history.\n  An inspector general review is the only way to shed light on this \nabuse, the only way to document and assess the administration's \nwarrantless surveillance activities over the past 6 years. The review \nwill help bring clarity, closure, and accountability to this episode. \nIt will help us draw lessons and move on from it.\n  Millions of Americans have been secretly spied on for years. They at \nleast deserve to know the reason. The Senate also deserves to know. \nSenators who vote to pass this amendment will be not only honoring \ntheir constituents' right to learn what was done to them, they will \nalso be enabling themselves to serve their constituents better in the \nfuture.\n  The inspector general report will produce information that will \nassist us in our legislative duties. When Congress takes up FISA in the \nfuture, the results of this report will be enormously valuable in \nhelping us to enact legislation to meet the genuine national security \nand civil liberty needs of the Nation.\n  It is revealing in how quiet the White House has been in opposing the \ninspector general review. Make no mistake, they have been clear they \ndon't want any kind of investigation into what they did. But their \narguments against the inspector general review have been very quiet, \nindeed, perhaps because they know how transparently weak and self-\nserving their arguments are. They said we should not have an inspector \ngeneral review because it might reveal classified information or help \nour enemies. This argument is nothing more than a scare tactic.\n  The inspectors general public report will contain only unclassified \nmaterial. Any classified material will go into a classified appendix. \nIt has been said an inspector generals' review might fuel a partisan \nwitch hunt. Senator Leahy and I have drafted this amendment to be \ntightly limited to the warrantless wiretapping program. The inspectors \ngeneral will have a very specific mandate, and they will do their work \nwithout any political influence whatever.\n  Understanding what happened to the rights of Americans over the past \n6 years is not a partisan effort. All Members of Congress should want \nto learn about the activities in which the administration has engaged. \nThe American people are concerned about what their Government has been \nup to. They need an independent review to restore trust in the \nGovernment and to feel confident that both their security and their \nliberty are being protected.\n  Finally, I have heard it said the inspectors general are not the \nappropriate entity to conduct this review. The question is, if not the \ninspectors general, then who? The inspectors general are experienced \nand independent; they are trusted by Congress and the American people. \nThey frequently conduct confidential investigations and have procedures \nin place to protect classified information. It is precisely for \nsituations such as this that we created the inspector general.\n  It has been reported that the Justice Department recently reopened \nthe Office of Professional Responsibility's investigation into the \nwarrantless surveillance program. That is a positive step, but it is \nnot relevant to this amendment. The scope of the OPR investigation is \nseverely limited. It deals with attorney misconduct, and it is confined \nto the Justice Department. By contrast, the inspector general review \nwill cover all of the relevant agencies, including the National \nSecurity Agency, and it will examine the use of warrantless \nsurveillance much more fully.\n  Moreover, the inspectors general are more independent than OPR, and \nfor investigating a warrantless surveillance program authorized by the \nPresident, independence is of critical importance.\n  Inspectors general also have a proven track record that gives them \nunique credibility. For example, the inspector general report on \nnational security letters showed widespread abuse by the FBI, and it \nhelped Congress understand what needs to be done.\n  There is one reason, and only one reason, to oppose this amendment, \nand that is to cover up the administration's actions. A vote against \nthe inspector general review is a vote for silence and secrecy, for \nstonewalling and denial. It is a vote to erase the past.\n  Many of the issues we have been debating on FISA are difficult and \ncomplicated, and there is room for reasonable people to disagree. But \nthere is no such room on this amendment. It is simple and \nstraightforward. Its potential benefits are great, and its costs are \nnegligible.\n  No matter where one stands on the issues of retroactive immunity for \nthe\n\n[[Page S267]]\n\nphone companies, this amendment should be a no-brainer. In fact, for my \ncolleagues who want to eliminate the court cases against the phone \ncompanies, this should be even more critical because it will at least \npreserve some measure of accountability. It will give the Senate \ncritical information to fulfill its constitutional duty to protect the \nrights of Americans, the separation of powers, and our national \nsecurity.\n  Many Senators who have been defending retroactive immunity have done \nso by emphasizing that the phone companies were just following White \nHouse orders. If you believe that argument, you should be especially in \nfavor of this amendment because it places the inquiry exclusively on \nthe White House. Here is what the amendment says:\n\n       The unclassified report shall not disclose the name or \n     identity of any individual or entity of the private sector \nthat participated in the program or with whom there was communication \nabout the program.\n\n  Even though we oppose retroactive immunity, Senator Leahy and I \nincluded that provision because we want to make this amendment as \nuncontroversial as possible. We want to make it crystal clear that all \nSenators who take their constitutional duties seriously, whether they \nare Democrats or Republicans, need to support this amendment.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to pass this amendment and take a vital \nstep toward restoring honesty and the rule of law in America's \nsurveillance policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a short period of \ntime on an amendment that I would like to offer, in the event I am \ngiven the opportunity to do so.\n  The Terrorist Surveillance Program began in mid-October of 2001, and \nit operated until January of 2007. It operated outside of the \njurisdiction of the FISA Court during that period of time. That is 5 \nyears and 2 months, when a program operated with no court review or no \ncourt approval.\n  Now, I must regretfully say the United States--long before this \nPresident and the prior President, but for decades--has had a rather \nsordid history of misusing foreign intelligence for domestic political \npurposes. This was well outlined in the Church Committee's report, \nwhich led to the development of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct--which is the bill we are talking about--in 1978.\n  If you go back and read the record, you will see that President \nCarter signed the bill. In his signing statement, as well as the record \nof the deliberations of the Congress at that time, he tried to overcome \nthis sordid history by making the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct--this bill--the exclusive authority for electronic surveillance of \nAmericans for the purpose of foreign intelligence. That was the bottom \nline, so that never again could foreign intelligence be used \npolitically against American citizens domestically.\n  FISA has continued over the decades, and I think it has served this \nNation well.\n  What we have seen develop now is a Presidency and a President who \nbelieves very strongly in his executive authority and has tried, \nthrough many different ways, to enhance that executive authority. One \nof those ways has been signing statements--more signing statements by \nthis President, saying what part of the law he would follow and what \npart he would not follow; the concept of the unitary Executive, which \nhas been espoused, whereby all commissions, even the FCC, would be \nsubject to the will of the Presidency and by his use of article II \nauthority--asserting that authority under the Constitution as supreme \nto any statute.\n  The battle over FISA going back to 1978--was to give FISA statutory \nauthority that would be supreme in this one particular area. The \nPresident strove to do it at the time, and the Congress strove to do it \nat the time. The Judiciary Committee bill has this strong statement of \nexclusivity in it, which I will propose in an amendment to this bill. \nThe amendment is cosponsored by the chairmen of both committees, \nIntelligence and Judiciary, Senators Rockefeller and Leahy; Senator \nNelson, who serves on the Intelligence Committee; Senator Whitehouse, \nwho serves on both committees along with myself; Senator Wyden from the \nIntelligence Committee; Senator Hagel from Intelligence; Senator \nMenendez; Senator Snowe from the Intelligence Committee; and Senator \nSpecter, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  All of us together believe there should be strong exclusivity \nlanguage that reinforces the intent of the Congress, that the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act be the exclusive authority for the \nwiretapping of Americans for the purpose of foreign intelligence. It \nmakes sense and should be the case.\n  Finally, the administration said in January of last year: OK, we will \ntry to put the program under the FISA Court. In fact, the program today \nis under the FISA Court through the Protect America Act. So there is a \ncourt review and, where warranted, court warrants are granted for the \ncollection of content. That is the way it should be. As we move to this \nbill, minimization strictures will be spelled out, approved by the \ncourt prior, and that is the way it should be.\n  We would like to add to this bill the exclusivity language contained \nin the Judiciary Committee bill. All of us are in agreement, whether we \nare Intelligence Committee members or Judiciary Committee members, that \nFISA should become the exclusive authority, and we should try to \nreinforce it so that in 2 years, 10 years, or 20 years we will not be \nright back to where we are today.\n  Let me quickly describe the amendment, and shortly I will try to send \na modification of the amendment that is at the desk now, which has some \ntechnical corrections in it.\n  Let me describe this amendment briefly. We add language to reinforce \nthe existing FISA exclusivity language in title 18 by making it part of \nthe FISA language, which is codified in title 50.\n  The second provision addresses the so-called AUMF loophole. The \nadministration has also argued that the authorization for the use of \nmilitary force against al-Qaida implicitly authorized warrantless \nelectronic surveillance.\n  The amendment we would offer states that only an express statutory \nauthorization for electronic surveillance in future legislation shall \nconstitute an additional authority outside of FISA. This makes clear \nthat only a specific future law that provides an exception to FISA can \nsupersede FISA. Only another statute specific can supersede FISA.\n  Third, the amendment makes a similar change to the penalty section of \nFISA. Currently, FISA says it is a criminal penalty to conduct \nelectronic surveillance, except as authorized by statute. The amendment \nreplaces that general language with a prohibition on any electronic \nsurveillance except as authorized by FISA, by the corresponding parts \nof title 18 that govern domestic criminal wiretapping, or any future \nexpress statutory authorization for surveillance.\n  Finally, the amendment requires more clarity in any certification \nthat the Government provides to a company--in this case, a telecom \ncompany--when it requests assistance for surveillance and there is no \ncourt order.\n  The FISA law provides only two ways to do electronic surveillance. \nOne of the ways is a court order. That is clear, that is distinct, that \nis understandable.\n  The second way provides that if assistance is based on statutory \nauthorization, a certification is sent to the company, in writing, \nrequesting assistance and saying that all statutory requirements have \nbeen met.\n  Under this amendment, the certification must specify what provision \nin law provides that authority and that the conditions of that \nprovision have been met. This adds specificity to the certification \nprocess which today is called for by the FISA law. I believe this is \nsomething that is necessary to have in law.\n  In good conscience, I could not vote for any law that did not make \nthe test case that we need to make, which is our legislative intent \nthat FISA is intended to be the exclusive authority for the collection \nof electronic surveillance, foreign intelligence involving a U.S. \nperson.\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\n  It should be subject to FISA law. I don't think any one of us would \nwant to vote to prevent that from happening.\n  I believe this amendment could be adopted given a chance. We have \nvetted it. It will not interfere with the collection of intelligence. \nWe have vetted it with the Department of Justice and with the \nintelligence agencies. As I say, it is bipartisan.\n  What I would like to do at this time is call up the amendment. It is \nNo. 3857, and I ask unanimous consent to send a modification to the \ndesk to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendments?\n  Mr. KYL. For the reasons Senator Bond explained earlier, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday our Vice President gave a speech \nat the Heritage Foundation talking about the need to pass the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. Today, the President gave a statement; \nit was a brief statement. The President gave a statement following up \non the Vice President's speech yesterday. The Vice President gave a \nspeech; the President gave a statement today.\n  Among other things, he said:\n\n       If Congress does not act quickly, our national security \n     professionals will not be able to count on critical tools \n     they need to protect our nation, and our ability to respond \n     to new threats and circumstances will be weakened. That means \n     it will be harder to figure out what our enemies are doing to \n     recruit terrorists and infiltrate them into our country. . . \n     .\n       So I ask congressional leaders to follow the course set by \n     their colleagues in the Senate Intelligence Committee, bring \n     this legislation to a prompt vote in both houses. . . .\n       Congress' action--or lack of action--on this important \n     issue will directly affect our ability to keep Americans \n     safe.\n\n  Let the record be spread with the fact that all 51 Democrats joined \nwith 49 Republicans in that we want to do everything we can to make our \nhomeland safe. We want, if necessary, within the confines of the law, \nto do wiretapping of these bad people. But having said that, we want to \ndo it within the confines of the law and our Constitution. We want to \nmake sure this wiretapping does not include innocent Americans who \nhappen to be part of what they are collecting. That is what the \nAmerican people expect us to do.\n  So I again say, no one can question our patriotism, our willingness \nto keep our homeland safe. We have tried to move forward on this \nlegislation. We have tried in many different ways. What we have been \ndoing today and yesterday is moving forward on this legislation. As the \ndistinguished Senator from California said, there are amendments that \nwill make this legislation better. That is in the eye of the beholder, \nand we all understand that. But shouldn't the Senate have the ability \nto vote on those amendments because no matter what we do as a Senate, \nit has to have a conference with the House. They have already passed \ntheir legislation. We have been stalled every step of the way--every \nstep of the way.\n  The Feingold amendment, for example, was offered. It certainly is \ngermane. But we are being told he cannot get a vote on this amendment \nbecause it concerns FISA's court orders. His amendment was discussed at \nlength previously. Half of it was accepted on a bipartisan basis, the \nother half was not. But certainly he is entitled to a vote.\n  Senator Feingold and I do not mean to embarrass him--is a legal \nscholar. He is a graduate of one of our finest law schools in the \nworld. He is a Rhodes Scholar. Senator Whitehouse has been attorney \ngeneral of the State of Rhode Island and is certainly known all over \nthe country as someone who understands the law. He has been a \ntremendously good person as a Member of the Senate. He serves on both \ncommittees, the Intelligence Committee and on the Judiciary Committee, \nand he is a thoughtful person.\n  He thought the legislation that came out of the Intelligence \nCommittee should be improved, and as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, he worked to have it improved. He sought to offer a germane \namendment a short time ago concerning minimization. What does that \nmean? That means if you pick up by mistake an American, that you drop \nit. You push that out of the way, that isn't going to be made public in \nany manner. We want to vote on that amendment. It seems everyone would \nvote for it. I certainly hope so. But there is an objection to even \nhaving a vote on that amendment.\n\n  Senator Cardin, a long-time Member of Congress, a relatively new \nMember of the Senate, but a long-time, experienced Member of the \nCongress of the United States sought to offer a germane amendment \nshortening the sunset provision. The bill that is before us that came \nout of the Intelligence Committee is for 6 years. Things are changing \nrapidly in our country and in the world as it relates to electronics. \nWe don't know what is going to take place in regard to terrorism, \nviolence or what is going to take place with our ability to do a better \njob electronically to uncover some of what we believe should be \nuncovered. He wants this legislation to be for not 6 years but 4 years. \nThat is a pretty simple amendment. I support it. I think it is a good \namendment. But he has been unable to offer that simple amendment.\n  Senator Feinstein has given a very fine statement seeking consent to \noffer a germane amendment on exclusivity, meaning that FISA is the only \nbasis for the President's eavesdropping. There have been editorials \nwritten virtually in every State of the Union in the newspapers saying \nthat should be the law, but she has not been able to offer that \namendment.\n  Senator Kennedy wanted to offer an amendment that is so rational, so \nimportant. He says: Let's have the inspector general do an \ninvestigation about the whole wiretapping program to find out what has \ntaken place, who has been involved in it, and report back to Congress, \nnot tomorrow; he sets a reasonable time that be done. But guess what. \nWe cannot even vote on that amendment. He cannot even offer the \namendment.\n  I say to my friends it does not matter what we try to do, we cannot \ndo it. It appears the President and the Republicans want failure. They \ndon't want a bill. So that is why they are jamming this forward.\n  I am going to vote against cloture. It is not fair that we have a \nmajor piece of legislation such as this and we are not allowed to offer \nan amendment as to whether the bill should be 4 years or 6 years, and \nwe are not allowed to offer an amendment as to minimization, that is \nwhether Americans picked up by mistake are going to be brought out in \nthe public eye, or Senator Feingold's germane amendment dealing with \nhow court orders are issued, a real good amendment, an important \namendment.\n  If there were ever a Catch-22, this is it because what we are being \nasked to do is irrational, irresponsible, and wrong. From where does \nthis ``Catch-22'' come? We all know it was a bestseller. Joseph Heller \nwrote this book. He was a pilot during World War II. Joseph Heller \nthought he was crazy. He was a bomber pilot. We all know how difficult \nit was to fly those big airplanes in World War II. The casualty rate \nwas high. If you were crazy and you said so, you would be grounded from \nflying these big bombers. But the officials of the military would say: \nWe are not going to let you not fly airplanes because you have to be \ncrazy to fly one of these in the first place. That is what Joseph \nHeller was stuck with because it was crazy to fly bomber missions, and \nthey would immediately make you fly more bomber missions.\n  That is what we have today. We are trying everything we can do, but \nno matter what we do, we step on each other in the process.\n  I suggest we were doing this the right way. We were looking at title \nI, which deals with procedures of this FISA legislation, and then we \nwere going to come later and offer amendments to title II. For example, \none of the difficult issues is whether there should be retroactive \nimmunity for the phone companies. Senators Dodd and Feingold want to \noffer an amendment to strike from the provisions of the bill \nretroactive immunity. That is something on which we should be able to \nvote.\n  Senator Levin came up with the idea, and there are others--I believe \nSenator Whitehouse also wanted to offer an amendment dealing with \nsubstitution,\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\nsaying: OK, if there is going to be retroactive immunity, have the \nGovernment pay for it, not the phone companies, because if, in fact, \nthey were entitled to immunity, that means they were forced into \nsomething they shouldn't have been forced into. That is something I \nthink is reasonable and logical to vote on, but we will not be able to \nvote on it.\n  I asked unanimous consent that we extend this matter for 30 days \nbecause it is very apparent, unless cloture is invoked--and I say to my \nDemocratic colleagues I think this is an example of something on which \nwe should not invoke cloture--if cloture is not invoked, this bill is \nnot going to be finished by February 1 and this program will expire.\n  So we say to the President, who gave this statement today saying he \nwants the program to continue, he needs to talk with his Republicans in \nthe Senate and say: OK, let's get an extension; let's see if we can \nwork something out. Two weeks, a month, we are willing, if the \nPresident wants, to continue this awful program for a year, 15 months, \nwait until the next President comes along. We are willing to do that, \nand he will still have his authority.\n  We know one of his counsel, Mr. Yu, says he doesn't need this anyway; \nhe can do what he wants without this legislation. But we are willing to \ndo whatever is within the realm of possibility.\n  I said we will take a 30-day extension. We will take a 2-week \nextension. We will take a 12-month extension. We will take an 18-month \nextension. I tell all my friends, I have been told--and I appreciate \nvery much my distinguished counterpart, Senator McConnell, who has told \nme he has a cloture motion, it is all signed, and he is going to file \nit as soon as I yield the floor to him--I say to all my friends, under \nthe regular order, we will have this vote Monday. If, in fact, cloture \nis invoked, we will have to have the vote early Monday because the 30 \nhours begins running, and we will have to finish it because we have so \nmuch to do before the final week. I explained all this to the \ndistinguished Republican leader.\n  If cloture is going to be filed, and I know it is going to be, and if \ncloture is invoked, we have to have a vote no later than 1 p.m. on \nMonday, so the 30 hours runs out at a reasonable time on Tuesday so we \ncan do other things. If cloture is not invoked--and I am not going to \nvote for cloture--unless the President agrees to some extension of \ntime, the program will fail. I don't know any way out of that. But I, \nin good conscience, cannot support this legislation, at least unless we \nhave a vote on retroactivity of immunity. I can't vote for cloture \nunless some of the very basic amendments that people want to offer are \nallowed. They all have asked for very short time limits. No one is \nquestioning spending a lot of time. We Democrats are not in any way \ntrying to stall this bill. We have been trying to expedite it for a \nlong time now.\n\n  For purposes of making the record clear, and for my distinguished \ncounterpart, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 2541, which is a 30-day \nextension of FISA, and that the Senate then proceed to its \nconsideration; that the bill be considered read a third time, passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nto modify the request so that instead of passing the House bill, we \nwill now pass the bill we know the President will sign. So, therefore, \nI would ask the pending amendments to the substitute be withdrawn and \nthe substitute offered by Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond be \nagreed to; that the bill be read a third time, and passed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have, Republicans and Democrats--I \nacknowledge more Democrats than Republicans--who believe this \nIntelligence Committee bill can be improved upon, and I so appreciate \nthe Judiciary Committee working in good faith with the Intelligence \nCommittee. We think there are some tuneups that can be done to this \nbill to make it much better, and it is not fair, I say respectfully to \nmy friend from Kentucky, it is really not fair that we be asked to just \naccept this without the ability to have a vote on a single amendment.\n  So I respectfully object to my colleague's request to modify the \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Is there objection to the \nmajority leader's request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am now going to ask unanimous consent to \npass the House bill, which was passed by the House last November.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 517, H.R. 3773, which is the House-passed \nFISA bill; that the bill be read three times, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am sure those watching C-SPAN 2 are \nprobably thoroughly confused with all of the parliamentary discussion \nback and forth and the parliamentary nuances attached thereto. \nObviously, there are two sides to every story.\n  In fact, in April of 2007, the DNI--the Director of National \nIntelligence--asked for this FISA bill to be passed. Our good friends \non the other side of the aisle delayed it. In June and July of 2007, \nthe DNI actually pleaded--pleaded--for help. Our friends on the other \nside delayed right up until the August recess, at which time we did \npass the Protect America Act, which was a 6-month authorization.\n  Now, during September and October, the Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence, in a bipartisan way, produced the Bond-Rockefeller \ncompromise, which is the pending proposal before the Senate. It was, I \ngather, a painful series of compromises that brought the two sides \ntogether 13 to 2 on this extraordinarily important piece of legislation \nto protect our homeland. And that is the pending issue before us.\n  Now, we all know on an issue as important as protecting the homeland \nwe don't get the job done unless we get a Presidential signature, and \nwe do know the President of the United States will sign the \nRockefeller-Bond proposal that is before us. So my strong \nrecommendation to our colleagues is that we avail ourselves of the \nopportunity to pass this measure, which is already the product of \nsubstantial bipartisan compromise between the chairman and vice \nchairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and also the \nmembers, who approved it 13 to 2.\n  A way to do that, obviously, would be to invoke cloture on that \nproposal, indicating that 60 or more Members of the Senate believed \nthis bipartisan compromise, which we know will get a signature by the \nPresident of the United States and go into effect, would be a good \nbipartisan accomplishment for the Senate, and ultimately for the House \nand for America.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Bearing that in mind, Mr. President, I send a cloture motion on the \nsubstitute amendment; that is, the Rockefeller-Bond proposal, to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     substitute amendment to S. 2248, Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2007.\n         Mitch McConnell, Christopher S.

Smith, Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint, Richard Burr.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am, of course, disappointed we are where \nwe are, but that is where we are. I have had a conference just now with \nthe distinguished Republican leader, and what we are going to do is to \nvote on this cloture motion at 4:30 on Monday. I have gotten agreement, \nand we will formalize that in just a bit. I have agreement that the \nvote will be as if it occurred at noon that day, so if in fact cloture \nis invoked, we can start something at 6 o'clock on Tuesday because we \nhave a lot to do.\n  So having said that, Mr. President, we have one call to make, which I \nthink will be fine, and I will make the request at a later time when we \ndo have agreement of what we want to do. I will formalize that as soon \nas we make a phone call.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          The Stimulus Package\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as my colleagues are trying to sort out \nissues related to scheduling votes, and I certainly do care about the \npending issue and making sure that we come to a resolution that will \nprotect a variety of interests, I rise now to speak specifically about \nthe economic stimulus package which the Senate is going to take up next \nweek.\n  We all know there has been a downturn in the economy caused by \npersistent high energy costs and an ongoing mortgage crisis, and we \nknow we are seeing damages to both individual households and to \nbusinesses. We know that layoffs are accelerating, gas and home heating \nprices are skyrocketing, making us face some of the biggest economic \nchallenges we have seen in years. So I think it is very important, Mr. \nPresident, that we continue on this rapid pace to get a stimulus \npackage. And that is the good news; that in a bipartisan effort we have \nbeen working diligently along with the White House to immediately get \nsome stimulus into the economy and help working people and businesses \nthat are struggling.\n  I think our goal should be that we identify measures that are timely, \ntargeted, and, when possible, address the underlying causes of our \neconomic problems--that is getting money in people's pockets, I \nbelieve, must be a key component of this package. I have been following \nwhat the other side of the Capitol has been doing, the House of \nRepresentatives is working on a formidable package, and I know we are \ndiscussing a variety of issues here. But I believe any package should \ntake the opportunity to invest in critical business stimulus measures \nthat can alleviate some of the underlying problems that are causing \nAmericans economic heartburn.\n  We are seeing oil prices in recent weeks hovering around $100 a \nbarrel and natural gas prices remaining at exceedingly historic highs, \nwhich I think is adding great impact to what Americans are doing in \ntrying to deal with this economy. In fact, a Los Angeles Times article \nin December cited economists' fear that high energy costs could ignite \ninflation. This would just aggravate our economic problems further.\n  High energy costs make it much more difficult for our manufacturing \nand agricultural sectors to make ends meet. Today the National Farmers \nUnion came out in favor of a proposal that I think we should put into \nour stimulus package, and one that I am about to describe. It is an \nopportunity to include in the stimulus package incentives that both \ndramatically boost economic activity in 2008 and take an important step \ntoward reducing energy costs.\n  I believe we should consider an extension of the clean energy tax \nincentives in the stimulus package. They meet the definition of short-\nterm stimulus, targeted and timely. They have the benefit of getting \nimmediate short-term results--that is, significant economic activity \nand new jobs in 2008. And they also result in long-term benefits which \nwill help us deal with the underlying problem that is causing so much \nhavoc with our economy, and that is high energy costs.\n  Mr. President, the American Wind Energy Association estimates that \nextending the production tax credit will result in as many as 75,000 \nnew jobs in 2008 and $7 billion of capital spending over the next 12 \nmonths. All by Congress making the right decisions about tax incentives \nfor the wind industry.\n  I think that would be a big boost to our economy. Wind generation \nalone has accounted for over 30 percent of our new generation placed in \nservice last year. This industry is well beyond what some might \nconsider a pilot phase and has significant sources of job diversity for \nthe United States.\n  Likewise, the solar industry estimates that up to 40,000 new jobs \ncould actually be lost in the next 12 months if we do not extend the \ninvestment tax credit. That is right; not only do those tax credits add \nstimulus to the economy, we should understand that by not doing them, \nby not passing them, we are actually taking away economic opportunity \nand investment plans that people would be making this year.\n  Included in this package are also four energy efficiency incentives \nfor consumers. As a Deutsche Bank report released last November said:\n\n       Gains in efficiency will have the effect of muting the \n     effect of expensive oil.\n\n  If we want to get consumers to go shopping, why not encourage them to \nbuy items that will reduce their energy costs? Everybody wins when this \nhappens. Consumers get lower bills, retailers get more economic \nactivity, and it reduces the upward pressure on prices by mitigating \ndemand. All of which helps the overall economy rebound faster.\n  This is the kind of economic stimulus we need. It helps with jobs, it \nhelps diversify the energy industry. The clean energy industry is one \nof the few bright spots in an otherwise slumping economy. Unless those \nincentives are extended in this quarter, we are taking a risk at an \neven steeper downturn in an industry that saw remarkable results in \n2007.\n  Mr. President, that's why we need to make sure we extend these \ncritical clean energy tax incentives. I will remind my colleagues that \nthe three times Congress let the clean energy tax incentives lapse, the \nwind industry saw a 75- to 93-percent decline the following year, \nbecause we were not giving them the predictability in tax incentives. \nSo while I am very happy to make sure the public is getting the \nincentives in the form of rebate checks, I also want to say to my \nconstituents that we are also putting a variety of solutions on the \ntable, that we are trying to deal with problems that will help them not \njust in the near term, but also to solve the underlying problem of high \nenergy costs that is a drag on our economy.\n  I know some of my colleagues will probably talk about lots of \ndifferent ways we can stimulate infrastructure development, but I will \nsay that this is about a business tax investment strategy. These clean \nenergy incentives will stimulate billions of dollars of capital outlay \nnow in the next 12 months, and be a huge source of new job creation.\n  An immediate cash infusion into the economy is necessary, but we \nshould not lose sight of the fact that this has the additional benefit \nof helping us with our long-term problem.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on an extension of these \nclean energy incentives as part of the stimulus package, and to \ndemonstrate the leadership and foresight that we have here in the \nSenate to make the right decisions about a package that will \nsimultaneously provide us near term economic boost, prevent job loss, \nand help solve high energy costs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the \ncloture motion just filed occur on Monday, January 28, at 4:30 p.m.; \nthat the requirements of rule XXII be waived; that if cloture is \ninvoked, all postcloture time during a recess or adjournment would be \ncounted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Also, Mr. President, when we get the vote, the vote be \ndeemed as having occurred at 12 noon on Monday, January 28.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at the direction of the majority leader, I \nannounce there will be no further votes today. The next vote is \nscheduled for 4:30 on Monday. It will be a cloture motion filed by \nSenator McConnell relative to the bill on the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n  The Senate will be in session tomorrow at 9:30 for morning business \nand debate. Members who care to may come to the floor to discuss issues \nof their choosing. I would say on behalf of the majority leader as well \nour frustration that we have reached this point. We have a deadline of \nFebruary 1 to enact this new FISA act. The President has argued he \nneeds this to keep America safe. We have offered to the Republican side \nan extension of the current law so that the President would be able to \ncontinue this policy and program uninterrupted for a month, several \nmonths, as long as a year and a half, and we have been rejected. The \nRepublican leadership on the floor has argued they do not want to \nextend this program as we try to work out differences on the issue of \nthe liability of telephone companies that provided information to the \nFederal Government. That is unfortunate.\n  It is also unfortunate that we had Members of the Senate come to the \nfloor in good faith to offer amendments to this bill. I can tell you, \nhaving spoken to those on our side of the aisle, each of the amendments \nwas prepared and offered to the Republican side for their review, no \nsurprises. We understood that they would offer their own amendments in \nresponse. That is certainly proper. It would engage the Senate in \ndebate on some very important issues relative to national security. But \nit was the decision of the Republican leadership they wanted no \namendments, they wanted no debate. They wanted the President's version \nof this bill, take it or leave it. They would rather run the risk of \nclosing down this program of surveillance of terrorists than perhaps \ngive us a chance for a few amendments to be debated and voted on in the \nnext 24 hours. That is an unfortunate start to the 2008 Senate session.\n\n  In the last year of the Senate, the Republicans were responsible for \nsome 62 efforts to stop debate on the floor, 62 efforts at filibusters, \nwhich is a modern record; in fact, it is an all-time record for the \nSenate; 62 different occasions the Republicans engaged in filibusters \nto stop debate.\n  We were hopeful as we talked about the stimulus package and \nbipartisanship, working together, that things had changed. And then \nwithin a matter of hours, the Republican leadership came to the floor \nto stop us from having any amendments, any debate in a timely fashion \non this important bill, and also to stop us from extending this bill, \nthis law, so the President can use this program, and that America would \nnever have its security at risk.\n  I think the Republicans have taken an untenable, indefensible \nposition. They do not want the law extended so the President can use \nit. They do not want us to enact any revision to the law or even debate \nit on the off chance that there might be a change. They have taken the \nposition it is their way or the highway.\n  Well, we will have a vote on Monday, an unfortunate vote that would \nhave been avoided with a modicum of cooperation here in the Senate.\n  So there will be no further votes today; the first vote will be at \n4:30 on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S271-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I wish to take the floor for a few minutes \nbefore we adjourn today to talk about the economy and about this \nstimulus package we are hearing the House is developing and will send \nover here some time in the next few weeks.\n  I must say, first, it is clear that there is a downturn in the \neconomy that is causing a lot of anxiety among all Americans. It is \nclear we need to do something. Over the last 6 years, I must admit, I \nhave been disturbed by the lack of fiscal discipline by this White \nHouse and by this Congress, as the deficits have piled up.\n  Think about this: In 2001, when President Clinton left office, we had \nsurpluses. We were going to have surpluses as far as the eye could see. \nWe were talking about paying down the national debt, saving our Social \nSecurity system. That all changed. It all changed because the new \nPresident came in and said: What is more important than paying down the \ndebt, paying our bills, putting us on a sound fiscal basis? What is \nmore important than that is tax cuts for the wealthiest people in our \ncountry. Oh, sure, everybody got a little bit, but a lion's share of it \nwent to the wealthiest in our country.\n  I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised. The President's \nphilosophy has always been one of trickle down, trickle-down economics. \nHow many times do we have to keep enduring trickle-down economics when \ntime after time we know it does not work? It may give you a little bit \nof a good feeling for awhile, but it always leads to disastrous \nconsequences.\n  So that is what we had in 2001. We had trickle down, give the most to \nthe wealthiest in the country; it will trickle down to everybody. It \ndidn't trickle down. What it did was widen the gap between the rich and \nthe poor. The very highest income earners in our country have gotten \nwealthy beyond Midas' imagination and the rest are down here, and the \npoor have gotten poorer and they have gotten to be a bigger part of our \npopulation. Children in poverty have gone up since 2001.\n  I suppose it was a nice dinner party for those who were at the top of \nthe ladder for the last 5, 6 years, a wonderful ride, but look what it \nhas led to. Now we have these huge deficits. The debt has piled up. We \nare now stuck in a war in Iraq that is costing us $10 billion to $12 \nbillion a month, with no end in sight. Still we have these big tax cuts \nfor the very wealthy going on and on.\n  Again, here we are. And, now we have a downturn. What do we do? We \nhave to do something. There are times when deficit spending in the \nshort term is prudent and necessary. That is when there is an economic \ndownturn. But during the times when the economy is sound, that is when \nyou ought to be paying down your debts. When the economy was sound for \nthe last few years, we gave it all away. We gave it away, again, mostly \nto the wealthiest in our country. Now we are in a situation in which we \nwant to ward off a deep recession.\n  Recessions always hurt those at the bottom worst. And now we are \ngoing to have to, because we don't have any money, do it with deficit \nspending, which I don't like, but we are going to have to do it.\n  I think it behooves us if, in fact, we are going to have to ask our \ngrandkids and great-grandkids to pay the bill--that is what the \nnational debt is; they have to pay it--if we are going to borrow from \nthem for right now to get us through a recession, then we ought to be \nprudent about what we do with that money and how we do it.\n  I guess from my standpoint, taking a bunch of money and throwing it \nout there is not the way to do it. Don't throw money at the problem. \nThat is why I have very serious reservations about what I hear coming \nfrom the other body. We haven't seen anything. All I know is what I \nread in the paper and see on the news and what I hear about what the \nWhite House is doing.\n  I have no doubt the House is acting in good faith. I am all for a \nbipartisan solution. But I remind both the President and my colleagues \nthat we in the Senate are going to have some say-so in shaping the \nfinal stimulus package. Any bill that comes from the House is\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\ngoing to be fully amendable here, and I intend to be here with a number \nof my colleagues to amend it if what I hear is coming from the House, \nand that is mainly a rebate. I don't know what the parameters are of \nthe rebate. That is to be decided yet. But I hear the rebate can go to \ncouples making $150,000 a year. I guess when you figure out what the \naverage income of Americans is, that is pretty high.\n  Everybody likes free money. Hey, come on, everybody likes to have the \nGovernment send them a check. Why not? I repeat, if we are going to \nborrow money from our grandkids and great-grandkids, let's be prudent \nabout it. Let's put the money where it is most effective and where it \nis most needed, and that is not some kind of a general rebate for \npeople.\n  We have unemployment rising, house prices are falling, and the home \nconstruction industry is in a severe slump. That affects everything, \nnot just the house that is going to be built or is not being built. \nThat is the window manufacturers, the tubing, the piping, the plumbing, \nthe heating and air conditioning, and everything else down the line.\n  That is a real factor, something about which we should be concerned. \nFurniture makers, appliance makers, so many are also affected. Millions \nof Americans face the prospect of foreclosure, losing their homes. \nBanks are tightening their lending requirements. New credit is drying \nup. Even as the Fed reduces their interest rates, banks are tightening \nup the requirements. And who always gets hit the hardest? You got it, \nlow-income people.\n\n  Prices are rising. I need not tell everybody about the rising price \nof fuel. But I also have to tell you that in many cities in this \ncountry, the price of a gallon of milk is higher than a gallon of \ngasoline. I read where somebody said once a price of gasoline may not \naffect a lot of low-income people because they ride mass transit and \nthey don't have a car. They eat. And when the price of a gallon of milk \nis higher than a price of a gallon of gasoline, you don't have much \nchoice.\n  If a gallon of gasoline is high and you don't like it, I supposed you \ncan ride mass transit, ride a bicycle, or walk. If you are hungry, you \nhave to have food. I don't know any substitute yet for food.\n  We need a stimulus package, but we have to get it right, targeted to \nthose who have been hit the hardest and invest in the growth in the \nU.S. economy. Don't think about this as a one-time thing, if we spend a \nlot of money now that will get us through it. If you have someone who \nmakes $150,000 a couple or $75,000 for, let's say, a single person, you \ngive them 600 or 700 bucks, what they are talking about, I think \nstudies have shown a big portion of that will be saved. There is \nnothing wrong with that. That is fine. I am all for saving. People \nought to save more. But another portion of that will be used to pay \npast bills, and another portion of that, guess what, is going to be \nused to buy things. One might say: That is the deal, we want people to \nbuy things; that is the idea of a stimulus. Yes, but what are they \ngoing to buy? Are they going to buy a new flat-screen TV made in China? \nAre they going to buy a new electronic game made overseas? So many of \nthose items are made in foreign countries, so a lot of money will flow \nfrom here right to China, Japan, Korea, or who knows where else.\n  You can buy clothes. Most of our clothes are made overseas. You can \nbuy a pair of shoes. We don't make many shoes here anymore. I am saying \nyou have to think about who is getting helped and where is the money \ngoing, and is it going to help build the structure of America and make \nfor our economy to be sound.\n  On that score, the proposal I see from the House does not quite do \nit. There are three big items, as I understand, that they leave out. \nThe first is food stamps. I was in my office today listening and I \nheard some speakers on the floor talk about all we need in a stimulus \npackage. Some of them never even mentioned food stamps, and yet these \nare the people hit the hardest by a recession. We know the multiplier \neffect of food stamps is better than any other single program in which \nwe can invest. Here is a chart that indicates that. This is prepared by \nMoody's Economy. It is not a Government source. Here are the proposals \nthat deliver the demand generated by $1 of stimulus. For $1 of \nstimulus, what do you get back? For business investment writeoffs, if \nyou invest $1, you get 27 cents; extend the Bush tax cuts, you get 29 \ncents. Who is going to invest a dollar to get back 29 cents, I ask you. \nThen income tax cuts, payroll tax rebates, aid to States, unemployment, \nfood stamps, a $1.73 multiplier effect for every dollar you put \nin. These are the people hit the hardest. We know food prices are \nextremely high. A gallon of milk is more than a gallon of gasoline. \nThere is no substitute for food.\n\n  It seems to me that if we are going to invest in a stimulus package, \nthis is a key place where we ought to be investing our money. Not only \ndoes it help the poorest in our Nation, to give them the food they \nneed, but think about it in another way. When you give someone food \nstamps, they can't spend it on a flat-screen TV made in China, they \ncan't spend it on a new electronic game or an iPod; it has to be food. \nFor the most part, most of that food is grown in the United States, it \nis processed in the United States, it is packaged in the United States, \nit is shipped in the United States, and it is sold in stores in the \nUnited States. And, they will spend it all. That is why the multiplier \neffect is so big.\n  Now, from what I hear, the House proposal has zero in it--zero--for \nfood stamps. Well, that has to be taken care of. And when that bill \ncomes, if it doesn't have it in here when it comes here, I, along with \nothers--and I see my colleague from Ohio, who I know is going to be \nstalwart on that too--we are going to demand that any stimulus package \nhave food stamps. Food stamps. And why shouldn't it? That is the \nbiggest bang for the buck right there.\n  Now, again, everybody likes rebates and stuff. Maybe I am a little \nmore conservative on this issue than others and I see it in those \nterms, that we have to be very careful about how we are spending \ndeficit money. Put it here and it gets spent and it will go for \neverything made in the United States. You get a big multiplier effect \non that. And it has to be a distinct change.\n  Here is what I would propose that we do on food stamps. First of all, \nraise the asset level for which you qualify for food stamps. Right now, \nit is $2,000. Let me make it very clear what I mean by that. Let's say \nthat you are a single parent, you are working at a low-income job, and \nyou temporarily get unemployed, which is what is happening now because \nunemployment goes up in a recession, and you find it necessary to get \nfood stamps for your children. If you have $2,000 that you have salted \naway in a savings account, in a 401(k), no matter what, if you have \n$2,000 salted away, you don't get food stamps.\n  Now, that level was set in 1977--in 1977. What if that had just kept \npace with inflation through all these years? What if we had the same \nasset level exclusion today in real dollar terms as we had in 1977? \nWhat would it be? I will tell you right now. It would be about $6,000. \nSo what we are saying to food stamp recipients today is: You are worse \noff, you are worse off than a food stamp recipient was in 1977. So the \nfirst thing we have to do is raise the asset level for which you \nqualify for food stamps, and we ought to raise it up to what the level \nwould be had it kept pace with inflation, and that is roughly in the \nneighborhood of about $6,000. Imagine that, $6,000.\n  We want poor people to save. One of the reasons people get stuck in \npoverty is they do not save any money. Yet we tell them: If you save \nand you hit a rough patch and you get unemployed, guess what, no food \nstamps. You have to spend your savings. What kind of message does that \nsend? So that is No. 1.\n  Number 2, we ought to take off the childcare cap. Take it off. Now, I \nwill admit that the Bush administration, in their farm bill proposal \nthey sent down, also asked that we take off the cap. So there shouldn't \nbe any argument there. So if you have to have childcare, whatever you \nspend for childcare is not taken into account. You get to deduct all \nthat. You get to deduct whatever the cost of childcare is from your \nincome. Right now, it is capped at $175 per month. That is not enough \nand it is very hard to work with young children with no one at home to \ntake care of them without\n\n[[Page S273]]\n\nchild care. So we shouldn't have the argument from the administration \nsince they proposed that too.\n  The third thing is to exempt from your savings, from your income, \nanything that you put into an education account or into a 401(k). That \nought to be exempt. The administration proposed that, also, so we \nshouldn't have any problem there.\n  The fourth thing we need to do is to raise the standard deduction. \nNow, the standard deduction is a deduction that applies to a family who \ndepends basically on income and depends on how many kids you have. That \nstandard deduction was set in 1996--welfare reform. Guess what. It \nhasn't changed since then. So the standard deduction needs to be raised \nto keep pace with inflation, and it needs to be indexed. We need to \nindex both the asset level and the standard deduction so that in the \nfuture we don't have this problem anymore.\n  We should do those four things.\n  Now, the fifth thing we ought to do is to recognize that many people \nwho get food stamps don't get enough food stamps. During an economic \ndownturn, a lot of people rely upon our food banks to get food for the \nrest of the month. You can go to any food bank in your cities, \nanywhere, and they will tell you that the third and fourth weeks of the \nmonth is when they get hit the hardest because people run out of food \nand come in there to supplement their food. But our food banks are in \ndire need of more food. So I would suggest, modestly suggest, that we \nought to put somewhere in the neighborhood of about $100 million in \nthis stimulus package to go out--that is under the Emergency Food \nAssistance Program--to be able to get food to our food banks. Again, \nnot only does this go to people who are on food stamps but also to \nhomeless people, soup kitchens, and the things that really help the \npoorest people in our country. Yet this is nowhere in the stimulus \npackage. Again, keep in mind this money would be spent for food \nproduced in the United States, processed, packaged, and for people who \nwork in a lot of our food banks and in our soup kitchens and places \nsuch as that.\n\n  So, again, those are five things which need to be done on food \nstamps.\n  The second thing we need to do is to extend unemployment benefits. \nSecond only to food stamps, unemployment benefits give you the biggest \nreturn on every dollar--$1.64 for every dollar spent. After all, isn't \nthat what we are talking about, people who have been on unemployment \nbut their benefits have run out? They should be extended. I mean, \ncommon compassion would tell you they ought to be extended, but common \nsense should also tell you that too. In a stimulus package, we ought to \nextend our unemployment benefits for those who no longer have jobs. \nYet, as I hear about and read about the House package, that is not \nthere. That is not there.\n  Now, the third thing we have to do is invest in the future structure \nof America so that we have some investments that will lead to a better \neconomic footing for this country. As I said, and I will repeat myself \nfor emphasis' sake, if we just give someone money and they spend it on \na flat-screen TV made overseas, some of that helps here, but a lot of \nit doesn't. What is there that we can invest in that will put people to \nwork right away, spend money in this country, and most of the money \nstays right here in America? What that means is infrastructure money. \nThat is money that goes out for repairing our roads and bridges and \nsewer and water systems, school construction and weatherization.\n  There was some talk that we need to put money in here for LIHEAP, the \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program. It is a vital program. It \nhelps a lot of low-income elderly heat their homes during the winter \nand, in the South, cool their homes in the summer. We ought to be \nputting money into weatherization programs for insulation and things \nsuch as that for these homes as well to save for the long term and also \nto create jobs. It puts people to work.\n  I actually did a workday once with a weatherization group, and when \nyou think about it, you get this done, and then their heating bills for \nthe next 5 to 10 years will be lower. That is what we need, to invest \nin the infrastructure of our country.\n  Right now, I know that in the Department of Agriculture, we have over \n$1 billion backlogged right now for just sewer and water projects, just \nsewer and water programs. Many are ready to go with all of the plans \nthat are there, designs all set, but they just don't have the money. \nSmall towns and communities could benefit from this, and it would put a \nlot of people to work. School construction--so many of our schools have \noutdated heating systems that cost a lot of money every year. They may \nneed to expand, or they may need new fire and safety materials. \nSometimes they just need to build new schools. A lot of these are ready \nto go. Why not invest the money there? Roads and bridges, our \ninterstate highways and bridge rehabilitation projects that are ready \nto go, courthouses that need to be built with the plans done but are \nwaiting for funds. People could be at work on these by this summer. \nSome time government will be paying for these projects. Why not do the \nwork this year when it will help a weak economy?\n  I hope people don't get deluded into thinking that all we have to do \nis pass $150 billion, throw it out there in the next couple of months, \nand it is all over with. That is not going to happen. Better we do it \ncarefully. If we can get this money out by this summer and put people \nto work, it would be one of the best things we could do.\n  Again, keep in mind, when you give aid to the States for \ninfrastructure--think about this--put a new roof or remodel the school \nor whatever--think about this--the work is all done here. You can't \noutsource that. So the work is done here, the people who work here are \npaid here, and they spend their money here.\n  Secondly, most of the materials that go into construction are made in \nAmerica--your lights, your heating, your wiring, your drywall, windows, \ndoors, and rerods. When you think about it, it is almost all made in \nAmerica. There may be some things made elsewhere, but probably 90 \npercent of all the construction materials we use in this country are \nmade in America. That is why this multiplier effect is so big. So not \nonly do you employ people here, who spend their money here and help \ntheir families out, you are buying materials that are made somewhere \nelse in America. That helps those jobs and helps those people go to \nwork, whether it is making windows or doors or floors or faucets or \npiping or wiring or lightbulbs or whatever it might be.\n  So that is why I say that what I hear about coming from the House I \nthink really misses the point. It misses the point. Don't just throw \nmoney at the problem. Don't just throw money at it. And don't throw \nmoney at it in a way that people who make a lot more money than poor \npeople get a bigger piece of the pie. Let's put it where it really has \nan effect--food stamps, unemployment benefits, and investment in needed \ninfrastructure. If we just did those three things, that would do more \nto stop a recession in this country than anything we could do, and it \nwould do more to build for the future--to build for the future--than \nanything else we could do.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, we get a better package than what I am \nreading about. I hope when it comes over here that we will have it on \nthe floor, it will be open, and we will be able to offer amendments, \nand I hope we can be heard on this and we can offer these amendments to \ntry to focus this where it is really needed. To me, that is what a \nstimulus package ought to be about. No more trickle down. No more just \nthrowing money out there.\n  Everybody loves free money. What the heck, everybody loves free \nmoney. That is not the point. The point is, we are borrowing from our \nkids and grandkids. We ought to treat it carefully, be conservative \nabout it, and we ought to do what will get the most bang for the buck \nand lead to a more sound economy in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Iowa \nfor his terrific work on advocating for those who are most victimized \nby this recession, the elderly who need help on their heating and \nweatherization of their homes, the people who need food stamps, people \nwho have lost their jobs, people who have lost their health\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\ninsurance, people who are struggling the most. I wish to thank Senator \nHarkin for his work.\n  I wish to tell a story that I think illustrates the hardship among \nmiddle-class Americans, middle-class Ohioans, people who have worked \nhard, played by the rules, have seen their unemployment run out, or \nseen their job lost or seen the prices of gasoline and home heating and \nfood go so high that they cannot afford the middle-class lifestyle or \neven the subsistence living that has afflicted their lives.\n  I mentioned this story on the floor a couple times, but it so much \nillustrates Senator Harkin's words and Senator Harkin's solutions of \nextending unemployment, that gets money in people's pockets quickly; of \nhelping with food banks and food stamps and LIHEAP and all that.\n  Congress's response needs to be twofold. We need to stimulate the \neconomy, and the House version is a start, it is a good start, and we \nneed to help those who are most victimized by the recession.\n  In Logan, OH, in Hocking County, a county halfway between Columbus in \nCentral Ohio and Athens on the Ohio River, in Logan, OH, a southeast \nAppalachian county, on a cold December day about a month ago, at 3:30 \nin the morning people began to line up outside the United Methodist in \nLogan, the county seat of Hocking County, to get food. It was 3:30 in \nthe morning on a cold winter day. By 8 o'clock, cars were snaked around \nthe church and the neighborhood and up and down the streets when the \nfood panty opened. By 1 o'clock in the afternoon, 2,000 people--2,000 \npeople in a county of about 30,000--7 percent of the county, had come \nto this food pantry.\n  Many of those in this county had driven 20, 25 or 30 minutes to get \nthere, a county that has had problems in the past but a county where \nthat food bank served only a few dozen people 3 or 4 or 5 years ago.\n  Across the State, in Warren County, a relatively affluent community \noverall, a larger county northeast of Cincinnati down in southwest \nOhio, the head of the United Way told me 90 percent of their people who \ncome to their food pantries in their county, 90 percent of the people \nhave jobs.\n  The mayor of Denver told a group of us, the Presiding Officer was \nthere, that 40 percent of the homeless people in greater Denver are \nemployed. Underemployed, perhaps, employed obviously in low-wage jobs.\n  Tim, a gentleman from Cleveland, used to donate time and money to the \nlocal food bank and soup kitchen. He is still employed, but the costs \nwere consuming him and his family. He quit giving money to the food \nbank but continued to volunteer there. Now he is in a position where he \nrelies on those resources himself. He said he used to be middle class, \nbut he does not consider himself middle class any more because his \nwages have not kept pace with the cost of basic needs such as food, \nheat, and shelter.\n  He spoke of the great humility it took to go to the food bank for his \nown household. He said it is merely a drop in the bucket compared to \nwhat his family needs.\n  Today my office received an alarming e-mail from Ohio's Second \nHarvest. Second Harvest is a group of food banks that serve our State. \nThe e-mail mail explained that Second Harvest Food Bank of Southeastern \nOhio, which serves the area where Logan is, the community I mentioned \nearlier, is nearly out of food. For the fourth time in just over a \nyear, the e-mail said, they have come very close to closing their \ndoors; there is no relief in sight.\n  This problem is not unique to Ohio, it is affecting cities all over \nthis country. It is affecting rural areas, large cities, small towns, \nand suburbs. No community seems to be immune from this.\n  That is why our efforts are so very important. Senator Harkin had a \nchart that showed the importance of putting money directly into the \npockets of those who are most afflicted by this recession. That means \npeople who go to food banks; it means people on food stamps; it means \npeople who have problems paying their heating bill; it means people \nwhose unemployment has run out.\n  I appreciate the House action. As I said, the House has a good start, \nputting money into the pockets directly of middle-class taxpayers, of \nworking families. But we need to do more. The best thing we can do \nwhile we want to stimulate the economy, the best thing we can do is \nextend unemployment compensation. Because that money will be spent by \nthose people who are hurting because they lost their job, they cannot \nfind work, and their unemployment has run out.\n  Our proposal of $40 million that I introduced back in December may \nneed to be more than that, but that would be a good start, to get \npeople over December, January, February as these food banks have run \nout of food. That $40 million spread around the country will matter, as \nthese food banks say they are in the worst shape than any time in the \nlast 20 years. They are in worse shape because grocery stores donate \nless because they are more efficient, they damage fewer cans, they have \nless oversupply or waste that they donated to food banks in the past.\n  Obviously, the demand on these food banks is so much greater than it \nhas been. Again, I would also add that donations are down in January. \nThey always are after Christmas. People, as generous as they are at \nChristmas, sometimes sort of forget in January, so they are not getting \nhelp from the individuals and the community. Of course, the demands on \nthose food banks are higher.\n  So that stimulus package, while a good start in the House, putting \nmoney in the pockets of middle-class Americans and working Americans, \nneeds to go further and needing to go further is helping the most \nafflicted, pained, the people who need it most and have been victims of \nthis recession.\n  As Senator Harkin said, that money will then be spent in our \ncommunities with American-made products and will have a very good \nmultiplying effect for jump-starting our economy.\n  No one should go hungry in the richest country in the world. We are \nspending $3 billion a week on the war in Iraq. The tax cuts the \nPresident gave over the last 6 years resulted in huge numbers of \ndollars to the richest people, the richest 1 percent in this country. \nIt is time we dealt with some of the problems that are hurting people \nin Steubenville and Lima and Zanesville and Dayton and Cleveland and \nAkron and Youngstown and Warren in my State.\n  So I ask, as this bill comes to the Senate after House passage, that \nwe look seriously at the proposal Senator Harkin had to take care of \nfood stamps and food banks, to extend unemployment benefits, to take \ncare of seniors who simply cannot meet their heating bills as the \nwinter moves on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S274-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S274-S275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the stimulus package \nand the progress we are making, and the further progress we must make.\n  As is being reported, this morning the House is very close--probably \nalready there--on a bipartisan stimulus package. This in itself is good \nnews. Our economy is in poor shape. It is not simply the housing \nmarkets--where this started--but it is also now consumer spending. As \nhousing prices go down, because of the subprime crisis, consumers spend \nless, and it also creates a credit freeze. Now we are finding credit \nproblems not only in subprime loans and subprime securities but also \nwith the insurers, the insurance, the mortgage and other insurers, \nwhich makes the markets wonder: Are there credit problems elsewhere, \nwhich is the most frightening issue we might have.\n  With all of this happening, Chairman Bernanke's swift action made a \ngood deal of sense. But it must be matched by swift action by the \nexecutive branch of Government and the legislative branch of Government \nin putting together a stimulus package. I think the package--I have \nalways said, and I think most Democrats and Republicans would agree--\nthe centerpiece ought to be a tax cut, a tax refund check sent to the \nmiddle class.\n  It is the middle class that needs the help. It is the middle class \nthat would spend it the most quickly. It makes a great deal of sense. \nIt also makes sense to send it to those who are the working poor--not \nquite middle class--for the same reasons, even if they do not pay an \nincome tax. It also makes sense to send those checks to people on \nSocial Security who would file a tax return but might not pay even a \npayroll tax.\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\n  The bill the House has done in terms of the centerpiece is very good \nprogress. It has taken the tax rebate checks and aimed them right at \nthe middle class, where it should be, whereas the President's proposal \naimed them significantly higher. In the President's initial proposal, \nsomeone making $300,000 or $400,000 a year would get the full rebate, \nand families earning between $30,000 or $40,000 would get less than the \nfull amount, or nothing at all. So that is great progress.\n  I salute the House and Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Paulson and \nMinority Leader Boehner for their progress. But the package is not \ncomplete. While it is a very good first step, we need to move a little \nfurther. One of the things many of us on this side have always felt is \nthat spending stimuli are necessary. Most importantly--for efficiency \nreasons, to get the economy moving--the rebate tax checks will not get \ninto people's hands until May, at the earliest, maybe June, or maybe \neven July. Some say they will spend the money in anticipation of those \nchecks but not very many. Rebate tax checks, while they do have a very \nsignificant effect on boosting the economy, do not come close to being \nas efficient as unemployment insurance and lengthening the time, and \nmaybe changing and expanding the benefit temporarily.\n  CBO--nonpartisan--estimates for every $1 you spend on unemployment \ninsurance, you get a $1.64 boost to the economy. That is great. That is \nphenomenal. For every $1 you spend on a tax refund--it is still very \ngood, and still should be done--it is only $1.26.\n  We have always felt, again, that there ought to be two bookends, one \non each side of the centerpiece on tax spending refunds. One should be \nbusiness tax cuts. They should be aimed to be speedy and quick, but \nthey should be balanced off by some spending stimuli.\n  The House bill does not have spending stimuli, and it is something I \nbelieve many of my colleagues--certainly myself--are going to try very \nhard to add to the package. Those spending stimuli should focus on \nemployment insurance but could be for other things: money for summer \njobs; money, if it can be spent quickly, for infrastructure; money for \nnutrition assistance, things such as that. I think that will add more \nbalance to the package, but it will also make it more effective as a \ntool to stimulate the economy.\n  The second change I think we need is a focus on the housing prices. I \nsalute my colleagues in the House--Speaker Pelosi, Congressman Frank--\nbecause they worked hard to add some things we have been talking about \nfor a long time to deal with the housing crisis, the conforming loan \nlimit, and FHA reform. Those are very good and important because, after \nall, if the housing crisis is at the center of our problems, to ignore \nit, to work around it, is not doing everything we can to help eliminate \nor at least reduce the severity of a recession.\n  There are some other issues we should consider looking at as we move \nthe bill in the Senate. Most importantly, dollars--some spending; it \nwill not be very much, actually, but some spending for counseling, \nforeclosure avoidance counseling, which could prevent tens of \nthousands, hundreds of thousands of homes from being foreclosed on \nunnecessarily. There are many people in these homes who do have the \nability to refinance given their income, given their FICO scores, but \nthere is no one there to help them do it because the banks are no \nlonger on the scene. These counselors would work. Secretary Paulson has \ntold me the administration has no problem with this kind of proposal.\n  We did put $180 million in the last omnibus budget bill. Senator \nCasey, Senator Brown, myself, with Senator Murray's great help, \nspearheaded the charge on that. But we should do more. We should look \nat other housing additions as well. Again, they will have to be broadly \nsupported, bipartisan, and not hold up the package.\n  Finally, the third aspect we should talk about is we do need a second \nstimulus package to look at the long-range problems. We have many \ndifferent structural problems in the economy now. A long-range package \nthat would focus more on infrastructure, on trade adjustment \nassistance, on reforming unemployment insurance, and many other things, \nis very much needed. On the business side, too, tax credits for energy, \nfor instance, for clean energy and green energy, are something we \nshould seriously consider.\n  The third point I would make--and this is not at all a criticism of \nthe House because we always intended there be a first package that is \nquick, gets into the economy quickly, does not create controversy--we \nneed a second package aimed at the longer term.\n  In conclusion, this is a very good start. Again, I particularly \nsalute Speaker Pelosi and the House Democratic leadership for so \nimproving the President's proposal on the tax refund. I also salute \nMinority Leader Boehner and his Republican colleagues for working so \nclosely with the Democratic leadership on this issue.\n  But we do need more. We need some spending stimuli. We need more done \nto deal with the housing crisis, which is at the center of these \neconomic troubled times. And we do need a long-range package that aims \nat the structural problems in the economy. If we can do that, and add \non to the great start that has been made by the House, we will have \ndone the right thing in a bipartisan way to move this country forward \nand avoid a recession--unlikely, but it may be possible; let's hope and \npray--certainly a deep and long recession that would hurt so many \npeople and families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S275-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECONCILIATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on Sunday, January 20, Mikhail Saakashvili \nwas reinaugurated as President of the Republic of Georgia. He won an \nelection that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nOSCE, referred to as ``the first genuinely competitive presidential \nelection in the country, enabling the Georgian people to express their \npolitical choice.'' I wish President Saakashvili and the people of \nGeorgia well.\n  President Saakashvili's program of reform and integration into Euro-\nAtlantic institutions, such as NATO, depends on the strength of \nGeorgia's democracy. At the same time, membership in those institutions \nwill reinforce and protect Georgia's democracy.\n  When I spoke with President Saakashvili in November, I was confident \nthat he understood the close connection between these two goals. In \norder to achieve them, reconciliation between the President and his \npolitical opponents is essential.\n  Despite the findings of OSCE international monitors, the Georgian \nopposition repudiated the election's results and took to the street. In \n16 years of independence there has never been a peaceful transfer of \npower in Georgia. Perhaps the time has come to move the debate off the \nstreet and into Parliament.\n  In my 35 years in the Senate, I have seen just how powerful a vehicle \nfor change a democratically elected body can be. I hope the opposition \nparties will focus their energies on April's parliamentary elections, \nreinvigorating the Parliament and promoting progress from within.\n  On the same day that they gathered to elect a President, 73 percent \nof the Georgian electorate affirmed their interest in Georgia joining \nNATO. I support their aspirations and I am confident that the people of \nGeorgia, united by a sense of common purpose, can and will realize \ntheir full potential and achieve great things.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S275-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S275-S277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

This report is submitted \n     under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act, as amended.\n       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues \n     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of \n     S. Con. Res. 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for \n     Fiscal Year 2008, as approved by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Pursuant to section 204(a) of S. Con.

Con. Res. 21, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal\n  Year 2008, as adjusted pursuant to section 207(f), assumed\n  approximately $0.6 billion in budget authority and $48.6 billion in\n  outlays from emergency supplemental appropriations. Such emergency\n  amounts are exempt from the enforcement of the budget resolution.\n  Since current level totals exclude the emergency requirements enacted\n  in P.L. 110-28 (see footnote 1 of table 2), budget authority and\n  outlay totals specified in the budget resolution have also been\n  reduced (by the amounts assumed for emergency supplemental\n  appropriations) for purposes of comparison.\nAdditionally, section 207(c)(2)(E) of S. Con. Res. 21 assumed $145.2\n  billion in budget authority and $65.8 billion in outlays for overseas\n  deployment and related activities. Pending action by the Senate\n  Committee on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on the Budget has\n  directed that these amounts be excluded from the budget resolution\n  aggregates in the current level report.\n\\2\\ Current level is the estimated effect on revenue and spending of all\n  legislation that the Congress has enacted or sent to the President for\n  his approval. In addition, full-year funding estimates under current\n  law are included for entitlement and mandatory programs requiring\n  annual appropriations, even if the appropriations have not been made.\n\\3\\ Excludes administrative expenses of the Social Security\n  Administration, which are off-budget, but are appropriated annually.\nSource: Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\n  TABLE

Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlaw, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On September 22, 2007, Matthew Shetima was walking through an alley \nin Farmington, NM, when he encountered three men. Shetima, a gay man, \nclaims that Scott Thompson, 21, Jerry Paul, 40, and Craig Yazzie, 37, \nall from New Mexico, called him over as he walked by the men. According \nto the police report, the three men began to hit Shetima, all of them \ncalling him derogatory names as they struck him. According to the \npolice report, when he fell to the ground, at least one of the men \nasked him if he wanted to die as they continued to kick him. Shetima \nwas then pulled into the hotel room the three men were staying in, \nwhere the assault continued. Fortunately, Shetima was able to escape. \nThe district attorney prosecuting the case is seeking sentencing \nenhancements for all three men under New Mexico's hate crime law.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S277-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S277-S278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MICHIGAN TECH'S TUITION OFFER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Michigan Technological University's recent \ndecision to offer in State tuition to the children or spouse of anyone \non active military duty, regardless of their State of residence, \ndeserves our recognition and praise.\n  We are all deeply indebted to our men and women in uniform for their \nbravery and sacrifice. Michigan Tech is expressing thanks and showing \nsupport for the families of those serving in our armed services in a \nway that will make a real difference.\n  While out-of-State students at Michigan Tech pay over $21,000 for \ntuition, in State tuition is less than $10,000 each year. This savings \nwill be available to the families of the 1.3 million men and women who \nare on Active Duty in the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marines, Navy, \nNational Guard and Reserve, as well as the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration and United States Public Health Service \nCorps. We believe that Michigan Tech is the first college or university \nin the Nation to extend in State tuition to the families of all \nmilitary personnel serving on Active Duty.\n  The idea developed after an applicant to a State university in \nMichigan received an admission offer but was denied in State tuition \neven though he graduated from a Michigan high school. His father was \nserving on Active Duty and had been stationed in Michigan but was moved \nout-of-State,\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\nprompting the tuition decision. Michigan Tech's new policy would allow \nthis student, along with many others, to receive in State tuition if \nadmitted. Hopefully this decision will be followed by other colleges \nand universities as well.\n  The university's fight song, ``Fight Tech, Fight!'' includes the \nline: ``From Northern hills we'll sound our cry, we'll ring your \npraises to the sky!'' This is an important decision by Michigan Tech \nthat deserves praise and, from the hills of Michigan's upper peninsula, \nit is a decision that will undoubtedly be heard and appreciated by \nmilitary families across the country and our brave men and women \nstationed around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S278-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   U.S. WITHDRAWAL OF LETTERS TO CUBA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, with Florida's marine \nenvironment and tourism economy threatened by potential drilling a mere \n45 miles off its coast, and a communist regime ruling Cuba, we find \nourselves in a difficult situation. We must do all that we can to \nprotect our Nation's natural treasures while at the same time \nemphasizing that the undemocratic Castro government has no right to \nspeak for the people of Cuba.\n  That is why I have asked President Bush to withdraw the letters that \nthe United States exchanges with Cuba every 2 years. This exchange of \nletters is the only thing enforcing the 1977 Maritime Boundary \nAgreement between the United States and Cuba, and incidentally, one of \nthe only rationales the Castro government has for drilling just 45 \nmiles off of our pristine coast.\n  We have seen what oil spills have done in other parts of the country \nand around the world. I am not prepared to take chances with Florida's \ncoral reefs and other marine life, nor with the livelihoods of millions \nof Floridians who depend on tourism for their economic well-being. The \ncontinued exchange of these letters leaves the door open to economic \nand environmental disaster and the enrichment of the Castro regime.\n  And so, I urge the administration to join me in closing this door on \ndisaster and to protect Florida by withdrawing these letters now. \nShould Cuba gain a democratically elected government as envisioned by \nthe Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity--or LIBERTAD--Act of 1996, \nwe could consider renegotiating our boundary agreement so that it \nclearly protects the environment. Until that time, however, withdrawing \nthese letters is the best and first step towards protecting the people \nand environment of Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S278-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE VILLAGE OF EASTLAKE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate Leon N. Weiner & Associates for their success with the \nVillage of Eastlake in Wilmington, DE. For almost 60 years, Leon N. \nWeiner & Associates has been doing outstanding work for the housing \nindustry in Delaware and surrounding areas. Their work on the Village \nof Eastlake has made such a positive impact that the readers of \nAffordable Housing Finance Magazine recently named it the Nation's best \naffordable home ownership development.\n  The Eastlake neighborhood, which was built in 1943, was locally known \nas ``the Bucket,'' meaning if people lived in Eastlake, they had hit \nthe bottom of the bucket. The 267-unit public housing development, one \nof many in a crime-ridden neighborhood, became dilapidated despite the \nbest efforts of the Wilmington Housing Authority. Violent crime and \ndrug abuse grew to proportions exceeding some of the worst per capita \ncrime rates in the Nation. In 1997 alone, Wilmington police were called \nto Eastlake over 5,000 times.\n  After a decade of work, Leon N. Weiner & Associates transformed the \nsite, which is about the size of three city blocks, into the Village of \nEastlake, an affordable housing project consisting of 70 rental and 90 \nhome ownership units. Furthermore, their work here has helped jumpstart \nadditional affordable housing projects in the city of Wilmington. A \nnonprofit and a for-profit firm have teamed up to build 72 town homes \nin the neighborhood, as well.\n  All 90 units--62 town homes and 28 duplexes--at Eastlake consist of \nthree bedrooms. The homes are reserved for households with widely \nvarying incomes--as low as 26 percent of the area median income up to a \nhigh of 115 percent. Fifty-nine homes are reserved for households \nearning between 26 percent and 80 percent of the area median income.\n  The success of Eastlake could not have been reached without the added \nhelp and efforts of many other entities, including the U.S. Department \nof Housing and Urban Development, PNC Bank, the Federal Home Loan Bank \nof Pittsburgh, and the State of Delaware, which provided much needed \nfunds.\n  Once again, I wish to recognize Leon N. Weiner & Associates. Their \nwork in the Eastlake community is commendable and most deserving of \nAffordable Housing Finance Magazine's Reader's Choice Award. They are \nan invaluable asset to our community, and I wish them all the best.\n  On a point of personal privilege, Leon Weiner, who passed away in \n2002, was a personal friend of mine for over three decades. In fact, he \nwas one of the first people I met after enrolling in the University of \nDelaware's MBA program in 1973. More importantly, throughout his life \nhe was one of the strongest voices in this country calling for the \ncreation of affordable housing for all Americans. He fervently believed \nthat all families need and deserve a decent place to live, and he \nworked tirelessly to ensure that government, the private sector, and \nnonprofits work together in pursuit of this goal. Unfortunately, he did \nnot live to see one of his last dreams Eastlake become a reality, but \nit serves as a fitting memorable to him and to the team of dedicated \nmen and women he led at Leon N. Weiner & Associates. Together, they \ndemonstrated and continue to demonstrate that it is possible to do good \nand do well at the same time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S278-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S278-S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF COLONEL BARBARA BRUNO\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great \nAmerican and a true military hero who has honorably served our country \nfor 26 years in the Army and Army Nurse Corps: COL Barbara J. Bruno has \na true passion for nursing and served in a variety of clinical nursing \nand leadership positions at various Army medical facilities.\n  Her tremendous leadership skills led to her selection for long-term \nschooling to obtain an advanced degree in nursing and subsequent \nselection for director of the operation room nurse course. Colonel \nBruno served with distinction in a series of senior leadership \npositions as Army nurse corps staff officer, AMEDD personnel proponency \ndirectorate, chief nurse, 30th Medical Brigade deputy commander for \nnursing, chief nurse 67th Combat Support Hospital personnel management \nofficer, and chief, perioperative nursing services. In every \ncircumstance, Colonel Bruno was recognized for her clinical excellence \nand loyal, dedicated, and stellar leadership.\n  In 2004, Colonel Bruno was appointed the deputy chief of the Army \nNurse Corps. As deputy chief, Colonel Bruno developed and implemented \npolicies and procedures that affected nearly 35,000 nursing personnel \nthroughout the Army. She spearheaded several recruitment and retention \ninitiatives to include the Funded Nurse Education Program, the \nProfessional Nurse Education Program, the Registered Nurse First Assist \nProgram, and increased capacity for the Army Enlisted Commissioning \nProgram. Her tenacity also led to additional recruitment options and \nincentive pays to retain our highly qualified nurse officers. As chair \nof the Federal Nursing Service Council, she sponsored the development \nof a Federal nursing research model that focused on improved soldier \nreadiness and patient care outcomes.\n  Colonel Bruno's accomplishments are eloquent testimony to her talent, \ndedication, loyalty, and determination to see that the best possible \nnursing care is always available to our soldiers, their family members, \nand our deserving retirees. Colonel Bruno has established a legacy of \nsuperior performance to be emulated by all, and her performance \nreflects greatly on herself, the U.S. Army, the Department of Defense, \nand the United States of America. I extend my deepest appreciation on \nbehalf\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\nof a grateful nation for her dedicated service.\n  Congratulations to COL Barbara J. Bruno. I wish her Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S279-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO THE VANDERVLIET FAMILY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

This award goes to the VanDerVliet family: Rod \nand Lois VanDerVliet and their children, Ryan and Sarah VanDerVliet, \nLisa and Jamie Johnson, and Lori and Ryan Fods; and their grandchildren \nRhegan Oberg, Tyson VanDerVliet, Weston VanDerVliet, Parker Johnson, \nDevin Fods, and Clara VanDerVliet.\n  For over 30 years the VanDerVliets have raised livestock and grain on \ntheir farm west of Colton, SD. Today, Rod's son Ryan, daughters Lisa \nand Lori, and son-in-law Ryan are an important part of the farm \noperation. Over the past several years the family has navigated the \nquickly changing farm industry and successfully utilized technology to \nensure that the farm stays competitive and productive.\n  Although Rod VanDerVliet sees farms becoming more business oriented \nthan ever, he and his family love the farming lifestyle. Rod enjoys it \nbecause of its flexibility, connection to nature, and most importantly, \nbecause it is something that involves the whole family. Ryan shares his \ndad's love of farming and says he ``like[s] being around the animals \nand the farming lifestyle.'' Both men would like to pass this way of \nlife on to the next generation. And, with six grandchildren under the \nage of six, there shouldn't be any shortage of help.\n  The family's hard work has passed beyond the farmyard and into the \ncommunity. The children grew up participating in 4-H and FFA. Rod has \nserved on the Colton Farmers Elevator Board for more than 20 years and \nthe MCWC Rural Water Board; Ryan serves on the township board, and the \nentire family is involved in numerous community organizations and \nactivities.\n  The VanDerVliets are an example of families that embody South Dakota \nvalues and form the bedrock of our great State. I am very proud to see \na family-run farm successfully evolving in the changing industry while \nmaintaining a commitment to their community and family. I commend them \nfor this award, and I wish them continued success in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S279-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LARRY HEALY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I honor Larry Healy, who has \nbeen named the 2008 Agri-Business Citizen of the Year. Larry has been \nemployed by Campbell Supply Company for 20 years, and currently manages \none of its Sioux Falls stores. He is also actively engaged in community \nactivities and embodies the true spirit of the American farmer.\n  Larry grew up in Montrose, SD, where he first worked in his father's \nwelding and repair shop before becoming employed in the farm department \nat Campbell Supply in Sioux Falls. In 1990, he was promoted to store \nmanager at the Rock Rapids, IA, store, a position in which he proudly \nserved for 11 years.\n  In 2001, Larry transferred back to Sioux Falls where he continued to \nserve as store manager. Since then, Larry has become involved with the \nSioux Falls Area Chamber of Commerce Agri-Business Division, where he \nhas served on the Agri-Business Division Council and volunteers with \nAgri-Business activities.\n  Larry chaired the Ag Appreciation Day for 2 years and has worked with \nthe chamber and hundreds of volunteers on events such as an event \nduring the Sioux Empire Fair that provided a complimentary meal to \napproximately 5,000 area farmers. He also chaired the Ag Division in \n2006-07.\n  Larry is proud to work for Campbell Supply Company, which has been \nfamily owned since its founding. The Campbell family believes in giving \nback to the community and supporting local agriculture, something Larry \nsincerely appreciates because he understands the important role farmers \nplay in American cities and towns.\n  Larry sets a fine example for all involved in advancing our Nation's \ngreat agricultural foundations.

A bill to provide for the safe development of a repository \nat the Yucca Mountain site in the State of Nevada, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Amendments Act of 2008.\n  I have said many times on this Senate floor that we do have a crisis \nin energy and that we need all of the following: We need nuclear \nenergy, but we also need clean coal technology, we need oil and gas, we \nneed renewables. We need all of the above. I feel very strongly about \nthis, and I know there is a disagreement on that issue, even within our \ncommittee. But I am concerned about the continued delays in opening our \nNation's repository at Yucca Mountain, that it would hinder the \nresurgence of nuclear energy in the United States. It seems as though \nright now we are making a major breakthrough. People who were objecting \nto nuclear energy just a few years ago are now realizing that it is \nclean, it is safe, it is abundant. Not that I use France as our model \nvery often, but in this case, they are between 80 and 90 percent \nnuclear, and they have done the right thing.\n  A bit of history on this. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 \nestablished a program to locate and develop a repository for nuclear \nwaste, including both Defense waste, a legacy from the Cold War, and \ncivilian spent fuel. In 2002, after 20 years of research, the President \nrecommended to the Congress that Yucca Mountain should be developed as \nthe repository. The State of Nevada objected. I wasn't surprised to see \nthat happen, and it did. It certainly is their right to do so under the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act. However, Congress passed a joint resolution \naffirming or reaffirming the administration's recommendation of Yucca \nMountain with strong bipartisan majorities in both Houses.\n  The location has been decided. The debate is no longer in existence \nof whether a repository should be built at Yucca Mountain. That \ndecision was made in 2002. The task that remains is to develop a \nrepository that protects public health and safety and the environment, \na permanent solution for our Nation's nuclear waste. It is high time we \naccomplish these tasks now. This is very serious. We passed laws and \nresolutions to do it. We have collected over $27 billion--that is with \na ``b''--$27 billion for electricity from consumers to pay for it. The \ncourts have affirmed and reaffirmed that we have the obligation--not \nthe legal right to do it, the legal obligation.\n  Now, I am frustrated that the Department of Energy is 20 years behind \nschedule. However, I am pleased that DOE appears to have made \nsignificant progress in the past few years and will hopefully file a \nlicense application this year, despite the persistent assault on \nprogram funding.\n  I understand that opposition to Yucca Mountain remains, advocating \nthat we abandon it in favor of interim storage. There have been many \nproposals on interim storage, and I expect there will be more in the \nfuture, but we have interim storage right now at 121 locations in 39 \nStates. Make no mistake, interim storage is a temporary fix. It forces \nfuture generations to solve a problem that we ought to be resolving \ntoday. It is time to move forward with a permanent solution at Yucca \nMountain.\n  I have visited the site. I have a question for those who would want \nto abandon Yucca Mountain: If you can't build a repository in the \nmiddle of a mountain in the middle of a desert, where should it be?\n  Let's think about this for a minute. The logical first step to \nfinding a new repository site is to begin by reevaluating sites that \nhave been considered before. I have a map--which is not here, but it \nwill be here before I finish talking--showing the 37 States that DOE \nand its predecessor, the Energy Research Development Administration, \nhave evaluated in the past based on the presence of favorable geologic \nformations. Those States are Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, \nGeorgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nMichigan, Minnesota, and it goes on and on, including my State of \nOklahoma--37 of the 50 States. Now, 37 States have been considered as \npossible candidates for developing a repository. Does it really make \nsense to abandon a site where we have already invested 25 years and $8 \nbillion before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission even considers it, \nonly to turn around and start from scratch, reevaluating sites in 37 \nStates? I don't think so.\n  As the generation that has benefited from the use of nuclear energy \nand the resulting spent fuel, I believe it is incumbent upon us to \nmanage spent fuel in a manner that is fair to current generations and \ngenerations to come, and the bill I am introducing now will do just \nthat.\n  DOE has indicated there are legislative provisions they need to \ncomplete the licensing process and begin construction of the repository \nour electricity consumers have paid some $27 billion for already. \nSenators Domenici and Craig introduced their NU-WAY bill, S. 37, which \nincludes those provisions within the jurisdiction of Environment and \nPublic Works. My bill includes the remaining DOE provisions that are \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nMy bill goes beyond that. My bill will incorporate a flexible framework \nfor future generations to apply their knowledge and innovations to \nimprove the repository.\n  The task at hand is to develop a safe repository using state-of-the-\nart technology and cutting-edge science. The trouble is technology that \nis state of the art now won't be 50 years from now, much less 100 years \nfrom now. When you are making decisions on how to develop a facility \nthat will be safe for up to a million years, we should not limit \nourselves to science and technology that is available today. We should \nestablish a flexible framework that incorporates technological advances \ninto the facility design over time, one that allows our grandchildren \nand great-grandchildren to improve on the project we have started. In \nother words, we know that even though we are using the million-year \nbenchmark, things are going to happen next year and the year after and \nthe year after where we can have dramatic improvements. But the one \nthing we have to do is make the decision today--or keep the decision \nthat has already been made.\n  Several international bodies, including the National Academy of \nSciences and the International Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development's Nuclear Energy Agency, have advocated repository \ndevelopment in stages that will incorporate technological advances over \ntime--just what\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\nwe are talking about. The reformed licensing process in this bill \nintegrates that concept into the current licensing process. My bill \nreforms the licensing process for authorizing construction, operation, \nand closure of the repository.\n  I have to say we have come a long way already on this. When I became \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Clean Air within this committee, we had \nnot had an oversight committee hearing on the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission for 12 years. I don't care what the bureaucracy is, you have \nto have oversight. Well, we have come a long way.\n\n  The threshold for approval of construction of a repository is based \non a determination that the facility could be safely operated for 300 \nyears. During this time, a long-term science and technology program \nwill be established to monitor and analyze the repository's performance \nand to conduct research into technologies that would improve the \nfacility. The repository license will be amended every 50 years at a \nminimum to incorporate these improvements. During this phase, waste \nwould remain retrievable so that future generations may recover \nvaluable material or upgrade disposal systems, for example.\n  When the DOE applies to permanently close the repository, it must \nthen demonstrate compliance with EPA's radiation standard before \nceasing operations at the site. Until then, the facility will be \nsubject to the strict NRC regulation and oversight as an operating \nfacility.\n  Today, this program has been litigated into a corner. After several \nlawsuits, the EPA has responded by drafting a radiation standard for 1 \nmillion years. That is right, based on what we know today, DOE must \nprove a reasonable expectation that Yucca Mountain will be safe for 1 \nmillion years before DOE can even begin building a repository. This is \na ridiculous and arrogant requirement that assumes we know right now \nall that will ever be known about the management of spent nuclear fuel \nand its impact on public health and safety. That compliance decision \nonly makes sense when DOE decides to close the repository and cease \noperations. Until that time, repository enhancements reflecting 300 \nyears of scientific innovation will improve its protection of public \nhealth and safety and, I might add, the environment.\n  Now, my approach is not about kicking the can down the road and \nforcing future generations to solve the problem. That is what concerns \nme about a lot of the things we do around here. My wife and I have 20 \nkids and grandkids, and they are the ones who are going to be doing a \nlot of the things we should be doing today. My approach is about \nmeeting a legal and moral obligation to build the best facility we can \nnow, laying a solid foundation for future generations to improve it \nbased on what they learn.\n  I am confident we can build a repository that will protect public \nhealth and safety and the environment, but I am equally confident that \n50 years from now our grandchildren could build a better one. Fifty \nyears from now, they will have learned a lot about the actual \nperformance of repositories; something we can only predict right now, \nthey will know by that time. Fifty years from now, the waste placed in \nthe repository may require isolation for a few hundred years instead of \na million.\n  Lastly, my bill includes provisions necessary to support new nuclear \nplant construction. Before receiving a license, nuclear plants must \nmeet two requirements. The first is that companies must sign a contract \nwith DOE to provide for the disposal of spent fuel. My bill modifies \nthose provisions in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to make them current. \nThe second is known as waste confidence. Nuclear plants must \ndemonstrate there is confidence that the spent fuel will be managed and \ndisposed of in a manner that protects health and safety. My bill \nclarifies that the repository program meets this requirement for \ndisposal.\n  So when a society takes on the task of building a complex, first-of-\na-kind facility envisioned to remain robust for a million years, it \nimmediately raises questions about generational equity. As Senators, we \nmust balance fairness to the future generations that haven't been born \nyet with fairness to the generations we currently represent. Finding \nthat balance must be based on several principles, including protecting \nthe health and safety of current generations; protecting the health and \nsafety of future generations; minimizing the impact on the environment; \nmeeting the need for reliable, cost-effective energy; meeting legal \nobligations; minimizing taxpayer liability; and the costs are covered \nby those who benefit from the waste. My bill adheres to these \nprinciples and strikes that balance.\n  Rumors of Yucca Mountain's demise have been highly exaggerated. It is \ntime we focus on developing the safest state-of-the-art repository we \ncan, one step at a time. We owe it to our generation and to the \ngenerations that follow.\n  I have to say, regarding all of the emphasis recently on the concern \nwe have for the environment, nothing is cleaner, nothing has been shown \nbetter for the environment than this type of energy, which we have to \nhave in our mix.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mrs. Clinton,  Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Obama, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \n        Cardin, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 2554. A bill to restore, reaffirm, and reconcile legal rights and \nremedies under civil rights statutes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues \nSenators Leahy, Dodd, Bingaman, Kerry, Harkin, Mikulski, Akaka, Boxer, \nFeingold, Murray, Durbin, Schumer, Cantwell, Clinton, Lautenberg, \nObama, Menendez, Cardin, and Brown in introducing the Civil Rights Act \nof 2008. This legislation is vital to realizing the full promise of our \ncivil rights laws and labor laws to protect all of America's people.\n  Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America. Prejudice, \ndiscrimination, and outright bigotry continue to limit the lives of \nlarge numbers of our people. Unfortunately, in recent years, the \nSupreme Court has rolled back some of the core statutory protections \nfor civil rights and workers' rights. The Civil Rights Act of 2008 will \nstrengthen existing civil rights protections and restore the bedrock \nprinciple that individuals may challenge all forms of discrimination in \npublic services.\n  It has long been clear that effective enforcement of civil rights and \nfair labor practices is possible only if individuals themselves are \nable to seek relief in court. Our legislation will strengthen existing \nprotections in cases where the courts have let us down by narrowing \nindividuals' right to demand accountability for discrimination.\n  Key elements of our proposals will make it easier for working women \nto enforce their right to equal pay for equal work. Our bill enhances \nprotections against discrimination in federally funded services, and \nenacts needed safeguards for students who are harassed because of their \nnational origin, gender, race, or disability.\n  We make sure that victims of discrimination and unfair labor \npractices can receive meaningful damages where appropriate. Our \nlegislation will also enable members of our Armed Forces to enforce \ntheir Federal right to be free from discrimination by States because of \ntheir military status.\n  In addition, our legislation will ensure that older workers who \nsuffer age discrimination are not denied the chance to seek relief \nbecause they work for a State government. It will also prevent \nemployers from requiring workers to sign away their right to bring \ndiscrimination claims and fair labor claims in court, in order to \nobtain a job or keep a job.\n  This bill is a needed step in restoring the effective remedies that \nour civil rights laws and fair labor laws must have in order to ensure \naccountability for discrimination. America will never be America until \nwe do.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, our great Nation was founded on the \nfundamental principle that all persons are created equal. We have long \ncommitted, and recommitted, ourselves to ensuring that all persons have \nthe\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\nright to prosper through hard work and ingenuity. However, for many \nAmericans, those rights still remain illusory. Today, we introduce a \ncomprehensive bill to vindicate our founding principles and make the \npromise of equal opportunity in the workplace a reality for all \nAmericans.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the Civil Rights Act of 2008, and I thank \nSenator Ted Kennedy for his leadership in the Senate on this issue, and \nRepresentative John Lewis for his leadership in the House. I have been \na long-time supporter of efforts to rid the workplace of unlawful \ndiscrimination, and I believe the Civil Rights Act of 2008 is critical \nto achieving that important goal. We must continue to fight to end all \nworkplace discrimination, including discrimination based on sexual \norientation.\n  This legislation we are introducing today responds to several \ndisappointing decisions by conservative courts. These court rulings \nhave misconstrued congressional intent, and have had the effect of \nlimiting important civil rights protections provided by Congress.\n  A 2000 decision from the Supreme Court of the United States greatly \nrestricted the capacity of workers who suffer age discrimination to sue \nfor full relief. In Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents, the Supreme \nCourt ruled that, contrary to Congress's original intent, State \nemployers do not have to provide back pay or other monetary damages \nwhen workers are discriminated against based on age. As a result, \nmillions of State workers who are 40 or over lost the right to back \npay. This bill would restore Congress's original intent that State \nemployers give workers full relief for age discrimination, including \nback pay.\n  The bill would clarify the standard for challenging employment \npractices that have an unjustified discriminatory impact on older \nworkers. It would make clear that the standard of proof in cases \nalleging a disparate impact based on age is the same as in cases \nalleging a disparate impact based on race, color, gender, national \norigin, or religion.\n  The bill would also restore the rights of victims of discrimination--\nin the workplace or otherwise--to challenge practices that have a \ndisparate impact on certain communities based on race, national origin, \nsex, age, or disability. Since the Supreme Court's decision 7 years ago \nin Alexander v. Sandoval, individuals can no longer challenge \ndiscrimination by entities that receive Federal funding without facing \nthe high burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\n  Currently, only the Federal Government has the right to challenge \nsophisticated forms of discrimination--by federally funded entities--\nthat fall disproportionately on certain minority groups. So if a State \ndecided to administer a driver's license exam only in English, rather \nthan administering the exam in multiple languages, a non-English \nspeaker would be denied his or her right to have their day in court. \nThis measure returns the Federal law to our original intentions by \nallowing individuals a right to challenge such practices:\n  These added protections provide a significant step forward in the \nfulfillment of our goal to eliminate the footprint of unlawful \ndiscrimination from the workplace and broader society. Civil rights \nlegislation over the last 44 years--including antidiscrimination in the \nworkplace laws--represents some of Congress's greatest achievements. \nWith the passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991, the Age \nDiscrimination Act of 1975, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \nCongress gave victims of discrimination a way to address the wrongs \nthat they have suffered and put teeth into the sanctions faced by those \nwho unlawfully discriminate against their victims.\n  Despite these gains, efforts to eliminate bias from the workplace and \nlarger society have been largely eroded by decisions from conservative \njurists on the Supreme Court and other Federal courts. Year after year, \nconservative courts have rolled back rights by denying certain types of \nrelief and taking certain tools--designed to fight intentional and \nsophisticated forms of workplace discrimination--from individual \nworkers. This bill would reverse that rollback, and restore the rights \nof victims to have their day in court and to have meaningful remedies \nwhen those rights are violated.\n  Discrimination on the basis of certain personal characteristics has \nno place in any workplace or in any State in America. It is long \noverdue for Congress to reinforce Americans' protections against bias \nin the workplace and eradicate barriers to full and equal participation \nin our society.\n  The time for this bill is now. It is particularly important that, on \nthe week our Nation observes and honors the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., Congress has introduced this bill. We must remain vigilant \nin ensuring our precious civil rights, which generations of Americans \nfought and bled to protect, remain available for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2556.

Mr. President, I was hoping that at this time today we \nwould be talking about the work we had done on the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act. But we were unable to do that. What an unusual day. \nWe were not allowed to vote on anything on this bill. I hope our \nfriends in the press have been able to witness what took place today.\n  We talk about last year the Republicans having caused us to try to \ninvoke cloture more in 1 year than had ever happened in a Congress \nbefore. In 1 year, they obstructed more things than ever in the history \nof the country.\n  Now we are starting this year, and they are objecting to their own \nbills. The President wants the bill passed. Every one of the \nRepublicans--all 49 of them, I assume--will vote for this bill. So all \nthey would need to pass it is two Democrats. I would have to suggest \nthey probably could do that. They are so afraid they may take a vote \nthat may not be something they want to take that they stop everything.\n  This is the President's program. It is not our program. We have stood \nby since 9/11 telling the President: Anything that you need, we are \nhere at\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\nyour disposal. Just tell us what you need and we will do it. We only \nhave one request--let's do it legally, constitutionally. If the present \nlaw is not sufficient, tell us what you need changed.\n  We have been standing with our arms out since 9/11. But what we have \nlearned now, since 9/11, is basically the President does not care what \nwe do because he has been told--and he accepts the advice given to him \nby a man by the name of John Yoo, among others--that the President does \nnot need to follow any law that Congress passes, that he is above the \nlaw. I am not making this up. This is the fact. Mr. Yoo has stated so \nbefore the world on television: The President does not need to follow \nany law that we pass. But in spite of that, we have said: Mr. \nPresident, we are willing to work with you. We don't think you have \nthat authority. But here we are today, with the law about to expire, \nand the Vice President having made a speech yesterday, and the \nPresident making a statement today saying: They have to pass that bill.\n  As I explained in some detail earlier today, they put us in a Catch-\n22. No matter what we do, it does not meet their expectations. So I \nagain repeat, I hope the press is watching this. I hope people who \nbelieve in good government are watching this. I hope the people are not \ngoing to accept Monday night, during the speech that he is going to \ngive, or any statements made between now and the State of the Union \nAddress, that we are holding up his legislation. We are not holding it \nup. The Republicans in the Senate are holding it up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/24/senate-section/article/S302-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.
