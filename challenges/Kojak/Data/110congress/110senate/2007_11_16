Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour of debate prior to the cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to S. 2340.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today we have an opportunity before us. \nWith the bill we will consider, we can do what the American people have \nasked us to do. We can begin to bring the war in Iraq to a close.\n  More than 3,800 of our servicemembers have died. In fact, as we know, \n2007 has been the deadliest year so far in Iraq. And while we spend \nbillions of dollars in Iraq, the list of safety, health, and \ninfrastructure needs at home is stacking up.\n  Today it is time to begin redeploying our troops, rebuilding our \nmilitary, and getting back to fighting the war on terror.\n  I was one of the 23 Senators who voted against the war in Iraq, and \nsince then I have voted time and time again to get us out of this war. \nThat is why I support the bridge funding that is being offered by \nSenator Reid this morning that we will consider.\n  This bill provides $50 billion to make sure our troops have what they \nneed to do their job and it requires the President to begin redeploying \ntroops out of Iraq within 30 days after he signs this into law. Our \ngoal with this legislation is to be out of Iraq by the end of next \nyear. And importantly, unlike the bill being offered by the other side, \nit is not a blank check. It requires American personnel, including the \nCIA, to follow Army Field Manual rules on torture, it requires the \nmilitary to give our troops at least a year to rest in between tours of \nduty, and to ensure that they are battle ready before going into war. \nSo this morning I urge our colleagues to seize this opportunity and put \nAmerican lives, American security, and America's future first and begin \nto change direction in Iraq.\n  Earlier this year, President Bush promised us his troop surge was \ngoing to improve security and allow Iraqis to stabilize their own \ncountry, but that is not working. The Washington Post reported Thursday \nthat senior military commanders in Iraq are now saying that the \ninflexibility of the Shiite government is the key threat facing the \nU.S. effort there.\n  We have given the Iraqi Government every chance to step up and take \ncontrol. We have done our part. The Iraqi Government has not done its \npart. And in the meantime--while more than 150,000 of our troops are \npolicing a civil war in Iraq--we have become more vulnerable overseas. \nTerrorist attacks have risen almost fivefold since 9/11.\n  The President has hidden in his bunker and stubbornly refused to \npursue the strategy needed to bring stability in Iraq. It is time for \nhim to face facts. It is time for the Iraqis to take control of their \nown country and for us to redeploy our troops where they are most \nneeded.\n  Our bill will allow us to rebuild our military, which is stretched \ntoo thin. Generals have testified to Congress that the war in Iraq has \nweakened our military readiness, destroyed our equipment, hurt our \nability to respond to disasters here at home, and left our troops \nstressed and without fully rounded training. We need to make sure our \ntroops are trained for whatever conflict they face, and changing the \ndirection in Iraq allows us to do that.\n  We need to fight and win the war on terror and rebuild our military. \nWe also need to be there to support our servicemembers, our veterans, \nand their families. Our veterans have had to struggle to get basic care \nbecause this administration has put them on the back burner. We learned \nthis week that, tragically, thousands of our veterans didn't get the \nhelp they needed and they took their own lives. CBS reported that in \n2005 alone, 6,256 veterans committed suicide--a rate twice that of \nother Americans. That is shocking.\n  The bill we are working on today, and that we hope we can get enough \nvotes for, will ensure we are meeting our veterans' needs every step of \nthe way, from the day they are recruited, while they are trained, while \nthey are deployed, and as they transition back home.\n  Finally, while President Bush has waged war overseas, he has insisted \non paying for it in ways that have left us tragically underfunded here \nat home. Democrats have taken the right steps to reinvest in the many \nparts of our budget that have been neglected. We have got to move \nforward. I hope we can move this legislation that has been offered on \nour side, because the war in Iraq is not making us more secure, it is \nmaking us less secure. It is hurting how our Nation is perceived around \nthe world, it is hurting our military, it is hurting our veterans, and \nit is hurting our security at home.\n  Today we have an opportunity to make progress, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bridge funding and send a message to the \nPresident that it is time to change course in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may speak for up to 7 \nminutes. The balance of the time on the Democratic side has already \nbeen allocated.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I request 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we face an opportunity to change the \ncourse and the direction of our policy in Iraq. The other body, the \nHouse of Representatives, has sent a provision--a bridge appropriations \nsupplemental--to us, which includes language that would change this \npolicy. It would change our missions, it would establish a goal to \ncomplete the transition to this new mission by the end of next year, \nand it would invest resources, energy, and effort in diplomacy as well \nas military activity. I think it is critical to do that.\n  We have, for the last several months, seen an increase in American \nforces on the ground, and the sheer presence and effectiveness of \nAmerican forces has created some tactical momentum in terms of the \nsecurity situation. But the fundamental challenge remains to get the \npolicy right in Iraq, and that is the responsibility of the Government \nof Iraq. In January of this year, 2007, the President announced his \nsurge and he said:\n\n       I have made it clear to the prime minister and Iraq's other \n     leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the \n     Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, \n     it will lose the support of the American people and it \n     will lose the support of the Iraqi people.\n\n  Well, those individuals in this body who oppose the House provision, \nthe changed missions, are essentially declaring that there is an open-\nended commitment; that we will not condition our resources and our \neffort in Iraq. I think that is wrong. And, in fact, it is wrong \nbecause what has been acknowledged over the last several days is the \nfact that the Iraqi political leaders have not seized on the situation \nin Iraq. They have not followed through.\n  The President proposed his surge because he thought the Government of \nIraq would have the breathing space it needed to make progress in other \ncritical areas. No such significant progress has been made. Yesterday, \non the front page of The Washington Post, Tom Ricks wrote:\n\n       Senior military commanders here now portray the \n     intransigence of Iraq's Shiite-dominated government as the \n     key threat facing\n\n[[Page S14579]]\n\n     the U.S. effort in Iraq, rather than al-Qaida terrorists, \n     Sunni insurgents, or Iranian-backed militias.\n\n  General Odierno, our tactical commander, the corps commander, \nindicated if that doesn't happen--i.e., the Government taking charge--\nwe are going to have to review our strategy. Well, that is not taking \nplace. We have to review our strategy. Indeed, we have to change our \nstrategy. We have to have a strategy with limited missions, \ncounterterrorism, force protection, training Iraqi security forces. \nThose are the missions embedded in the supplemental bridge legislation \npassed by the House. Those are the missions we should pursue. Those are \nthe missions that are essential to our security.\n  The Iraqi people, the Iraqi Government, must solve their own internal \nproblems. We have given them space. They have not used it. Now we must \nseize on those mission which will protect the United States without an \nopen-ended, unlimited commitment of our forces and our resources.\n  I urge that all of our colleagues join together in a bipartisan \nfashion and strongly support the supplemental bridge legislation \nproposed by the House, including conditions which are essential to our \nprogress forward in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be yielded 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is only 3\\1/2\\ minutes that \nhave not been allocated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask I be yielded that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again the Senate has an opportunity to \naddress the situation in Iraq. This morning, we are considering a \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 4156 that contains a so-called bridge fund of \n$50 billion for ongoing military operations in Iraq.\n  The House-passed bill provides for the President, within 30 days \nafter enactment, to commence a phased redeployment of U.S. forces from \nIraq and for the transition of those forces to specific missions: (1) \nprotecting U.S. diplomatic facilities, U.S. forces, American citizens; \n(2) conducting limited training, equipping and providing logistical and \nintelligence support to Iraqi Security Forces; and (3) engaging in \ntargeted counterterrorism operations against al-Qaida, al Qaida \naffiliated groups, and other terrorist organizations in Iraq. It sets a \ngoal for the completion of the transition would be December 15, 2008.\n  Some argue that we should not identify the new more limited missions \nor commit to transition to them. The President told the American people \non September 13 that we will transition to a new phase starting in \nDecember and that ``As this transition in mission takes place, our \ntroops will focus on a more limited set of tasks, including \ncounterterrorism operations and training, equipping, and supporting \nIraqi forces.'' Does that sound familiar? Well, it's like the House \npassed language before us.\n  It is the goal of completing the transition that he objects to--\nalthough it is a goal and not binding. Setting a goal may be too much \nfor he who is unwilling to set a goal--but just don't misrepresent it \nas a fixed timetable when it is stated as a goal.\n  From all accounts, the surge has already produced militarily \nprogress--sectarian violence in most regions of Iraq, particularly \nBaghdad, is down.\n  The problem is that, while the surge has at this point seen \nmilitarily progress, it has not accomplished its primary purpose as \nannounced by President Bush last January, when he stated that its \npurpose was to give the Iraqi government ``the breathing space it needs \nto make progress in other critical areas.'' The President also said \nthat ``America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has \nannounced.'' Well we haven't. The President statement that he ``will \nhold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced'' is so \nmuch hollow rhetoric. Those benchmarks include approving a hydrocarbon \nlaw; approving a de-Baathification law; completing the work of a \nConstitutional Review Committee; and holding provincial elections. \nThose commitments, made 1\\1/2\\ years ago, which were to have been \ncompleted by January 2007, have not yet been kept by the Iraqi \npolitical leaders despite the breathing space the surge has provided. \nAs a matter of fact, the Iraqi leaders appear to be farther apart today \nthan they were at the start of the surge. The Iraqi political \nleadership's response to the breathing space provided by the surge has \nbeen nothing less than abysmal.\n  One year ago this month, the Prime Minister of Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki \nhimself: ``The crisis is political, and the ones who can stop the cycle \nof aggravation and bloodletting of innocents are the [Iraqi] \npoliticians.'' Secretary of Defense Gates agreed with that assessment \nin December of last year. President Bush agreed in January. Petraeus \nagreed in September. If everyone agrees that this is a political \ncrisis, why does the administration keep focusing on military \nsolutions?\n  General Odierno, according to yesterday's Washington Post, described \nthe breathing space as a window of opportunity, which may close at any \ntime. Whether the Iraqi political leaders decide to take advantage of \nthis window of opportunity is of course their decision. We can't make \nthat decision for them. They are a sovereign country.\n  But how long U.S. forces remain deployed to Iraq, and with what \nmissions, and how long U.S. forces continue to fight the insurgency \ninstead of the Iraqi army taking over that fight, and how long we \ncontinue to subject our brave and valiant servicemen and women to the \nrisk of death and serious injury--those decisions are in our hands.\n  Secretary Gates has said that pressure on the Iraqi political leaders \nis useful. President Bush has acknowledged as much. How can Congress \nact to put pressure on the Iraqi political leaders? By setting a goal \nfor the transition of the missions of U.S. forces in Iraq to the more \nsupporting and less direct role. The Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group in \ntheir December 2006 report essentially called for a transition of the \nmission of U.S. forces in Iraq very much like that called for in this \nbill--only they called for it to take place by the first quarter of \n2008.\n  We need to do more than say to the Iraqis that our patience has run \nout and that they need to seize the opportunity that has been given \nthem. Their dawdling will only end when they have no choice.\n  The bill we will hopefully vote for sets a goal for completion of a \ntransition to missions the President has said were going to transition \nto. I wish it were binding but setting a timetable as a goal is better \nthan silence which leaves in place the open-endedness of our current \npresence.\n  It is that open-ended commitment which continues to create in the \nminds of the Iraqi political leaders the false impression that their \nfuture is in our hands instead of theirs.\n  We should vote for cloture on the House passed bill and be allowed to \nvote on its substance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, this morning we are going to be voting \non two supplemental appropriations bills. Both of these bills would \nappropriate funds for our operations in Iraq--one would provide $50 \nbillion while the other would provide $70 billion. However, the key \ndifference between the bills is very simple: the goal of one of the \nbills is to help our efforts in Iraq succeed, and the goal of the other \nbill is to make our efforts fail.\n  H.R. 4156, which passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday by \na margin of only 15 votes, would mandate that the funds appropriated \nthrough the bill can only be used for a ``safe and orderly'' withdrawal \nof U.S. forces from Iraq and requires that a withdrawal of U.S. forces \nbegin 30 days after enactment with a goal for a complete withdraw of \nDecember 15, 2008. If there is a reason the restrictions in this bill \nsound familiar, it is because they are. This bill employs the same \njargon and ill-advised deadlines and withdrawal dates that the majority \ntried on the Defense authorization bill and fiscal year 2007 \nsupplemental appropriations bill earlier this year. Those strategies \nfailed and, in the case of the appropriations bill, the proposed \nrestrictions were removed after a Presidential veto and Congress then \npassed\n\n[[Page S14580]]\n\na supplemental appropriations bill without surrender dates. These \nstrategies will fail this time as well, and they will fail for several \nreasons.\n  First, in the midst of progress in Iraq--which no one denies--and a \nstrategy which is working, it simply does not make sense to tie the \nhands of the commanders on the ground and force them to implement a \nstrategy which--in the best judgment of our military leaders, our \nintelligence agencies, and the perspective of countless outside \nobservers--will lead to the failure of our mission and the rapid \ndeterioration of conditions in Iraq and for the Iraqi people.\n  Second, the type of restrictions and conditions in this bill exceed \nboth the authority and the expertise of the legislative branch. For \nexample, section 104 of the bill requires that no unit can be deployed \nto Iraq unless it is certified to be fully mission capable 15 days \nprior to deployment. Everyone will agree that our troops need to be \ntrained, rested, and ready to execute the missions they are given. No \none will disagree that the global war on terrorism has stretched our \nmilitary and that our military is having to adapt to meet the \nchallenges we put before them. However, to legislate readiness levels \nin a time of war is extremely unwise and--in my judgment--\nunconstitutional. Although appealing at face value, such restrictions \nwill hamper our commanders, ability to respond to crises and weaken \ntheir ability to take advantage of momentum. These types of \nrestrictions would have compromised our effectiveness and success in \nprevious military engagements with catastrophic results.\n  Third, the strategy which inspires these restrictions is--at root \nlevel--not a military strategy. It is a political strategy. The tactics \nbeing used by those who would enact conditions and deadlines like those \nin this bill are not based on any strategic thought or analysis--\ninstead they respond to a political base that is anti-war and refuses \nto acknowledge the progress we are making. Political strategies for \nfighting wars--like the strategy we are dealing with now--all have one \nthing in common--they result in failure. They are shortsighted, \npolitically motivated, and--most importantly--do not serve any national \nsecurity objective.\n  We are making progress in Iraq. The strategy our President and our \nmilitary commanders have implemented is working. We are receiving \nregular updates from our leaders in Iraq which are not ``glowing,'' but \nthey are positive. Most importantly, our leaders are adjusting their \nstrategy in accordance with developments on the ground as well as the \nrealities back home. They are doing this wisely, not hastily, or in \nresponse to opinion polls, but according to good judgment and a \nrealistic assessment of what will work, what won't work, and what is \nappropriate at this point of time. H.R. 4156 will put a stop to our \nleaders' ability to do this. It will keep them from doing the jobs we \nhave sent them to do, and that is to lead, to decide, to make \njudgments, and to report back to us on their effectiveness.\n  One week from today, I will be in Iraq. I will be spending \nThanksgiving day with the troops and I am so looking forward to it. \nWhile we are there on this bipartisan trip, we are going to be getting \nthe facts about what is happening in Iraq. I know militarily, as I \nstated, we are moving forward. That is what this bill is all about, \nsupporting our troops. But at the same time, we know there are \nchallenges there, particularly on the political side. The stability of \nthe Iraqi Government is not where we want it to be, and we are going to \nbe delivering a bipartisan message from this body that it is time for \nthe Iraqi leadership to get their political Government in order and it \nis time for them to begin to exercise real leadership of the Iraqi \npeople because we are not going to be there forever.\n  They now have the ability, because of the great work the men and \nwomen of the U.S. military have done and continue to do, to provide \nstability to that Government, and that message will be delivered very \nclearly.\n  For all the above reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. \n4156 and in support of Senators McConnell and Stevens' alternative, S. \n2340.\n  Now I wish to move to the other vote we are going to be taking today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                             the farm bill\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the upcoming \nvote to restrict debate on the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007. \nRule XXII has historically been used in the Senate of the United States \nas a way to limit the duration of debate on bills of consequence. This \nrule is typically utilized when the Senate--long known for its ability \nto conduct lengthy and protracted debates--is unable to conduct its \nbusiness in a timely fashion due to a threat of filibuster or an \nunwillingness on the part of some Senators to end debate and vote on \ncritical legislation.\n  Today, the Senate has been forced into a cloture vote, not because we \nhave conducted a protracted debate with no end in sight; not because a \nfilibuster has been employed by the minority; not because there is a \nlack of desire by anyone in the Senate to pass a farm bill; but because \nthe past precedent of conducting a fair and open farm bill debate was \ntrampled upon before this process was even started.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans have utilized the procedural tool of \n``filling the tree'' in the past in an effort to restrict our \ndeliberative process. Each circumstance for employing this tool is \nunique and I respect the right of the majority leader to choose this \nprocess; but I certainly wish he would have chosen a more bipartisan \napproach. The bill we passed out of the Agriculture Committee enjoyed \nso much support from our committee members that it was passed \nunanimously by voice vote. Our committee knew and understood that a \nbill of this magnitude would not only have to face the scrutiny of the \nentire Senate; but that it would also likely be amended in some form or \nfashion. We recognized and embraced that fact because we knew the \nstrong bipartisan support within our committee would allow us to debate \nthis legislation on the floor under the guiding principle of providing \nan effective safety net for America's farmers and ranchers; rather than \nthe principles of political partisanship and procedural maneuvers.\n  Unfortunately, as occurred with the House version of the farm bill, \npartisan politics were inserted into this debate at the final hour and \nhave successfully transformed a bill that enjoyed vast bipartisan \nsupport into a partisan spectacle on the Senate floor.\n  Let me be clear to every Senator on the floor and every farmer and \nrancher in America listening today; I have a vested interest in the \npassage of this legislation. I have tirelessly worked on the farm bill \nbefore us today for over 2 years. I have traveled the entire country \nand held field hearings to garner the views of America's farmers and \nranchers. I have conducted oversight hearings, initiated GAO \ninvestigations, traveled to rural destinations across this great \ncountry and have met with everyone with an interest in this bill from \nthe peanut farmer in Georgia to Agricultural Ministers from foreign \nlands.\n  I have done all of these things with a singular goal in mind; that \nis, to craft a 2007 farm bill that will carry American agriculture into \nthe next 5 years in a very prosperous way. With the help of my friends \non the Agriculture Committee, both Democratic and Republican, and \nparticularly the chairman, and particularly Senator Conrad, I believe \nwe have accomplished just that.\n  No one can challenge my sincere desire to pass this bill. I reject \nany suggestion that I do not want a farm bill. But I want a farm bill \ndone the right way, a farm bill that is debated under the long-held \nprinciples of this body that any Member may offer any amendment he or \nshe desires. Had we taken this approach on Tuesday morning, November 6, \nI am quite confident that today we would be voting on final passage \nrather than attempting to restrict a debate that has yet to even occur.\n  It is, frankly, irresponsible and disrespectful to the Members of \nthis body that we would constrict debate on this critical piece of \nlegislation to the rules of postcloture without allowing any \nsubstantive debate. To be clear, there has been no debate on the farm \nbill in the 10 days it has been on the floor--not one vote, not one \namendment considered, not one meaningful debate on the substance and \nmerits of the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007.\n\n[[Page S14581]]\n\n  Every Member must understand that if we vote for cloture today, we \nwill limit every Member's ability to offer amendments they believe are \nvital to this bill. Some will argue that 30 hours of debate will be \nadequate to address the concerns of Members, but history tells a clear \nand different story.\n  During the 2002 farm bill debate, the Senate held three cloture \nvotes, and they all failed. The farm bill was only allowed to move \nforward when the then-Senate majority leader finally allowed an open \nprocess. Once he did so, the bill was completed in a little over a \nweek. An open process served the Senate then, and it will serve us well \ntoday.\n  I respect this body. I respect the Members who rightfully have an \nopportunity to debate any piece of legislation brought before them. It \nis not in our interest nor in the interest of the American agricultural \nproducer to force this bill through the Senate without the due \nconsideration of the Members who so passionately represent them. Let us \nnot rush to the finish line simply to stumble on our final step. A \ndeliberative process will serve America well and perhaps will allow the \nbipartisan spirit of our Senate Agriculture Committee to infect and \noverwhelm the partisan rancor on the Senate floor.\n  I humbly urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me first respond to my friend from \nGeorgia and for the benefit of all Senators make it quite clear that if \nwe have cloture on the farm bill this morning, we will still be allowed \nto have up to 3 days, 3 full days of debate, 30 hours, and untold \nnumbers of amendments. Every amendment that is relevant and germane to \nagriculture in the farm bill will be allowed to be offered and voted \non. I wish to make that very clear.\n  Now, if a Senator wants votes on immigration, well then put it on \nsome other bill. If he wants to vote on taxes, put it on some other \nbill. If they want to vote on whatever else they might want to bring up \nthat is important, put it on another bill. Let's do what is needed for \nour farmers and ranchers and rural America and get the farm bill \npassed. That is what this cloture vote will do this morning.\n  Now, you know, we have a good, strong bipartisan bill. We came out of \ncommittee on a voice vote without one dissenting vote voiced--without \none. We spent a day and a half--a record short time to my knowledge--in \ngetting a farm bill through the committee.\n  Mrs. HUTCHINSON. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Without losing my right to the floor, of course.\n  Mrs. HUTCHINSON. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to follow \nthe Senator from Iowa for up to 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask if this is additional time being requested for \ndebate on the bill or under the time allotted?\n  Mrs. HUTCHINSON. Under the time allotted.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I withdraw my objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask that the preceding few minutes not \ncome from my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. They have not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the farm bill before us was laid down 10 \ndays ago. Yet during that time we have been blocked from voting on any \namendments--not one amendment in 10 days. So the majority leader has \ncorrectly filed a cloture motion in an effort to allow this body to \noffer, debate and vote on amendments and pass this vital legislation \nwithout further unreasonable delay. The cloture vote, I say to all, is \npivotal, crucial as to whether we will have a new farm bill this year. \nEveryone knows it. Let me remind my colleagues of what is at stake, why \nit is so critically important that we put an end to the delay and move \nahead.\n  The pending legislation stays within strict pay-go budget limits. Yet \nwe provide good farm income protection; we promote new economic \nopportunities for farm and ranch families, especially in the area of \nenergy production; and we help dairy farmers and especially the \nspecialty crop producers all across America. There is more in this bill \nfor specialty crops than any farm bill ever passed in the history of \nthis country. The bill boosts economic growth, jobs, and quality of \nlife in rural America with rural development money in the bill. It \nmakes major new investments in conservation of our natural resources, \nto save soil, increase water quality, restore wetlands and wildlife \nhabitat. A big part of this farm bill will allow low-income Americans \nto put a little more food on the family table and to improve the diets \nnot only of our families but of our kids in school. We also have very \nstrong provisions in this bill to help restore our national energy \nsecurity by promoting biofuels, other renewable energy sources and \nrural energy initiatives.\n  These are just some of the highlights that are in this bill. There is \nmuch more in the farm bill to benefit rural America and all of our \nNation. We have come too far with this bill, we have accomplished too \nmuch to let this vitally important bill languish and stall. In fact, at \nthis point, the fate of this bill is in jeopardy--in jeopardy. That is \nwhy this cloture vote is so critical.\n\n  We are at a procedural impasse. We simply cannot obtain the necessary \ncooperation from the Republican leadership. They will not agree to a \nreasonable plan that we debate and deal with relevant, germane \namendments so that we avoid having the farm bill even further \nsidetracked by becoming a Christmas tree of nongermane, nonrelevant \namendments, far off the subject of dealing with the farm bill.\n  I tried--I tried to obtain consent to allow the Senate to debate and \nvote on amendments that Republicans themselves have filed and \npresumably wanted to offer, debate and vote on. I asked unanimous \nconsent to bring them up, get a time limit, and vote on them. My \nrequest was rejected out of hand. We cannot even get consent to adopt \nover 50 amendments that have been agreed upon on both sides for a \nmanagers' amendment--50 that have been agreed upon. We cannot even get \nconsent to adopt those. Now that shows you how unreasonable--how \nunreasonable this lack of cooperation has become.\n  I certainly hope the situation is not a deliberate and orchestrated \nattempt to stop the farm bill dead in its tracks, but I am beginning to \nwonder. There are enough rumors floating around. When rumors start \ncoming from different sources, you know there may be something behind \nthem. What I am hearing is that the White House has put out the word \nbehind the scenes to stop this farm bill--stop it. Now, why is that? I \nbegan to wonder.\n  Well, keep in mind, the White House has issued a statement of policy \nthreatening a veto of the farm bill as passed by the House. Then the \nWhite House issued a threat to veto the farm bill reported by the \nSenate Agriculture Committee. So that means if we pass the bill, if we \ngo to conference, we will probably send the White House something they \nsaid they would veto.\n  I suspect some of the White House political people said: You cannot \nveto a farm bill. Do you want to lose all of rural America for the \nRepublican Party next year? You cannot veto that farm bill. So perhaps \ninstead it would be better if the bill never made it to the White \nHouse. Kill the bill here in the Senate. Kill it here.\n  I see the heavy hand of the White House behind what is going on here. \nI have worked very closely with Senator Chambliss. We have worked very \nhard to get to this point. We have worked very hard to get a bipartisan \ncoalition together. But I detect something else interfering here: I \ndetect the White House's heavy hand coming in, telling people what to \ndo and what not to do.\n  The majority leader has done the appropriate thing by filing cloture. \nNow, let me again repeat, cloture does not cut off debate, and it does \nnot cut off any relevant, germane amendment to the farm bill. As I \nsaid, if we vote for cloture this morning, we can have 3 days of \ndebate, 10 hours a day. We can have 20 amendments or more debated and \nvoted on, plus the 50 we have already agreed upon and others. Plus, \nevery amendment that is relevant and germane is guaranteed an up-or-\ndown vote at the end of cloture. No one will\n\n[[Page S14582]]\n\nbe denied a vote on an amendment to the farm bill as long as it is \nrelevant and germane. If someone wants to add a Christmas tree ornament \ndealing with immigration or foreign relations or the war in Iraq or \nsomething, yes, that amendment is out after cloture. They will not be \nable to offer that amendment. But that comes down to the question, do \nyou want a farm bill or not? Do you want a farm bill or not? It is too \nimportant to allow a small minority or the White House--maybe people \nhere are bowing to pressure from the White House--to hold it up \nindefinitely.\n  We are falling behind. If we get cloture, we can move ahead \naggressively. We can come back after the Thanksgiving recess, spend \nabout 2 or 3 days, 3 days on the farm bill, and it would pass the \nSenate. We can go to conference, work out our differences, and send the \nbill to the White House. That will not happen if we do not get cloture. \nIf we do not get cloture, my friends, there may well not be any farm \nbill.\n  Now, who has a stake in this? I have a good number of letters here \nwith many signatures. I ask unanimous consent to have them printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Here is a letter with 11 groups telling us to move \nforward without further delay, everything from the American Farmland \nTrust and Audubon, to the National Wildlife Federation and the Izaak \nWalton League of America.\n  Here is another letter with 185 signatures urging the Senate to vote \nfor cloture. Many of those signing the letter are antihunger and \nnutrition groups ranging from the America's Second Harvest to the \nAtlanta Community Food Bank, the Food Bank of North Alabama, the Food \nBank of the Albemarle in North Carolina--food banks and others who \nfight hunger all over the country realize they need this farm bill. The \nNational Association of State Departments of Agriculture, National \nFarmers Union, National Milk Producers Federation and many others--\nagain, 185 groups on this letter asking us to vote for cloture this \nmorning.\n  Here is another letter--61 groups who wrote in late September calling \nfor expedited action on the new farm bill. Well, that is what cloture \nis--expedited action. This letter is signed by groups from the American \nFarm Bureau Federation, to the American Soybean Association, to the \nNational Association of Wheat Growers, the National Cotton Council, \nPheasants Forever, and the School Nutrition Association, to name just a \nfew. They want expedited action.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed his 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I urge all Senators to vote for cloture and let us get \nthis critical farm bill passed, go to conference, send it to the White \nHouse, and get it signed before Christmas.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                November 15, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned conservation organizations \n     urge the Senate to move forward with consideration of the \n     farm bill without further delay but with full and fair \n     consideration of relevant amendments. We need a new and \n     improved conservation title, and extension of the 2002 Farm \n     Bill is not, in our view, an acceptable alternative. We \n     believe the bill reported by the Agriculture Committee makes \n     very important strides in addressing key conservation issues \n     and programs, but we also are united in the view that \n     important improvements to both policy and funding need to be \n     made on the floor. Therefore, we urge you to move as quickly \n     as possible to considering, amending, and passing a new farm \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Farmland Trust, Audubon, Center for Native \n           Ecosystems, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Coevolution \n           Institute, Defenders of Wildlife, Izaak Walton League \n           of America, National Campaign for Sustainable \n           Agriculture, National Wildlife Federation, Natural \n           Resources Defense Council, Sustainable Agriculture \n           Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 15, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations write to urge \n     the Senate to vote in favor of the farm bill cloture motion. \n     It is critical that the Senate pass omnibus farm legislation \n     as soon as possible in order to assure enactment of a new \n     farm bill this year.\n       While our organizations have differences on specific policy \n     recommendations, we believe it is vitally important that the \n     Senate pass a 2007 Farm Bill as soon as possible. The 2002 \n     law expired in September, leaving farmers and ranchers \n     uncertain of the policy environment in which they will \n     operate next year and several conservation and nutrition \n     programs expired. These programs that conserve land resources \n     and serve poor and hungry people must be reauthorized and \n     adequately funded now.\n       Extending the 2002 Farm Bill is not an acceptable \n     alternative to enacting new legislation that addresses \n     important needs in each of these areas. Extension is only a \n     short term solution that does not provide the assurances that \n     the nutrition, agriculture, conservation and renewable energy \n     communities need for efficient long-term planning.\n       We worked with the Senate Agriculture Committee to develop \n     a farm bill that addresses our priorities, but are concerned \n     that delayed floor action is lessening the chances of \n     completing a new farm bill this year. We therefore urge a yes \n     vote on the cloture motion on this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         AARP; Alameda County Community Food Bank; America's \n           Second Harvest--The Nation's Food Bank Network; \n           American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy; \n           American Farmland Trust; American Heart Association; \n           American Public Health Association; American Wind \n           Energy Association; America's Second Harvest of KY's \n           Heartland Food Bank; America's Second Harvest of \n           Wisconsin; Association of American Veterinary Medical \n           Colleges; Association of Arizona Food Banks; Atlanta \n           Community Food Bank; Bay Area Food Bank, Theodore, \n           Alabama; Blue Ridge Area Food Bank, Verona, Virginia; \n           California Association of Food Banks; California Food \n           Policy Advocates; California Hunger Action Coalition; \n           Capital Area Food Bank of Texas; Care and Share Food \n           Bank for Southern Colorado; Cathedral Kitchen, Camden, \n           New Jersey; Center for Civil Justice, Michigan; Center \n           for Public Policy Priorities, Texas; Central \n           Pennsylvania Food Bank; Children's Alliance, \n           Washington; Children's Hunger Alliance, Ohio; \n           Children's Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program (C-\n           SNAP); Cleveland Foodbank, Inc.; Coalition on Human \n           Needs; Community Food Security Coalition; Colorado \n           Anti-Hunger Network; Colorado Food Bank Association; \n           Community Food Bank of New Jersey; Community Food Banks \n           of South Dakota; Congressional Hunger Center; \n           Connecticut Association for Human Services; Connecticut \n           Food Bank; Dare to Care Food Bank, Louisville, \n           Kentucky; DC Hunger Solutions; Denver Urban Ministries.\n         Emergency Food and Shelter Program, NYC; End Hunger \n           Connecticut; End Hunger Network, Houston, Texas; \n           Environmental and Energy Study Institute; Environmental \n           Law and Policy Center; Familia Center, Santa Cruz, \n           California; Feeding Indiana's Hungry (FIsH); Feinstein \n           Center for a Hunger Free America, University of Rhode \n           Island; Florida Impact; Food & Water Watch; Food Bank \n           for New York City; Food Bank of Alaska; Food Bank of \n           Central and Eastern North Carolina; Food Bank of \n           Central New York; Food Bank of Delaware; Food Bank of \n           Iowa; Food Bank of Lincoln, Nebraska; Food Bank of \n           North Alabama; Food Bank of South Jersey; Food Bank of \n           the Albemarle, North Carolina; Food Bank of the Rio \n           Grande Valley, Inc.; FOOD for Lane County, Eugene \n           Oregon; Food Research & Action Center (FRAC); FOOD \n           Share, Inc., Oxnard, CA.\n         Foodbank of the Virginia Peninsula; FoodLink for Tulare \n           County, Inc.; Foodshare, Bloomfield, CT; FRAMAX Child \n           Care Food Program, Modesto; Georgia State Food Bank \n           Association; Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana, Inc.; God's \n           Pantry Food Bank, Lexington, Kentucky; Great Plains \n           Food Bank, Fargo, ND; Greater Chicago Food Depository; \n           Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger; Greater \n           Pittsburgh Community Food Bank; Harry Chapin Food Bank, \n           Ft.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n         Forestry, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators Reid, McConnell, Harkin, and Chambliss: The \n     undersigned organizations write to support expedited action \n     on the 2007 Farm Bill. It is critical that the Senate develop \n     omnibus farm legislation as soon as possible in order to \n     assure enactment of a new farm bill this year.\n       While our organizations have differences on specific policy \n     recommendations, we believe it is vitally important that the \n     Senate Agriculture Committee mark up and pass a 2007 Farm \n     Bill as soon as possible. Only a few days remain before \n     provisions of the 2002 law expire. Farmers and ranchers need \n     certainty on the policy environment in which they will \n     operate next year. Several conservation and nutrition \n     programs expire at the end of the fiscal year. These programs \n     that conserve land resources and serve poor and hungry people \n     must be reauthorized and adequately funded now.\n       Extending the 2002 Farm Bill is not an acceptable \n     alternative to enacting new legislation that addresses \n     important needs in each of these areas. Extension is only a \n     short-term solution that does not provide the assurances that \n     the nutrition, agriculture and conservation communities need \n     for efficient long-term planning.\n       We are working with the Senate Agriculture Committee to \n     develop a farm bill that addresses our priorities, but are \n     concerned that delayed action on this legislation is \n     lessening the chances of completing a new farm bill this \n     year. We therefore urge a quick and favorable resolution to \n     the funding and other outstanding issues that are holding up \n     action on this important legislation. We look forward to \n     working with you to move this process forward in the Senate \n     in the coming weeks.\n           Sincerely,\n         AARP; Alliance to End Hunger; American Farm Bureau \n           Federation; American Federation of State, County and \n           Municipal Employees (AFSCME); American Malting Barley \n           Association, Inc.; American Soybean Association; \n           America's Second Harvest; Association of Fish and \n           Wildlife Agencies; Children's Sentinel Nutrition \n           Assessment Program (C-SNAP); Coalition of Human Needs; \n           Community Food Security Coalition; Congressional Hunger \n           Center; End Hunger Network; First Focus; Food Research \n           and Action Center; Jewish Council for Public Affairs \n           (JCPA); MAZON: A Jewish Response to Hunger; Migrant \n           Legal Action Program; National Association of \n           Conservation Districts; National Association for the \n           Education of Young Children (NAEYC).\n         National Association of Resource Conservation and \n           Development Councils; National Association of Wheat \n           Growers; National Barley Growers Association; National \n           Cotton Council; National Corn Growers Association; \n           National Council of Farmer Cooperatives; National \n           Commodity Supplemental Food Program Association; \n           National Education Association (NEA); National Farmers \n           Union; National Grange; National Law Center on \n           Homelessness & Poverty; National Milk Producers \n           Federation; National Policy and Advocacy Council on \n           Homelessness (NPACH); National Pork Producers Council; \n           National Recreation and Park Association; National \n           Sorghum Producers; National Sunflower Association; \n           National WIC Association; National Wild Turkey \n           Foundation; NETWORK: A National Catholic Social Justice \n           Lobby.\n         OMB Watch; Pheasants Forever; Presbyterian Church (USA) \n           Washington Office; Quail Unlimited; RESULTS; School \n           Nutrition Association; Share Our Strength; Society of \n           St. Andrew; Southern Peanut Farmers Federation; \n           Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance; The Brewers \n           Association; The United Methodist Church--General Board \n           of Church and Society; U.S. Canola Association; U.S. \n           Dry Bean Council; U.S. Rice Producers Association; \n           USAction; USA Dry Pea and Lentil Council; USA Rice \n           Federation; Voices for America's Children; Wider \n           Opportunities for Women; YWCA USA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Specialty Crop\n\n\n                                           Farm Bill Alliance,\n\n                                                November 15, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: The Specialty Crop Farm \n     Bill Alliance, a national coalition of more than 120 \n     specialty crop organizations representing 350 specialty \n     crops, is disappointed in the lack of progress that is being \n     made by the Senate regarding the consideration and passage of \n     the 2007 Farm Bill. The reauthorization of the Farm Bill \n     represents an historic opportunity to move agriculture into \n     the 21st Century by investing key resources into the \n     livelihoods and business of specialty crop producers across \n     the country.\n       Most importantly, this ongoing delay with the 2007 Farm \n     Bill will make it difficult to enact legislation that \n     addresses the needs of the specialty crop industry, which \n     include increasing the role of specialty crops to improve \n     nutrition, expanding production and product innovation \n     research capabilities and improving critical procedures to \n     control for invasive pests and diseases from entering this \n     country. Therefore, it is critical that the Senate resolve \n     their differences and pass a bill expeditiously so that a \n     conference committee can be appointed and a final bill can be \n     approved in 2007.\n       Specialty crop producers across the nation urge the Senate \n     leadership and members of the Senate to come together quickly \n     to pass a new Farm Bill for American farmers and consumers.\n       Thank you for your consideration of these important \n     matters.\n           Sincerely,\n         Alabama Watermelon Association;

The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining Republican time be divided equally between Senators Graham, \nThune, and Sessions, and that I be allowed to speak at this point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we know what the deal is. The Senator \nfrom Iowa knows what the problem is. The Democratic leadership is \nrefusing to allow amendments on the farm bill, and the farm bill is not \ngoing to pass until they do. And they are going to allow amendments at \nsome time, and we are going to pass a farm bill. That is what the truth \nis, and everybody knows it here.\n  But I want to talk about something that is really troubling to me. We \nhad a hearing yesterday in the Armed Services Committee. The Secretary \nof the Army, Pete Geren, and GEN George Casey, the Chief of Staff of \nthe Army, told us that they are reaching a crisis in maintaining \nsupport for our troops in Iraq, that they need desperately for this \nCongress to fulfill its responsibility to support the troops we have \nsent into the field in harm's way to execute the policy of this Nation.\n  They are there because we sent them there. They are doing fabulous \nwork, and they need support.\n  Just remember, this summer we had a long debate about what to do. \nPresident Bush said we need to change our policy. The American people \nsaid we need to change our policy. We sent General Petraeus there. I \nsee the Senator from Texas. I don't know if she wants additional time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I had 2 minutes. I would be happy to \nfollow the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that 2 minutes be allocated to \nthe Senator from Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We really need to do this. We voted after a full debate \nthis summer to give General Petraeus a chance, asked him to come back \nand report in September. We voted 80 to 14 to fund the surge, and \nGeneral Petraeus came back with positive reports in September. But it \nwas early. We were not sure what was going to be the true trend. Since \nSeptember, the situation in Iraq has improved to a degree I did not \nexpect possible. The casualties are down two-thirds from earlier in the \nsummer. It appears al-Qaida is completely on the run. Great progress \nhas been made. It is unthinkable at this point, after all we have been \nthrough, the difficult times we had this summer, when progress is being \nmade clearly, indisputably, that we would now jerk the rug out from \nunder our soldiers. We have to do this. We need Senator Reid to quit \nsaying we are losing and quit saying this is not working, while our \nsoldiers are making progress. How demoralizing is that?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to support our troops at this critical \npoint as we are making progress.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the bridge \nbill that was sent over by the House of Representatives. I hope the \nSenate can do what the Senate has been doing all year, and that is stop \nthese reckless amendments that would tie the hands of our generals, \nthat would dictate policy on the ground in Iraq from 6,000 miles away, \nfrom people who do not know what is going on on the ground, it seems. \nWe have voted 40 times in the last year, since February, on amendments \nthat would constrain the troops in the field doing what they are doing. \nLast week the Iraqi Government and U.S. commanders proclaimed that al-\nQaida had been routed in every neighborhood in Baghdad, an 80-percent \ndrop in the murder rate. The BBC reports that all across Baghdad \nstreets are springing back to life, shops and restaurants which closed \ndown are back in business. People are walking on the streets. Things \nhave changed in Baghdad. Things have changed in Iraq. The only place it \ndoesn't seem to change is in the Congress. We should not vote on \nanything that underfunds the troops, which is what this bridge bill \ndoes, and overregulates what our troops in the field are doing when we \nare not there every day, day in, day out, watching the progress.\n  General Petraeus is succeeding in quelling the violence. Now we must \nwork with the Iraqis to have stability in that country so we can leave. \nGeneral Petraeus has already said he is bringing home a brigade from \nthe surge. We are going in the right direction. Let's don't do \nsomething foolish in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized for 1 minute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I also want to urge my colleagues to pass \nthe $70 billion supplemental for the Department of Defense. The \nMcConnell alternative is a funding bill that is free of\n\n[[Page S14585]]\n\npolitical posturing, not influenced by armchair generals. The \nDepartment of Defense needs this money, and they need it now. \nYesterday, Secretary Geren and General Casey testified before the Armed \nServices Committee on the state of the Army. When I asked Secretary \nGeren about what effect the lack of funding was having on the Army, he \nwas frank and clear. The Army will run out of money by February and, \nwhat is worse, they will have to start scaling back services and \ncanceling important civilian contracts. Moreover, when the President \nsigned the Defense appropriations bill, it stopped the department's \nfunding under the current continuing resolution. Now the Army is being \nforced to borrow from its operations and maintenance accounts in its \nbase budget. The Army O budget is about $27 billion. Since the Army \nspends about $6.5 billion a month, that money will be gone by February. \nWe are forcing our Army to borrow against itself.\n  General Casey testified that in the December timeframe nine brigades \nare coming back from Iraq, and they may return to find services that \nsupported them have been cancelled. Last, when we passed a timely \nsupplemental bill, the Army depots were able to reset 27 brigades, \nprocess 123,000 large vehicles, and 10,000 humvees.\n  Democrats are always going to paint Iraq as a failure, no matter what \ngains have been made. We need to support our troops and make sure they \nhave the funding to do their job.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized for 1 minute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will try to frame the issue the way it \ndeserves. It is going to be hard hitting. Senator Reid told me \nsomething one time, that we shouldn't run the Congress down. I \ngenerally agree with that except here. What we are about to do is take \none of the most successful military operations in American history by \nany measure, the surge, and undercut it by one of the most \ndysfunctional Congresses in American history, by denying the funding to \nthe troops in the field who have performed.\n  The House bill would replace military commanders with a dysfunctional \nCongress that is being led around by its nose by Code Pink and \nmoveon.org, who don't understand success on the battlefield. All they \nsee is the next election, the potential for an ad. Listen to the \ninflammatory rhetoric.\n  We are not going to allow the dysfunctional Congress to replace a \nsuccessful commander. We are not going to send the message to our \nenemies: You are back into the fight. We are not going to tell our \ntroops: You are a loser; you don't get any more money. We are not going \nto tell our allies and the brave Iraqis who have jumped on our side \nthat we are leaving. This is ridiculous. It is undercutting America's \nvital national security interests, and it is telling our soldiers: You \nare losers--when they are winners. We are going to defeat it now and \nforever.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the comments \nmade by my colleague, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee. It is \nimportant to recognize why we are in the procedural predicament we find \nourselves in today. This predicament is not based on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee's inability to come together to protect and \nenhance our most basic national security interest--food security. We \nhave successfully done that with a bill supported unanimously by the \ncommittee--across partisan and regional divide.\n  To be clear, this is a problem of including, in a farm bill, other \nextraneous issues that have little to do with agriculture policy. I \ndon't fault the decision to go down this path of including tax-related \nprovisions in the farm bill. It was decided early on. However, we must \nrecognize the full implications of this decision. Indeed, one only need \nlook at what occurred in the other body to see how a bipartisan process \ncan completely disintegrate when other issues are injected into the \nfarm bill debate.\n  Tax debates are always difficult and the inclusion of tax-related \nprovisions in a piece of legislation has never been known to simplify \nthe legislative process. In this instance, however, as much as I regret \nits impact on the farm bill, it is simply necessary to allow for debate \non the tax-related provisions included in the Food and Energy Security \nAct of 2007.\n  I am confident we will work through these difficulties. I am grateful \nthat my colleagues on the Finance Committee were able to avoid the \nproblems created by the inclusion of the Ways and Means provisions in \nthe underlying House bill. However, the tax-related provisions included \nin the underlying Senate bill have nonetheless complicated our process \nand we must recognize, accept, and work through the process in a \ndeliberative and responsible manner.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, first I want to congratulate the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Harkin, and the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, for \ntheir leadership in the Agriculture Committee and for bringing to the \nSenate a bipartisan farm bill that works for many family farmers.\n  I hope this hard work will not be endangered by an amendment that \nwill adversely affect family farms in some States by eliminating the \nability for family farms to receive financing, or will prevent farmers \nfrom efficiently markting their crop. Since the passage of the 2002 \nFarm Bill there has been a good bit of controversy surrounding the \nissue of payment limits. Much of this has been based on misinformation \nand is a result of misunderstanding agriculture practices. While I am \npleased that the legislation passed by the committee contains \nsignificant reforms to address the concerns raised over the past 6 \nyears, I want to be very clear that these reforms are not easy for \nproducers in my State of Mississippi to accept and will result in many \nfarms having to significantly alter their farming operation. I would \nlike to give an example of how unfair this amendment is to crops grown \nin the South. Under the Grassley-Dorgan amendment, a cotton and rice \nfarmer in Mississippi could only grow 400 acres of cotton or 225 acres \nof rice before they reach the limit. In comparison, a soybean and corn \nfarmer in North Dakota could farm 2,000 acres of soybeans or 1,300 \nacres of corn before they hit the limit.\n  I believe it is important for my Senate colleagues to understand just \nhow significant the reforms in the committee-passed bill are. This \nlegislation applies direct attribution to the individual farmer, thus \nmaking all farm payments transparent. The committee-passed legislation \nwould limit the direct payment a single producer can receive to \n$40,000. The legislation reduces the amount of a counter-cyclical \npayment to $60,000. In addition, the Senate language reduces the \nAdjusted Gross Income means test for producers from $2.5 million all \nthe way down to $750,000. While this may still sound like a lot of \nmoney, when you consider production costs such as $400,000 cotton \npicker, fuel prices, fertilizer costs, and technology fees for seed, \nthese levels are quite low.\n  Many crops of the Midwest are enjoying record prices right now due \nmostly to the use of corn in the current ethanol boom. The most \nprevalent crops in the South, cotton and rice, are not seeing the \nrecord prices created by the billions of dollars in renewable fuel \nincentives and tax credit subsidies, and it is important to point out \nthat none of these subsidies is subject to an arbitrary limit.\n  Agriculture is the economic engine for rural communities located \nthroughout Mississippi. These communities are dependent on family farms \nto provide the economic activity that generates millions of dollars in \ntax revenue and thousands of jobs. While we encourage small businesses \nto grow and prosper in this country, this amendment is telling our \nfamily farmers they will be punished if they do the same. The amendment \noffered by my friends from Iowa and North Dakota would have a very \nnegative impact on a region of this country that already suffers from \nsevere economic depression.\n  This amendment would have a very negative impact on the livelihood of \nthousands of farmers. It would undo what many farmers today and \ngenerations before them have established through hard work, surviving \nnatural disasters, and even the Great Depression. This amendment is an \nattempt to drive farmers in my State to conform to the way others \noperate in very different regions of the country. Not every farmer fits \nin the same mold, and I ask my colleagues to vote against the Grassley-\nDorgan Amendment.\n\n[[Page S14586]]\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as we consider the farm bill, I am proud \nto say that Vermont is leading the Nation in developing programs to \nbring fresh, local foods to school cafeterias.\n  Let me begin by recounting the experience of Burlington, VT, which \nhas been replicated in other cities and towns across our State. Five \nyears ago, residents of the city expressed concern about the \nsignificant nutritional issues facing the city's children. Twenty \npercent of the city's children were living in poverty, food insecurity \nwas widespread, and the rate of childhood obesity was steadily \nincreasing. In response, citizens called for an increased commitment to \nhealthy food choices for children and their families.\n  At the same time, they were aware of the need to promote the local \nfarm economy. So in the fall of 2003, with a U.S. Department of \nAgriculture grant, the Burlington School Food Project was created.\n  The program brings fresh foods from local farms to school cafeterias \nand provides hands-on agricultural education in the classroom. Students \nat the ten schools in this program are now eating foods that are \nhealthier, more nutritious and from all the reports I have heard, \nbetter tasting.\n  The program also involves students in the process of harvesting, \npreparing and even taste-testing their own food. This has helped many \nyoung Vermonters learn about where food comes from, helping them \nconnect with their local farms and community.\n  After 4 years of the project's existence, the Burlington school \ndistrict now prepares 930,000 meals annually using fresh and local \nproduce. Several schools offer salad bars either as a full lunch or as \na side item to hot lunches. This has led to better diets and improved \nhealth.\n  The project has also been impressive from an economic standpoint. \nLast year, for instance, more than 1,000 pounds of local tomatoes, 600 \npounds of local zucchini, 600 pounds of carrots and 400 pounds of local \nbasil were used in school meals. The amount of local produce purchased \ntripled between 2003 and 2006.\n  Many partners have built upon these successes. Today, I would like to \nmention two driving forces.\n  Bonnie Acker, a school parent, took it upon herself to do whatever \nnecessary to improve the quality of the food being served at her \nchild's school. She worked with teachers, students, volunteers, and \ncafeteria workers at Edmunds Middle School. This school has become a \nmodel for others, its cafeteria has been transformed, and its school \ngardens are rich with color.\n  The director of the Burlington School Food Service, Doug Davis, \nprovided much of the leadership needed to make BSFP work. When he was \napproached by parents like Bonnie, he listened. He then immediately \ntook action and spearheaded an effort to buy whole grain breads for the \ncafeterias. Doug also introduced initiatives such as taste tests and \nclassrooms linked to the cafeteria. Before long, Burlington students \nwere trying new foods and getting healthier lunches. For his efforts, \nDoug was presented the Northeast award as Food Service Director of the \nYear.\n  But Burlington is not alone. Other Vermont school districts have \nundertaken similar programs, among them:\n  Brattleboro Elementary Schools, which won a Vermont Farm to School \ngrant to set up a program to promote local food purchasing, taste \ntesting seasonal foods, and to get students to farms for hands-on \nagricultural experiences. Sheila Humphreys coordinates the program, and \nLaura White has been a major force in its success.\n  Waitsfield Elementary worked with VT FEED on local purchasing and \ndeveloping a food, farm and nutrition curriculum. Key figures in this \neffort have been school nurse Sue Dillon, as well as George Schenk of \nAmerican Flatbread, who has been a strong and supportive community \nmember raising money for Waitsfield and other schools.\n  Orleans Essex North Supervisory Union, where three elementary schools \nhave comprehensive farm to school programs that include local \npurchasing, school gardening, taste testing of seasonal products, \nharvest celebrations with farmers and the communities, field studies \nwith students on farms, and the development of farm and food-based \nclassroom activities.\n  Sharon Elementary School also worked with VT FEED for 3 years \ndeveloping a food, farm, and nutrition curriculum. Its principal, \nSheila Moran, along with teacher Keenan Haley and food service director \nLynn Ann Perry, have been instrumental in weaving farm to school into \ntheir school culture.\n  Ferrisburgh Elementary School has involved high school students to do \nfield studies on farms, make a school garden, purchase more local foods \nand taste-test them, try new recipes using local foods, and have a \nfarmers' market harvest festival for their community.\n  In addition, Hardwick Elementary School has worked with VT FEED on \ncombining food, farm, and nutrition into the existing curricula, \nplanting crops on farms for school use, and making healthy snacks. Val \nSimmons, its food service director, has led the effort to reconnect \nstudents and school food to the local farms.\n  Salisbury Elementary School takes students to local farms for field \nstudies and does local food taste testing in classrooms. Here, teacher \nDiane Benware and food service director Gaye Truax have been prime \nmovers.\n  On a larger scale, the Food Works' Farm-to-Table program, based in \nMontpelier, serves as a nonprofit distributor of produce from 18 area \nfarms, delivering the produce throughout the year to 13 schools in \ncentral Vermont. In 2007 alone, more than $50,000 of local produce has \nbeen purchased and distributed through Farm-to-Table. Rick Hungerford, \nfood service director at the U-32 High School in East Montpelier, is \nnow sourcing nearly 14 percent of cafeteria purchases locally while \nturning a profit and preparing outstanding, healthy food for the entire \nschool community. Ann Gilbert and Liz Scharf, two parents from Rumney \nElementary School in Middlesex, spearheaded a grassroots effort to \nconnect their school with local farms, in particular to purchase year-\nround from local grower Joe Buley, who is new to farming and has \ninvested in greenhouse production so he can sell to schools.\n  Finally, let me recognize Vermont Food Education Every Day, VT FEED, \nwhich uses a community-based approach to school food system change and \nis the product of a collaboration of three Vermont nonprofits: Food \nWorks, Northeast Organic Farming Association of VT, and Shelburne \nFarms. It does fine work in building connections between classrooms, \ncafeterias, local farms, and communities. It is most ably directed by \nAbbie Nelson and Kim Norris. It has also had strong cooperation from Jo \nBusha, the State Director of the Vermont Department of Education Child \nNutrition Program, in introducing the farm to school concept to many \nschool food service directors.\n  And this is just the beginning. With strong provisions in the farm \nbill for beginning farmers, increased funding for fruits and vegetables \nfor schools, and an innovative pilot to work on community gardens in \nhigh-poverty schools, I expect Vermont's trailblazing efforts to expand \nnot only in our State, but across the Nation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will oppose the motion to proceed to both \nthe Senate and House bills to provide bridge funding to Iraq because \nthey do not contain firm and enforceable dates to get our troops out of \nIraq.\n  Once again, Congress is being asked to pour tens of billions of \ndollars more into an unending war, for uncertain goals, carried forward \nby little more than a mixture of blind faith and inertia.\n  Once again, the American people are being asked to shut their eyes \ntight against the facts and trudge blindly on--this time at the cost of \nsome $50 or $70 billion, depending on which bill we are talking about, \nand who knows how many more lives. And once again, those who question \nthis war--a majority of Americans--are being asked: You support the \ntroops, don't you?\n  How could we not? How could we not be awed by the bravery and \nsacrifice of our men and women in Iraq? How could we not be inspired by \ntheir choice to volunteer in the first place? How could we not be \nimpressed by the discipline, competence, intelligence, and \nresourcefulness with which General Petraeus and the soldiers under his \ncommand have fought in Iraq? They deserve our respect and much more.\n  But contrary to what the President's supporters would have you \nbelieve, the\n\n[[Page S14587]]\n\ndebate does not end there. It begins there. And I have come to the \nfloor today to suggest that the President's supporters would do well to \nheed key military virtues: recognizing the difference between tactics \nand strategy--between short term and long term.\n  All the tactical brilliance in the world will win you nothing if it \ndoesn't find its place within a larger plan for victory. And in Iraq, \nthat plan is exactly where we found it in the spring of 2003--\nnonexistent.\n  No one in this Chamber would doubt that recent months in Iraq have \nseen significant tactical success. The number of IED explosions has \ndropped significantly.\n  The total number of enemy attacks, and the number of coalition \nsoldiers killed in action, have been in decline--even though 2007 \nrecently became the deadliest year on record for U.S. troops in Iraq. \nIraqi civilian casualties have been cut from a high of 3,000 in the \nmonth of December 2006--even though they still hover around an \nappalling 1,000 per month.\n  But overall, the security picture in Iraq is, for the time being, \nimproved.\n  The question is: Why? What made that happen? If anything comes out of \nthis debate, it should be an honest answer to that question--not so we \ncan assign praise and blame but so we can piece together a coherent \nstrategy.\n  I don't doubt that our troops' dedication did its part to reduce the \nviolence. But if American agency was the sole factor, why was violence \nin Iraq on the decline before the surge began--even before it was \nannounced? It is clear to me that there have been three deeper causes.\n  First, Moqtada al-Sadr, a prime mover of sectarian violence, has sat \nout the surge, patiently waiting for its inevitable end. As The New \nYorker recently put it: ``Analysts credit much of the recent drop in \nIraqi civilian deaths not to the surge but to Sadr's decision, in \nAugust, to order the Mahdi Army, which is believed to have been \nresponsible for much of the Shiite-on-Sunni sectarian killing in and \naround Baghdad, to `freeze' its activities for six months.'' Sadr and \nhis fellow sectarian leaders may be brutal--but they are also \ncalculating and self-interested.\n  They know that the surge, whatever is decided here today, cannot be \nphysically sustained indefinitely.\n  Second, the drop in violence can also be attributed to the so-called \nSunni awakening: the decision by tribal leaders in Anbar Province to \nturn against al-Qaida and foreign jihadists. That choice was laudable \nand--as shown by Abu Risha, the charismatic tribal leader who allied \nwith America and was murdered for it--truly courageous.\n  But it was also unforeseen by the surge and began independently of \nthe surge. But as valuable and necessary as the fight against al-Qaida \nin Iraq has been, it does little to stem the deeper civil war between \nSunnis and Shiites--the overwhelming source of Iraq's chaos.\n  The fight against al-Qaida must go on--but there's no reason why it \ncompels us to police a civil war.\n  Third and finally, many analysts have argued that violence has \nbottomed out because Iraq's ethnic cleansing is reaching a conclusion--\nbecause Iraq has, de facto, partitioned itself. With almost a million \nBaghdadis fleeing their homes in the conflict, the city has become ever \nmore ethnically homogenous, reducing Sunni-Shiite flashpoints.\n  Each of these causes has contributed its part to what some are \nintemperately hailing as our long-awaited victory. It would be \nwonderful to believe that America made it happen, after all this time, \nthrough sheer force of will. Every one of my colleagues, I am sure, \nwants to believe that.\n  But this is the clear line running through this Chamber: between \nthose who want it to be true so desperately that they blind themselves \nand those who understand that that kind of belief--the kind that calls \na proposition true because we want it to be true--is the kind that saw \nan alliance between Saddam and al-Qaida, the kind that saw an Iraq full \nof WMDs, the kind that saw a mission accomplished 4 years ago.\n  But still, even if you grant that belief, even if you say that the \nsurge, and nothing else, brought down the violence--is that our \nvictory?\n  No. The surge was always a military means to a political end. \nComptroller General David Walker put it well: ``The primary point of \nthe surge was to improve security . . . in order to provide political \nbreathing room'' for the Iraqi Government. President Bush has said much \nthe same. The surge was always meant to open a window for political \nreconciliation. Nearly 800 Americans sacrificed their lives to keep \nthat window open; thousands and thousands of Americans took wounds to \nkeep that window open. What has the Iraqi Government done with it?\n  Failed to meet its own political benchmarks. Failed to enact oil \nlegislation. Sustained a mass resignation of Sunni politicians, leaving \nmore than half of its Cabinet seats vacant. Enjoyed a month-long \nvacation.\n  This September, 60 percent of Iraqis--and 93 percent of Sunnis--\nthought it was justified to kill American troops.\n  And during America's long sacrifice to keep civil war at bay, the \nMaliki Government has grown more sectarian than ever, more and more \nopenly an arm of the Shiites, more and more actively prejudiced against \nSunnis. Hundreds of Americans died to give breathing space to Iraqi \npoliticians and they act as if Iraq doesn't exist.\n  Many of the Iraqi forces we have relied on to stabilize that country \nare little more than retooled sectarian gangs. What is stopping them \nfrom accepting our training, accepting our weapons, and then, as soon \nas the surge dies down, jumping once again down each other's throats?\n  In the name of unity and reconciliation, our policies have divided \nIraq deeper and deeper, until, as George Washington University Middle \nEast expert Marc Lynch has argued, Iraq becomes ``a warlord state . . . \nwith power devolved to local militias, gangs, tribes, and power-\nbrokers, with a purely nominal central state.''\n  That is Iraq with the surge in place. But President Bush has conceded \nthat it can't continue past July; and soon, we will be confronted by \nIraq without the surge. So I have a simple question for my colleagues \nthis morning:\n  What then?\n  And as President Bush tries to find an answer, as he tries to cobble \ntogether a plan more than 4 years too late, our billions will continue \nto be poured into a desert sinkhole; our Nation will earn the enmity of \nmore and more Muslims for our endless occupation; our military will be \nground into the dirt, unit by unit, machine by machine, soldier by \nsoldier; and young Americans will continue to die. And we will be not \nan inch safer.\n  That is why I have come to the floor this morning: not to pass \njudgment; not to score points; not to assign blame. But because as we \nhurtle on with all tactics and no strategy, the costs are becoming too \nheavy for us to bear.\n  There is only one realistic strategy, only one honest answer to: What \nthen? Redeploy our combat forces from Iraq, starting immediately. \nRefocus the fight on al-Qaida, training those Iraqi forces we can \ntrust, and protecting U.S. personnel and infrastructure. Rebuild our \nworn-down, battered military.\n  Our troops will have my respect for what they have done in Iraq for \nas long as I live. And I join President Bush in his fervent hope that \ntheir sacrifice would be enough to heal a shattered country. But my \neyes are open. I know that the best hope for Iraq, and the best hope \nfor America, lies in redeployment--not in another $50 or $70 billion \npoured down this hole. I have faith that time will open the eyes of \nevery one of my colleagues; I hope they will begin by seeing the deep \nerror of these bills.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I oppose H.R. 4156, a bill that \nwould link vital funding for our troops to a mandated timeline for \nwithdrawal from Iraq. Not only is this bill irresponsive to the facts \non the ground, it is irresponsible. Instead, we should approve S. 2340 \nand provide our military with the resources they require, free of \nconditions that would undermine their ability to conduct operations and \nbuild on their recent successes.\n  Today the Senate considers yet another bill mandating the withdrawal \nof U.S. combat forces from Iraq, regardless of conditions on the ground \nor the views of our commanders in the field. If this latest attempt \nsounds familiar, it\n\n[[Page S14588]]\n\nshould--the majority has thus far engaged in no less than 40 \nlegislative attempts to limit the ability of the President and his \ncommanders to prosecute this war. And, just like the 40 votes that \npreceded this one, the result of this vote will undoubtedly be the \nsame. The proponents of this legislation are well aware of this fact, \nand the fact that the President has pledged to veto legislation calling \nfor a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. Rather than move beyond these \ndifferences and ensure that our troops in the field receive the vital \nfunding they need, however, we will go through this exercise yet again.\n  This legislation would mandate a withdrawal of U.S. combat forces \nwithin 30 days of enactment, leaving a smaller force authorized only to \ncarry out narrowly defined missions, with the goal of ending our \ninvolvement, irrespective of the situation in Iraq, by December 15 of \nnext year. Given that similar provisions have failed 40 times already, \nit is inconceivable that they would succeed now, when there is \nunambiguous progress in Iraq. The choice today is simple: do we build \nupon the clear successes of our current strategy and give General \nPetraeus and the troops under his command the support they require to \ncomplete their mission, or do we ignore the realities and legislate a \npremature end to our efforts in Iraq, accepting thereby all the \nterrible consequences that will ensue? The answer should be simple.\n  As we proceed with consideration of this bill, it is important to \nspend a few moments reviewing the current state of affairs in Iraq. We \nsee today that, after nearly 4 years of mismanaged war, the situation \non the ground in Iraq shows tangible signs of progress. The forces \nneeded to implement General Petraeus's counterinsurgency plan have been \nin place for over 6 months and our military, in cooperation with the \nIraqi security forces, continues to make significant gains in a number \nof areas.\n  The second in command in Iraq, LTG Ray Odierno, stated earlier this \nmonth that due to the recently implemented counterinsurgency \noperations, ``we have been able to eliminate key safe havens, liberate \nportions of the population and hamper the enemy's ability to conduct \ncoordinated attacks.'' General Odierno went on to add that ``we have \nexperienced a consistent and steady trend of increased security over \nthe last four months, and I believe continued aggressive operations by \nboth Iraqi and coalition forces are the most effective way to extend \nour gains and continue to protect the citizens of Iraq.'' According to \na recent report issued by the Department of Defense, weekly IED attacks \nhave decreased by 60 percent across Iraq since the beginning of \nOperation Phantom Thunder in mid-June.\n  The Associated Press reports that Iraqi civilian deaths have dropped \nsharply as a result of the ``surge,'' from 1,791 in August to 750 in \nOctober. Mortar attacks by insurgents in October were the lowest on \nrecord since February of 2006, as were the number of ``indirect fire'' \nattacks on U.S. and coalition forces. The surge's success in \nestablishing greater security has spurred a great increase in \ncooperation from Iraqi citizens, and MG Rick Lynch, commander of U.S. \nforces south of Baghdad, said he believes the decrease in rocket and \nmortar attacks will continue to hold because of a ``groundswell'' of \nsupport from regular Iraqis. ``If we didn't have so many people coming \nforward to help, I'd think [the decrease in attacks] is a flash in the \npan. But that's just not the case,'' General Lynch said.\n  We are all aware of the monumental strides our military has made in \nrestoring order and reducing violence in Anbar Province. A province \nonce declared ``lost'' to al-Qaida has begun a return to normalcy for \nmany of its inhabitants. Locals, sickened by the brutality of \ninsurgents and terrorists, have rejected violent extremism and have \ncooperated with U.S. and Iraqi forces to take the fight to the enemy. \nThis partnership model combined with U.S. troops ``living forward'' is \nbeing replicated and producing real results all across the country.\n  In Ghazaliya, for example, once known as a strategic gateway to \nBaghdad for insurgents and a place where coalition convoys were \nregularly ambushed, the creation of joint security stations has led to \na significant reduction in sectarian violence and IED attacks. \nAmariyah, a neighborhood in western Baghdad that just 6 months ago was \na central operational location for al-Qaida in Iraq and plagued by high \nlevels of bombings and shootings, is beginning to see a drastic \nreduction in violence and many residents are beginning to experience \nsome semblance of normal life. None of this is to argue that Baghdad or \nother regions have suddenly become safe, or that violence has come down \nto an acceptable level, or that victory lies just around the corner. On \nthe contrary, the road ahead remains, as it always has been, long and \nhard. Violence is still at unacceptable levels in some parts of the \ncountry, reconstruction of important infrastructure lags, and the \nMaliki government remains unwilling to function as it must. No one can \nguarantee success or be certain about its prospects, but, by the same \ntoken, no one should dismiss the positive developments that have \nresulted from this new strategy in Iraq.\n\n  Nor can we dismiss the enormous costs of American failure in Iraq. \nMany of my colleagues would like to believe that, should the bill we \nare currently considering become law, it would mark the end of this \nlong effort. They are wrong. Should the Congress force a precipitous \nwithdrawal from Iraq, it would mark a new beginning, the start of a \nnew, more dangerous effort to contain the forces unleashed by our \ndisengagement. If we leave, we will be back--in Iraq and elsewhere--in \nmany more desperate fights to protect our security and at an even \ngreater cost in American lives and treasure. Now is not the time for us \nto lose our resolve. We must remain steadfast in our mission, for we do \nnot fight only for the interests of Iraqis, we fight for ours as well.\n  That means approving the support that our fighting men and women \nneed. The funding contained in this supplemental is not, as some have \ncharacterized it, the ``President's money.'' This money is for the \ntroops. This funding is to provide them with the equipment and proper \ntraining they require to fulfill their mission, funding to protect our \nmen and women from roadside bombs and other attacks, funding to enable \nthem to bring this war to a successful end. Holding our military's \nfunding hostage to a repetitive and futile attempt to score political \npoints is unconscionable.\n  Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England recently wrote to the \nchairman of the House Appropriations Committee about the effects of \nthis legislation. ``Without this critical funding,'' he wrote, ``the \nDepartment will have no choice but to deplete key appropriations \naccounts by early next year. In particular, the Army's Operation and \nMaintenance account will be completely exhausted in mid-to-late \nJanuary. This situation will result in a profoundly negative impact on \nthe defense civilian workforce, depot maintenance, base operations, and \ntraining activities.'' Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said just \nyesterday that, should the money contained in this bill be withheld, he \nwill have to ``lay off 200,000 civilian employees and contractors, \nterminate military contracts and partially shut down U.S. military \nbases.'' Army Secretary Pete Green went on to add that without these \nfunds, the negative effects ``will fall most heavily on...home based \ntroops and their families.''\n  I have seen a lot during my time in the Senate, but few events sink \nto the level of what we are witnessing today. I understand the \nfrustration that many feel after nearly 4 years of mismanaged war. I \nshare their frustration and sadness. But we must remember to whom we \nowe our allegiance. Not to short-term political gain, but to the \nsecurity of America, to those brave men and women who risk all to \nensure it, and to the ideals upon which our Nation was founded. That \nresponsibility is our dearest privilege and to be judged by history to \nhave discharged it honorably will, in the end, matter so much more to \nall of us than any fleeting glory of popular acclaim, electoral \nadvantage or office. Let us not sacrifice the remarkable gains our \nservice men and women have made by engaging in a game of political \nbrinksmanship. There is far too much at stake.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, H.R. 4156, the House-passed bill \nproviding\n\n[[Page S14589]]\n\nbridge funding for the Iraq war, is unacceptably weak. While I will \nsupport cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of that bill, \nmy vote should not be misinterpreted as a vote in favor of this bill. \nBy supporting cloture on the motion to proceed, I am voting in favor of \nthe Senate having the opportunity to debate and amend it. I have \nalready filed an amendment to the bill that consists of the Feingold-\nReid amendment offered to the Defense Department authorization bill \nearlier this year. Unfortunately, it appears that the Republicans will \nnot even allow the Senate to have meaningful debate on a war that has \nno end in sight and that does not have the backing of the American \npeople.\n  But Democrats aren't off the hook either. H.R. 4156 purports to \nattach some strings to the funding it provides, but those strings are \nso thin and pliable as to be virtually meaningless. Since Democrats \nassumed control of Congress with a mandate from the American people, we \nhave made progress toward changing course in Iraq, and I have supported \nefforts to increase pressure on this administration to listen to the \nAmerican people. At this point, giving the President money to continue \nthe war while only setting a ``goal'' for concluding the redeployment \nof our troops is insufficient. I am afraid we are moving backwards, not \nforward, with this new bill.\n  I spoke at some length yesterday about the administration's flawed \nstrategy in Iraq, so I will not repeat myself today. I will say, \nhowever, that the administration's policy is indefensible. The American \npeople know that, which is why they voted the way they did in November. \nThey want us out of Iraq, and they want us out now. They don't want to \ngive the so-called ``surge'' time and they are right. The surge is a \ndelaying tactic, an effort to buy time. We can't afford to spend any \nmore time, or money, on a war that is hurting our own national \nsecurity. We must act and we must do it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a simple message this morning. \nWe need to get the funds to the troops, and we need to do it now. The \nSecretary of Defense told us yesterday that the money for the Army and \nMarine Corps will soon run out, that he will have to start writing pink \nslips, tearing up contracts, and reducing missions at military bases. \nIf we don't approve these funds for training and supplies that are \nneeded to protect these brave men and women in the field, that is \nexactly what will happen.\n  Are we about to deny all these supplies just as the successes of \nGeneral Petraeus's plan have become more clear? Attacks are down, \ncasualties are down, political cooperation is taking root at the local \nlevel. We should not leave our forces in the field without the funding \nthey need to accomplish the mission for which they have been deployed.\n  The Pelosi bill, if it were to get to the President's desk, would be \nvetoed, as was the supplemental bill sent to the President earlier this \nyear that contained a withdrawal date. We need to get our troops \neverything they need, and we need to get it to them now.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  A word about the farm bill. We all know we are going to pass a farm \nbill. Any suggestion to the contrary is laughable. I am disappointed \nthat the majority has filed cloture on the bill. I am even more \ndisappointed that from the get-go, the parliamentary device of filling \nup the tree was used on a 1,600-page bill so that one Member of the \nSenate could dictate to everybody else what amendments would be \nallowed, if any. This is not the way to go forward.\n  I am not sure how the majority defines wide-open debate, but this is \ncertainly a no-amendments process which is stunningly observed in a \nbody that has passed a number of farm bills over the years. As I \nmentioned on the first day of floor consideration, we have been down \nthis road before.\n  During the last farm bill, when the Democrats were in the majority, \nthen-Leader Daschle attempted to limit amendments. He failed three \ntimes. I am going to confidently predict today that this unfair \nprocedural tactic is going to fail again. In 2002, after the majority \nfinally agreed to an open-amendment process, final passage of the farm \nbill occurred fairly quickly--about a week. So we went through a \nsomewhat similar dance. The tree was not filled, but there was \npremature cloture filed. Cloture was defeated several times. When the \ngames stopped, we went back to the farm bill. We had an open process \nfor a week and passed it.\n  We would probably be passing the farm bill today had we not used this \nprocess last week. We could have gone through the amendment process and \nworked our way through it and gotten to final passage. On today, \ninstead of defeating cloture after an unfair process for 10 days, we \ncould have been and would have been sending a farm bill on to \nconference with the House had we employed an open process which the \nSenate almost always insists upon. The farm bill will not pass today \nbecause the games have not stopped. But I will confidently predict at \nsome point they will stop. We will have an open process and, in about a \nweek, we will get a farm bill and get a conference and do the important \nwork we need to do for America's farmers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, whatever time runs past 9:30, I will use \nleader time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The leader has that right.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the farm bill, what has happened these \npast 10 days is extraordinarily wrong and negative. Today the \nRepublicans have a decision to make: Are they going to allow the farm \nbill to proceed? Everyone out there from all over this country who is \nconcerned about the farm bill, I want their eyes directed toward the \nRepublican votes cast on this today. If they try to hide under some \nprocedural nonsense, it is outlandish.\n  If cloture is invoked on the farm bill, there would be 30 hours of \noffering relevant amendments. Isn't that enough? Is it necessary that \nwe have a farm bill where we debate immigration again; where we debate \nforeign policy, including the Iraq war; medical malpractice? The answer \nis no.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  I would like to travel back in time, 10 months past, January 10, \n2007, the exact date. In that second week of 2007, America was reaching \nthe fourth full year of the war in Iraq, still without clear purpose, \nplan, or Presidential leadership. President Bush had faced a stinging \nrejection of his Iraq strategy by the votes in November. That is an \nunderstatement. He had fired his Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, \nmuch too late, but he did fire him. Republicans in the House and Senate \nwere publicly and privately breaking ranks with his strategy. The \ndemand and imperative to change course and end the war were clear. For \nthe first time in his Presidency, there was real reason to believe he \nwould heed the call for change. But on that day in January, the \nPresident did just the opposite. He called for a surge of forces in \nIraq, not a responsible transition out of combat, not a refocus on the \nwar on terror, but a plan to sink us further into the intractable Iraqi \ncivil war.\n  What were the goals of that surge? Here are the President's own \nwords:\n\n       The strategy I announced in January is . . . aimed at \n     helping the Iraqis strengthen their government so that it can \n     function even amid violence.\n       It seeks to open space for Iraq's political leaders to \n     advance the difficult process of national reconciliation, \n     which is essential to lasting security and stability.\n\n  Fast-forward to today, 10 months later. It is indisputable that the \ngoals of the surge have failed. As we speak, there are 187,500 American \ntroops in Iraq. The Iraqi Parliament created eight benchmarks for \nprogress toward national reconciliation. These benchmarks were passed \nby this Congress on a bipartisan basis and signed by the President. \nAccording to an independent analysis by the General Accounting Office, \nthe watchdog of Congress, and this country, only one and a half of \neight legislative benchmarks have been achieved. By any standard, even \nthe math of the Republicans, that is a failing grade.\n  Iraq, a country with huge natural resources, I can remember the first \ntime I met with Iraqi leaders right back here in then-Senator Frist's \noffice. We were told by the Iraqi President that he disagreed with the \ninternational assumption that Iraq had the second\n\n[[Page S14590]]\n\nlargest supply of oil in the world. He said: We have the largest supply \nof oil in the world.\n\n  Why are we pouring the treasures of this country into a country with \nthe highest oil reserves in the world?\n  Without evidence of reconciliation, the Bush administration and its \nallies are trying a new playbook--pointing to recent reductions in \nviolence. To be clear, any shift that makes conditions less dangerous \nfor our troops and the Iraqi people is welcome news. But take, for \nexample, what we read in the papers today. This past month, there were \n``only'' 1,560 violent explosions with explosive devices in Iraq--\n``only'' 1,560 in the last month. That is down from 3,200. Sounds like \na lot of violence to me.\n  We must not forget that 2007 has been the deadliest year for our \ntroops in the entire war. We must remember that about 3,900 Americans \nhave been killed. We must remember that tens of thousands have been \ngravely wounded. According to the Joint Economic Council, more than $1 \ntrillion already has been spent on the Iraq war. And 5 million Iraqi \nmen, women, and children have fled their neighborhoods or left the \ncountry altogether--about half and half; half have left the country and \nabout 2\\1/2\\ million have been displaced--out of a total population of \nabout 27 million people.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S14590, November 16, 2007 the following appears: Mr. \nREID. . . . more than $1 trillion already has been spent on the \nIraq war--$1.8 trillion to be exact. And 5 million Iraqi men, \nwomen, and children . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Mr. REID. . . . \nmore than $1 trillion already has been spent on the Iraq war. And \n5 million Iraqi men, women, and children . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  With these staggering costs and political reconciliation nowhere in \nsight, how would the President honestly judge his troop surge? We know \nhow General Petraeus rates it. In a letter to the troops he wrote:\n\n       One of the justifications of the surge, after all, was that \n     it would help create the space for Iraqi leaders to tackle \n     the tough questions and agree on key pieces of national \n     reconciliation legislation. It has not worked out as we had \n     hoped.\n\n  General Petraeus.\n  And why has reconciliation failed?\n  Yesterday's Washington Post reported the alarm among our military \nleaders that it is clear the Iraqis are simply not doing their part. \nQuoting from one article:\n\n       U.S. military officials expressed growing concern over the \n     Iraqi government's failure to capitalize on sharp declines in \n     attacks against U.S. troops and Iraqi civilians. . . .\n       The lack of political progress calls into question the core \n     rationale behind the troop buildup President Bush announced \n     in January, which was premised on the notion that improved \n     security would create space for Iraqis to arrive at new \n     power-sharing agreements.\n\n  Our troops continue to fight and die valiantly; and our treasury \ncontinues to be depleted rapidly--for a peace we seem far more \ninterested in achieving than Iraq's own political leaders--a peace we \nwant. The Iraqi leaders do not seem to want one.\n  Meanwhile, the hidden costs of the war are only growing. Our military \nis stretched nearly to a breaking point, which has prompted Secretary \nColin Powell to say: ``The army is [nearly] broken.''\n  New evidence emerges every day that President Bush's obsession with \nIraq has come at the expense of Afghanistan, once viewed as a success.\n  Now the opium trade in that country is at an all-time high. Ninety-\nthree percent of the world's opium this year is coming from \nAfghanistan. Think of the misery around the world that it has created. \nViolence is at its highest since the American intervention in \nAfghanistan, and it was reported yesterday that the Taliban has vastly \nstepped up its efforts.\n  Meanwhile, bin Laden is still free, taunting and threatening us with \nvideotapes, and his al-Qaida network--according to the Bush \nadministration's own intelligence--has regrouped and is stronger than \never.\n  We need to look no further than the crisis in Pakistan as a reminder \nthat the world can change overnight, and our ability to respond nimbly \nto new challenges is essential.\n  Are we prepared to do so? General Casey, head of the Army, a few \nweeks ago, said this:\n\n       The current demand for our forces exceeds the sustainable \n     supply. We are consumed with meeting the demands of the \n     current fight, and are unable to provide ready forces as \n     rapidly as necessary for other potential contingencies.\n\n  The evidence--from General Casey, from Secretary Powell, from the \nGeneral Accounting Office, and from constant news reports--is \nindisputable. Yet President Bush has demanded another $200 billion with \nno accountability at all.\n  But the choice is ours. Those of us who think the answer in Iraq is \nmore of the same should approve the President's request. If you think \nwe should simply stay the course, approve the President's request. But \nif you think it is time to turn the page and take a responsible path \nout of Iraq, approve the bridge fund bill that came from the House.\n  We will never turn away from our courageous troops.\n  A couple of days ago, we sent a bill to the President that he signed \nfor $470 billion. People are out here now, after Secretary Gates has \ngone and talked to the President, saying we need the money tomorrow. We \ntalked to Secretary Gates on Wednesday. On Wednesday, he said the Army \nis OK until the end of February, the Marines are OK until the middle of \nMarch. But he went on to say: If we have to start doing layoffs, we are \ngoing to go to the union members first. Everybody listen to that. The \nSecretary of Defense said: If we have to start laying people off, we \nare going to go to the union members first.\n  Does that speak of this administration, their despicable attitude \ntoward men and women who work hard, and by a chance to improve their \nlot they are union members--they are going to get laid off first--when \nthey got, 3 days ago, $470 billion that, we were told on Wednesday, \nwould take the Army until the end of February and the Marines until the \nmiddle of March?\n  This bill requires the President to start bringing these troops home \nso they can get the heroes' welcome they so bravely have earned.\n  Our bill sets a reasonable goal for the end of combat operations, and \nit finally ensures that the President will be accountable to the \nCongress and to the people.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this fair and reasonable \nlegislation we received from the House of Representatives.\n  Finally, let me say this. The vote the Republicans are having us take \nis totally unnecessary. Yesterday, when the minority leader requested a \nvote on his motion to proceed, my staff told him he could offer his \nproposal to the House appropriations bill. He chose to ignore that and, \ninstead, made the unusual motion to proceed by a minority--by a \nminority leader--so not only is this vote unnecessary, it is totally \nmeaningless. It is a motion to proceed to a Senate appropriations bill.\n\n  Let me repeat that it is a motion to proceed to a Senate \nappropriations bill. Everyone knows, even in elementary school, that \nunder our Constitution revenue bills must originate in the House of \nRepresentatives. So even if the Senate were to pass his bill, the House \nwould refuse to act on it. This would be the case regardless of which \nparty controls the House of Representatives.\n  The Republicans, when they controlled the House, also upheld their \nconstitutional role in the appropriations process, and rightfully so. \nThe only way to get the troops their funding is to act on the House-\npassed appropriations bill. Anything else is political posturing and \ndoes nothing to get the troops their needed funding.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4156\n\n  In order to give the minority leader his vote, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of H.R. 4156--\nthat is the House-passed bill--and that immediately after the clerk \nreports the bill, the minority leader be recognized to offer his bill \nas an amendment; that there be 1 hour for debate on his amendment, and \nthat the Senate vote on his amendment upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, with 60 votes needed to pass his amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. On behalf of the Republican leadership, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this summer, we had grim numbers coming \nout of Iraq and we had an election and we went through a soul-searching \nanalysis of what to do. By an 80-to-14 vote, this Senate voted to send \nGeneral Petraeus to Iraq and give him a chance to succeed. We had his \nfull report in September. We had other reports from General Jones and \nGAO, and we concluded to continue this.\n  In recent weeks, progress has exceeded what we could have expected \npossible. This is not the right time to tie the hands of our military \nleaders. It is not the right thing to do--to leave any doubt that we \nare going to support the troops we have sent into harm's way.\n  I urge colleagues to not leave our troops in uncertainty and stand \nfirm with a policy that seems to be working.

Mr. President, with all the ``he said, she said'' that has \nbeen going on in this body this week, everyone should all agree with \none voice we passed extremely important legislation, terrorism \ninsurance, which gives breathing room to the American free enterprise \nsystem, which allows various companies to go forward with what needs to \nbe done, dealing with making sure that when they have a building they \nare going to construct, that there is some ability for the purchase of \ninsurance, so if something untoward comes from these evil people around \nthe world, they are covered.\n  This is good legislation. I appreciate the cooperation of the \nRepublicans.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate has \nunanimously passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization \nAct of 2007. It is critically important for our Nation's workers and \nbusinesses that we enact this backstop legislation. The legislation \npassed today provides for an extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance \nAct, known as ``TRIA,'' which expires on December 31 of this year. TRIA \nwas originally passed in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and was \nextended for 2 years in 2005. The bill passed by the Senate today \nextends TRIA for an additional 7 years.\n  In anticipation of TRIA's expiration, the Banking Committee held a \nhearing earlier this year in which the committee heard from a variety \nof experts about the critical need to extend this program, which is \nvital to the economic security and prosperity of our Nation. As my \ncolleagues will recall, after the attacks of September 11, 2001, the \nmarket for terrorism insurance in this country virtually disappeared. \nBusinesses could not obtain credit, borrowers could not obtain loans, \njobs were at risk, and the economy faced serious instability and \ndislocation. We repeatedly heard from businesses, both large and small, \nfrom labor unions, from universities and hospitals, from manufacturers, \nbuilders, and lenders, and from insurers about the need for the Federal \nGovernment to help stabilize the market and ensure the availability of \naffordable insurance against the risk of future terrorist attacks. \nCongress responded by creating TRIA, a public-private partnership in \nwhich the Federal Government would share the risk of future terrorist \nattacks with insurers by becoming the backstop against truly \ncatastrophic losses.\n  And the overwhelming evidence shows that TRIA has worked, very very \nwell. According to several recent studies, terrorism insurance is more \nwidely available and more affordable today than in the aftermath of 9/\n11, providing certainty and stability to the sectors of our economy \nthat we depend on for our national well-being. And it is important to \nnote, TRIA has cost taxpayers virtually nothing. When terrorism \ninsurance is available at reasonable rates, and when business owners \nand property owners can insure themselves against terrorism, there is a \nprivate-sector mechanism in place to cover a significant amount of the \nlosses stemming from any future terrorist attack. In fact, a recent \nstudy by the RAND Corporation found that in the case of a terrorist \nattack, TRIA would actually save taxpayers money, as property owners \ncould rebuild using the payments from their insurance policies instead \nof federal disaster assistance. Let me quote from RAND's findings: \n``Taxpayer cost is lower with TRIA than without TRIA across a broad \nrange of scenarios when post-attack assistance is factored in as \nwell.''\n  The need to extend this program is clear. The private insurance \nindustry has not reemerged with respect to the provision of terrorism \ninsurance. Nearly all of the data and the experts say that there is no \nreason to think that the private insurance industry alone can insure \nagainst this unique risk. As long as the threat of terrorism remains, \nwe must act to ensure that terrorism insurance remains available and \naffordable.\n  I want to note that this bill contains two important studies to \naddress serious issues that were raised in the context of the TRIA \nextension debate. First, there is a mandate for the GAO to study the \nquestion of insurance for nuclear, biological, chemical, and \nradiological terrorist events. Insurance coverage in this area is very \nlimited and in this legislation we require the GAO to make \nrecommendations for expanding such coverage. Second, the GAO is \nrequired to study and to report back to the committee within 6 months \non whether there are areas of this country, such as Lower Manhattan, \nthat may have unique capacity constraints when it comes to terrorism \ninsurance, and to make recommendations for addressing those capacity \nconstraints.\n  This legislation is supported by the insurance industry and \npolicyholders, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord letters of support for the legislation. I also want to \nparticularly thank Senator Shelby for his work on this program, as well \nas Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, and Senators Reed, \nBennett, and Schumer, for their work both on this bill and on the \noriginal TRIA bill and its extension in 2005. By extending the TRIA \nprogram for an additional 7 years, this bill will address the long-term \nsecurity needs of our people and our economy, and I thank all the \nMembers of the Senate for their unanimous support for this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      International Brotherhood of\n\n\n                                                    Teamsters,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 2007.\n     Hon.

For us and our \n     families, it is an issue of jobs and our national economic \n     security, as well as one of protecting the investments of \n     pensioners to shareholders to individuals.\n       With the devastation of the September 11th attacks, and the \n     recognition that terrorism risk will be with us for the \n     foreseeable future, insurers have excluded this risk from \n     coverage, and reinsurance remains largely unavailable, \n     exposing our economic security to serious peril.\n       The essential facts that led Congress to enact the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 have not changed. We \n     continue to face an unpredictable threat with the potential \n     of mammoth losses to our economy. We continue to need \n     terrorism insurance for our economy to function in the face \n     of the terrorist threat. We continue to need the framework \n     the program provides to enable the United States to recover \n     quickly and efficiently should there be some future terrorist \n     attack.\n       As Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I encourage \n     you to act on an effective long-term federal program as soon \n     as possible.\n       Thank you for your consideration of these views.\n           Sincerely.\n\n                                        Frederick P.

Shelby, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: The Coalition \n     to Insure Against Terrorism (CIAT), a broad-based coalition \n     of business insurance policyholders, representing a \n     significant segment of the nation's GDP, strongly endorses \n     your efforts to extend and improve the Terrorism Risk \n     insurance Act (TRIA) with the introduction of the Terrorism \n     Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA).\n       CIAT is very pleased that the Senate Committee on Banking, \n     Housing and Urban Affairs is proposing bi-partisan \n     legislation to extend TRIA. As the principal consumers of \n     this vital insurance coverage, CIAT thanks you for your long-\n     standing support and leadership on the issue of terrorism \n     risk insurance.\n       The current federal terrorism risk insurance program has \n     been a tremendous success. TRIA has helped keep the economy \n     going in the face of continued terrorist threats by allowing \n     businesses across America to secure this commercially \n     necessary product, saving countless jobs in the process. \n     Moreover, it serves as an important tool to minimize the \n     severe economic disruption that almost certainly will occur \n     from a future terrorist attack.\n       With TRIEA's expiration looming at the end of 2007, CIAT is \n     extremely pleased that the extension enjoys bi-partisan \n     support in the Committee, and we look forward to the \n     Committee's consideration of it.\n       CIAT thanks you for taking a significant step towards \n     securing the economy against terrorism risk by scheduling \n     this mark-up.\n\n[[Page S14594]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                 October 16, 2007.\n     Hon.

These iconic \n     buildings are a source of public pride for millions of sports \n     fans, and, with capacities that can sometimes exceed 100,000, \n     are the sites of huge public gatherings year-round. In most \n     cases, sports venues are the result of public-private \n     partnerships that involve significant financial commitments \n     from taxpayers. And very often, they serve as anchors for \n     private investment in communities across the country.\n       In the current environment, it is critical that arenas and \n     stadia continue to be insured against a terrorist act. The \n     federal backstop established by Congress in 2002 has been a \n     tremendous success, and is the only reason that such \n     insurance remains available to policyholders. We are \n     therefore pleased that the Committee will be taking up \n     extension legislation this week, and we urge its prompt \n     passage.\n       In addition, because many of our venues are located in \n     densely populated areas, we further hope you will include \n     language similar to that in the House-passed bill (HR 2761). \n     providing private insurers with an incentive to make coverage \n     available in those areas where they would otherwise impose \n     coverage limits due to the perceived risk of terrorism.\n       Ensuring minimum economic disruption from a terrorist \n     attack is an important national objective, and guaranteeing \n     the continued availability of terrorism insurance is a key \n     component of that goal. Once again, we are grateful to the \n     Committee for its history of supporting TRIEA and strongly \n     support its extension.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                   Mutual Insurance Companies,\n\n                                                 October 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC) \n     and our over 1400 member companies we want to express our \n     support for the Committees' ``Terrorism Risk Insurance \n     Program Reauthorization Act of 2007.''\n       With the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act (TRIEA) set \n     to expire on December 31st, this legislation is vital in \n     continuing this much needed program. Following the terrorist \n     attacks on September 11, 2001, it became clear that some form \n     of federal involvement was needed to help stabilize the \n     marketplace. Despite some improvements in the marketplace, \n     NAMIC believes that the current TRIA program must be \n     reauthorized to assure an orderly economic recovery after the \n     next terrorist attack.\n       By eliminating the distinction between foreign and domestic \n     terrorism, maintaining insurers' copayments and deductibles \n     at existing levels and extending the program for seven years, \n     we feel strongly that this bill assures that terrorism \n     coverage will continue to be available to policyholders. \n     While we strongly support the base bill, we would like to \n     continue to work with the Committee to try to lower the \n     current event trigger level to $50 million to assure that \n     small and medium-sized property and casualty companies are \n     not squeezed out of the marketplace.\n       We look forward to continuing to work with you as this \n     important bill moves through the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M.

Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n         Urban Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: As you \n     prepare to mark up the ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Program \n     Reauthorization Act of 2007'' (TRIPRA), the Mortgage Bankers \n     Association (MBA) believes the seven-year extension in the \n     Chairman's Mark signals to the real estate finance industry \n     and the nation as a whole that terrorism risk insurance will \n     remain available and affordable over an extended period of \n     time. This certainty bolsters the capital market's confidence \n     in the commercial and residential real estate finance \n     industries and fosters market stability.\n       In addition, recently uncovered domestic and international \n     terrorist plots indicate that the distinction between foreign \n     and domestic source terrorism has blurred to the point where \n     such distinctions are meaningless. Accordingly, we strongly \n     support the clarifying language contained in TRIPRA that \n     eliminates this distinction and allows domestic source \n     terrorism to be included in TRIPRA.\n       MBA remains concerned about nuclear, biological, chemical \n     and radiological (NBCR) risks We stand ready to participate \n     in an effort that would bring together the federal \n     government, policy holders, the insurance industry, and \n     insurance regulators to perform a comprehensive evaluation of \n     the challenges facing the development of the NBCR insurance \n     market and provide recommendations for overcoming these \n     challenges.\n       Once again, MBA commends you for working together to extend \n     TRIEA. A long-term extension helps provide the clarity and \n     certainty of the federal government's response to a terrorist \n     attack will serve as an important deterrent to future \n     attacks. MBA salutes you for this effort and offers its full \n     support of TRIPRA.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Kieran P. Quinn,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Building and Construction\n\n\n                                            Trades Department,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd: I am writing to you to encourage prompt \n     action on the issue of terrorism risk insurance. This issue \n     is of critical importance to my members and their families \n     all across the United States. For those of us whose jobs \n     depend on this important coverage to do business, this is not \n     just an issue of protecting the investments of pensioners, \n     shareholders, bondholders and individuals from across the \n     nation. It is an issue of jobs and our national economic \n     security.\n       Since 9/11, the threat of terrorism remains a clear and \n     present danger as are the economic risks associated with this \n     peril. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) and its \n     extension have been essential to those of us who depend on \n     this coverage. But the current law, TRIA, is, as you know, \n     set to expire in just over 3 months, and people now in the \n     market for terror coverage that extends into next year are \n     being told that their coverage will end if Congress fails to \n     act.\n       The essential facts that motivated Congress to enact TRIA \n     in 2002 have not changed. Terrorism continues to be an \n     unpredictable threat with potentially mammoth losses. \n     Insurers continue to say terrorism risk is uninsurable. Our \n     economy continues to need terrorism insurance in order to \n     function in the face of the terrorist threat.\n       Most importantly, our economy needs the framework the \n     program provides to enable us to recover quickly and \n     efficiently after some future terrorist attack. If not \n     extended, the real victims will be the millions of good men \n     and women who depend on the construction industry for their \n     livelihood.\n       We encourage you as Chairman of the Senate Banking \n     Committee to enact an effective long-term federal program as \n     soon as possible.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important \n     national issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark H. Ayers,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 2007.\n\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We understand that tomorrow your \n     Committee will markup legislation to reauthorize the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). We urge your Committee \n     to approve legislation that is permanent or that extends TRIA \n     for a term of years that is as long as possible.\n       The ABA believes it is very important to pass a long-term \n     or permanent reauthorization of TRIA, which was enacted after \n     September 11, 2001, in order to create a program that helps \n     stabilize the commercial property and casualty insurance \n     markets and ensures the continued availability of terrorism \n     insurance for U.S. businesses. Terrorism insurance is \n     required by banks and financing \n     institutions prior to approving loans on commercial real \n     estate projects and development. Insurance companies are \n     reluctant to offer terrorism insurance without TRIA, which is \n     set to expire at the end of December 2007. In order to \n     prevent market disruption, it is critical for Congress to act \n     promptly so that new policies for 2008 can be written by \n     insurers and purchased by policyholders prior to TRIA's \n     expiration.\n       TRIA has helped stabilize the price of terrorism insurance \n     by reducing the amount of risk borne by insurers. Without \n     this federal backstop, many insurers would not provide \n     terrorism coverage. The unpredictability of terrorism \n     diminishes the ability of the private market to underwrite \n     this risk, which is significantly more difficult to predict \n     and model than other kinds of risks. The risk is so variable \n     and difficult to predict that insurers and reinsurers will \n     only put limited amounts of capital at risk. The government \n     backstop helps to consolidate the risk of catastrophic events \n     so that the consequences of\n\n[[Page S14595]]\n\n     modeling mistakes are shared by the federal government and \n     the private insurance industry, rather than by individual \n     insurers alone.\n       A government backstop is especially needed in the area of \n     insurance coverage for nuclear, chemical, biological, and \n     radiological attacks. At the present time, there is little \n     insurance available for such attacks apart from coverage \n     mandated by state law, such as workers compensation.\n       The government-industry partnership benefits policyholders \n     and the economy. Some critics of TRIA improperly characterize \n     it as an ``industry bailout'' bill. Such rhetoric is both \n     overblown and misplaced. After September 11, and prior to \n     TRIA's enactment, exclusions from terrorism risk were \n     approved in 45 states and the District of Columbia. It is \n     therefore reasonable to assume that without sufficient \n     reinsurance, or another financial loss-sharing mechanism like \n     the federal backstop, most insurers could simply exclude \n     terrorism risk from their coverage.\n       The federal government, because of its massive national \n     security apparatus and its superior access to information, is \n     in the best position to partner with the insurance industry \n     to provide terrorism insurance. Moreover, experience has \n     shown that the government will likely provide assistance to \n     victims of a major terrorist attack; it behooves the federal \n     government to be involved prior to the attack in order to \n     receive the benefits of advance planning, risk management, \n     capital accumulation, and the opportunity to use the \n     underwriting and claims expertise of the insurance industry.\n       We urge your Committee to approve legislation that would \n     provide for the permanent or long-term reauthorization of \n     TRIA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Denise A. Cardman,\n     Acting Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   America's Comunity Bankers,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: On behalf of \n     America's Community Bankers (ACB) and its member banks \n     representing over $1.7 trillion in assets across the nation, \n     I am writing to express our strong support for the Terrorism \n     Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 and the \n     Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2007. These \n     two pieces of legislation, scheduled for consideration during \n     the Committees Executive Session on Wednesday, October 17, \n     2007 will provide much needed certainty to both the \n     commercial and residential lending market by ensuring that \n     adequate terrorism and flood insurance safeguards remain both \n     affordable and available They will also provide certainty to \n     our nation's lenders who require these types of coverage for \n     the commercial and residential loans they originate\n       ACB particularly appreciates the inclusion of a provision \n     that extends the terrorism risk insurance program beyond what \n     has become a standard two years. This will allow time for the \n     private market to innovate and develop private-based \n     solutions for permanently covering this level of risk.\n       We commend you both for crafting balanced legislation that \n     will ensure adequate continuity in our nation's lending and \n     insurance markets, and we look forward to working with you in \n     passing these very important bills.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Robert R.

NAR, supports the Terrorism \n     Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) being \n     considered on Wednesday, October 17.\n       The availability of terrorism insurance is vital to the \n     continued strength of the commercial real estate markets. \n     Without a reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance \n     Program by the end of the year, terrorism coverage will \n     likely become unaffordable and widely unavailable. As we \n     continue to fight the WAR on terror, our enemies may look \n     beyond the iconic real estate of our major urban centers and \n     consider soft targets such as shopping centers and suburban \n     offices. NAR supports a comprehensive extension of the \n     Terrorism Risk Insurance Program which provides a long-term \n     duration, eliminates the distinction between foreign and \n     domestic acts of terrorism, and evaluates whether the federal \n     backstop program should be strengthened to enable insurance \n     providers to make nuclear, biological, chemical, and \n     radiological event coverage available at an affordable rate.\n       Again, I thank the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and \n     Urban Affairs for addressing the need to extend the Terrorism \n     Risk Insurance Program in a timely and comprehensive manner. \n     NAR urges you to support TRIPRA.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Pat V.

We represent more than 1,000 \n     members who insure America's large and small businesses in \n     every sector of the economy.\n       TRIA works. This program has successfully protected \n     millions of individuals, businesses and the U.S. economy \n     since January 2003 and has made it possible for insurers to \n     cover an otherwise uninsurable risk. We greatly appreciate \n     the leadership both of you have shown in crafting legislation \n     to renew this vital program that has been a foundation on \n     which America's economic strength is built. We are \n     particularly appreciative of the exclusion of a mandatory \n     ``make available'' requirement for nuclear, chemical, \n     biological and radiological (NBCR) attacks, and also of the \n     inclusion of a seven-year term, which will allow time for a \n     fair analysis of the potential for private sector growth in \n     this market.\n       We look forward to our continued work with you as this \n     much-needed bill moves through the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Benjamin McKay,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Multi Housing Council and National Apartment \n           Association,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 2007.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd: On behalf of the National Multi Housing \n     Council (NMHC) and the National Apartment Association (NAA), \n     we would like to express our strong support for the \n     ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of \n     2007'' (TRIPRA).\n       The NMHC and the NAA represent the nation's leading firms \n     participating in the multifamily rental housing industry. Our \n     combined memberships are engaged in all aspects of the \n     apartment industry, including ownership, development, \n     management, and finance. The NMHC represents the principal \n     officers of the apartment industry's largest and most \n     prominent firms. The NAA is the largest national federation \n     of state and local apartment associations. NAA is comprised \n     of 190 affiliates and represents nearly 50,000 professionals \n     who own and manage more than 6 million apartments. NMHC and \n     NAA jointly operate a federal legislative program and provide \n     a unified voice for the private apartment industry.\n       We are extremely pleased with the proposed 7-year \n     extension. This recognizes the long-term need for the program \n     and will bring certainty to the market relative to pricing \n     and capacity. With the December 31, 2007 expiration date of \n     the program quickly approaching, we are reminded of the \n     interruptions that result with looming expiration dates that \n     are harmful to the overall health of the market for terrorism \n     insurance. Certainty in costs and coverage limits are \n     critical components in a multifamily property owner's \n     continued ability to offer safe and affordable housing. We \n     are also pleased to see the elimination of the distinction \n     between foreign and domestic acts of terrorism.\n       The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) and the \n     Terrorism Risk Extension Act of 2005 (TRIEA) have been the \n     mechanism that provides ready access to affordable terrorism \n     insurance coverage for commercial property owners and \n     developers, as well as countless small and large companies \n     throughout the United States. The real estate industry \n     represents one of the highest take up rates among all \n     policyholders for terrorism coverage. According to results of \n     the NMHC 2007 Risk Survey, 87.1 percent of apartment firms \n     surveyed purchased terrorism coverage as part of their \n     property program.\n       NMHC/NAA remain optimistic that over time private market \n     solutions will reduce or eliminate the need for federal \n     support. However, we are not there yet. Until such time we \n     support the federal government's continued role to ensure \n     that terrorism risk insurance is available and affordable for \n     all American businesses. We encourage your support for the \n     ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of \n     2007'' (TRIPRA).\n       Thank you for your support of this critical program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Jim Arbury,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n\n[[Page S14596]]\n\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last night I had the honor and pleasure of \ngoing to a birthday party. I, personally, never had birthday parties. \nMy mother always said my birthday was too close to Christmas, so I \nguess we made up for it on Christmas. But the party last night was \nsensational.\n  Hundreds of people showed up. They showed up a few days early, but \nonly a few days, because this coming week Senator Robert Byrd will be \n90 years old. He holds all kinds of records. I often compare him with \nthe greatest baseball player of all time, Babe Ruth, for obvious \nreasons.\n  What a pleasure it has been for me to serve in the Senate, but every \nday that goes by that I am able to serve in the Senate, I reflect upon \nhow fortunate I am to serve with Senator Byrd and the many courtesies \nhe has extended to me; from the first time I arrived in the Senate, \nwhen he asked: Senator, will you agree to conduct hearings for the \nInterior Subcommittee on Appropriations?\n  That was as good as scoring a touchdown, to have Senator Byrd ask me \nto conduct a hearing. He was chairman of that subcommittee, and I did \nthat. When work was to be done on that committee, it didn't matter what \nI had scheduled, I set it aside so I could satisfy Senator Byrd and do \na good job of conducting those hearings.\n  I wish Senator Byrd happy birthday. As I said last night at the \nbirthday party, I also wish to tell him how much I appreciate all he \nhas done for me personally, all he has done for the people of West \nVirginia, all he has done for the people of the State of Nevada, and \nall he has done for our country.\n  It is such a thought-provoking thing, to think that I have been able \nto serve with Senator Byrd and serve in some of the positions he has \nheld: Minority leader, majority leader, minority whip, majority whip.\n  Last night I was so happy. Senator Byrd was his old self. There he \nwas up there in front of everybody, without a note, reciting poetry \nfrom memory. I have said it before, but I will say it again, I want him \nto hear this and I want everyone else to hear this. I have a lot of \nfavored stories about Senator Byrd, but this is my favorite.\n  I came back from Nevada. I was right back here. Senator Byrd said: \nWhat did you do this weekend?\n  I said: Senator Byrd, I grabbed a little paperback book out of my \nlibrary and I read ``The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.''\n  Senator Byrd did as I have seen him do many times: Robinson Crusoe? \nHe was on that island 28 years, 6 months, 2 weeks, and 3 days.\n  I looked at him. I said: What is he talking about? I just read the \nbook. I went back to my home and looked, and there it was. He hadn't \nread the book for 40 years, but in that computer he has that is a \nbrain, he was able to recall that.\n  That is only one indication of the abilities of this orphan who is so \nproud of being from West Virginia. He may have been an orphan growing \nup, but he is not an orphan in the Senate. He has a family who loves \nhim.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when Robert C. Byrd was born, America \nhad just sent its first troops to France, an angry mob had just \nabolished private property in Russia, and the New York Times published \nits first op-ed piece.\n  Unfortunately, the ``Times'' would continue to publish daily \neditorials in addition to those op-eds. But fortunately for the country \nand for us, his colleagues, the Lord granted Robert Carlyle Byrd the \ngift of years--a lot of them.\n  Next week, Senator Byrd celebrates one more milestone in a long and \ngrowing list of them: his 90th birthday. And I think I speak for every \nMember of this body when I say we are grateful to have lived in an age \nin which we could serve with such a remarkable man.\n  Writing about the foundation of any great society, Ralph Waldo \nEmerson wrote:\n\n     Not gold, but only men can make a nation great and strong\n     Men who for truth and honor's sake stand fast and labor long\n     Real men who work while others sleep\n     Who dare while others fly\n     They build a nation's pillars deep\n     And lift them to the sky\n\n  Robert Byrd is such a man. Indeed, those words seem almost to have \nbeen written with him in mind.\n  Senator, we revere you for your many achievements, we thank you for \nalways bringing us back to our purpose here, we wish you a very happy \nbirthday, and many more to come.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14596-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EXPLANATION OF OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will take a few short minutes because I \nknow others want to honor Senator Byrd, and there is some other \nbusiness to discuss. The bill I objected to today comes before us \nbecause we have some questions. The chairman of the committee, Senator \nKerry from Massachusetts, and Senator Snowe, the ranking member, have \nit right, wanting to help our veterans and to make sure they have great \nopportunities as they return. But I remind my colleagues that this last \nyear, in the SBA, we stole $26 million worth of their salaries to run \nthat, to do directed earmarks. So we have this great new leader at the \nSBA, Steven Preston. Yet we have handcuffed him in his ability to do \nwhat he needs to do at the SBA.\n  We noticed in the paper yesterday a tremendous, large number of loans \nwhere things have been faked. The SBA hadn't had the capability of \nmanaging the SBA properly. So our purpose in doing this is not to go \nagainst the veterans we see. Nobody stands as a greater supporter than \nI in terms of protecting their privacy, their second-amendment rights, \nand honoring them.\n  We do want to do this. The offset that is in this bill comes out of a \nmicroloan that is also designed to help veterans. So we are taking \nmoney from one area and not the other at the same time we are stealing \nmoney from the SBA's operational money to do earmarks that don't do \nanything to help veterans.\n  My pledge to both Senator Kerry and Snowe is to look at this and see \nif we can't come to some resolution about our concerns over the \nintervening time between now and the time we come back and make a \ncommitment to try to do that.\n  But most important is, what we want to do is preserve freedom. An \never-encroaching Federal Government does not preserve the very freedom \nthat those veterans fought for.\n  I yield.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14596-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14596-S14597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to wish a very happy \nbirthday today to my colleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd, and to say a \ncouple of things about him.\n  As the majority leader indicated, we had a wonderful reception for \nhim last night, and what was interesting to me was not only the warmth \nof what it was that those who spoke said of him, but even more \nimportant was the fact that in the crowd of 2 or 300, I would say 80 \npercent of them had come up from West Virginia or were West Virginians \nwho had come from other parts of the country.\n  It was actually the strongest statement of the evening because it \nreflects their love and their respect. These were people who would not \nordinarily do something such as this because they have other matters \nthey might need to attend to because they are public officials or \nbecause of their positions--they are scholars or whatever. But they \nmade their way up here so they could pay their tribute by their \npresence, even though they could not say a word to Senator Byrd.\n  That meant a lot to me, to understand--as I do anyway--the way people \nfeel.\n  I also wish to say one of the things I have always most admired about \nSenator Byrd is he grew up the hard way.\n\n[[Page S14597]]\n\nWe have talked about that from time to time, all of us who comment on \nSenator Byrd, from one birthday to another, and how he persevered and \nhow he never grew discouraged. He had very little means with which to \nlive, but he had something called iron will and a sense of purpose.\n  It is not entirely clear to me that his sense of purpose was to be \ndirected to the Senate in his early years, when he was working for the \nmilitary, as a ship builder, as a meat cutter, and doing other things \nhe needed to do, particularly when he was in West Virginia, for the \npurpose of surviving.\n  But what actually interests me almost the least about next Tuesday is \nthat it is his 90th birthday. That is not what I think of when I think \nof Robert C. Byrd. I don't think about his age. I think about his \nabsolutely dominant sense of discipline, self-control, purpose, and a \nwillingness to do whatever needs to be done to accomplish a goal for \nWest Virginia.\n  Senator Byrd and this speaker, this Senator, understand very well how \nhard it is for West Virginia to succeed, to make strides forward, \npartly because of the nature of its topography--only 4 percent of the \nland is flat. There is a very interesting effect of that 4 percent. I \nthink Senator Byrd would agree with me. It causes us not only to have \nto fit most of the industry in that 4 percent, but a lot of the people \nare fit into that 4 percent. Therefore, by definition, the word \n``community,'' and from that the word ``family,'' has a powerful \nmeaning in West Virginia.\n  I wasn't born in West Virginia. I came to West Virginia as a VISTA \nvolunteer and worked in a very challenged community for 2 years as a \nVISTA volunteer. It was that sense of family, of people looking out for \neach other, that turned my life upside down and made me want to stay \nthere and fight for West Virginia.\n  The phrase ``fighting for West Virginia'' is what sums up Robert C. \nByrd, whether it is his 50th birthday or his 90th birthday. It has \nnever changed with him. The fight for West Virginia, in our part of the \nworld, is a sacred cause; No. 1, because it is hard; No. 2, because \nthere are so many people who don't understand West Virginia, don't \nunderstand West Virginians.\n  But then an interesting thing happens. They come to West Virginia on \na visit. When they go to the Greenbrier, that doesn't quite count as \ngoing to West Virginia. But if they come to the rest of West Virginia, \nthey are usually overwhelmed. This can be reporters, this can be \nobservers, this can be people who are doing business or visiting in \nWest Virginia--they are overwhelmed by the sense of warmth, honesty, \nintegrity, purpose. For the most part, it is a hard life, a fairly low \naverage family income, people living at the margins--some people doing \nspectacularly well. Many of them leave the State. Many of them stay in \nthe State.\n  But West Virginia takes work. It takes hard work. That is what \nSenator Robert C. Byrd is all about and that is what I think of when I \nthink of him on this day, on next Tuesday, or any time in the future: \nthe capacity and the love of hard work. It is a requirement for a \nSenator from West Virginia, but it has been the particular domain of \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia. Yes, it is true that he has held \npowerful positions and does hold powerful positions in the Senate. What \ncan one make of that? The fact that he has been here and he has earned \nthose positions.\n  But he has done everything in his power to help our people and to \nhelp our communities. That is essentially what I am here for, but I am \nstaggered by what he has done.\n  It is not just the building of roads--that is what is usually \nassociated with Senator Byrd--but it is all kinds of work. When you \npick up a local newspaper, often somebody--some institution, some \ncollege, some volunteer fire department, some research institute at one \nof our universities or colleges--has been helped by Senator Byrd.\n  It is work, it is simply hard work.\n  It is like the memorization which has been referred to so often. It \nis the power of memory. If you memorize poems, if you memorize books, \nif you memorize English monarchs, that takes work. It takes a \nparticular type of diligence, fanatical commitment to achieving a \npurpose. So he can do it on that cerebral side, the intellectual side, \nand he does it all the time in serving West Virginia.\n  I can remember in happier days for all of us, when Irma, his beloved \nwife, was living. I would call him--I would try not to call Senator \nByrd too often at home--and she would say: Oh, he is out on the porch \nhaving a cigar.\n  I would feel good. I would feel good because it would be one of the \nvery few times that I had ever heard of Senator Byrd not working but \nactually sitting on the porch smoking a cigar. Now, he may have been \nreading the Constitution, he may have been reading the Encyclopedia \nBritannica, I have no idea. But he was smoking a cigar. Or sometimes he \nwould take a walk with his beloved dog Billy. And those things he \ntreasured.\n  So he did have his moments of solace and his moments of quietude. I \nthink a particularly hard blow for him, and therefore for my wife \nSharon and myself, was the death of his wife. She was the, as they say, \nmoving wind under his wings. He adored her. We have had many \nconversations about her. Yet when she passed on, it did not change his \nnature. It saddened him. He does not show his emotions. But it did not \nchange his nature as a worker. So he will be 90, that should be noted \nas a fact, on Tuesday. But on Tuesday he will also be an incredible \nfighter for the people of West Virginia and, yes, of the Constitution \nand, yes, the place of the Senate in our pattern of Government. But, \nfundamentally, his heart, his work, his attention, over and above what \nhe has given to his family, has been helping the people of West \nVirginia. That is what we are elected to do. We all do it in one way or \nanother. Some just do it in a superior way because they have the \nsuperior ability and a superior focus and a superior concentration and \nan overwhelming love for their State, which nurtured them, brought them \nup, and gave them the values Senator Byrd has.\n  Senator Byrd, I am tempted at this point to say: Here is to you. But \nyou do not drink. That is another one of your good characteristics. So \nI am not going to say that. I am just going to say I am extremely proud \nto be your colleague. I am very moved by every aspect of your career \nwhich, I think, in the broad sweep of America, matches anybody.\n  Lots of people can make money. They have an idea, they turn it into a \nproduct, the product sells, they make a lot of money, and then they go \nbuy houses and do things. Very few people have the constancy of purpose \nand love of State, driven greatly now by the memory of Irma, which is \nalways with you every minute of every day.\n  So I honor you, Senator Byrd. I wish you a happy birthday, and many \nhappy birthdays to come.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish Senator Byrd a happy birthday. I \nwas there at the celebration last night. Senator Byrd is one of the \ngreat men in American history. As people will look back on his career, \nthey will see a truly remarkable public servant. It has been my \nprivilege in the 21 years I have been here to watch Senator Byrd, to \nlearn from him. He is a truly remarkable man, a renaissance man, \nsomebody who studied not only American history but world history. He \nhas learned from what he has studied. He brings the wisdom of the ages \nto this Chamber.\n  We have enormous admiration for what Senator Byrd has meant to this \ncountry, to his State, and to the Senate that he loves so much. We all \nrecognize Senator Byrd and want to honor him on this special day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14597-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14597-S14599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3074\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n3074, the Transportation-HUD Appropriations Act; that there be 20 \nminutes of debate with respect to the conference report; with the time \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Murray and Bond or \ntheir designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on adoption of the conference report, without further \nintervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S14598]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is objection on behalf of members of \nthe \nRepublican side. As you know, the Republican leader objected to the \nsame request yesterday. There is objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are about to begin one of the busiest \ntravel seasons of the year--the week of our Thanksgiving holiday. The \nmillions of Americans who will take to our Nation's roads, rails, and \nairways probably won't have the country's transportation budget on \ntheir minds. But we had them in mind as we put together this bipartisan \nTransportation-Housing appropriations bill and negotiated the \nconference agreement before us today. Unfortunately, the Senate \nRepublican leadership has now formally blocked our ability to have a \nvote on this conference agreement and move it to the White House. And \nthat is shameful.\n  Our conference report invests in rebuilding our infrastructure and \nmodernizing our safety systems. It spends the money needed to \nadequately staff our air traffic control towers and hire the safety \ninspectors for aircraft, pipelines, and railroads that are needed to \nprotect us. It rejects misguided budget cuts proposed by the White \nHouse to slash the number of safety inspectors, underfund our highway \nneeds, and throw Amtrak into bankruptcy.\n  This bill also keeps faith with another American Thanksgiving \ntradition--giving back to those who are less fortunate. It rejects the \nPresident's proposals to slash housing funds for the elderly and the \ndisabled and provides necessary increases to shelter the homeless and \nkeep federally subsidized tenants in their homes.\n  Finally, this holiday, millions of families will worry that they \nwon't be able to keep their homes for another year. Millions are facing \nforeclosure on their homes in the coming months as their mortgage \npayments rise to unaffordable levels. This agreement helps address that \ncrisis by targeting a quarter of a billion dollars to ensure these \nfamilies get counseling that will allow them to stay in their homes. We \nare working to stop the rising number of foreclosures and increasing \ndespair among the millions of citizens who pursued the American dream \nof homeownership.\n  Throughout this process, I have worked closely with a very able \npartner, my ranking member, Senator Bond of Missouri. We held numerous \nhearings together. We negotiated every line of a very complicated \nspending bill together, and we negotiated the details of a conference \nreport with the House together. Senator Bond and I didn't agree on \nevery issue or every funding level, but we continued to make \ncompromises so that we could keep the team together, press forward with \nour joint responsibilities.\n  We were able to put together an appropriations bill that was reported \nby our committee without one dissenting vote. That bill passed the \nSenate with 88 votes. We then negotiated a conference agreement that \nearned the signature of every single conferee, on both sides of the \naisle, on both sides of Capitol. I am so proud of how well we were able \nto work together to get this important bill done. This is truly a \nbipartisan bill.\n  Sadly, President Bush threatened to veto this agreement--despite the \nyears of neglect it seeks to reverse--and even though it has strong \nbipartisan support. The President says he opposes this bill because it \nspends about $3 billion more than the levels he requested for these \nprograms back in February. I think it is unconscionable that he wants \nto spend $196 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan--in this year \nalone. Yet he refuses to invest just $3 billion on some of the basic \nneeds of every American--transportation and housing.\n  What is even worse is that instead of standing up for programs they \nbelieve in--that they supported already--the Republican leadership here \nin the Senate has decided to stand in the way in order to protect \nPresident Bush from having to veto these important projects. The Senate \nRepublican leadership put their loyalty to this failed Presidency above \nall the good this bill can do--and above the fact that 88 Members of \nthe Senate supported it.\n  Clearly, when the Senate Republican leadership calls for \nbipartisanship--as they have several times since they became the \nminority--they don't necessarily mean it. When we have a truly \nbipartisan agreement, they might still kill it just to score a \npolitical point. And that is a tragedy for the Senate and for \nAmericans.\n  So I think it is important to point out why this bill spends more \nthan the President's request. It is because all the conferees--\nDemocrats and Republicans alike refused to let our bridges and highways \ncrumble. They refused to go into the busiest travel week of the year by \nslashing funding for airports and railways. They refused to let our \nfamilies lose their homes without an opportunity to work with their \nlender and professional counselors to keep it. And they refused to let \nour returning heroes lie homeless on the street in need of shelter and \nmental health services.\n  Now let me share some examples of why this bill should move forward.\n  We have all heard the stories this year about record flight delays \nthat have disrupted people's travel plans across the country. Customer \nservice complaints are at an alltime high. Our airports and runways are \nnow more congested than they have ever been. And that is on a normal \nnonholiday week--some 27 million Americans will take to the \nairways this Thanksgiving.\n\n  We also face a huge challenge as we work to replace the thousands of \nair traffic controllers and safety inspectors who are scheduled to \nretire over the next several years. The void they will leave threatens \nthe safety and reliability of our airlines. Many of our controllers are \nstill using equipment that is two decades old or older. But if the \nPresident had his way, we would cut funding to modernize our air \ntraffic control system by more than $50 million.\n  Well, not one Democratic or Republican conferee on our bill stood up \nfor the President's dramatic cuts in airport investment. And no one \nagreed that the cutting our investment in modernized equipment was a \ngood idea.\n  The President just doesn't get it. Just yesterday, he voiced concern \nabout flight delays even as he continued to threaten to veto this bill. \nOnly someone who flies on Air Force One could make those two statements \nat the same time. Travelers will have President Bush and the Senate \nRepublican leadership to thank as they wait at the gate and on the \nrunway, this holiday weekend.\n  Mr. President, the next is train travel. This coming Wednesday--the \nday before Thanksgiving--more than 125,000 Americans will use the \nAmtrak system in just 1 day. Our overcrowded highways and runways \naren't able to absorb those travelers. We have to keep up our \ninvestments in options like Amtrak, which will cut down on highway \ncongestion and air pollution caused by cars stalled in traffic. Yet the \nPresident proposed to decimate Amtrak's funding, which would have \nthrown the railroad into certain bankruptcy.\n  Well, all the conferees--House and Senate--Democrats and \nRepublicans--refused to slash funding for Amtrak by nearly 40 percent--\nor almost $500 million. Not one wanted to lose our Nation's passenger \nrail service to the President's misguided budget priorities.\n  Thirdly, we agreed to spend more than the President requested because \nthe conferees recognized that the millions of holiday travelers who \ntake to the highways next week will cross over 600,000 bridges that the \nFederal Highway Administration has rated as ``Deficient.'' Mr. \nPresident, 80,000 of those bridges have been deemed to be functionally \nobsolete, meaning they don't meet today's design standards for safety, \nand they are handling traffic far beyond what they are designed for. \nThese are not just remote bridges in sparse parts of the country, \neither--6,000 of those deficient bridges are on the National Highway \nSystem--the core network of highways that connect our major cities and \ntowns.\n  We still have a tragic reminder of the cost of neglecting our \nhighways and bridges. In the city of Minneapolis, tens of thousands of \nThanksgiving travelers will be required to take alternative routes due \nto the collapse of Interstate 35W bridge.\n  This conference report includes $195 million to help complete the \nreconstruction of the I-35W bridge. It also includes additional \nspending authority of $1 billion dollars from the Highway\n\n[[Page S14599]]\n\nTrust Fund to allow all 50 States to beef up bridge inspections and \nrebuild or renovate their most deficient bridges. That additional \nspending authority came about as a result of my amendment, which passed \non the floor back in early September. I want to thank the many \nRepublican Senators who supported me on that vote.\n  Now the President's budget was formulated and delivered to Congress \nbefore the Minneapolis tragedy. But I just think it is wrong that the \nPresident hasn't altered his budget priorities one penny in the wake of \nthat reality.\n  Both sides of the aisle in Congress have heard the wake-up call on \nthe need to address our most critical, deteriorating infrastructure. \nYet the President would rather spend $196 billion on the war than help \nour communities ensure their safety.\n  Our conference agreement also helps protect homeowners who are \nstruggling to keep a roof over their heads. It spends more than the \nPresident's request because the conferees--Democrats and Republicans \nalike--didn't hide from the subprime mortgage crisis that is \nthreatening to destroy many middle-income communities across the \nNation.\n  In the next two quarters, more than 2 million homeowners throughout \nthe Nation will see their mortgage payments rise. Many of them will \nstruggle or fail to meet these new, higher payments. We are now seeing \ncommunities where every other home--or every third home--is being \nabandoned by homeowners who can't meet their payments. Whole \ncommunities are having their economic underpinnings ripped from beneath \nthem. Many of these near-ghost towns have been concentrated in the \nindustrial Midwest. But Senators must know--if something isn't done to \naddress this crisis soon, we will find these communities all across the \ncountry.\n  Our conference agreement includes a special infusion of $200 million \nto boost housing counseling efforts to help keep struggling mortgage-\nholders in their homes. It is the same level that was included in the \nSenate version of the bill--a 500-percent increase over the current \nlevel. And rather than send this additional funding into the HUD \nbureaucracy, we have sent it out for competitive grants through the \nNeighborhood Reinvestment Corporation--a federally chartered \ncorporation that specializes in this area.\n  I am especially proud that this agreement helps protect our veterans, \nwho-- tragically--now make up a quarter of the homeless population.\n  Veterans Day just passed. In the speech I delivered in my home State, \nI said we ought to be asking what we can do--as a community, a state, \nand a nation--for our veterans. The conferees on our Transportation-\nHousing bill--Democrats and Republicans alike--refused to turn their \nback on the realities facing our returning heroes from Iraq and \nAfghanistan and all past conflicts. So our bill took one step in the \nright direction for our veterans. It includes $75 million for \nadditional housing vouchers, which provide housing assistance through \nHUD, as well as supportive services through the VA to help get our \nheroes back on their feet.\n  This isn't the first year the President has tried to underfund our \nNation's housing and transportation system. The cuts this Congress \nrefused to adopt this year are the very same reckless cuts proposed by \nthe Bush administration in 2007, in 2006, in 2005, and every other \nyear. The President has been proposing to slash funding for the CDBG \nProgram, for elderly and disabled housing, for Amtrak, and for \nairports--year, after year, after year. This year was no different--and \nCongress responded the same way. The only difference between this year \nand prior years is that this year President Bush is threatening to veto \nthe bill. And the Senate Republican leadership is determined to protect \nhim from having to make that hard decision.\n  But the American people don't care about party politics. They care \nabout whether their bridges are safe enough to travel on. They care \nabout whether they will have to sit for hours in the airport because \ntheir flights were delayed. They care--when they are sitting on a train \nplatform--about whether the train is actually going to arrive. And they \ncare about our homeless veterans and the need to keep struggling \nmortgage-holders in their homes.\n  Our conference committee addressed those realities head-on and came \nup with a bipartisan solution. I only wish the Senate Republican \nleadership had these concerns of the American people on their minds \nrather than their need to protect a misguided President who is so out \nof touch with the American people.\n  We learned today where bipartisanship begins and ends for the Senate \nRepublican leadership. It begins with empty, insincere rhetoric on the \nSenate floor. And it ends when it comes to the need to protect \nPresident Bush. When the American people wonder why important \nlegislation is not passing out of the Senate, they should look at this \nexample, one where the Senate Republican leadership is blocking \nprogress on a bill that bears the signature of every Republican who \nworked on it--one where the needs of the American people are thrown out \nthe window in favor of the need to protect a failed President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14599-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14599-S14600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO SENATOR BYRD\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Certainly, Senator Rockefeller, being Senator \nByrd's colleague, with great emotion, I noted, commented on his \ncolleague's birthday.\n  I hope perhaps coming from someone on the other side of the aisle it \nwill be equally meaningful to recognize Senator Byrd's birthday, but \nalso recognizing his long service here, not just his birthday.\n  We all hope we can continue to achieve those birthdays, but more \nimportant is the ability to represent the people of our State, the \npeople of the United States, and do so over a long and distinguished \ncareer.\n  There are few who have matched Senator Byrd in that regard. I join \nSenator Rockefeller in extending my best wishes to Senator Byrd, \nsomeone who, like me, loves bluegrass music. The only difference is he \ncan play it; I cannot. Happy birthday, Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I join in wishing Senator Byrd a happy 90th \nbirthday. I first heard Senator Byrd speak, and for that matter play \nhis fiddle, in 1974 in Shelby, OH, a city in north central Ohio.\n  I was a candidate, right out of school, for the State legislature. I \nknew of Senator Byrd's reputation, but I never heard him play the \nfiddle, and I was honored by his coming to this small town and playing \nthe fiddle for the assembled 200 or 300 people.\n  I also had the pleasure of listening to Senator Byrd earlier this \nyear as a freshman member of this body as he spoke to the Democratic \ncaucus lunch. He talked about his background. He was born during the \nflu epidemic. It took members of his and so many families' lives, and \nhis struggles, as Senator Rockefeller said, made him into the scholar \nand the fighter for economic justice that he has been.\n  Then I had the pleasure of visiting Senator Byrd in his office my \nfirst month on the job. He then came out during my maiden speech on the \nSenate floor and made a comment that my daughter talks about to this \nday. He said: Senator Brown's words will be in the Congressional Record \nnot for 100 years but 1,000 years. And my daughter called me up right \nafterward and said Senator Byrd said the words will be in the \nCongressional Record in 1,000 years.\n  But more important than that, he gave me his collection of speeches \non the history of the Roman Senate, something we all, as newer Members \nof the body, should have the opportunity, and should take advantage of \nthe opportunity to learn from his writings about the Roman Senate, how \nwe can make this Senate work better than sometimes it does.\n  I would finally say, as the Senator from the State on the other side \nof the Ohio River, we share Parkersburg and Marietta and Belpre. We \nshare Wheeling and Belmont County, Saint Clairsville, Bellaire, \nFlushing, across the river, and all up and down the river. People on my \nside of the river have such great admiration--of course,\n\n[[Page S14600]]\n\nthey do in West Virginia, but they have such great admiration on my \nside of the river for the terrific work Senator Byrd has done.\n  I only have 4 or 5 minutes I would like to say about Thanksgiving and \nthe farm bill. But if Senator Byrd would like to take time before that, \nI am certainly willing to yield or I can proceed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have some comments. They will be short, \nbut I will save them for next Tuesday, which the Lord willing, at that \ntime I will say a few things. I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, today the Senate will break for the \nThanksgiving holiday. We will all travel back to our States. We will \nwork in our offices. We will move around our States. We will probably \ncelebrate the Thanksgiving holiday with our families and our friends.\n  Many of us who are so very blessed will gather together next Thursday \nat tables surrounded by family, echoing with laughter, overflowing with \nfood.\n  For too many families in my home State of Ohio and across the Nation \nnext Thursday will be very different. These families, many of whom work \nfull-time, simply do not earn enough each month to survive without the \nassistance of food stamps and food banks and help from churches and \nhelp from other organizations.\n  Too many families suffering from layoffs--layoffs caused by plant \nclosings, the offshoring of jobs, and the downsizing of American \nindustry--are now solely reliant on food stamps and food banks to feed \ntheir families. Adding anguish to heartache, food banks, the last hope \nmany have for getting even just one meal a day, are finding themselves \nrunning short on food.\n  Yesterday's Cincinnati Enquirer told the story of Denise Arnold, a \nmother from Roselawn, OH, a suburb of Cincinnati. Since losing her job, \nand while looking for another job, Ms. Arnold has fallen behind on her \nrent and worries about becoming homeless. She has applied for food \nstamps, but that process takes time, and she has a son to feed.\n  Ms. Arnold visits the St. Vincent de Paul food pantry industry to get \nwhat food she can for her family. She told the reporter: It is really \nrough. I have been so scared. The pantry once was able to offer a \nweek's supply of food to those in need. Now, because of budget cuts and \ninadequate funding, this pantry must ration out, as so many others do, \nto their visitors, a few days' worth at a time, not a full week.\n  According to yesterday's newspaper article, food pantries across the \nregion have similar stories to report. On this floor, I have shared the \nstory of Rhonda Stewart, a single mother from Butler County, OH, who \nrelies on food stamps to feed her family.\n  Ms. Stewart bravely shared her story before the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee several months ago as we began the process of writing the \n2007 farm bill. She told us she has a young son and is fairly recently \ndivorced. Her husband--her ex-husband--has lost his job and is not able \nto support the son or his former wife.\n  She has a full-time job, only making about $9 an hour. She is \npresident of the local PTA and volunteers for the Cub Scouts. She \nteaches Sunday school. She does everything we ask of a citizen and a \nparent, and she is a food stamp beneficiary.\n  Yet, she told us, at the beginning of the month, she and her son--she \ncooks pork chops once or twice that first week. That is his favorite \nmeal. By the middle of the month, she takes him out to a fast food \nrestaurant perhaps once or twice. By the end of the month, she always \nruns out of money. She sits at the dining room or the kitchen table \nwith her son, and that last couple of days of the month at dinnertime \nhe is eating dinner, and she is sitting there not eating.\n  He says: Mom, what is wrong?\n  She says: I am not feeling well, or I am not hungry. She said it \nhappens month after month.\n  The truth is, food stamps provide a benefit of about $1 per person \nper meal. So Rhonda Stewart was getting $6 per day for food stamps. She \ntraveled to Washington to let us know what mattered most to her and to \nher family and to families like hers. She had every right to expect \nthat we would listen and we would hear her.\n  In 2006, more than 35 million Americans went hungry. We must ask \nourselves, how many more will go hungry next Thursday and Friday and \nSaturday and Sunday and into the rest of the holiday season?\n  I raise this issue today because at this moment we are debating in \nthis Chamber legislation that literally means the difference between \nfood and hunger for Ms. Arnold, Ms. Stewart, and millions of families \nin this country, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of families in my \nhome State of Ohio like theirs.\n  In a nation wealthy as ours, eradicating hunger, eliminating poverty, \ninvesting in families should not be a political issue. It is not \nRepublican versus Democrat. It is food and shelter versus Americans who \naren't as fortunate as all of us in this body, as the staff, the \nSenators, all of us. This is a moral obligation, a duty that flows from \ncompassion and the very reason we have been sent here as public \nservants.\n  In November of last year, families in my State of Ohio, as they did \nin the State of the Presiding Officer, sent a loud and clear message \nthat they wanted change. They demanded in no uncertain terms that the \npriorities championed here in Washington better reflect their own back \nhome. Given their call for change and the unquestionable understanding \nof challenges facing families across the country, one must pause and \nreflect on what we are actually doing here. We have a responsibility to \nthink about the priorities being debated this week, this very day as \npart of the farm bill.\n  On the one hand, we have been arguing for weeks about how many tens \nof millions, sometimes hundreds of millions, an industry gets out of \nthis bill. We have been arguing over profit margins. On the other hand, \nwe have in this legislation language that would fund food banks by an \nadditional $110 million each year. We have legislation that would \nincrease food stamp funding by $5 billion over 5 years and would help \nmillions of new families with food assistance. We have the opportunity \nin this bill to validate for Ms. Arnold and Ms. Stewart and the \nmillions of mothers like them across the country that their voices do \nin fact matter. These are not issues being discussed only within these \nwalls. This is a question of principle. It is a call to action the \npublic understands very well. The public understands how important are \nthe issues of hunger, social justice, investing in families, at every \nlevel of income.\n  I applaud Ohio food banks and businesses such as First Energy and the \nKroger Company for their dedication and initiative. This year First \nEnergy and its employees, as part of their Harvest for Hunger campaign, \ncollected the equivalent of nearly 2 million meals. This week the \nKroger Company helped jump-start a Hunger is Unacceptable campaign in \ngreater Cincinnati.\n  Local social service agencies in the area are pooling resources to \nhelp fight hunger more effectively. What these stories say to me is \nthat people back home get it. They get it in Cincinnati, in Columbus, \nand in Cleveland. It is time that Washington gets it.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to remember that budgets and bills are \nmore than ink on paper. They are a set of priorities, and they are \nabout our values. I strongly encourage my colleagues not to delay in \npassing the farm bill and to remember how many families are depending \non them for us to stand up for them.\n  I fully expect and encourage families back home to continue watching \nwhat we do and to hold all of us accountable for our actions.\n  I want to say to Ms. Arnold--with a very special mention to Rhonda \nStewart--that so many of us in this Chamber hear you. We are fighting \nfor you, and we will not give up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S14601]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for his \nservice on the Agriculture Committee. He has brought new vision, new \nvigor to the committee. We very much appreciate his service there. This \nhas been a difficult challenge, but I think we can be very proud of the \nresult. This bill is fiscally responsible, and at the same time it does \nbegin the orientation of priorities. It gives additional funding to not \nonly conservation but to nutrition, where the Senator from Ohio has \nbeen a real leader. Over and over he has reminded us of not only our \nresponsibility to fellow Americans, but a moral responsibility we have \nto make certain we change some of these programs that are so critically \nimportant to people all across America.\n  It is so often overlooked that the vast majority of the money in the \nfarm bill, 66 percent of the funding, goes for nutrition. That is where \nthe vast majority of the spending goes. We can be very proud of the \nchanges that have been made. We have added over $5 billion above the \nbaseline for nutrition, to begin to address things that have not been \nchanged for 30 years. The Senator from Ohio has been a leader, somebody \nwho prodded us all to be better than we have been. I thank the Senator \nfrom Ohio for his leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14601-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14601-S14602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BUDGET FACTS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to respond to remarks \nmade yesterday by the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. I \nmust say, sometimes my friends on the other side of the aisle amaze me \non the question of fiscal policy. Because after nearly 7 years of \nrubberstamping the Bush administration's completely failed fiscal \npolicy, they are so anxious to distract attention from what they did, \nthey now want to besmirch what we have done. We are not going to let \nthem do that.\n  I have enormous respect for my colleague. He and I work together on \nthe Budget Committee. I like him. I respect him. But it is not his \nright to rewrite history. The fact is, when they were in charge, as \nrecently as last year, they couldn't even get a budget. They had no \nbudget for the United States. They did not produce a budget, even \nthough they controlled the House of Representatives, the White House, \nand the Senate. They did not produce a budget for our country. In fact, \n3 of the last 5 years they didn't produce a budget for this country.\n  Facts are facts. Not only did they not produce a budget, they did not \nfinish work on 10 of the 12 appropriations bills for last year. They \nare now complaining we have not completed this year's work. One reason \nis, we had to start out by doing virtually all of last year's work \nbefore we could get started on this year's work. That is a fact.\n  The larger reality is that Democrats not only produced a budget, they \nproduced a budget that will balance the books over 5 years. That is not \naccording to my numbers or the Senate Budget Committee's numbers. That \nis according to the Congressional Budget Office that is nonpartisan. \nThey are the ones who have the responsibility to make these judgments. \nThey say our budget will balance over 5 years. The President never has \nproduced a budget that would balance. In fact, none of his budgets come \neven close. In fact, he has run up record deficits and record debt and \nput America in a deep hole. Our friends on the other side supported \nevery one of his misguided efforts. Facts are facts.\n\n  Let's look at the record of our colleagues. For nearly 7 years, our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle voted lock, stock, and barrel to \nsupport the President's failed fiscal policy. The result is record \ndebt, and the explosion in Federal debt comes at the worst possible \ntime, just before the retirement of the baby boom generation. That has \nbeen their policy. That is their record. We on the Democratic side are \nworking feverishly to change this failed course.\n  Let's be clear. Under the President's policies, the $5.6 trillion \nprojected surplus he inherited has been completely wiped out. Worse \nthan that, the President's policies have driven us deep into deficit, \nas this chart shows. This is the record. This isn't a projection. This \nis what has happened under the President's policies. He inherited a \nsurplus, in fact, a surplus so large that for 2 years we were able to \nstop what had gone on for 20 years, raiding Social Security to pay \nother bills. For 2 years under the Clinton administration, that bad \nhabit was stopped. Instead of using Social Security money to pay other \nbills, we were able to actually pay down debt. That is a fact. That is \nnot an imagining. That is not a political claim. That is historic fact.\n  Here is the record of our friends on the other side. Here is what \nhappened to spending they controlled. Make no mistake, they controlled \nit completely. They controlled the House of Representatives, the \nSenate, and the White House. Here is what happened to spending. It went \nfrom $1.9 trillion a year to $2.7 trillion a year on their watch. And \nthey accuse us of being big spenders? Excuse me? This is their record. \nThis is what they did. They ran up the spending in the country by 50 \npercent. But it didn't end there. Here is what they did on the revenue \nside. On the revenue side, real revenues have been stagnant during the \nentire time of this administration. They will show you a very different \nchart. They will show you not real revenues, which are adjusted for \ninflation; they will show you a chart that only looks at the last 3 \nyears, and they will do it not adjusted for inflation. So the last 3 \nyears they will show a big increase in revenue. But we all know that is \nnot an apples-to-apples comparison, and we all know that neglects to \npoint out what has happened over the whole period of their control.\n  Over the whole period of their control, there has been virtually no \nincrease in the real revenues, the inflation-adjusted revenues of the \ncountry. They have been flat, as this chart shows.\n  What is the result? If you dramatically increase spending and revenue \nis flat, what happens? The debt explodes. That is precisely what has \nhappened with our colleagues on the other side in control. They walked \nin here with a debt at the end of the first year of the President's \ntenure at $5.8 trillion. We don't hold them responsible for the first \nyear, because they are working on the budget of the previous President. \nBut look what has happened to the debt. They have run it up $3 trillion \nin these last 6 years. They have run up the debt to a fare-thee-well. \nAnd increasingly, it is foreign-held debt. That is, we are increasingly \ndependent on the kindness of strangers to finance this incredible \nborrowing binge our colleagues on the other side have taken this \ncountry on.\n  When they came into office, we had a trillion dollars of U.S. debt \nheld abroad. That is now over $2 trillion. They have more than doubled \nforeign holdings of U.S. debt in this short period of time from 2001 to \n2007.\n  They then go after the spending that is in our budget. Let me be \nclear. We pay for our spending. We balance the books in 5 years. If you \nlook at total spending, there is virtually no difference between what \nthe President proposed and what we proposed. The difference is seven-\ntenths of 1 percent.\n  Where did we propose spending some additional money?\n  We proposed not to spend more money in Iraq. We proposed to spend \nmore money right here at home on critical domestic priorities, in three \nareas: No. 1, aid to our veterans and their health care; No. 2, \nchildren's health care; and, No. 3, education.\n  Those are the priorities of the American people. Those are the \npriorities that will make a significant difference to our country over \ntime: more money for education so people can go to college, so they can \ncome out with less debt, so parents can afford to help their kids get \nthe best education they can; more money for veterans health care to \nkeep the promise that was made to veterans when we sent them in harm's \nway; more money for children's health care so we begin to cover \nchildren with health insurance. That is a good investment because if \nyou are able to help a child lead a healthier life, that is an \ninvestment that pays off over a lifetime.\n  But more than that, Democrats adopted a rule that we call pay-go. \nWhat pay-go says is simply this: If you want more tax cuts or more \nmandatory spending, you can do it, but you can only do it if you pay \nfor it. In the Senate we adopted the rule that new mandatory spending \nand tax cuts must be offset, must be paid for, or that you get a \nsupermajority.\n  Now let me be clear: Pay-go is working. My colleague on the other \nside\n\n[[Page S14602]]\n\ncalls it ``Swiss-cheese-go,'' as a way of deriding the new discipline \nthat they refused to follow.\n  We used to have pay-go, and you can see--it is very interesting--the \ndifference. This chart goes back to 1990. You can see that red ink back \nin the early 1990s. Then things started to get better when a strong \npay-go rule was put in effect, as shown right here on the chart. The \nresult was that, coupled with other steps, every year the deficit was \nreduced. In fact, we got into a situation in which we had a surplus. \nThen our friends took over after the 2000 election, and look what has \nhappened since: They immediately weakened pay-go. It is one of the \nfirst things they did. Look what has happened since: They immediately \nfrittered away the surplus that had been built up, with great \ndifficulty, and plunged us back into deficit.\n  Now we have restored pay-go, and we are moving in the other \ndirection. We are finally moving out of deficit.\n  Let me be clear that pay-go is working. What is the evidence? Here is \nthe evidence. The Senate pay-go ``scorecard'' has a positive balance of \n$670 million over the next 11 years. That means the legislation we have \npassed thus far has, in fact, been paid for. You would not have a \npositive balance on the pay-go scorecard unless the legislation that is \npassed has been paid for. These are facts. These are not political \nclaims. These are not the assertions that were made on the other side \nwithout the backing of fact. These are facts.\n  No. 2, every bill coming out of conference committee this year has \nbeen paid for--or more than paid for. My colleague calls it ``Swiss-\ncheese-go''? No. This is pay-go, properly applied, getting real \nresults, requiring that things be offset--something they never bothered \nto do.\n  Pay-go also has a significant deterrent effect, preventing many \ncostly bills from ever being offered.\n\n       Interestingly enough, my colleague on the other side, in \n     his previous service as head of the Budget Committee, said \n     this. He had a different view of pay-go back then. I am \n     quoting him from back in 2002, 5 years ago. He said this:\n       The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially \n     says if you are going to add a new entitlement program or you \n     are going to cut taxes during a period, especially of \n     deficits, you must offset that event so that it becomes a \n     budget-neutral event that also lapses. . . .\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If we do not do this--\n\n  In other words, if we do not have pay-go--\n\n     if we do not put back in place caps and pay-go mechanisms, we \n     will have no budget discipline in this Congress, and, as a \n     result, we will dramatically aggravate the deficit which, of \n     course, impacts a lot of important issues, but especially \n     impacts Social Security.\n\n  That is what he said 5 years ago. He was right then. He now \ncontradicts himself and, unfortunately, the record bears out his \nprevious position. Because when he weakened pay-go--and his side \nweakened pay-go--what was the result? Exactly what he predicted 5 years \nago. The deficit has exploded, the debt has exploded--all while they \ncontrolled the fiscal direction of the country. He was right then. He \nshould have stayed with that position. The country would have been in \nfar better shape.\n  Now he made a series of arguments in his assault on pay-go, \nsuggesting that it is ``Swiss-cheese-go.'' Let me indicate we do not \nhave to take my word for it on the question of what has happened under \npay-go with the legislation that is passed. We can look to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, because what we find is that \nhis argument is full of holes. It is not pay-go that is ``Swiss-cheese-\ngo.'' It is his own argument that is full of holes.\n  Here is what the Congressional Budget Office says: On the SCHIP \nreauthorization--that is children's health care--the overall effect of \nthat legislation led to a savings of $207 million; on the higher \neducation bill that he criticized, the combined effect of that \nlegislation was a savings of $752 million. In other words, the \nlegislation was paid for, plus additional savings were created so that \nthe cost was completely offset. It did not add a dime to the deficit or \ndebt. In fact, it had savings.\n  As to the immigration bill that never passed the Senate, it had, when \nit went down, large unified savings--over $20 billion over 10 years. \nThe farm bill shows savings of $102 million, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  So these four bills cover virtually all of the phony claims--phony \nclaims--made by the other side with respect to pay-go.\n  Again, you do not have to take my word for it. This is an official \ndocument from the Congressional Budget Office. The Senator on the other \nside, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, attacked the \nchildren's health insurance bill, saying it was not paid for. Wrong. \nThe Congressional Budget Office says not only was it paid for, but that \nit had savings of $207 million.\n  The College Cost Reduction Act of 2007--he said it was not paid for. \nWrong. According to the Congressional Budget Office, over 10 years, it \nsaves $3.6 billion.\n  The Immigration Reform Act. He has again said it was not paid for. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, he is wrong again. Over \n10 years, it would have unified savings of over $25 billion.\n  The Food and Energy Act of 2007 he says is not paid for. The \nCongressional Budget Office says he is wrong again, that it saves $102 \nmillion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14602-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14602-S14603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me conclude on the farm bill itself. \nThis farm bill is fiscally responsible. It is a 5-year reauthorization. \nIt is fully paid for. It complies with pay-go. It cuts commodity title \npayments by $7.5 billion over 5 years. That is a fact. In fact, the \nshare of the total Federal budget going to commodity programs is \nreduced from the previous farm bill, from three-quarters of 1 percent \nof total Federal spending to one-quarter of 1 percent. That is a fact.\n  This bill tightens payment limitations and eliminates loopholes. It \nadopts the elimination of the three-entity rule that allowed people to \nhide behind paper entities to get farm program payments. It eliminates \nthat abuse. It requires direct attribution of farm program payments so \na living, breathing human being has to be the recipient of these \npayments--again, instead of being able to hide behind a mask of phony \ncorporate entities.\n  This bill is fiscally responsible. When my colleague says this bill \nhas tax increases in it--$15 billion he asserted of tax increases--\nwrong again. Is there more revenue in this bill? Yes. How can it be \nthere is more revenue but not tax increases? Well, let's look.\n  Let's look at where the revenue comes from--$15 billion over 5 years. \nWhere does it come from? It comes from codifying the ``economic \nsubstance'' doctrine that prohibits businesses from using certain tax-\navoidance schemes. Is that a tax increase? No, I do not think that is a \ntax increase. I think that is shutting down a bunch of tax scams that \nare going on around the country. In fact, you heard the Republican \nranking member of the Finance Committee out here on the floor \nvigorously defending that pay-for, and that came out of the Finance \nCommittee on a vote of 17 to 4--overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  The second pay-for is to revoke tax benefits for leasing foreign \nsubways and sewer systems. Now they are going to say that is a tax \nincrease? Let's understand what is happening. We have certain \ncorporations and wealthy individuals who are buying--get this--buying \nforeign sewer systems, and depreciating them on the books for U.S. tax \npurposes--leasing those sewer systems back to the European cities that \nbought them in the first place.\n  Did they do this because they are in the sewer business? No. They are \nnot in the sewer business. They are in monkey business. They are buying \nforeign sewer systems to depreciate them on the books in the United \nStates to reduce their taxes in the United States. They have nothing to \ndo with being in the sewer business in European cities. They want to \ncall that a tax increase? Again, that provision came out of the Senate \nFinance Committee on a vote of 17 to 4--a very strong bipartisan vote.\n  Where is the other revenue coming from?\n  Increasing penalties for failure to file correct information returns. \nThat is not a tax increase. That is a penalty for people who are trying \nto cheat.\n  Finally, denying deductions for certain fines and penalties. That is, \nagain,\n\n[[Page S14603]]\n\nan additional inducement for people to play fair.\n  In addition, much of the money--in fact, two-thirds of the money--\nthat has come from this additional revenue has been turned around and \nput right back out in tax cuts. You did not hear that from the other \nside, did you? They never mention that fact.\n  Well, what are the tax cuts that are in this bill? There is $7.3 \nbillion for conservation, including a tax credit for farmland in the \nConservation Reserve Program--a program that affects over 10 million \nacres across the United States.\n  There is $2.5 billion for energy, including a tax credit for small \nproducers of cellulosic fuel and $800 million for agriculture and rural \nareas.\n  Those are the tax reduction elements which are a part of this bill.\n  The final point I want to make is this Democratic-led Congress has \nrejected the failed fiscal policies of the last 2 years. We have put in \nplace a strong pay-go rule. It is working by any standard--by any \nobjective standard. While it would not single-handedly solve all of our \nproblems, it is making a meaningful contribution. The fact is, the pay-\ngo scorecard, as of this moment, shows a positive balance. That means \nthe legislation that has been advanced has been paid for. That is a \nsignificant departure from what has gone on in the previous 6 years \nunder the control of our colleagues on the other side.\n  So it is going to be a long, tough slog for us to get done what needs \nto be done and get America back on track, at least in the fiscal arena. \nWhile the Senator from New Hampshire and I have sharp disagreement on \nthese matters, we are working together on a plan to bring together a \nbipartisan task force--16 Members; 8 Democrats, 8 Republicans--with the \nresponsibility to come up with a plan, a long-term plan to get America \nback on track. In that, he and I are joined at the hip, and we are \nprepared to ask our colleagues to come together in a bipartisan way to \ndevelop a plan to deal with these long-term imbalances. So while we \nhave sharp disagreement on the question of pay-go and on the question \nof their fiscal record versus ours, one place we are in complete \nagreement is on the need to face up to these long-term fiscal \nimbalances. That is in the interests of our country. That is in the \ninterests of every citizen of America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Ron Hindle has done a tremendous job of \nfinding any information that I need and putting it in tremendous format \nso that it is easily understandable, and even writing it up in words \nthat I can understand. He has been with me the entire time that I have \nbeen in the Senate. This is my 11th year. He has done a tremendous job. \nHe worked for Senator Simpson before that. So I welcome him to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, in the history of politics, I don't think anyone has \never had their finger on the pulse of the Nation quite like former \nPresident Ronald Reagan. Anyone who knew him or heard him speak was \ninstantly warmed by his charm and captivated by his personality. He had \na way of expressing himself that enabled him to connect with all of \nAmerica. He had a unique way of speaking, and that unforgettable Reagan \nwit let everyone know he was on their side and would do everything he \ncould to make this a better world for us all.\n  I remember one day in particular. It was 1992, and the Republican \nConvention was going strong. Ronald Reagan approached the podium to \ngive one of his trademark speeches. As he spoke, something told us that \nthis night, this speech, would be different from all the rest. \nSomething told us that we were watching the last major address he would \never give.\n  In his message, he spoke of the importance of doing everything we \ncould to point America toward the day when the nations of the world \nwould turn to us and say: America, you are the model of freedom and \nprosperity. That was when we would turn to them and say: You ``ain't'' \nseen nothing yet.\n  It was a wonderful catch phrase that had been around for so many \nyears, but it expressed his feeling that when that day came, something \neven bigger and greater would be about to make its presence felt \nthroughout the Nation. Unfortunately, today when we hear those words, \nwe are reminded not of a great President, but of a Congress that \ncontinues to lag further and further behind the expectations it created \nin the last election.\n  I know I am not the first one to notice. There have been editorials \nin the papers asking us when we are going to fulfill the promises that \nwere made in the elections last year by the Democratic majority party.\n  This is also the anniversary of another event. It was about a year \nago that what is now the Democratic Party put together a strategy that \nproved to be successful and they won both Houses of Congress. People \nwere excited and looking forward to the change the Democrats said the \nelection would bring. It seemed that every Member had a press \nconference during which he or she offered a long laundry list of \nlegislation that was going to be taken up as soon as possible.\n  With such a celebrated beginning, you may be wondering why you ain't \nseen nothing yet. Trust me, you aren't the only one. I don't think you \nwill see any celebrating in the leader's office or the Speaker's office \nabout the past year's results. So much of what they fought so hard to \nattain has been lost over the past year. So much of the progress they \npromised and that we all hoped to see has somehow failed to \nmaterialize. I do need to note an exception. The HELP Committee, the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that Senator Kennedy \nchairs and on which I am the senior Republican, has produced a few \nbills and virtually all of the bills that have passed. If someone as \nliberal as Senator Kennedy and as conservative as I am can move bills, \neveryone should be able to, but it requires putting aside ``gotcha'' \npolitics and working for the 80 percent that we can agree on.\n  Is it any wonder that Congress's approval ratings are at an all-time \nlow?\n  As the Senate's only accountant, I well remember all of those times I \nwould come to the Senate floor to debate our Nation's budget. The \nDemocratic Party didn't have the numbers back then to control the \nSenate, so all we heard was a steady stream of complaints from them \nabout the lack of progress that we were making on the budget and the \nlack of a coherent plan for spending. Now that the shoe is on the other \nfoot and the Democrats are in charge, what have they produced?\n\n[[Page S14604]]\n\n  We have all heard about the slow boat to China. Well, this is a slow \nboat that is going nowhere. The same people who criticized the \nRepublican budget, the same people who promise they would do better \nhave instead done worse--a lot worse.\n  We are long past the start of the fiscal year--about 6 weeks or so--\nand still only two appropriations bills have been sent to the \nPresident, and that was just last week. If you want to find another \nCongress that was this tardy with spending bills, you would have to go \nback quite a while, I would imagine. In fact, I think you would have to \ngo back through all of U.S. history.\n  Remember all the talk we heard about fiscal discipline and \ncontrolling spending? Once again, you might be thinking that you ain't \nseen nothing yet, and you would be right again.\n  Reminiscent of Everett Dirksen's words that a billion here and a \nbillion there and pretty soon we are talking about real money--the \nDemocratic Party seems unconcerned about the difference between their \nproposed spending and the President's proposals over the next 5 years. \nAfter all, what is $20 billion or so among friends? We have even had \ntimes of gaming to pay for the spending to the tune of nearly $40 \nbillion.\n  So what is the record of the Democratic Party so far? Not too good. \nAre we surprised? The Democrats continue to insist that they support \nthe troops. At the same time they are professing their support for the \ntroops in Iraq, they are suggesting it is time to cut funding off for \nour military. With our backs against the wall, they have been keeping \ntheir foot to the pedal--the brake pedal--when it comes to providing \nour troops with emergency supplies they need--the body armor, the \nbullets, the mine-resistant vehicles. These things save lives, and we \nneed to give our troops what they need when they need it so that they \nwill come home safe and sound to their loved ones.\n  This isn't all. There is a long list of promises made during the last \nelection that haven't been kept. After questioning whether the war in \nIraq made us safer, they refused to deal with the reforms we need to \ngather the intelligence we have to have to keep our people safe.\n  I am strongly supportive of the rights guaranteed to us by our \nConstitution. There is no question that our rights as Americans are \nsacred and they have to be respected. But if you ask the average \nAmerican if terrorists deserve to be treated as citizens, if terrorists \ndeserve to be treated as citizens and given those same rights, I think \nyou will hear a decisive no. I believe our constituents know they have \nbeen kept safe for these past 6 years by this administration, and they \nwant Congress to work together with the administration to continue that \npattern of safety. I don't think they want us to work against each \nother.\n  When the new Congress began about 11 months ago, we were promised a \nnew attitude. We were told we would be walking arm in arm, working \ntogether to make this a better Nation for us all.\n  Unfortunately, that hasn't happened either. Instead, we have seen a \ngeneral unwillingness to work together to get things done. The \n``gotcha'' politics. In fact, in 2007, at least 70 cloture motions have \nbeen filed by the majority so far. That is the same number of motions \nfiled by the Republicans in the entire 109th Congress spanning 2 years. \nWe are supposed to be here to conduct the people's business. Instead, \nmore often than not, we are just getting the things done on cloture \npetitions, and that is not getting anything done at all.\n  How do you get things done? We quit playing ``gotcha'' politics. We \nhave been on the farm bill for 2 weeks, but there hasn't been a single \namendment voted on. There hasn't been a single amendment allowed to be \nvoted on.\n  I did some checking. The farm bill has never passed without votes. I \nthink we could have done this bill in a week. It came out of committee \nunanimously. So why not give the rest of the Senators a shot and move \non? I have checked. We have always done about 25 amendments on the farm \nbill, in the history of the farm bill. A lot of them failed, but we \nhave the right to have votes.\n  Parliamentarily, we have been precluded from having votes, from \noffering amendments. Until that happens, there is not going to be any \nprogress on the bill. As soon as it happens, there will be progress on \nthe bill.\n  So how about health care? Well, you ain't seen nothing yet, and I \nknow you will not this year. You may not next year.\n  Are you concerned about energy? Again, you ain't seen nothing yet. \nThere has to be something done.\n  How about training our workers for the good jobs that will come \nduring the current global economy? Once again, unfortunately, you ain't \nseen nothing yet. I am bringing these sentiments to the attention of \nCongress that could do great things, and does do great things when it \nwants to, or probably more accurately when it needs to. It can come \ntogether with a snap of a finger in a time of crisis.\n  Remember September 11? We came together not as Democrats or \nRepublicans or Independents. We came together as Americans, and we \nswore we would work together to make this a better country. \nUnfortunately, that magic moment didn't last, and it wasn't long before \nwe were back to our old ways.\n  Sometimes it seems like partisanship and gridlock are just a way of \nlife back here. It doesn't need to be. It doesn't have to be. If we \nwork together and take the action on health care, education reform, and \nso much more of the Nation's needs, and look to get it done, when we go \nhome to hold town meetings and meet with our constituents and we are \nasked what we are doing in Washington to make their lives better, ease \ntheir burdens, and make their futures brighter, we will be able to \nanswer truthfully: You ain't seen nothing yet--not because we haven't \ndone anything yet but because we have, and there is a lot more to come. \nAnd it can come. We agree on 80 percent of the issues. So if we just do \nthe 80 percent instead of concentrating on the 20 percent we are not \ngoing to agree on--but I guess makes good political ads--we can get \nsomething done.\n\n  As every football fan knows, it takes four quarters to make a \nfootball game. We are only coming up on halftime. There is plenty of \ntime to put our heads together and develop a winning strategy--not for \nour parties but for the American people.\n  At the close of the speech I referred to earlier, Ronald Reagan said \nthat he hoped we would have the heart to conceive, the understanding to \ndirect, and the hand to execute the works that will make the world a \nlittle better for our having been here. That is our charge, our \nmission--to leave the world a little better than it was when we got \nhere. It is a difficult mission, but it is one we can accomplish. We \ncan accomplish it by joining and working together because the future is \nquite literally in our hands.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, I know the Senate is about to adjourn. I \nwish to take a minute. Last evening, I called a legion club in a small \ntown in southwestern North Dakota, a State I am privileged to represent \nin the Senate, and said congratulations to a group of young men from my \nhometown of slightly less than 300 people, Regent, ND, who combined \nwith a school in Mott. The Regent-Mott team won the nine-man State \nchampionship football game last week at the Fargo Dome in Fargo, ND. I \ncalled last evening to several hundred people who gathered to say \ncongratulations to the players and talk about how proud they were. I \nwish to add my congratulations today. I told them I was going to do so \non the floor of the Senate.\n  It is a big deal for a small community to have the kind of community \npride and the achievement of winning a State championship.\n  The communities of Regent and Mott--the community I grew up in was a \ntown of 300 people in Regent, ND, and\n\n[[Page S14605]]\n\nMott is slightly larger than that, but it is a wonderful community. It \nis a community that has the kind of small-town values one would expect.\n  When I grew up in that community, I graduated in a senior high school \nclass of nine students. I have always talked about the tapestry of the \nSenate. I sit in the Senate with Joe Lieberman, from Connecticut, on \none side of me and Dianne Feinstein, a Senator from California, on the \nother side. We have people coming from all corners of this country to \nserve in this great place. My privilege is to come from a town of about \n300 people and a high school senior class of nine students.\n  We didn't, when I was in that senior class of nine students, win a \nState championship. Finally, the students from that school combined \nwith a school in neighboring Mott, ND, and did win a State \nchampionship. They are enormously proud, and I am proud of them. They \nactually played in what is called the Fargo Dome, a very large indoor \ndome in Fargo, ND. That is over 300 miles from southwestern North \nDakota, but distance doesn't mean too much to us out on the northern \nGreat Plains. Driving is not such a chore. There is not a lot of \ntraffic. People are pretty courteous to each other. We drive a lot of \nmiles on virtually every occasion.\n  I wished to describe the pride I have in a very small community. \nHettinger County, to describe one more specific, in North Dakota, is \nlarger than the State of Rhode Island in landmass. It has 2,700 \ncitizens in the entire county spread out among three towns and also a \nlot of family farms. It is, in my judgment, the cradle of family values \nand all things that are sensible and all things that are likable about \nAmerican life.\n  I wished to, again, come to the floor today to say to the Regent and \nMott schools and those young boys in Hettinger County congratulations \non a State championship and to the coach who has coached for 22 years. \nOne might expect the number of hours that man has invested in the lives \nof young people, and last Saturday he had the privilege of coaching a \nState championship team. I know how proud he is as well.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the pending crisis \nof the American taxpayer. The cause of this crisis is the failure of \nCongress to deal honestly with the alternative minimum tax, or AMT.\n  Debate over what to do about the AMT has become a yearly ritual on \nCapitol Hill. As a member of the Finance Committee, I fully understand \nthis ritual. But this year, we are dragging our feet, and the more we \ndelay, the more likely it is that millions of Americans will get socked \nwith an unexpected tax bill next year and millions more will have their \nrefunds delayed.\n  Now it appears we are not going to address the AMT until December. \nFailure to address the AMT promptly on our return will be a pretty \nterrible Christmas surprise for the families impacted by congressional \nineptitude, but it will certainly be a surprise they will never forget. \nI can see it now: Surprise, you need to write a check for $3,000 to the \nIRS by April 15. That is right up there with: Surprise, you have been \nserved. Yet Congress delays. Congress fiddles. This is grossly \nirresponsible.\n  According to Secretary Paulson and the Department of the Treasury, \nunless we fix the AMT, 25 million taxpayers will be subject to it in \n2007. That is 21 million more than in 2006. And 25 million other \ntaxpayers will face delays in the processing of their returns and \nreceiving of refunds. In my home State of Utah, the Joint Tax Committee \nestimates we will jump from 19,000 AMT filers to 150,000 AMT filers. \nThis is simply unacceptable.\n  Most of the taxpayers who are at risk have not planned for the \neventuality of AMT liability. After all, year after year, like \nclockwork, the Republicans controlled Congress and they passed AMT \nrelief. We are already too late to avoid some problems. The IRS warned \nCongress that unless we fixed the AMT by early November, there would be \nserious delays in the processing of tax returns. We are now pushing \ntoward Thanksgiving. Secretary Paulson has made clear that based on \nhistorical filing patterns, enactment of an AMT fix in mid to late \nDecember could delay issuance of approximately $75 billion in refunds--\nthat is with a ``b,'' a billion dollars, 75 of them. That is 25 million \ntax refunds delayed.\n  It is always a bad idea for Members of Congress to get between their \nconstituents and their tax refunds. Yet here we are. How did we come to \nthis particular pass? The story of the AMT should be a case study for \nlimited Government. Give Congress long enough, and it will find a way \nto mess things up.\n  In 1969, the press reported that 155 high-income Americans paid no \nFederal income taxes in 1966. That was found out in 1969. Congress came \nto the rescue, creating an alternative minimum tax that would make sure \nall Americans paid their fair share. The AMT would prevent tax \navoidance by disallowing certain credits and deductions. As if it is \nnot bad enough figuring out one tax system, now many Americans would \nhave to complete their tax a second way--once under the traditional \nincome tax and once under the alternative minimum tax. And naturally \nthe tax that gets paid is the one which is highest.\n  Still, this AMT was originally meant to apply to a small number of \nfilers--155. That is 155 out of almost 300 million people. Today, it is \na menace threatening millions of Americans. Absent changes, estimates \nshow that by 2010, nearly 89 percent of all married couples, with two \nchildren, earning between $75,000 and $100,000 will be hit by the AMT. \nMake no mistake about it, elected officials are responsible for that \ntrain wreck--and, I might say, on both sides of the aisle.\n  In 1986, Congress failed to index the AMT exemption for inflation.\n  In 1993, a Democratic Congress and President Clinton took us a bit \nfurther down the road toward this fiscal debacle. They raised the 24-\npercent rate on the first $175,000 of the alternative minimum tax. They \nraised that taxable income to 26 percent. The rate on income in excess \nof $175,000 was raised to 28 percent.\n  Republicans in Congress attempted to right the ship. In 1999, we \npassed a provision repealing the AMT in its entirety. Done. Finito. \nVaya con dios, AMT. Had President Clinton signed this bill, we would \nnot be having this debate today. Millions of Americans would not be \nstaring down the barrel of an unfair and unplanned-for tax hike. But we \nall know how this story ended. President Clinton vetoed the bill. This \nwas the coup de grace. And so the AMT would continue to haunt us, \ngrowing bigger and more destructive every year since then.\n  The tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 only further emphasized the \ninsidiousness of the AMT. These tax cuts promised tax relief to middle-\nclass families and economic growth. Yet, as the economy grew and income \nrose, more and more middle-class families fell into the AMT trap. \nEconomic growth, income growth, tax cuts, and a failure to index the \nAMT for inflation created one costly cocktail for millions of families.\n  So there you have it. Congress manages to take a tax designed to \ntarget a handful of super-rich tax avoiders--155 people--and 40 years \nlater, millions of middle-class families are being hit by that tax.\n  For what it is worth, this experience should give pause to any \nAmerican who wants to hand management of the Nation's health care \nsystem over to the good people on Capitol Hill--us good people on \nCapitol Hill. Nonetheless, since 2001, Congress has patched the AMT. In \nlayman's terms, on a yearly basis we have increased the AMT exemption. \nThe result is that fewer Americans have an AMT liability greater than \ntheir liability under the ordinary income tax. These patches have done \nthe trick. They have prevented the AMT from hitting even more families. \nRepublicans dutifully passed that patch as sure as the sun rising in \nthe morning.\n  Now, don't get me wrong, a yearly patch is no substitute for what we \ntried\n\n[[Page S14606]]\n\nto do during the Clinton years, and that was to completely repeal the \nAMT, which I have been advocating for many years. Only complete repeal \nwill remove the uncertainty faced by millions of Americans with \npotential AMT liability. And as is on full display this year, that \nuncertainty is growing.\n  The problem now is the insistence by my colleagues on the other side \nthat we follow the so-called pay-go rules. Under a Democratic Congress, \nany tax cuts must be paid for. Now, let me translate that for you. This \nDemocratic Congress is going to raise your taxes, and to pay for the \nAMT, a Democratic Congress is going to have to raise a lot of your \ntaxes. Under pay-go rules, if Congress passes a provision that reduces \nrevenues to the Treasury, it must make up the balance from somewhere \nelse. This is true even if the provision does not cut taxes but merely \nprevents a tax increase from hitting middle-class American families.\n\n  The Democratic Congress is proud of these rules. These rules \nsupposedly demonstrate a commitment to fiscal responsibility. But, as \nsome wags have suggested, the Democrats misnamed their rule. It should \nbe more accurately called tax-go, not what it has been--pay-go. You \nsee, in the hands of a Democratic Congress, the way to balance the \nbooks after a tax cut is never to cut spending; it is always to raise \ntaxes. You have to love the logic. We are going to cut taxes by raising \ntaxes. This is a public policy of robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Now, you don't have to take my word for it. This is what Congressman \nTim Mahoney, a Florida Democrat, had to say:\n\n       You want to reward people for taking risks. How about \n     budget cuts to make government more efficient? We need to \n     show people we are good managers and stewards of their money. \n     I've been here 10 months and I haven't seen one proposal to \n     cut spending.\n\n  Now, I think that about hits the mark, and that is a Democrat \nspeaking about Democrat rule in the House of Representatives and the \nSenate.\n  Now, for the Democrats--most of them--fiscal responsibility means one \nthing: raising your taxes. They have a one-page playbook, and with the \nAMT fix passed by the House last week, they ran that play right down \nthe throats of the American people. Touchdown, Democrats. \nUnfortunately, the American people are the big losers here. A 1-year \npatch for the alternative minimum tax costs $50 billion. For 2 years, \nwe will need to come up with $135 billion. Permanent repeal of the \nalternative minimum tax will now cost us $872 billion.\n  Oh, if we had just had President Clinton sign into law the repeal of \nAMT that we passed through both Houses of Congress back then. But let's \njust start with the 1-year patch.\n  In order to pay for this $50 billion 1-year patch--or a tax increase, \nin other words--the House had to come up with $50 billion in tax \nincreases. One of the most talked about tax hikes in that bill involves \ntreating carried-interest income, currently taxed as capital gains, as \nordinary income. This is an old-school soak-the-rich play, honed before \nthe adoption of the forward pass. I think for this one the Democrats \npulled out FDR's playbook. Go after private equity managers, raise \ntaxes on the 50,000 people nationwide earning carried interest, and \nkeep taxes level for the 23 million people whose financial security is \njeopardized by AMT. Never mind the fact that this could create perverse \ndisincentives for one of the engines of our current economic growth. \nNever mind that it would reduce risk-taking in venture capital firms \nand real estate partnerships and other entities that create jobs and \neconomic growth. Never mind the fact we are paying for a 1-year AMT tax \nby permanently raising taxes--your taxes. No, what is really pathetic \nabout this proposal is that the Democrats who support this want to \npermanently raise taxes to pay for revenue we never thought we would \nhave in the first place. People, this is phantom revenue. We were never \ngoing to collect this money. We never wanted to collect this money. But \nwith a twisted sense of fiscal responsibility, we are now going down \nthe road of permanently increasing taxes to make 1-year offsets on \nmoney we never thought we would have. And that is because we are \nunwilling to cut spending in this Congress today. Now, this is some \nseriously warped tax policy.\n  The House majority leader sees these misguided tax hikes as a model \nof virtuous statesmanship--``Raising revenues takes political \ncourage.'' If that is true, then the House Democrats are the Spartans \nof tax hikes. In the end, I doubt we will raise taxes to pay for AMT \nrelief. I certainly hope we will not do that.\n  I understand why the Democrats feel the need to blame someone else \nfor this problem. While Americans everywhere could be hit by the AMT, \nit really is the high-tech States--represented primarily by Democrats--\nthat will suffer the most if Congress fails to act. All States will \nsuffer, but the ones that will suffer the most are the blue States. \nTaxpayers in California, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New \nYork filed 44.2 percent of all AMT returns last year, and I think that \nfigures in it a lot.\n  This disparity is only growing. If Congress does not fix this \nproblem, in States such as Connecticut, Maryland, and New Jersey, \nnearly 25 percent of current filers will be forced into paying the \nalternative minimum tax. Absent alternative minimum tax relief, New \nYork would have 1 million additional AMT tax filers this year compared \nto last year--1 million more. In California, the number of new AMT \nfilers would increase by 1.7 million.\n  I don't mind these Robin Hood-like approaches to blue States, if that \nis what they want to do by electing people who do this to them. I think \nthey have a right to do that. But I will bet money that they do not \nwant that type of thing to happen to them.\n  These individuals and families, who are going to now be sucked into \nthe AMT tax, never thought they would be subjected to the AMT and so \nthey did not withhold accordingly. The worst case scenario, then, is \nthat they will actually have to cut checks for thousands of dollars \ncome April.\n  Let's not forget the 25 million lower income taxpayers who are facing \nlong delays in getting their refunds because of the slowness of the \nCongress and the inability of Congress to get this done. This would be \ndevastating, it will be devastating, unless we can change this. Yet we \ncontinue to dither. The answer is easy: Repeal it, just do it, get rid \nof it already. But Democrats do not seem to be inclined to do the \nsensible thing. They want to let the AMT linger and fester.\n  Year after year, repeal will become even more expensive and the \nDemocrats, armed with their pay-go rules, will have to find a way to \nbalance the books when they do repeal it.\n  What do they propose? How will they offset the nearly $1 trillion \nthat AMT repeal or reform will cost? If you look closely enough, you \ncan just make it out on the horizon--the mother lode, the mother ship, \nthe mother of all tax reforms, according to my dear friend over in the \nHouse, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. We are close \nfriends but, boy, he called it right, the mother of all tax reforms.\n  AMT relief is at the center of the central Democratic proposal for \ntax reform. While this tax reform is going nowhere right now, make no \nmistake about it, this is what we have to look forward to, from a \nDemocratic Congress and White House.\n  My friend from New York, the chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, has a way of getting what he wants. He is smart--I think he \nis brilliant, personally--he is persistent, and he knows how to cut a \ndeal. I know. I have worked with him on a number of things. I have \ngreat admiration for him. And this mother of all tax reforms is his \nbaby. But as much as I love my friend Congressman Rangel, this is one \nugly mother.\n  This mother is not friendly or funny like Lucille Ball. She is a bit \ncreepy, as a matter of fact, as you can see. Actually, she is a bit \nscary. That is frightening. At times, she is downright unstable. This \nmay be hard to see on the television cameras here, but she looks pretty \nunstable to me. And she is coming to get the middle class.\n  This mother promises to get rid of the onerous AMT. By repealing AMT, \nmother claims she will provide tax relief to millions of middle-class \nfamilies. But mother is really only out for mother. Of course, that \nrelief is not real relief, since we never intended those families to \npay the AMT in the first place. Calling this tax relief is\n\n[[Page S14607]]\n\nlike someone getting ready to hit you in the head with a hammer, \ndeciding not to hit you, and then telling you that he is doing you a \nfavor.\n  What she gives with one hand, this mother takes away with the other, \nby assuming the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, so essential to our economic \ngrowth, will expire.\n  The mother ship already comes fully loaded with the largest tax \nincrease in history. Allowing the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire \nwould dwarf even that.\n  This is not a recipe for happy taxpayers, this is bitter and \nunnecessary medicine. The majority of Democrats in the Congress seem \nprepared to make the American taxpayer take the dose. You can see, it \nis not very tasty.\n  We do not need to go down this track. To borrow from an old movie, we \nshould ``Throw Momma''--this mama--``From The Train.'' It would be a \nreal mistake to continue the practice of paying for fake, temporary tax \ncuts with real and permanent tax hikes.\n  Contrary to the assertions of some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, the only responsible and the only realistic action we can \ntake is to repeal the AMT in its entirety right now. We should do so \nwithout raising taxes.\n  We are going to have a debate in the next few years over fundamental \ntax reform and we are going to have debates over fundamental health \ncare reform. We should do so without the specter of the AMT hanging \nover this Chamber.\n  I urge my colleagues to repeal it in its entirety, right now, without \nraising taxes. You cannot be fiscally responsible without being \nfiscally honest. This phantom income should play no part in broader \ndebates over tax reform. At the very least, we should not pass \npermanent tax hikes that would have ugly economic ramifications in \norder to pay for 1 year of AMT relief. We are putting off disaster 1 \nmore year by doing that, at a cost of $50 billion in tax increases.\n  There are some ways we can do this. There are no good ways we can do \nthis. But I know one thing, the worst way is to do it by increasing \ntaxes to pay for it, and stifling the economy that has enough on its \nplate with the high cost of energy, to mention one item.\n  To go to approximately 24 million people from 155 people is more than \nabsurd. That is where we are going. If we take this mother of all tax \nreforms seriously, and if we were able to pass that--and I hope we are \nnot--I have to say there is going to be a great increase in taxes, a \ngreat stifling of the economy, and much more difficulty for this \ncountry in the coming years.\n  One reason I am giving these remarks is I know there are people on \nthe Democratic side who do not like this, who are responsible and who \ndo want to do what is right, who basically know there are no good \noptions here. Raising taxes is one of the worst options we can do. I \nappeal to them to stand up now and not let this happen because if it \ndoes, this economy is going to pay a tremendous price. I think in the \nend, as bad as it will be no matter what we do, there are better ways \nof doing this than increasing taxes, doing it the way that has been \nsuggested.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are facing a number of challenges in \nthe Senate and in the Congress, but none is more important than our \nwillingness and our responsibility to properly support the men and \nwomen in our Armed Forces who are serving us today in Iraq and \nAfghanistan; serving us because we voted to send them there, doing the \npolicy of the United States that has the support of the President, the \nChief Executive, the Commander in Chief, and that has been supported by \nthe Congress.\n  Yes, we have had a lot of debate, a lot of dissension, and a lot of \ncomplaints, but when the chips have been down, time and time again we \nhave authorized and funded the activities that are going on now in the \nname of the United States of America in Iraq and in Afghanistan.\n  We had an election last fall. We have heard people talk about that. \nBut the American people did not say: We want to pull out of Iraq \nregardless of the consequences. They said they were not happy, and none \nof us were happy with the way things were going.\n  It seemed to be drifting in a bad way, and there seemed to be no \npositive results coming. So we had, after this election, last spring, \nApril and May, a big debate about it. And President Bush said: We need \nto change policy. I am going to send a new general over there, General \nPetraeus, and we are going to change tactics, and I am going to ask you \nto approve additional troops. I am asking for a surge in troops.\n  So we talked about it. We debated it right here in the Senate. This \ngreat Nation's legislative branch responded to the President's call and \nhad a debate on it. We had no obligation to fund that. None whatsoever. \nBut earlier in the summer, we voted 80 to 14 to fund the surge in Iraq \nand to send General Petraeus and to give him a chance to utilize a new \ntactic and a new strategy for confronting the terrorist forces we were \nfacing there, in particular al-Qaida, which was a strong entity at that \ntime.\n  I have got to tell you, I was worried things had not gone as well as \nwe had expected. We had had a bad year, and casualties were up and \nattacks were up and it was a tough time. But as part of that debate, we \nasked General Petraeus to come back in September and give us a report. \nMy Democratic colleagues and others, all of us were concerned. We \nwanted a report to see how things were going because we were not going \nto have a blank check and unended obligation to Iraq if things were not \ngoing to work.\n  That is a fundamental synopsis of the situation. I believe that is a \nfair analysis. So General Petraeus came back and gave us his report. \nGeneral Jimmy Jones had been sent and a group of other independent \nevaluators with experience in military matters.\n  That commission was sent over there at the direction of Congress. \nWhen we passed the supplemental to fund General Petraeus and the surge, \nwe required another report, not just General Petraeus, but the Jones \nCommission to come back and make a report. We asked the General \nAccounting Office to do an evaluation also, the independent GAO.\n  So they all came back in September. We had hearings and debate and \nsuggestions and we continued to go forward. We voted, in essence, to \ncontinue to allow General Petraeus to pursue the plans he was carrying \nout. Some progress had been made. It was notable, but it was not \nsufficient for us to say with certainty that a major change positively \nhad occurred. We could not be certain of that. But it looked as if some \nprogress was being made with more troops and new tactics.\n  So we said then: Let's go forward. And we did. Now we have seen some \nvery dramatic positive developments in Iraq. The Iraqi people, by all \naccounts, I think few can dispute this, have believed the American \ntroops are reliable allies. We have changed our tactics in how we deal \nwith the local Iraqi officials and tribal leaders and mayors and chiefs \nof police.\n  We are doing a much better job--General Petraeus is--of partnering \nwith them. They have turned against al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden's troops, \nthat terrorist group they thought was going to take over Iraq. And Al \nAnbar, the worst area in Iraq for al-Qaida, has made a transformation. \nAl-Qaida is on the run throughout Iraq. Violence is down substantially.\n  Can I guarantee you it will continue to go down? I cannot. I can tell \nyou that deaths of American soldiers are down by two-thirds this last \nmonth; and attacks on Iraqi civilians, which always cost more lives \nthan attacks on our American soldiers, are down by a similar margin. \nAttacks on Iraqi soldiers are also down.\n  Al-Qaida has virtually been removed. Sadr's group has quieted down \nand\n\n[[Page S14608]]\n\nseems to be working with the Government. The Government has not \nperformed like we would like it to. The Parliament, they have not \nperformed like I would like to see them perform. I think they deserve \ncriticism for that. But it is not an easy thing for them to do, just to \nwalk in and reach agreements that affect the future of Iraq and the oil \nrevenue and military power within Iraq for generations to come.\n  It is understandable they would be somewhat reluctant. But they need \nto do better. But, fundamentally, as of this date, things are so much \nbetter than they were in April and May, and so much better even than \nthey were in September. That is quite remarkable. No one, I think, can \ndeny that.\n  We are a great nation. We have a great Congress. And we went through \na national post-election discussion about what to do. Were we just \ngoing to pull out regardless of the consequences? Were we going to give \nGeneral Petraeus a chance to employ new tactics? We voted to give him a \nchance. It is beginning to work better than I think any of us would \nhave predicted so far. It is rather dramatic.\n  So I would say to my colleagues, at this point in time, for goodness' \nsake, let's not now start cutting back on the ability of our soldiers \nto have the resources they need to continue what they are doing. Let's \nnot try to pass legislation that directs General Petraeus how to \nconduct operations in Iraq.\n  What do a group of politicians in a dysfunctional Congress have to \noffer to one of the most brilliant generals this Nation has ever \nproduced, General Petraeus? In a few short months he has achieved \ndramatic progress there.\n\n  We are committed there. Our soldiers are committed. They are serving \nus now. I had an e-mail the other day sent to me from a relative of a \nsoldier in Iraq. He was saying things are better. The only concern he \nhad was what the Congress would do, whether we would pull the rug out \nfrom under them, if we are going to deny them the resources they need \nto continue the progress. After all this effort, to walk away from what \nwe have done is, to me, unthinkable.\n  We are at a point now where instead of giving a supplemental that \nwill allow the military to plan the year's activities, plan to go \nforward with, as you know, General Petraeus's commitment to reduce \ntroops by next summer, we are talking about a $50 billion supplemental \nwith all kinds of strings attached to it. The President is not going to \naccept it. He cannot accept it. He is not going to accept it. So for us \nto continue to pursue a supplemental with excessive strings attached \nthat is too small, leaves the military uncertain of the support of the \nAmerican people and the Congress is a bad thing for us to do. It really \nis. It is not good.\n  Well, they say, let's keep the military out there. Let's let them \nknow we are watching them. We are going to keep control of them instead \nof giving them the funding they need for a year or more. Let's do it a \nfew months at a time. Then we can bring them in here, and we can beat \nthem up. We can appeal to our antiwar people out in the country and let \nthem know we are fighting for them, and we will do all these things. \nAnd it won't hurt anything.\n  But it does hurt. If you were walking the streets in Baghdad right \nnow attempting to execute the policy of the United States, placing your \nlife at risk, does it not make any difference to you whether Congress \nis behind you? I think it does make a difference. While questioning \nGeneral Casey yesterday, the chief of staff of the Army, former \ncommander in Iraq, I said, I am concerned that what we are doing is \ngoing to undermine the confidence American soldiers have in the support \nthey have at home. It will embolden the enemy and make our allies less \ncertain of our commitment. I said, I know you don't want to be drawn \ninto a political debate, but that seems to be the situation. He summed \nit up this way. He said: Senator, as I said in my opening statement, it \nsends the wrong message.\n  Doesn't it send the wrong message that we can't, after a full debate \nthis summer, now continue for a few months to support our troops? They \nare in the field now. Why stand we here idle? Why are we not doing our \npart to show them the support they need? We will watch this situation \nin Iraq. If it gets worse and things are not moving effectively, then \nwe ought to, as a Congress, continue to consider whether to remove our \ntroops, to cut off funding. But that is not what we are going to do. We \nare not going to cut off funding for our troops while they are making \nthe kind of progress they are making. It is not going to happen. So if \nwe are going to actually follow through eventually and give this money \nto them, why don't we do it in a way that helps them to be even more \nsuccessful instead of doing it in a way that makes it more difficult \nfor them and places our soldiers and troops at greater risk?\n  This is what the Deputy Secretary of Defense wrote a few days ago, \nNovember 8, about the budget situation we are now in. Yes, we did pass \na Defense appropriations bill. But we funded the military effort in \nIraq and Afghanistan by separate supplemental appropriations. It allows \nus to have more control over what is actually being spent on the war \neffort to do it separately. He wrote this letter. This is Secretary \nGordon England:\n\n       I am deeply concerned that the . . . Defense Appropriations \n     Conference report under consideration does not provide \n     necessary funding for military operations and will result in \n     having to shut down significant portions of the Defense \n     Department by early next year.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Without this critical funding, the Department will have no \n     choice but to deplete key appropriations accounts by early \n     next year. In particular, the Army's Operation and \n     Maintenance account will be completely exhausted in mid-to-\n     late January, and the limited general transfer authority \n     available can only provide three additional weeks of relief. \n     This situation will result in a profoundly negative impact on \n     the defense civilian workforce, depot maintenance, base \n     operations, and training activities. Specifically, the \n     Department would have to begin notifications as early as next \n     month to properly carry out the resultant closure of military \n     facilities, furloughing of civilian workers, and deferral of \n     contract activity.\n\n  If you were Secretary of Defense, what would you do if you have \nsoldiers in the field authorized by the Congress, authorized by the \nCommander in Chief, and you run out of money? You have to lay off your \ncivilian personnel, and you have to get the money to the soldiers whose \nlives are at risk.\n  Secretary England goes on to say:\n\n       In addition, the lack of any funding for the Iraqi Security \n     Forces and the Afghanistan National Security Forces directly \n     undermines the United States' ability to continue training \n     and equipping Iraqi and Afghani security forces, thereby \n     lengthening the time until they can assume full security \n     responsibilities.\n\n  These are not idle threats. The money is running out. We ought not to \nbe dangling the Defense Department out there, leaving them hanging with \nuncertainty, having them spend hours and hours figuring out how they \nare going to juggle personnel, developing plans to lay off nonessential \ncivilian personnel, although I suppose in some sense are all essential, \nbut laying off civilian personnel and canceling contracts. It will \nresult in substantial expense to the Government for penalties and that \nkind of thing. We ought not to be doing that.\n\n  This is what Secretary of the Army Geren said yesterday at the Armed \nServices Committee hearing:\n\n       Let me just conclude with a brief comment on the \n     supplemental.\n       Very quickly we run through the resources that are \n     available to us.\n       Dr. Gates has told us to start planning for what we're \n     going to do when we--if we reach the point where we do run \n     out of our O funding and start making plans for what we as \n     an army would do with that eventuality.\n\n  He pleaded with us:\n\n       Last year, we had bridge funding that helped us through \n     this period. This year, we don't have that funding. So we \n     just ask that--we know there are many issues you all are \n     working on and working through regarding that supplemental. \n     But it's very important for us to be able to provide the \n     orderly and reliable support to our soldiers, for us to get \n     that funding.\n\n  Isn't that a reasonable request for him to make? I know moveon.org \ndoesn't want us to fund the military. But we voted 80-14 to do this as \na Senate, and the House also supported it. Why are we putting the \nmilitary in a position to go through incredible gymnastics to try to \nmanage this effort, because we are leaving them hanging about whether \nwe are going to give them the money to support our troops?\n  Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Armed Services\n\n[[Page S14609]]\n\nCommittee, asked this of General Casey. General Casey is the chief of \nstaff of the Army. He asked:\n\n       And I want to ask General Casey, if I might, a question \n     because earlier this year the Army--it was at an Army posture \n     hearing, I believe, that your predecessor, General \n     Schoomaker, raised concerns about the effect of not \n     delivering adequate and predictable funding, particularly in \n     the form of supplemental funding for the war effort.\n       We're 46 days into the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. \n     We don't have an authorization bill. We don't have a bridge \n     funding bill for the [Department of Defense]. And we don't \n     have an [fiscal year 2008] global war on terror supplemental.\n\n  Senator Thune goes on:\n\n       We recently sent a defense appropriations bill to the \n     president which he has signed into law, but that has little \n     effect on the war effort.\n       So my question is what will be the effect of no timely \n     bridge funding or supplemental funding. Will you have to \n     cancel service contracts, lay people off, slow down work at \n     depots, those sorts of thing? If you could, address that \n     subject.\n\n  This is what General Casey said, a career military man:\n\n       Secretary [of Defense] Gates has instructed us to begin \n     planning for that possibility. The signing of the \n     appropriations bill did two things. One, it gave us money for \n     our base budget, but it also stopped the continuing \n     resolution funding that was going to support the war.\n       So now we're faced with having to fund the war without a \n     bridge out of the base budget. Our Army O account is about \n     $27 billion. When you look at our Army base budget . . . \n     you're talking about $6.5 billion, $6.6 billion a month.\n       If the Army is asked to fund this without any type of \n     bridge or without any additional resources, we're going to \n     run through that $27 billion . . . around mid February. And \n     we cannot wait until then to start making some of the \n     decisions that will have to be made.\n       Our employment contracts, many of them, require 60 days' or \n     45 days' notice before you can furlough somebody. We have \n     many of the services that are provided by civilians, by \n     contractors, and it would have a hugely detrimental effect on \n     the home base.\n       We will beggar the home front to make sure our soldiers \n     that are in theater have everything they need, and it will \n     put a terrible burden on our soldiers, on families, on the \n     institutional Army, our ability to train.\n       Timely funding is absolutely essential. An organization of \n     our size cannot live effectively with unpredictable funding. \n     And we need that supplemental passed soon, or we're going to \n     have to start planning for the possibility that we're not \n     going to have it.\n\n  Can anybody dispute that General Casey is exaggerating about that? \nCan anybody dispute that uncertainty in funding has a terrible impact \non the Pentagon?\n  Senator Thune asked another question:\n\n       General Schoomaker also testified that the Army was forced \n     to cash flow itself through the first quarter of . . . 2006. \n     Could you explain what that means? And will the Army have to \n     do that again?\n\n  General Casey:\n\n       We're in that position now. The O account is our account \n     that offers us the greatest flexibility. Most of the other \n     accounts are constrained by specific--we call the term color \n     of money.\n       But we would find ourselves having to spend the O money \n     not only to support the Army but to support also the war \n     effort. So we are in that position today and using up the \n     funds at a rate of $6.5 billion a month against a $27 billion \n     total.\n\n  So I hope in the weeks to come our leaders in the Senate will begin \nto work together in a way that can allow us to approve this funding--\nthat I think with certainty we will ultimately approve--sooner rather \nthan later and not go through this painful exercise.\n  I have to say, I really think it would be a lot better for our \ncountry, I think it would be a lot better for our military, I think it \nwould be a lot better for our allies, and I think it would put us in a \nmuch better position against our enemies if the leader of the Senate, \nthe majority leader, would quit saying this is a doomed, failed effort. \nIt is not helpful.\n  We have voted to support this effort, and we do not need to be saying \npublicly it is not going to work when, in fact, we are achieving more \nsuccess today than any of us would have thought possible just a few \nweeks ago.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on October 31, President Bush proclaimed \nNovember 2007 as National American Indian Heritage Month.\n  American Indians influence and enrich our culture. I am proud of the \ncontributions that Nevada's tribes have made and continue to make in my \nhome State. The 26 tribes, bands, and colonies support their tribal and \nsurrounding communities with their diverse tribal enterprises. Working \non a government-to-government basis, they join Federal and State \nagencies to protect many of Nevada's natural resources and the \nenvironment--our wildlife habitats in mountains and valleys and our \nlakes and waterways for fish and fowl. The tribes in my State, like \ntribes throughout the country, provide education and health services to \ntheir children, elders, and members.\n\n[[Page S14610]]\n\nI am proud of the leadership and opportunities many tribal leaders are \nproviding for their people and that improve the lives of their \nneighbors.\n  Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues of an anniversary this \nyear. Fifteen years ago, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \nAmendments of 1992 became law. My friend and colleague, Senator Inouye, \nas chairman of the then-named Select Committee on Indian Affairs, led \nthe effort to reauthorize the principal law governing Indian health \nservices and programs. I joined Senator Akaka, Senator Cochran, Senator \nConrad, Senator Domenici, Senator Kennedy, Senator McCain, Senator \nStevens, and others to sponsor that bill, which became law. Incredible \nto think today, but S. 2481 was passed by a voice vote on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The 1992 law was due to be reauthorized in 1999. Because of Senator \nDorgan's passion for this issue and his regular statements on the \nSenate floor, we all know that the bill has been reauthorized annually \nsince then, but more needs to be done.\n  The bill before us, S. 1200, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \nAmendments of 2007, reflects the leadership and work of members on both \nsides of the aisle. Leaders on the Indian Affairs, Finance, and HELP \nCommittees have worked to refine the bill with many Federal departments \nand agencies, national tribal organizations, and individual tribal \nleaders. It is a bipartisan, consensus bill that has been negotiated \nsince the 105th Congress.\n  S. 1200 clarifies current law and authorizes critical services for \nIndian Country--strengthening recruitment, retention, and training \nprograms for health care professionals; encouraging health care \npractioners to consult with other professionals using telemedicine and \nother technologic tools; expanding programs for behavioral health, to \naddress problems of youth suicide and violence against women and \nchildren; improving individual access to other Federal health programs \nserving the most vulnerable people in our population--Medicaid, \nMedicare, and the Childrens Health Insurance Program; and helping \ntribes better coordinate with Federal programs to maximize the health \nservices available to their members.\n  I am pleased that many of my colleagues who supported the 1992 \nlegislation and whom I just mentioned are sponsoring this bill--with 29 \ncosponsors, including Senator Craig Thomas, our former colleague and \nranking member of the Indian Affairs Committee.\n  I applaud the hard work of my colleagues, particularly Senator Dorgan \nand Senator Baucus. As I have said before, I am committed to bring this \nbipartisan bill to the floor for the full Senate's consideration, and I \nask that the Republican leader work with me to bring this bipartisan \nbill to the floor in a timely and efficient manner.\n  Mr. President, as we acknowledge November as National American Indian \nHeritage Month, I cannot think of a better, or more timely, way to \nhonor our indigenous people than by reauthorizing the Indian health \nbill. We must honor our Federal obligations to these people--just as \nmany Native Americans have served and continue to serve this country, \nevery day on battlefields, in government offices, in classrooms, in the \nwilderness, and on waterways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14610-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I wish to speak on the latest report from \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, on Iran's nuclear \nprogram. Yesterday, a copy of the IAEA's upcoming report on Iran was \nreleased. It is troubling.\n  The IAEA gives an interesting description of Iran's nuclear \ndevelopment over the past 20 years. What is more relevant, however, is \nits report on Iranian nuclear proliferation in the present day. \nAccording to this latest document, Iran has continued to enrich uranium \nin violation of two U.N. Security Council resolutions passed under \nChapter Seven of the U.N. Charter. The resolutions, which are binding, \nwere enacted specifically to prevent Iran from completing the nuclear \nfuel cycle. To ensure multilateral support at the U.N., they were made \nas soft as possible. Resolution 1737, passed in December 2006, only \ntargeted items related to Iran's nuclear enrichment cycle. When that \nfailed to have any impact, the UNSC passed Resolution 1747, which \ntargeted specific members of the Iranian regime and made certain \ncommitments related to Iranian arms sales.\n  At the time, the United States was applauded for taking the \nmultilateral\n\n[[Page S14611]]\n\nroute. Withering contrasts were made to our approach to Iraq. If I am \nnot mistaken, we received these same accolades in 2003, when we allowed \nthe EU-3--Germany, France, and the United Kingdom--to handle nuclear \nnegotiations with Iran. And like then, these same accolades and \nmultilateral approach have accomplished little. Instead, Iran's uranium \nenrichment program has greatly expanded, to the point where--as the \nIAEA notes--uranium hexafluoride has been fed into each of the 18 \ncentrifuge cascades. There is almost no doubt at this point that Iran \nwill ultimately have enough enriched uranium to create a nuclear \nweapon.\n  There have been so many red lines broached during the past 5 years, \nit is almost hopeless to begin creating new ones. I will not try. What \nI will say, however, is that the issue of Iran creating highly enriched \nuranium has now become almost moot.\n  Centrifuge technology is technologically difficult; of that, there is \nno question. The Iranians have failed to spend the usual time needed to \ntest and measure their first centrifuge cascade before building new \nones. But resolution of this potential problem is just a matter of \ntime. The equipment is there. The necessary uranium and uranium gas are \nthere. Thanks to Pakistan's A.Q. Khan network, the knowledge is there.\n  Sometime in the future--not immediately but sometime not too far \noff--we will be approaching the endgame of this situation. I do not \nknow what form the endgame will take. I hope and pray it is short of \nmilitary confrontation; after all, that is why we have pursued the \ndiplomatic track as long as we have. That is why I still believe \ndiplomacy is the only answer. But we should remember that we in the \nUnited States have a luxury of sitting thousands of miles away from a \nnuclear-armed Iran. That is a reassuring expanse of mountains, plains, \nand oceans. Others do not have this luxury. Israel, one of our closest \nallies, is much closer, easily within Iran's missile range and \ncertainly within Hezbollah's. Israel's decisionmaking process is \ncertain to take this vulnerability into account.\n  So how do we move forward from the IAEA's report? Over the next \nseveral months, our focus must be in securing a third U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution on Iran. The Russians and Chinese may well point to \nthis recent report and drag their heels on further sanctions. They are \nexcellent at that, on issues from Darfur to Burma to North Korea. But \nthe point of the first two resolutions was to halt Iran's uranium \nenrichment, not to receive more documentation from the IAEA. Iranian \nuranium enrichment is still continuing. Therefore, I think it weighs \nheavily on the U.N. and the Security Council in particular to pass a \nthird set of sanctions on Iran. These would need to be stronger than \nthe past two resolutions; ideally, they would include serious \nprohibitions on military and energy-related items, as well as nuclear \nequipment.\n  The time for foot-dragging is over. Every day that passes, that \nuranium hexafluoride becomes more enriched and the Islamic Republic \ndraws nearer to a nuclear weapons capability. I believe that diplomacy \nis the best and only effective response to this growing threat. \nTherefore, Mr. President, it is time to pass the Iran Counter-\nProliferation Act of 2007, to complement America's recent sanctions, \nand to pave the way for further U.N. sanctions. I was proud to \nintroduce this bill with my colleague Mr. Durbin, and I hope for quick \npassage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14611-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  In the early morning of November 4, 2007, in Austin, TX, a man was \nbeaten by a group of college-aged men screaming antigay slurs. Tony \nBaker, 29, was riding his bike home when three men called to him from a \nsidewalk. He stopped to engage them since he hadn't understood what \nthey were saying, and the men approached him. When it became apparent \nto him that the men were shouting antigay insults and that they were \nhostile, he began to ride off. But it was too late. The men were \nalready upon him and began punching and kicking him in the head, still \nallegedly shouting slurs. The beating reportedly lasted about a minute, \nand Baker ended up in the hospital with minor injuries. The police are \ninvestigating the incident.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14611-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14611-S14612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LABOR-HHS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my deep disappointment \nin President Bush's decision earlier this week to veto H.R. 3043, the \nfiscal year 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, \nLabor-HHS, appropriations bill.\n  This bill would have provided an additional $8.2 billion in important \nhealth, education, and worker protection programs while remaining \nfiscally responsible. The President would have us cut funding from \nprograms that help disadvantaged Americans while spending more than $10 \nbillion monthly in Iraq. What does this say to the American people?\n  The President claims he understands the value of education. The \noriginal intent behind the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, was to give \nevery child the opportunity for a quality public education while \nholding schools accountable for teaching the skills needed to succeed. \nThat is an insightful goal. But not providing adequate funding to \noperate crucial programs has the effect of leaving every child behind. \nThe Labor-HHS bill would have provided an additional $1.6 billion for \nNCLB programs, enough funding to provide title I services to 430,000 \nmore disadvantaged children. The President's budget request provided a \nmodest increase but also eliminated funding for school technology, \nschool counselors, and arts in education. The spending bill also \nprovided $12.3 billion in increased funding for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, IDEA. The IDEA Program entitles children \nwith disabilities to a public education and provides Federal funds to \nhelp schools with the cost. The President proposes slashing $291 \nmillion from special education. Further, the President proposes \nreducing Head Start by $100 million, thereby cutting 30,000 slots for \nchildren. What is this saying to America's children?\n  As you are aware, Mr. President, my home State of Maryland is \nfortunate to have many Federal agencies that employ thousands of hard-\nworking Marylanders. The Social Security Administration, SSA, is \nheadquartered there. We are all aware of SSA's resources being \nstretched to the limit. Currently, over three-quarters of a million \nindividuals are waiting an average of 523 days for hearing decisions. \nThe Labor-HHS bill would have provided the agency with a $125 million \nincrease over President Bush's budget request for administrative \nexpenses. Funding provided by this bill would have barely scratched the \nsurface of the ongoing claim backlog issue but is a step in the right \ndirection. The President's decision to veto this bill forces older and \ndisabled Americans to wait longer for their Social Security benefits. \nWhat does this say to America's seniors and disabled population?\n  We are also fortunate in my home State to have the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, headquartered in Bethesda, MD. NIH funds \nsignificant health research at over 3,000 institutions throughout the \nU.S. and around the world. NIH funding supports research to find cures \nfor diseases such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, and mental illness. \nThese are health concerns that millions of Americans face every day. \nNIH-sponsored research offers hope for medical cures to millions of \nAmericans. The bill added $1.1 billion for NIH research as opposed to \nthe President's $279 million cut to NIH programs. His veto effectively \ncloses the doors on much promising research and medical breakthroughs. \nWhat does this say to America's chronically ill citizens?\n\n[[Page S14612]]\n\n  My agenda for America is one that values health care and education \nand hard work. Those are American values, and they were on display in \nthe bill the President just vetoed. I regret the President's decision, \nand millions of other Americans do, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14612-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. This Saturday, November 17, is the eighth annual National \nAdoption Day. On this day, courts across the country will open their \ndoors to finalize the adoption of thousands of children from foster \ncare.\n  This month, four Maryland cities will celebrate with events: \nBaltimore, Urbana, Rockville, and our capital city of Annapolis. In \nBaltimore on Saturday, November 17, the Circuit Court for Baltimore \nCity will finalize the adoptions of more than 40 children. The court \nwill host an event with face painting, arts and crafts, a dessert \nreception, and a commemorative photography session. Local businesses \nhave donated toys and gift certificates for the children. Also, on \nSaturday, November 17, the Montgomery County Department of Health and \nHuman Services, Child Welfare Services, will host an appreciation \nluncheon in Rockville. In Urbana on Sunday, November 18, an \norganization called Adoptive Families and Friends will host a \ncelebration at the Urbana Public Library. They will have balloons, \nrefreshments, entertainment, and representatives of adoption agencies, \ncultural groups, and support groups. Finally, in Annapolis on Thursday, \nNovember 29, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County will finalize \nbetween 10 to 15 adoptions and then host a reception for the new \nfamilies and guests.\n  Mr. President, celebrations similar to these four in Maryland will \noccur all across our Nation in the days to come. The new families will \nserve as the inspiration for countless more adoptions in the years to \ncome. By facilitating these adoptions, the lawyers, foster care \nworkers, child advocates, judges, and others are building strong \nfamilies and stronger communities.\n  This is my first year in the Senate, but for several years in the \nHouse of Representatives, I had the privilege of serving as ranking \nmember on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, which \nhandled issues related to families, foster care, and adoptions. Its new \nname is the Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee. In 1997, \nthe committee worked in a bipartisan manner to pass the Adoption and \nSafe Families Act. That law created the Adoption Incentives Program, \nwhich provides incentive payments to States to promote adoptions out of \nfoster care, with additional incentives provided for the adoption of \nfoster children with special needs. Since that time, we have seen a \nsubstantial increase in the number of those adoptions--more than 60 \npercent.\n  Then in 2003, Representative Dave Camp and I authored, and Congress \npassed, the Adoption Promotion Act. It was introduced in the Senate by \nSenators Grassley and Landrieu, and became law on December 2, 2003. \nThat bill reauthorized the program providing States with incentives for \nincreasing overall adoptions, and it created bonuses for placing older \nchildren in permanent homes. It also authorizes the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to penalize States that fail to provide the Federal \nGovernment adequate data on adoptions and foster care services.\n  That law will expire next year, and to ensure that these vital \nprograms can continue, Congress will need to reauthorize it. We still \nneed more families willing to bring children into their homes. More \nthan 114,000 American children are still awaiting adoption, and half of \nthem are over 9 years old. These are the children who have the least \nchance of being adopted and the greatest chance of spending the rest of \ntheir childhood in foster care, so we must do more to help find \nadoptive families for them. I will be listening closely to the people \nof Maryland to learn how we can improve upon current laws.\n  Despite all the work we have done to promote adoptions, more than \n25,000 age out of foster care every year. That means that they reach \nadulthood without ever having received permanent placement with a \nfamily. In September, a few of my colleagues and I participated in a \nwonderful event sponsored by the Orphan Foundation of America. We went \nto the Mansfield Room and helped put together care packages that are \nsent to college students across the country. It is something that many \nof us who have put children through college don't automatically think \nabout. We have sent our college-age kids care packages with clothing, \nfood, and other items. But what about the students without parents? \nThis organization, with funding from Federal Express and many other \ncompanies, assembles and ships more than 3,700 packages to college \ncampuses every year. I had the honor of meeting six talented students \nfrom Maryland--four from Morgan State University, one from the \nUniversity of Maryland College Park, and one from the College of \nSouthern Maryland. They have all the brains, promise, and enthusiasm of \ntheir fellow students, but they aged out of foster care, so they need \nour support to make the transition into adulthood a smoother one.\n  Mr. President, I believe every child deserves a loving family and a \nsafe place to call home. We in Congress have the power to make that a \nreality for many of the more than 100,000 foster children now waiting \nfor a family. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nchildren who will be adopted this week and in working on policies that \nwill help children who remain in foster care to get the opportunities \nthey deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14612-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14612-S14613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE GREAT AMERICAN SMOKEOUT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today is the American Cancer Society's \n31st annual Great American Smokeout. This is an annual event designed \nto encourage the 45.8 million Americans who smoke tobacco to kick the \nhabit. First held in 1977, American Smokeout Day challenges smokers to \ngive up their cigarettes for 24 hours, in the hope that their decision \nto quit will be permanent.\n  Each year, approximately 440,000 Americans die from tobacco-related \ndiseases. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both \nmen and women, accounting for one in five deaths in the United States. \nIn Maryland alone in 2005, there were more than 7,000 smoking-related \ndeaths, many from lung cancer.\n  Americans know much more today about the dangers of tobacco than we \ndid 31 years ago when this event first took place. We know cigarettes \ncontain more than 250 chemicals that are known to be harmful, including \nhydrogen cyanide, which is used in making chemical weapons; carbon \nmonoxide, which is found in car exhaust fumes; and ammonia, which is \nused in household cleaners.\n  We have also learned that smoking affects not only tobacco users, but \nalso the people around them. Recent research has demonstrated the \nserious hazards of secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke causes nearly \n3,400 lung cancer deaths and 46,000 heart disease deaths in adult \nnonsmokers in the United States each year, and it is especially harmful \nto young children. Tragically, secondhand smoke is cited as the cause \nof approximately 430 sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS, fatalities in \nthe United States each year.\n  My home State of Maryland is 1 of 22 States that have enacted laws \nbanning smoking in nearly all public places. Gov. Martin O'Malley \nsigned the Clean Indoor Air Act of 2007 into law on May 17, 2007. It \nwill go into effect on February 1, 2008. This law specifically \nprohibits smoking in public meeting places, public transportation \nvehicles, and indoor places of employment, including all restaurants \nand bars.\n  We also know it is never too late to quit. There are significant \nhealth benefits to quitting, even after 30 or more years of smoking. \nStudies have shown that quitting at age 30 reduces one's chances of \ndying from smoking-related diseases by more than 90 percent, and \nquitting by age 50 reduces one's chances by more than 50 percent.\n  Today is also a prime opportunity for our seniors who still smoke to \nquit. Doing so will save overall health care costs and save lives. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 9.3 \npercent of Americans age 65 and older smoke cigarettes, and nearly \n300,000 seniors die of smoking-related diseases every year. The Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services have estimated that smoking-related \nhealth problems accounted for\n\n[[Page S14613]]\n\nabout 10 percent of total Medicare costs.\n  Many elderly smokers began their habit decades ago, when tobacco \ncompanies told us that smoking carried no health risks. But we know \nbetter now, and help is available. Since 2005, Medicare has covered the \ncost of smoking cessation counseling for beneficiaries with diseases \ncaused by tobacco use, such as cardiovascular disease, lung disease, \nweak bones, blood clots, and cataracts. Medicare also covers counseling \nfor beneficiaries who take medications for diabetes, hypertension, \nblood clots, and depression because tobacco use can reduce the \neffectiveness of these medicines. Medicare Part D plans also cover \nsmoking-cessation products such as nicotine patches and gum as long as \nthey are prescribed by a physician.\n  There has been significant progress in the fight against cancer, and \none factor is the decline in overall smoking rates in the U.S. But a \nrecent New York Times article entitled, ``The Smoking Scourge Among \nUrban Blacks,'' reported dramatic increases in smoking among poor \nminorities in cities across America and particularly in my home town of \nBaltimore. On city streets, cigarettes are sold individually as \n``loosies'' for 50 cents each, targeting people who cannot afford the \nnearly $5 cost of a full pack. Despite the success of antismoking \ncampaigns among American society as a whole, recent research shows that \nmore than half of poor, Black young adults still smoke. So we must \ncontinue to do more to educate minority children and young adults about \nthe health hazards of smoking. We won't be able to attack the problem \nof health disparities in earnest until we do.\n  Finally, it is time for the United States to recognize nicotine as a \ndrug and regulate its use. That is why I am a cosponsor of Senator \nKennedy's bill, S. 625, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \nControl Act. This bipartisan legislation, sponsored by a majority of \nthis body, would give the Food and Drug Administration broad new \nauthority to regulate the manufacture, distribution, advertising, \npromotion, sale, and use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. \nCongress cannot in good conscience allow the Federal agency most \nresponsible for protecting the public health to remain powerless to \ndeal with the enormous risks of tobacco.\n  In closing, I want to recognize the extraordinary efforts of the \nAmerican Cancer Society in raising awareness of the dangers of tobacco \nuse and in sponsoring the Great American Smokeout. Over the years, ACS \nhas helped millions of Americans live healthier, longer, and fuller \nlives. With comprehensive tobacco control programs, indoor smoke-free \nworkplace laws, and a multitude of smoking cessation resources \navailable today to help smokers, there has never been a better time to \nquit. Today's smokeout will give many more Americans the motivation to \nput out their last cigarette.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14613-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE FIRES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 2007\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in October, residents of San Bernardino, \nSan Diego, Orange, Los Angeles, Ventura, Riverside, and Santa Barbara \ncounties faced some of the most horrific fires in California's history. \nAt one point, flames driven by fierce Santa Ana winds forced as many as \none million Californians to flee their homes and communities.\n  During these firestorms, 14 people lost their lives. More than 100 \npeople sustained injuries. Almost 3,000 structures, two-thirds of them \nhomes, were destroyed. More than 500,000 acres burned. The impact of \nthese tragic fires will be felt by the people of California for a long \ntime, but we will do everything we can to help rebuild the damaged \nlives, homes, and communities.\n  It is often during the very worst of times that we see the very best \nof humanity. I want to express my deep appreciation to all those at the \nlocal, county, State, and Federal levels who worked tirelessly to get \nthe job done, including CalFire, the California National Guard, the \nU.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Navy, the Marines, the Border Patrol, the \nNational Park Service and, above all, the county and local fire \nagencies.\n  I was deeply touched by the thousands of courageous and tireless \nfirefighters who worked around the clock saving the lives of people \ncaught in the fire's path, battling flames, and protecting \nneighborhoods. Our California firefighters and those who traveled \nacross the country to help risked their own lives to protect the lives \nand homes of others. We are so grateful to these heroes, and will never \nforget their bravery and dedication.\n  Thankfully, no firefighters or public safety officers lost their \nlives during the fires. But several of our firefighters were injured, \nsome of them seriously, and I send them and their families my best \nwishes for a full recovery.\n  As we pay tribute to our firefighters, we must recognize their valor \nwith not just words, but also deeds. That means standing up for their \nhealth and welfare, particularly as they face challenges that can last \na lifetime. Our firefighters are there for all of us when we need them \nmost and they deserve the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14613-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14613-S14614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF DENIS P. O'DONOVAN\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this is another one of those bittersweet \nmoments for us all as we say goodbye to a member of our extended \nfamily, Denis O'Donovan. Denis will soon be retiring and bringing to a \nclose a truly remarkable career in the Senate.\n  Denis has worked in several offices in the Senate during his career, \nbut I would like to think he saved his best for his last post--as the \nchief clerk of our committee, a post he has held since 1998.\n  I remember when I first came to the committee and had the opportunity \nto observe Denis at work. I don't think I have ever met anyone who had \na better eye for detail, or a better sense of making sure everything \nwas in its proper place. He has a great mind for numbers, and anyone \nwho has ever had to work with a budget knows how frustrating it can be \nto make sure all the columns add up and are balanced--top to bottom--\nand--left to right.\n  As the Senate's only accountant, I admire that kind of precision. In \nfact, I think our love of numbers may be one of the reasons why we got \nalong so well and enjoyed each other so much.\n  In the years that I have served on the committee, I have had the \nchance to work with Denis as its chairman and now, as the ranking \nmember. No matter which party had control of the committee, Denis was \nalways there, ready to help in any way he could. That is why he was \nsuch a good chief clerk for me, for Senator Kennedy, and for all of us.\n  Looking back, Denis has a lot to be proud of. He has been a part of a \nlot of the good work the committee has done over the years. Senator \nKennedy and I have brought a long list of measures to the Senate floor \nand then on to the President for his signature and Denis played an \nimportant role in every one of them. Thanks in no small part to you, \nDenis, we have made great progress on a lot of issues that will make \nlife better for all Americans.\n  Now Denis is about to head off to that thoughtful and reflective \nworld known as retirement. He will finally have the time to finish that \nbook--not the one he was writing--the one he was reading. For now, \nthere will be time to do all those things Denis has been putting off \nfor someday.\n  I have a family tradition we call the list of 100 things. Simply put, \nit is the to do list of all time. You put together a list of the 100 \nthings you have always wanted to do someday--and then you start to get \nthem done--one by one. It is a little more complicated than that, but I \nwill get together with you to explain the whole procedure to you later. \nIt will be one of our gifts to you on your retirement.\n  I know what you are thinking--just what I wanted--more stuff to do!\n  Trust me, you will enjoy this project. And the next time I see you, \nwe will compare notes so I can see how you are doing in your quest for \nadventure in your retirement.\n  I hope Senator Kennedy will not mind, but I would like to close with \na bit of Irish cheer for you--the words of a toast I have often heard, \nand I am sure you have too.\n  Denis, as you leave us:\n\n     May the road rise to meet you,\n     May the wind be always at your back.\n     May the sun shine warm upon your face.\n\n[[Page S14614]]\n\n     And rains fall soft upon your fields.\n     And until we meet again,\n     May God hold you in the hollow of His hand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14614-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   CONGRATULATING DR. SCOTT D. MILLER\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish to commend a true leader, \nsomeone who has left an indelible impression on thousands of Delaware's \ncollege students. Dr. Scott D. Miller, after 10 years at the helm of \nWesley College in Dover, is moving on to the next phase in his \nprofessional life.\n  Dr. Miller's tenure at Wesley has been marked by previously unknown \nsuccess. He took over a quiet school in our State capital and turned it \ninto a nationally recognized institution with a burgeoning and diverse \nstudent population.\n  Evidence of his quick influence is the fact that Wesley was named as \none of just four ``amazing turnarounds'' featured in the book, ``The \nSmall College Guide to Financial Health,'' after only 5 years of Dr. \nMiller at the helm.\n  Dr. Miller's accomplishments are too numerous to name in one \nstatement, but I would like to mention a few of the most notable:\n\n       Wesley's faculty is stronger in number and diversity, which \n     has improved the retention rate and academic profile of \n     Wesley's student body.\n       Enrollment has nearly tripled in the 10 years Dr. Miller \n     has been president.\n       He has presided over the most prolific fundraising era in \n     Wesley's history.\n       And he has developed community service partnerships for his \n     students with five campus-based affiliates.\n\n  In short, Wesley College has been changed permanently--and for the \nbetter--by Dr. Miller's leadership and vision. My State's oldest \nprivate college will retain its prominence for years to come, thanks to \nDr. Miller's guidance in leading that institution into the 21st \ncentury.\n  Dr. Scott Miller is moving on, being rewarded for his excellent work \nover the last decade, and he will surely be missed. But his efforts \nwill not soon be forgotten in Dover, surely not among all of the lives \nthat he touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14614-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING KITTY ROBERTS\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Kitty \nL. Roberts, the superintendent of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, \nwho will retire on December 3, 2007, after 28 years with the National \nPark Service. Currently the superintendent of Glen Canyon National \nRecreation Area and Rainbow Bridge National Monument, for many years \nKitty headed the National Park Service's Office of Legislative and \nCongressional Affairs, where she worked very closely with the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee.\n  A native of Milton, WV, Kitty graduated from the University of \nMaryland and attended graduate school at Indiana University. She then \nworked for the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission, \nwhere she remained for 9 years.\n  Kitty began her career with the National Park Service in 1979 as a \nmanagement assistant in the National Capital Region. She went on to \nbecome the assistant superintendent at the George Washington Memorial \nParkway between 1980 and 1984. From 1984 to 1990, Kitty was the Deputy \nAssociate Regional Director, White House Liaison, in the National \nCapital Region. During this time, Kitty was the NPS Inaugural \ncoordinator and oversaw the development of East Executive Park that now \nserves as a visitor entrance to the White House. In 1990, Kitty \nreturned to the George Washington Memorial Parkway, where she served as \nsuperintendent. In 1993, former National Park Service Director Roger \nKennedy asked Kitty to become the assistant director for Legislative \nand Congressional Affairs. Kitty served in that position for 8 years, \nand during that time was extremely helpful to the committee in its \nconsideration of national park-related legislation.\n  During Kitty's tenure as assistant director, over 230 laws were \npassed affecting our national parks. Among the notable laws passed \nduring that period were the California Desert Protection Act and the \nOmnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996, with its \ncreation of 5 new park units, 10 new national heritage areas, 12 park \nboundary adjustments, and numerous other changes that benefited several \nunits of the National Park System. Kitty also worked on the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, which doubled the \namount of funding for national park roads, and the National Parks \nOmnibus Management Act of 1998, which reformed the National Park \nService's concessions program, created a park research mandate, and \nsupported employee career development and training.\n  In February 2001, Kitty left Washington to become the superintendent \nof Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Rainbow Bridge National \nMonument. During her time at the park, Kitty has worked on a policy for \npersonal watercraft and off-highway vehicle use. She has found ways to \nmaintain access to Lake Powell even as ongoing drought conditions have \nled to a 145-foot drop in the lake's water level. Perhaps one of her \nmost important contributions has been a program of public education to \nprevent needless deaths due to individuals swimming behind boats where \nexhaust fumes were vented. In early June of this year, Kitty presided \nwith the President of the Navajo Nation at the grand opening of the new \nfloating marina village at Antelope Point, with its architectural \nelements from the surrounding red rock landscape and its unique cooling \nsystem using lake water from 75 feet below the surface.\n  Kitty has had a distinguished career with the National Park Service \nand will be greatly missed by those she has worked with over the years, \nboth in the Park Service and in Congress. I want to congratulate Kitty \non her retirement and thank her for the many contributions she has made \ntoward making our national parks the pride of our Nation, and I wish \nher the best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14614-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JERRY PARKS\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Jerry Parks \nof Georgetown, KY, for being recognized on USA Today's 2007 All-USA \nTeacher Team.\n  For 10 years USA Today has selected K-12 teachers nationwide for the \nAll-USA Teacher Team. This year the nominees were judged on how well \nthey recognize and respond to the needs of their students as well as \nthe effectiveness of their teaching methods. Each team member \ndemonstrates dedication and enthusiasm for educating the youth and \nfuture of this great country.\n  Mr. Parks, a seventh-grade social studies teacher at Georgetown \nMiddle School, was recognized in the top 8 of 20 teachers on this \nnational team. His creative hands-on teaching techniques produce \nstudents who value education and are eager to learn more. Mr. Parks \nalso holds a doctorate in theology and has had several teacher guides \npublished. Because of his commitment to education, Mr. Parks \nestablished student scholarships with the profits from these \npublications. His passion for teaching serves as an inspiration to his \npeers and to teachers everywhere.\n  I now ask my fellow colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Parks \nfor his remarkable achievement and his devotion to educating young \nminds. Our Nation can look forward to a brighter future because of \nindividuals like Jerry Parks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14614-4", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14614-S14615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING JOE FREEMAN\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Joe \nFreeman of Mistletoe Meadows Christmas Tree Farm in Laurel Springs, NC, \nfor winning the National Christmas Tree Association's 2007 National \nChristmas Tree Contest. As the Grand Champion, Mr. Freeman has the \ndistinguished honor of providing this year's Official White House \nChristmas Tree. This storied tradition began in 1966, and I applaud Mr. \nFreeman for producing North Carolina's tenth Official White House \nChristmas Tree. After winning at the State level, the Mr. Freeman's \nprized 18\\1/2\\ foot Fraser fir was selected at the national \ncompetition. The prized tree was chosen to be the Blue Room Christmas \nTree by White House Chief Usher Stephen Rochon, Superintendent of \nGrounds Irv Williams, Grounds Foreman Mike Lawn and White House Florist \nNancy Clarke. Mr. Freeman and Ms. Linda Jones will have the honor of \npresenting the prized Blue Room Tree\n\n[[Page S14615]]\n\nto First Lady Laura Bush in a special ceremony at the White House on \nNovember 26, 2007.\n  This year's Official White House Christmas Tree is a fine example of \nthe exceptional quality of Christmas trees that we have in North \nCarolina. According to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, in \n2006 North Carolina led the nation in Christmas tree production, \nproviding roughly one out of every four Christmas trees in the United \nStates, and contributing over $134 million to North Carolina's economy. \nBut this success did not come easily; it takes several years of \nmeticulous care and attention to raise a Christmas tree. An average 7 \nfoot tree is about 10 years old, and throughout that time the grower \ndiligently shapes, grooms, and fertilizes the tree several times per \nyear. Not many people realize the years of hard work and sacrifice that \ngo into raising a Christmas tree, and our growers are to be commended \nfor their continuous success.\n  North Carolina celebrates a rich history of Christmas Trees, and year \nafter year, many American families enjoy the warmth and beauty of these \nNorth Carolina trees that are a symbol of the holiday season. I am \nproud of the hard work exhibited by our Christmas tree growers in North \nCarolina, and I am proud that there will be another North Carolina \nChristmas tree in the White House this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14615-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL DANIEL J. DARNELL\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a great \nleader and an exceptional officer of the U.S. Air Force, MG Daniel J. \nDarnell, now serving as the Director of Legislative Liaison for Office \nof the Secretary of the Air Force, as he prepares to leave this \nposition for one of even greater importance.\n  A command pilot with more than 4,500 flying hours, primarily in the \nF-15A/B/C/D and F-16C/D, Major General Darnell has commanded at the \nsquadron, group, wing, and warfare center levels and has flown combat \nmissions in Iraq, enforcing no-fly zones during operations Northern and \nSouthern Watch. Major General Darnell continues to provide outstanding \nleadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on numerous \ncritical issues of enduring importance to the Air Force, Congress, and \nthis Nation.\n  Major General Darnell was born at March Air Force Base in California, \nwhere his father flew with Curtis LeMay as a B-29 radio operator, later \nretired as a B-52 tail gunner. He graduated as valedictorian from the \nVirginia Military Institute in 1975 and, immediately following \ngraduation, he entered the Air Force and was recognized as a \ndistinguished graduate from the Air Force ROTC Program. Major General \nDarnell was selected to attend pilot training at Reese Air Force Base \nin Texas and was again at the top of his class, graduating pilot \ntraining as a Distinguished Graduate. Upon completion of pilot \ntraining, Major General Darnell was selected to fly the F-15, the Air \nForce's premier air-to-air fighter. He was initially assigned to the \n7th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Holloman Air Force Base but then moved \noverseas to Kadena Air Base in Japan. At Kadena, Major General Darnell \nagain excelled in the air and on the ground leading to his selection as \ninstructor pilot, flight examiner, and the sole F-15 aerial \ndemonstration pilot in the Pacific.\n  In 1982, Major General Darnell was selected to attend the F-15 \nFighter Weapons Instructor Course at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, \nan honor only bestowed on the top fighter pilots in the U.S. Air Force. \nAfter graduating, he returned to Kadena as the squadron weapons officer \nand then was assigned to McChord Air Force Base in Washington, first as \nthe Chief of Standardization and Evaluation, and then as Chief of \nWeapons and Tactics. His weapons expertise, coupled with his superior \nleadership, led him back to Nellis Air Force Base and the U.S. Air \nForce Fighter Weapons School in 1986 where he was a Fighter Weapons \nInstructor Course instructor, flight commander and operations officer, \nproviding the most advanced air-to-air training in weapons and tactics \nemployment in the world.\n  Following a staff assignment to Headquarters Tactical Air Command at \nLangley Air Force Base, Virginia, as the Chief of Weapons and Tactics, \nMajor General Darnell was selected as the 20th commander and leader of \nthe U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, ``America's Ambassadors in Blue.'' \nMajor General Darnell flew the F-16 as Thunderbird lead for 2 years, \nperforming hundreds of aerial demonstrations for millions of people all \nover the globe. In 1994, he was hand-picked to attend National War \nCollege in Washington, DC, where he received a master's degree in \nnational security policy.\n  In 1997, Major General Darnell became the commander of the 12th \nOperations Group at Randolph Air Force Base where he was responsible \nfor conducting joint and allied pilot instructor training as well as \nAir Force and Navy undergraduate combat systems officer training. He \nreturned to the F-16 in 1998 and commanded the 20th Fighter Wing at \nShaw Air Force Base in South Carolina and then 31st Wing at Aviano Air \nBase in Italy.\n  Major General Darnell returned to Nellis Air Force Base in 2001 as \ncommander, 57th Wing, the largest composite wing in the Air Force. \nDuring that time, he deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia \nwhere he was the Senior Director of the Combined Air Operations Center \nduring the opening weeks and months of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In \n2003, Major General Darnell was assigned to Schriever Air Force Base in \nColorado as the commander of the Space Warfare Center where he was \nresponsible for advancing America's space capabilities and employment \nconcepts.\n  For the past 2 years, Major General Darnell has been the Director of \nLegislative Liaison. During that time, he laid the legislative \ngroundwork for procurement of four new major weapon systems, including \nJoint Strike Fighter, Joint Cargo Aircraft, Next Generation Combat \nSearch and Rescue platform, and the $20 billion KC-X, the Air Force's \nNo. 1 acquisition priority. His leadership, vision, and political \nacumen allowed the Air Force to break through years of congressional \nrestrictions on aircraft retirements, resulting in the landmark $4 \nbillion 2007 National Defense Authorization Act language, a milestone \nyear for Air Force recapitalization and fleet management. He flawlessly \norchestrated the movement of more than 1,500 congressional delegation \ntrips for Members and staff throughout the world.\n  Major General Darnell's mastery of complex issues and decisive \nleadership guided Air Force relations with Congress through a myriad of \ndifficult issues to include Base Realignment and Closure, Total Force \nIntegration, and a 40,000 personnel drawdown. Additionally, he was \nresponsible for effectively communicating a consistent Air Force \nmessage that was the driving force behind approval of an unprecedented \nmultiyear funding authorization for the F-22A Raptor, garnering \napproximately $411 million in Air Force savings.\n  On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank Major \nGeneral Darnell, his wife Vickie, and their entire family for their \ncontinued commitment, sacrifice, and contribution to this great Nation. \nI congratulate Major General Darnell on his selection to the rank of \nlieutenant general and wish him success as he transitions into his new \njob as Deputy Chief of Staff for Air, Space and Information Operations, \nPlans and Requirements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14615-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14615-S14616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR.

He is a well-respected member of the \nmedical community in our State, serving as a faculty member in the \nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine's Department of \nOphthalmology, as well as operating a private clinical practice. He \nserves our State public education and health systems at the Callahan \nEye Foundation Hospital, where he concentrates his research and \npractice in combating the devastating effects of the eye disease \nglaucoma. Dr. Mays also sits on the Board of Directors for the Alabama \nAcademy of Ophthalmology.\n  However, I speak to you today not to praise Dr. Mays for his \naccomplishments in medicine, but to congratulate\n\n[[Page S14616]]\n\nhim on being awarded the first prize in the 2007 Van Cliburn \nInternational Competition for Outstanding Amateurs. Dr. Mays beat 74 \nother contestants on June 3, 2007, to earn this mark of distinction. \nThis competition lasts a week, and allows competitors over the age of \n35 who do not earn their livelihood through playing or providing \ninstruction on the piano to vie for a chance to win this distinguished \ntitle.\n  Michael Huebner of the Birmingham News once stated that Dr. Mays \npossessed ``a heart and mind of extraordinary capacity.'' Drew Mays \npossesses wonderful talent. He polished and sharpened this talent at \nthe School of Music at the University of Alabama, earning both a \nBachelor of Music in 1982, summa cum laude honors included, and a \nMaster of Music degree in 1987 from this fine institution. In addition, \nhe earned the opportunities to study at the Conservatory of Music in \nHanover, Germany, and the Manhattan School of Music in New York City, \nwhere he began his Master studies.\n  Not only has Dr. Mays made a name for himself through medicine and \nmusic, he is a man dedicated to family values. He and his wife, Dr. \nTherese Mays, have four young children. Dr. Mays had his family by his \nside as he won the Van Cliburn competition this year. I had the \npleasure of meeting him and his wife when they came to visit my office \nduring a trip to play at George Washington University through a \nSmithsonian Associates program. During the recital he gave at the Jack \nMorton Auditorium on the GWU campus, you could see the bond these two \nshared as musicians and partners, as his wife nodded along to the \ntwists, turns, and rhythms of his performance.\n  I commend Dr. Andrew Mays for all of his accomplishments and \nsuccesses, and I am proud to be able to represent such a wonderful man. \nI share with this body today my pleasure in congratulating Dr. Mays for \nwinning this prestigious competition, as he is certainly a worthy \nrecipient.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14616-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CAPTAIN SETH CHAPEL\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \nletter from CAPT Seth Chapel be read into the Congressional Record. \nCaptain Chappell wrote this address for East Anchorage High School's \nVeterans Day Remembrance Ceremony. He is a 2000 East High graduate and \na 2004 Graduate of the U.S. Military Academy. Captain Chappell served \nwith the 37th Engineer Battalion, Combat, Airborne, in Afghanistan \nduring Operation Enduring Freedom VII as a route clearance platoon \nleader a light equipment platoon leader.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         East High Thunderbirds\n\n       When Mrs. Strickland approached me and asked for my \n     thoughts on Veterans Day, I had to take pause for a minute. \n     For me, Veterans Day 2007 will be my first as a veteran back \n     from war, free to enjoy my long four-day weekend, sales, \n     barbecues, and all the other trappings of Veterans Day here \n     in the States. Last year at this time I was in Ghazni, \n     Afghanistan, eight months into my tour as a Route Clearance \n     platoon leader, hunting the roads of Afghanistan for bombs \n     and mines. Since returning in March, I have had time to \n     reflect on what my deployment experience and coming home has \n     meant to me, and how it shapes who I am, what I do, and what \n     I value.\n       For many Americans Afghanistan is a dimly understood \n     backwater that occupies a place in world affairs somewhere \n     between interest rates and celebrity sightings. For those of \n     us who have served Afghanistan is much more. Afghanistan is \n     days of boredom and seconds of terror. Afghanistan is 120 \n     degrees in the shade and you have to keep your helmet and \n     body armor on. Afghanistan is 10 degrees at night and the \n     heater in your vehicle is broken. Afghanistan is eating \n     combat rations for the 35th day in a row and showering out of \n     a water bottle for a month. Afghanistan is waking up before \n     daylight to roll out and hoping you find the roadside bombs \n     and they don't find you. Afghanistan is the car coming up \n     fast behind your convoy that you hope isn't a suicide bomber. \n     Afghanistan is going to bed at night and hoping that a mortar \n     round doesn't find you, and being so tired that you don't \n     think twice about it. Afghanistan isn't all hardship and \n     torment though. Afghanistan is the sun coming up on the \n     mountains while I drink my coffee. Afghanistan is sitting \n     with the locals and sharing tea. Most of all for me, \n     Afghanistan is the combat engineers of 2nd Platoon, Alpha \n     Company, 37th Engineer Battalion. Having the opportunity to \n     serve with such great Soldiers made all the hardship and \n     trial worth it, and looking back on the experience now, I \n     wouldn't trade a minute of it.\n       The service members serving overseas today aren't much \n     different than you, and aren't much older, and are doing \n     amazing things. My twenty year old medic almost cut his life \n     short when he ran 200 meters under fire to work on a Soldier \n     with a sucking chest wound who he didn't even know. These are \n     men and women who face extraordinary circumstances and \n     hardship every day, and to see what they endure and achieve \n     is humbling. The job is hard, the risks are high, the pay is \n     low, the clock never stops, and deployments are over when \n     they are over (sometimes in excess of 15 months) and come \n     again all too soon. So why serve again and again and again? \n     Some of our Soldiers and Marines are now on their fourth tour \n     of duty in the Middle East, and still they keep coming back. \n     This morning in the Middle East, Soldiers are strapping on \n     body armor, checking weapons, and readying vehicles to go \n     outside the wire in places like Baghdad, Kandahar, and Mosul. \n     Everyday they give 100% to accomplish their mission with \n     honor and keep each other alive. As an officer, I have to \n     work hard every day to deserve the privilege to lead men and \n     women of this caliber.\n       We are a nation at war, and a thin red line, less than one \n     half of one percent of Americans, are directly engaged in \n     this conflict. The great majority of Americans can go about \n     their day and think about Iraq or Afghanistan if they choose \n     to, or blow it off completely and watch Laguna Beach on MTV. \n     Whatever your political leanings may be, understand that the \n     men and women of the volunteer military serve on your behalf, \n     and stand on that wall so you don't have to. The profession \n     to which they devote themselves is defined by sacrifice and \n     service to something greater than themselves. You are high \n     school students, with a whole life before you, and how you \n     live it will either honor that service and sacrifice, or deny \n     it. Graduate, work hard, and do something to help others, \n     something that you can be proud of. Earn the sacrifice that \n     generations of Americans have made to give you this \n     birthright of opportunity.\n       Lastly, I would ask you to think about how you spend \n     Veterans Day. Tomorrow I will board a plane to West Point, \n     and visit my alma mater for the first time since I graduated \n     in 2004. I'm going back to do some upkeep on the pedestrian \n     bridge that my best friend David Fraser and I built as \n     seniors for a civil engineering project. Dave won't be able \n     to join me however. His name will be read today. Captain \n     David M. Fraser was killed last year in Baghdad on November \n     26th when a roadside bomb destroyed the vehicle he was riding \n     in. Dave's commander and driver were killed in the attack \n     also. He was supposed to return to the States the next week. \n     Take the time this weekend to thank a veteran. More than \n     3,000 paratroopers are returning to Anchorage after a hard \n     tour in Iraq. You will see them out and about in town, and \n     when you do, tell them thank you. It means more than you can \n     ever know.\n           Regards,\n                                                 Seth L. Chappell,\n     Captain, U.S. Army Engineers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14616-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14616-3", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. \n(The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14616-4", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2363.

A bill to establish a demonstration project to provide for \npatient-centered medical homes to improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency in providing medical assistance under the Medicaid program \nand child health assistance under the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are all aware of the current healthcare \ncrisis in our nation. Health care spending continues to rise at an \nunsustainable rate, constituting 16 percent of the Federal budget. \nHealth care costs have increased 78 percent since 2001, more than 4 \ntimes the pace of prices and wages.\n  One reason for the rise in costs and spending is the increase in \nchronic disease. Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are the leading \ncauses of death and disability in the U.S. They also account for 70 \npercent of all deaths in the U.S., or 1.7 million people each year. \nThese diseases also make life harder for the 1 of 10 Americans who are \nliving with them. The irony, of course, is that chronic diseases are \nboth preventable and manageable.\n  The quality of our healthcare has not changed substantially despite \nthe fact that we live in the wealthiest country in the world with the \nbest researchers and medical doctors at our fingertips. At a time when \nboth health care costs and chronic illnesses are on the rise, we need a \nbetter way to provide care.\n  Changing the delivery of care is a controversial topic, but it is a \ntopic that has gained more traction in recent months. Last week, the \nNew York Times published an article titled, ``A Model for Health Care \nThat Pays for Quality.'' The article described a new model for \nhealthcare, and I quote here, ``to identify the best primary care \ndoctors and to steer patients their way. Those doctors, in turn, would \nbe paid for more services than are currently reimbursed under typical \nhealth plan payments for office visits. The idea is to encourage \ndoctors to meet with patients for more than a few minutes during an \noffice visit and to also compensate them, or nurse coordinators, for \ncommunicating with patients by phone and e-mail outside office hours.'' \nThis is an approach to delivering care that national physician groups \nand patient advocacy organizations call the medical home.\n  A medical home is something that those of us who have it take for \ngranted. We see the same doctor, in the same setting, for extended \nperiods of time. Our medical history is in one place, and even if we \nare seeing specialists or different doctors in the same practice, there \nis continuity in decisions about our health care. This is a medical \nhome.\n  But many people do not have this luxury. Think about people who move \nfrom place to place, whose home lives are less than stable, who don't \nhave health insurance, whose medical care is sporadic. For these \nmembers of our community, each visit to a clinic or an emergency room \nmeans starting over again.\n  So, everyone should have access to a medical home. A medical home is \nnot only a place, but an approach to providing comprehensive primary \ncare that respects, and responds to, individual patient preferences and \nneeds and helps patients develop relationships with their providers.\n  It sounds easy, but it requires some changes and creative thinking \nand, perhaps most importantly, it requires a commitment by local \nproviders to work together. The medical home model makes sense for \nimproving health care for everyone. It is a model of care that makes \nsense for stretching our limited Federal health care dollars.\n  States like Illinois and North Carolina are already seeing progress \nwith implementing the medical home model. Illinois Health Connect is a \nnew program at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family \nServices that uses the medical home model to deliver primary and \npreventive care for children and adults covered through the All Kids \nprogram. This emphasis on coordinated and ongoing care is leading to \nbetter health outcomes, and it's saving money.\n  Community Care of North Carolina launched a medical home model in \n1998, through nine physician-led networks. North Carolina started by \ncreating medical homes for 250,000 Medicaid enrollees. Today, it is a \nState-wide program that has saved the state at least $60 million in \nMedicaid costs in 2003 and $120 million in 2004.\n\n[[Page S14622]]\n\n  Cost savings is not the only benefit. Several studies show that the \nmedical home approach improves quality of care. Early analyses are \nfinding that having regular access to a particular physician through \nthe medical home is associated with earlier and more accurate \ndiagnoses, fewer emergency room visits, fewer hospitalizations, lower \ncosts, better care, and increased patient satisfaction. Many studies \nconclude that having both health insurance and a medical home leads to \nimproved overall health for the entire population, which brings down \nthe cost of care and reduces health care disparities.\n  Today, I am proud to be joined by my colleague Senator Richard Burr \nof North Carolina to introduce the Medical Homes Act of 2007. This bill \nwould make it easier for other states to implement a medical home \nmodel, much like Illinois and North Carolina have. Congress passed a \nmedical home demonstration project for Medicare last year. The Medical \nHomes Act of 2007 would do this for Medicaid and SCHIP beneficiaries by \nmaking Federal funding available for a demonstration project in 8 \nStates to provide care through patient-centered medical homes.\n  The approach we propose requires a per-member, per-month care \nmanagement fee to help pay for participating doctors and provides \ninitial start-up funding for participating States. The startup funds \nare used for the purchase of health information technology, primary \ncare case managers, and other uses appropriate for the delivery of \npatient-centered care.\n  If patients, provider, payers, and the government work together to \ncreate a system that values the patient more than payments and the \nhealth outcome of the patient more than the number of patients seen, we \ncan really change the way primary care is provided. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Medical Homes Act of 2007 and help stabilize \nhealthcare delivery for low-income and elderly Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2376\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Homes Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Medical homes provide patient-centered care, leading to \n     better health outcomes and greater patient satisfaction. A \n     growing body of research supports the need to involve \n     patients and their families in their own health care \n     decisions, to better inform them of their treatment options, \n     and to improve their access to information.\n       (2) Medical homes help patients better manage chronic \n     diseases and maintain basic preventive care, resulting in \n     better health outcomes than those who lack medical homes. An \n     investigation of the Chronic Care Model discovered that the \n     medical home reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease in \n     diabetes patients, helped congestive heart failure patients \n     become more knowledgeable and stay on recommended therapy, \n     and increased the likelihood that asthma and diabetes \n     patients would receive appropriate therapy.\n       (3) Medical homes also reduce disparities in access to \n     care. A survey conducted by the Commonwealth Fund found that \n     74 percent of adults with a medical home have reliable access \n     to the care they need, compared with only 52 percent of \n     adults with a regular provider that is not a medical home and \n     38 percent of adults without any regular source of care or \n     provider.\n       (4) Medical homes reduce racial and ethnic differences in \n     access to medical care. Three-fourths of Caucasians, African \n     Americans, and Hispanics with medical homes report getting \n     care when they need it in a medical home.\n       (5) Medical homes reduce duplicative health services and \n     inappropriate emergency room use. In 1998, North Carolina \n     launched the Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) program, \n     which employs the medical home concept. Today CCNC includes \n     14 networks, that include all Federally qualified health \n     centers in the State, covering 740,000 recipients across the \n     entire State. An analysis conducted by Mercer Human Resources \n     Consulting Group found that CCNC resulted in $244,000,000 in \n     savings to the Medicaid program in 2004, with similar results \n     in 2005 and 2006.\n       (6) Health information technology is a crucial foundation \n     for medical homes. While many doctor's offices use electronic \n     health records for billing or other administrative functions, \n     few practices utilize health information technology \n     systematically to measure and improve the quality of care \n     they provide. For example, electronic health records can \n     generate reports to ensure that all patients with chronic \n     conditions receive recommended tests and are on target to \n     meet their treatment goals. Computerized ordering systems, \n     particularly with decision-support tools, can prevent medical \n     and medication errors, while e-mail and interactive Internet \n     websites can facilitate communication between patients and \n     providers and patient education.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nquality of care provided to veterans in Department of Veterans Affairs \nmedical facilities, to encourage highly qualified doctors to serve in \nhard-to-fill positions in such medical facilities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation along \nwith Senator Obama that will address some serious deficiencies we have \nfound in the Veterans Administration's health care quality assurance \nefforts. Over the past several months, we have learned of problems in \nthe hiring practices and quality of care at the veterans hospital in \nMarion, IL. What we have learned suggests that there are flaws that \ncould equally affect the hiring and quality assurance programs in other \nVA hospitals.\n  The problems at Marion first came to light in August after the VA \nbecame aware that there had been an abnormal spike in deaths at the \nhospital the previous winter. A doctor was practicing at Marion even \nthough a year earlier he had agreed to stop practicing medicine in \nMassachusetts. This fact came to light only after he had resigned from \nMarion because he was being sued for malpractice involving a case at \nMarion. It turned out that he had been involved in at least nine other \ncases at Marion in which the patient died, and he had been the subject \nof at least two malpractice settlements and a disciplinary action in \nMassachusetts before moving to Illinois.\n  The VA initiated an investigation and has taken steps to protect the \npatients at Marion. All but the most simple outpatient surgeries have \nbeen suspended, one doctor has resigned, four others have had their \nprivileges restricted, and four top staff members have been temporarily \nreassigned.\n  The VA's Inspector General is conducting a thorough investigation and \nI am looking forward to considering his conclusions. But we know enough \nto take action now. And we must take action now because what happened \nat Marion may not be an isolated case. The same problems may exist at \nother VA hospitals as well.\n  The legislation we are introducing has three main objectives. First, \nit would improve the process of vetting doctors applying to and working \nin the VA. Second, it would expand the quality control programs in the \nVA health care system. And third, it would create incentives to \nencourage high-quality doctors to practice at veterans hospitals.\n  The VA's standards for evaluating employment applicants must be \nstrengthened. When the doctor whose problematic service brought this \nissue to light was hired by the VA, he had two malpractice payments on \nhis record, but he had only disclosed one to the VA. He was also under \ninvestigation by the Massachusetts medical board for gross incompetence \nin several cases that led to the deaths of patients. This was not \ndisclosed to the VA.\n  Our legislation will fix this problem. It will require all physician \napplicants to the VA, and all doctors practicing in the VA, to disclose \nany judgments, settlements, disciplinary actions, and open \ninvestigations involving them. In addition, each doctor would be \nrequired to make a written request to the State medical board of any \nState in which they have held a license, requesting that the board \nrelease this same information to the VA.\n  Now, as a lawyer, I understand the caution that must be used when \ndealing with investigations that are not complete and judgments that \nare not final. But doctors and hospitals understand and work with \nconfidential information all the time. VA officials with hiring \nauthority will keep this information confidential and will be able to \ndifferentiate between a frivolous lawsuit and a case that should raise \nreal concern. Before we entrust our Nation's veterans to a doctor, the \nVA should know all the pertinent information about that individual. \nBefore the VA hires a physician, it should be required to examine this \nkind of information to make sure the physician should not be \ndisqualified from employment in the VA.\n  In addition, our bill requires doctors employed by the VA to be \nlicensed in the state in which they practice.\n  The bill's second objective is to improve the VA's quality assurance \nprogram. Our legislation would establish a quality assure officer at \neach VA medical facility, in each Veterans Integrated Service Network, \nVISN, region,\n\n[[Page S14625]]\n\nand at the VA national headquarters. These officers would establish and \ncarry out a quality assurance program at each VA medical facility.\n  Over the year and a half that this doctor practiced at Marion, at \nleast a few of the nurses had concerns about his skills and competence \nand raised those concerns with the hospital leadership. They were \nignored. This is absolutely unacceptable.\n  Concerns about the quality of care in a VA facility should never go \nunexamined. If local hospital officials will not listen, another avenue \nshould be available for raising these concerns. Our legislation would \nallow employees to raise quality of care concerns to the local quality \nassurance officer and the regional quality assurance officer, ensuring \nthat there is a place employees can go and know that their concerns \nwill be considered.\n  In addition, we would require that the quality assurance program at \neach hospital include a mechanism for the peer review of physicians in \nthe hospital. At Marion, it appears that any kind of peer review \nprogram that might have been present was either dormant or ignored. As \na result, early warning signs were missed that might have saved lives.\n  Our measure would require that the quality assurance officers be \nlicensed physicians, so that they will be qualified to monitor the \nperformance of other doctors and ensure a fair but thorough peer review \nprocess is in place.\n  Finally, our legislation includes provisions to encourage talented \ndoctors to practice in the VA system. We would direct each VA hospital \nto seek to affiliate with a nearby medical school so that our hospitals \nwill have the benefit of the fresh, young minds of medical students and \nthe more experienced judgments Of medical school faculty. These \naffiliations would introduce young doctors to the work of the VA, which \nmight lead them to consider a career there. We also would create loan \nforgiveness and tuition reimbursement programs to encourage doctors to \ncommit to practice in VA hospitals.\n  We also recognize that many experienced doctors might be willing to \npractice part-time in a VA hospital but would be unwilling to totally \nleave private practice. Our bill would instruct the VA to develop \nprograms to increase the recruitment of experienced, quality doctors \nwho might be willing to practice part-time in the VA health care \nsystem. It would also offer access to the federal employees health \ninsurance program to doctors who are willing to practice at least five \ndays per month in a VA medical facility.\n  This bill addresses very real issues that directly affect the health \nof our veterans. The VA's investigation of what went wrong at Marion \nmay lead us to additional legislative initiatives, but the steps we \nhave outlined in this bill are steps that need to be taken now to \nprotect veterans in VA hospitals throughout the country.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by Veterans for America. I urge my \ncolleagues to join in moving forward with this legislation to ensure \nthat our veterans receive the quality of care they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the voluntary purchase of certain \nproperties in Treece, Kansas, endangered by the Cherokee County \nNational Priorities List Site, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nprotect the residents of Treece, Kansas from the potential danger of \nremaining in an area that is undergoing a Superfund cleanup. I commend \nmy fellow Kansas colleague, Congresswoman Nancy Boyda, for introducing \nsimilar legislation in the House.\n  Treece is located in Cherokee County, Kansas. The Cherokee County \nsite encompasses 115 square miles of former mining area. Mining in this \narea dates back to the early 1900s and at one time contained the \nrichest lead and zinc ore production in the world. Although the \ndrilling stopped in 1970, the effects of over 60 years of mining can be \nseen for miles around with mountains of milling left behind. Below \nthese mountains, and surrounding areas, are enormous holes large enough \nto fit a football stadium, and they continually threaten the everyday \nsafety of the residents of this community.\n  Cherokee County is part of a larger area known as the Tri-State \nMining District that encompasses cities in southeastern Kansas, \nsouthwestern Missouri and northeastern Oklahoma. Within the Tri-State \nMining District are two towns of particular importance, Treece, Kansas \nand Picher, Oklahoma. While these two towns are separated by a State \nline they are only a mere two miles away from one another. These two \ncommunities share more than a State line; they share a major highway, \nlocal stores, and most importantly the concerns of the aftermath of \nover 60 years of mining on their health, safety and the ultimate \nsurvival of their towns.\n  Currently Picher, part of the Tar Creek Superfund site, is undergoing \na Federal buyout. The residents of Treece rely heavily on the services \nprovided to them by Picher. Without that support the economic stability \nand ultimate survival of their town is in danger. Therefore, in order \nto assist the residents of Treece, I offer this legislation today to \nauthorize the Environmental Protection Agency to make available to the \nstate of Kansas $6,000,000, in 2009. This money will be used for the \nvoluntary purchase of certain properties in Treece and will also allow \nfor the relocation of community residents. This legislation will \nprovide the residents of Treece an opportunity to relocate to another \ntown of their choosing. An opportunity that they may not have without \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's assistance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 2384. A bill to authorize the Chief of Engineers to conduct a \nfeasibility study relating to the construction of a multipurpose \nproject in the Fountain\n\n[[Page S14628]]\n\nCreek watershed located in the State of Colorado; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Fountain Creek \nFeasibility Study Act of 2007. This bill is an important piece of a \nlarger vision to transform and restore the Fountain Creek watershed, \nwhich lies in the Arkansas River Valley between the cities of Pueblo \nand Colorado Springs in my State of Colorado.\n  The Fountain Creek watershed is a major tributary to the Arkansas \nRiver and is home to a wide variety of plants and wildlife. Anyone who \nhas traveled the 1-25 corridor between Colorado Springs and Pueblo can \nattest to the natural beauty of this region. The watershed itself \ncomprises 927 square miles, but the impact of its waterflow extends far \nbeyond its strict boundaries. According to the 2000 census, more than \n500,000 people live in the watershed's boundaries. Water from the \nwatershed serves municipal, industrial and agricultural uses. Creeks \nwithin the watershed contribute about 15 percent of the drinking water \nfor Colorado Springs and are a source of irrigation for over 100 farms \nand ranches. The fertile farmland there produces wheat, com, hay, oats, \nand vegetable crops; there are also many working livestock ranches \nalong Fountain Creek.\n  Today there are major problems with Fountain Creek. In recent years, \ninstead of serving as an important link for commerce and recreation, \nthe Fountain has divided the area. Decades of neglect, increased \nwaterflows in the Fountain as a result of major urban development in \nthe north half of the watershed, increased stormwater discharges, and \nsewage spills have all harmed the region. The watershed is subject to \nfrequent flood damage, erosion, and sedimentation. In 1999 a major \nflood caused millions of dollars of damage to public and private \nproperty, and destroyed the foundations of numerous homes and roads. \nIndeed, just this spring there was minor flooding from the Fountain in \nthe Pueblo area. Farmers and ranchers near the downstream end of the \nwatershed in particular have suffered substantial losses of productive \nfarmland. Degradation of the water quality and thus aquatic and wetland \nhabitats is accelerating due to wastewater spills, loss of natural \nvegetation, and high water volume. Simply put, Fountain Creek \nwatershed's ecological conditions are unstable and under constant \nthreat.\n  This bill is a foundation stone for the idea of restoring Fountain \nCreek and turning the corridor between Colorado Springs and Pueblo into \nan environmental, agricultural, and recreational ``crown jewel'' for my \nState.\n  This bill would task the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study \nof the feasibility of constructing one or more dams and reservoirs to \nprovide more reliable flood and sediment control, to conserve fish and \nwildlife and preserve their ecosystem, and to improve the water quality \nthroughout the watershed. The Corps' expertise and experience will be \ncritical to determining the options for restoring the health and \nstability of the Fountain Creek watershed.\n  The idea of such a multipurpose project on the Fountain is not new. \nIt was first proposed in 1970 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after \nthe 1965 flood that inundated communities along the Fountain Creek, \nincluding particularly the city of Pueblo. The proposal was supported \nby the States of Colorado and Kansas and local officials, and was even \nthe preferred option of the Army Corps for addressing flooding in the \nFountain. I believe a similar proposal should be evaluated again, in \nlight of changed conditions and increased flows in Fountain Creek \nresulting from urban development in the Colorado Springs metro area. \nBecause the Fountain contributes a significant amount of water to the \nArkansas River Valley below the confluence of the Fountain Creek and \nArkansas River in Pueblo, this project may very well help address the \nvarious concerns of residents and communities of the Arkansas River \nValley from Pueblo to the Kansas State line.\n  Last year I laid out a vision to revitalize Fountain Creek and \nconnect the communities along its bank in a regional project. My plan \ninvolves the cleanup and revitalization of Fountain Creek; creating a \nlinear state park along the river corridor with camping facilities, \nhundreds of miles of new trails, restored wildlife and natural habitat \nand new flat water recreation opportunities; protecting farms and \nranches along the creek and in the lower Arkansas Valley; and ensuring \na greenbelt separator between the communities of Colorado Springs and \nPueblo.\n  My vision is to restore and transform this vital watershed. I hope \nthat all levels of Government can work together to bring unmatched \nrecreational opportunities, create an environment for plants and \nwildlife to flourish, ensure that agricultural lands remain productive, \nand address the flood control and water quality issues on Fountain \nCreek. This bill is an essential step towards achieving this goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. BOXER):\n  S. 2386. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act, to authorize temporary mortgage and rental \npayments; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a series of \nbills, S. 2386, S. 2387, S. 2388, and S. 2390, designed to better \nprepare for catastrophic wildfires like the ones that recently \ndevastated Southern California.\n  The Nation watched as these fires swept, uncontrolled, through \nseveral counties.\n  They caused the evacuation of an estimated 750,000 people--the \nlargest evacuation in California history.\n  They burned more than 500,000 acres. Destroyed more than 2,000 homes.\n  Killed 10 people. Injured 130.\n  The financial damage is estimated in the billions.\n  Simply put: This was a major disaster.\n  It was not the first. Southern California suffered similar wildfire \nlosses just 4 years ago.\n  We must face the fact that catastrophic wildfires are in California's \nfuture, and the future of other states.\n  California is tinder-dry. Global warming is real, leading to extended \ndroughts and longer fire seasons.\n  Fires are larger, and they burn hotter and with more intensity.\n  More and more people are living in areas at high risk of wildfire. \nThere are more than 5 million homes in California alone in this high-\nthreat ``wildland-urban interface.''\n  Across the rest of the country, there are nearly 40 million more \nhomes in the wildland-urban interface.\n  So the question comes: What can be done?\n  There is no doubt that we cannot fully eliminate wildfires.\n  But I believe we can take steps now to better protect communities, to \nimprove firefighting capabilities, and to improve relief and recovery \naid.\n  The four bills introduced today will get this process started. They \nare the Fire Safe Community Act, which would establish new incentives \nfor communities at risk of wildfires to adopt a new model Fire Safe \nordinance; the Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act, to make sure \nthat qualified individuals, displaced by major disasters, can make \ntheir mortgage and rental payments; the Disaster Rebuilding Assistance \nAct, to increase the amount of Federal dollars available to homeowners \nwhose rebuilding costs outstrip their insurance coverage; and the \nManaging Arson Through Criminal History, MATCH, Act, requiring states \nto create registries of convicted arsonists.\n  Let me go into greater detail on each of these bills.\n\n\n                        Fire Safe Community Act\n\n  This bill will help protect our communities from the catastrophic \neffects of wildfires.\n  Most importantly, it does three key things: it instructs the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology to develop a model ordinance that \nwill serve as a baseline for communities seeking to protect their homes \nand property from wildfire; it encourages local participation by \nallowing for greater Federal reimbursement of firefighting costs in \ncommunities that adopt the model ordinance; and it creates a grant \nprogram to encourage responsible development practices that meet model \nguidelines in the wildland-urban interface.\n  In effect, the Federal Government would become the partner to local \ngovernments as they seek to make their communities fire-safe.\n  As I have said, we can never stop wildfires. But we can take \nimportant\n\n[[Page S14629]]\n\nsteps to make these fires less destructive.\n  This bill starts with the first step of creating a model ``Fire \nSafe'' ordinance--with clear, unambiguous language that sets a national \nstandard for how to address all aspects of fire threat.\n  The National Institute of Standards and Technology would provide this \nstandard guideline for communities, in conjunction with the U.S. Forest \nService, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fire \nAdministration.\n  States are also encouraged to adopt model ordinances tailored to the \nneeds of their own communities for fire-safe development.\n  These guidelines will address water supply, construction materials \nand techniques, defensible space, vegetation management, and \ninfrastructure standards.\n  The next step is to put this model ordinance to use.\n  The bill authorizes a $25 million per year grant program, \nadministered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Office of \nGrants and Training.\n  It will help communities implement these standards, and bring the \nsafest development practices to their neighborhoods.\n  This grant program will be available to local governments located in \nthe wildlife-urban interface, and to high-threat regions that have \nadopted--or plan to adopt--the model ordinance.\n  They will have the option of adopting either the federal model \nordinance, or one produced by their own state.\n  As further incentive, this bill would improve Fire Management \nAssistance Grants to communities adopting a model ordinance.\n  Today under the Fire Management Assistance Grant program, the Federal \nGovernment covers 75 percent of the cost of fighting wildfires.\n  Under this bill, communities adopting a model ordinance would be \neligible for federal reimbursement of up to 90 percent of their \nfirefighting costs.\n  The Fire Safe Community Act will also make grants available to States \nto help them compile their own fire maps.\n  The mapping grants will be matched 50-50 by State funds, and will \nencourage development of comprehensive fire hazard maps that indicate \nthe exact locations of high-threat fire areas.\n  This vital information will aid firefighting efforts at all levels.\n  It's important to note that the model ordinances at the core of this \nbill are not mandatory--they would provide voluntary guidelines that \ncommunities can adopt, or not.\n  It does not step on the toes of local government. Rather, it would \nhelp all of us reach a common goal.\n  I come from local government--I'm 9 years a mayor, 9 years a county \nsupervisor--and I recognize that zoning is the province of local \ngovernment.\n  But we have a real problem here: We know that development in the \nwildland-urban interface is accelerating, making fires more costly.\n  So we need to take steps to improve fire safety in these areas.\n  This bill is an important step toward becoming better prepared.\n  Now I want to discuss two bills intended to improve recovery aid \nafter disaster strikes.\n\n\n                Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act\n\n  This bill will provide much-needed relief to families hit hard by \ndisaster--including people displaced by the recent fires.\n  It would authorize FEMA to make mortgage and rental assistance \navailable for qualified individuals in communities designated by the \nPresident as disaster areas.\n  It is based on an important point: While catastrophic wildfires and \nother disasters can destroy homes, they don't relieve people of the \nfinancial obligations that come with home ownership or lease \nagreements.\n  In most cases, these payments must still be made, even if the \nresidence has been wiped out.\n  This burden is too much for many families. They incur additional \nexpenses--such as hotel or lodging costs--that come with being \ndisplaced following a major disaster.\n  FEMA used to provide mortgage and rental assistance. But it was \neliminated by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000.\n  This bill would reauthorize the program, and make several changes to \nensure that assistance is provided only to those most in need.\n  First, to qualify for assistance applicants must demonstrate that \nthey face significant economic hardships and suffered disaster-related \nincome loss.\n  The disaster-related income loss must fit into one of the following \ncategories: Your employer, or your own business, must be located in the \narea declared a major disaster by the President; you lose your job \nbecause your employer or business has a significant business \nrelationship with a company located within the Presidentially declared \ndisaster area; or you live in a Presidentially declared disaster area, \nand have suffered financially due to travel restrictions and road \nclosures post-disaster.\n  To qualify for this aid, applicants must also provide proof that \ntheir employment was discontinued as a result of disaster.\n  They must also show imminent delinquency, eviction, dispossession, or \nforeclosure.\n  Finally, this assistance is available only for up to 18 months, and \nis subject to income caps.\n  Only households with adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or less, in \nhigh-cost States such as California, would be eligible.\n  Households in lower-cost States could be eligible if their annual \nadjusted gross incomes do not exceed $75,000.\n\n\n                   disaster rebuilding assistance act\n\n  This second disaster relief bill would increase the amount of money \nFEMA can provide--for rebuilding and temporary housing--in high-cost \nStates such as California.\n  It is designed to help disaster victims whose rebuilding costs exceed \ntheir insurance coverage.\n  Sadly, many Californians hit by the wildfires are now learning that \ntheir insurance coverage was insufficient.\n  This is a real problem in California; in fact, California Insurance \nCommissioner Steve Poizner estimates that as many as 25 percent of the \nvictims of the recent fires may be underinsured.\n  Let me be clear: This bill will not cover the full costs of \nrebuilding.\n  But it will help close the gap, for qualified households in areas \ndeclared by the President to be disaster areas.\n  Today, FEMA can provide up to roughly $28,000 to individuals and \nhouseholds whose rebuilding costs exceed their insurance coverage.\n  This assistance can be used for rebuilding costs, as well as \ntemporary housing.\n  This bill would increase this amount to $50,000.\n  The legislation also gives the President the discretion to increase \nthis cap, if necessary, to cover rebuilding expenses in high-cost \nStates.\n  I believe this bill will provide an important step toward giving \nAmericans the chance they need to rebuild their lives after suffering \nthrough a major disaster.\n  The last bill in this package takes aim at criminal arsonists.\n\n\n              managing arson through criminal history act\n\n  This bill--also known as the MATCH Act--is the Senate version of a \nbill introduced in the House by California Representatives Mary Bono \nand Adam Schiff.\n  It would establish Federal and State arson registries; require \nconvicted arsonists to register and update certain specified \ninformation for 5 years after a first conviction, 10 years after a \nsecond conviction, and for life after a third conviction; and authorize \ngrants and incentives so that these registries will be operational \nwithin 3 years.\n  It is important that we improve our ability to keep track of \narsonists, because it is clear that some of these recent wildfires were \nno accident.\n  The Santiago Fire in Orange County--which burned at least 27,000 \nacres--has officially been declared an arson fire.\n  Would-be arsonists tried to start new fires as the wildfires raged.\n  In San Diego County, authorities arrested an adult and a juvenile \nsuspected of starting a blaze in Vista.\n  In San Bernardino, a suspect was charged with setting a brush fire \nnear Victorville.\n  There were several arson-related arrests in Los Angeles County--one \nsuspect died in a gunfight with police.\n  The arsonist who started the Santiago fire remains at-large.\n  There is a reward--it now stands at $250,000--but law-enforcement \nofficials\n\n[[Page S14630]]\n\nsay an arrest will likely depend on a tip from the public.\n  It does not have to be that way.\n  This bill would give fire investigators and law-enforcement officials \nup-to-date information on potential arsonists.\n  This is common-sense legislation. It will provide a readily \naccessible database, and help investigators rule out persons of \ninterest and zero in on arson suspects.\n  We owe it to our brave firefighters to give fire investigators this \nimportant new tool, so they can help bring arsonists to justice.\n  Catastrophic wildfires are not going away. In fact, the evidence \nstrongly suggests they will occur with greater frequency and ferocity.\n  But we can take important steps--now--to make our communities safer.\n  To strengthen our firefighting capabilities.\n  To ensure that more relief and recovery aid is provided to victims, \nso they can get back on their feet as soon as possible.\n  These bills are not a panacea. But they are an important first step. \nI urge my colleagues to vote for them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 2391. A bill to provide for affordable housing relief, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED Mr. President, today I introduce the Government Sponsored \nEnterprise Mission Improvement Act of 2007. This bill would amend the \nHousing and Community Development Act of 1992 to dramatically \nstrengthen the affordable housing mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac. I believe that deepening Fannie and Freddie's responsibilities \ntowards affordable housing must be a part of any type of GSE reform \nthat we undertake in the Senate.\n  The problems caused by the shortage in affordable housing are well \npublicized. But the impact of the shortage, which most commonly affects \nthose near the bottom of the income scale, receives less attention. \nWorse, there is currently no Federal housing program that increases the \nsupply of housing affordable to those with the most severe needs. The \nbill I am introducing today, the Government Sponsored Enterprise \nMission Improvement Act, would provide $500 to $900 million per year in \nfunding to help those with worst case housing needs.\n  Across the U.S., the 17 million renters and owners with lowest \nincomes have by far the most critical housing problems. About three-\nfifths of renters and owners with incomes below 30 percent of area \nmedian income pay more than half of their meager incomes for housing.\n  Families must pay such excessive amounts because there are too few \naffordable units. Nationally, according to HUD's analysis of 2005 \nAmerican Housing Survey data, there were 10 million renters with \nincomes below 30 percent of area median income in 2005, but only 6.7 \nmillion units with rents affordable to those with such incomes.\n  This bill I am introducing today would require Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac to set aside 4.2 basis points on each dollar of unpaid principle \nbalance of total new business purchases for an Affordable Housing \nProgram.\n  Sixty-five percent of this set-aside would go towards an Affordable \nHousing Block Grant Program. This program would be managed by the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development and in the first year after \nenactment, would be allocated to the states by formula grant to help \naddress the current subprime mortgage crisis. These grants could be \nused to facilitate loan modification and refinance options for low- and \nmoderate-income borrowers facing foreclosure. Some of the funding could \nalso be used to help low- and moderate-income homebuyers purchase \nproperties that have been foreclosed upon to help stabilize \nneighborhoods.\n  After 2008, the funding would be distributed by formula grants to the \nstates for the development, construction, and preservation of housing \nfor very low- and extremely low-income families. This funding would \ncomplement other Federal and State programs, such as the HOME \nInvestment Partnerships and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit programs, to \nbring down costs enough to primarily target the income group most \nneeding housing that is truly affordable to them, extremely low-income \nrenters.\n  The other 35 percent of this set-aside would be allocated for a \nCapital Magnet Fund managed by the Secretary of the Treasury. This \nfunding would go out through competitive grants for financial \nactivities that leverage affordable housing development, construction \nand preservation for low-, very low-, and extremely low-income \nfamilies. It could also be used for economic development activities or \ncommunity service facilities, such as day care centers and health care \nclinics, that in conjunction with affordable housing activities \nimplement a concerted strategy to stabilize or revitalize a low-income \ncommunity or underserved rural area.\n  The Government Sponsored Enterprise Mission Improvement Act also \nwould strengthen Fannie and Freddie's Affordable Housing Goals. In \nparticular, it would align their goals with current Community \nReinvestment Act income targeting definitions, which I believe should \nhelp the lower end of the conventional market become more liquid.\n  Finally, this legislation would create a new statutory duty for \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac to serve ``underserved markets'' that lack \nadequate credit through conventional lending sources such as \nManufactured Housing; Affordable Housing Preservation; Subprime \nBorrowers; Community Development Financial Institutions; and Rural \nHousing. I give teeth to this provision by making compliance with this \nduty subject to Section 1336 enforcement provisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and to help make \nit an integral part of any GSE reform that is taken up by the Senate. \nThis bill makes it clear that with Fannie and Freddie's Government \nbenefits come many important responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify, modernize, and improve public notice of and access to tax \nlien information by providing for a national, Internet accessible, \nfiling system for Federal tax liens, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Good \nGovernment Contractor Act of 2007.\n  This legislation represents my continuing efforts targeting federal \ncontractors with tax debt. For several years, as Chair and now as \nRanking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I have \nled a bipartisan Subcommittee effort, with the assistance of the \nGovernment Accountability Office, that has uncovered tens of thousands \nof deadbeat civilian and defense contractors.\n  What we are dealing with here are not everyday tax delinquents, but \nrather federal contractors who do not pay their fair share of taxes--\ndespite receiving billions of dollars from American taxpayers each \nyear. So far, since PSI began this effort, we have learned that 27,000 \nFederal contractors at the Department of Defense owed about $3 billion \nin unpaid taxes; 33,000 Federal contractors at civilian agencies owed \nback taxes amounting to $3.3 billion; 3,800 Federal contractors who \ncontract with the General Services Administration owe back taxes amount \nto $1.4 billion.\n  These contractors are not just cheating the American taxpayer but in \nmany cases cheating their own employees by using payroll taxes for \ntheir business or personal use. The Subcommittee has learned of \ncontractors who have bought luxury cars, boats, and multi-million \ndollar properties, even though they owed hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in unpaid taxes.\n  At the end of the day, these contractors are not only shifting the \nburden to honest taxpayers but also depriving the Treasury of funds \nthat could be used to address critical priorities from education to \nhealth care to the fight against terrorism. Accordingly, as part of my \non-going effort to safeguard the interest of the American taxpayer and \nhonest federal contractors, I am introducing legislation to better \ntarget tax cheating contractors.\n  More specifically, my legislation will amend the Federal Acquisition \nRegulations to consider a responsible contractor as one without any tax \ndebt; require the Department of Defense, GSA and NASA to issue a final \nrule relating to tax delinquency; establish a national electronic tax \nlien filing system; create a Federal tax conviction database for the \npurposes of verifying contractor tax information; and establish as \ncause for debarment or suspension for knowingly making false statements \nregarding Federal tax information or prior convictions or civil \njudgments for Federal tax evasion or other Federal Tax offenses.\n  My bill will also repeal the indiscriminant three percent tax \nwithholding requirement on all contractors, something which the vast \nmajority of responsible, tax-paying government contractors, as well as \nState and local units of government, will appreciate. Last year, \nCongress passed into law a well-intentioned but highly problematic \nmeasure establishing a three percent withholding tax on all government \ncontractors. Section 511 of the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005 will impose a 3 percent withholding tax on \nFederal, State and local payments for goods and services beginning in \n2011, except for local governments with annual spending of less than \n$100 million for goods and services. While this measure will obviously \ncapture the bad apples, it unfortunately will also hit honest \ncontractors--some of whose business livelihoods could well be \njeopardized as a result. Another serious side effect will be the \nadministrative burden on State and local governments, which could \nultimately heighten the cost of doing business in a much larger sense.\n  Rather than this broad and cumbersome approach, my Good Government \nContractor Act of 2007 will replace the blanket three percent \nwithholding requirement with measures focused on just the bad actors. \nIn closing, my bill will protect taxpayers, State and local \ngovernments, and law-abiding government contractors by holding deadbeat \ncontractors accountable in a strict but fair way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an adoption process improvement pilot \nprogram; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce legislation \nin honor of National Adoption Day that will address the needs of \nchildren waiting to be adopted from our Nation's foster care system. \nThese are children who are unable to return home to their natural \nparents and are in need of permanent, loving, adoptive homes. In recent \nyears, Congress has acted to implement supports for this population by \ncreating programs that allow states to pursue creative and innovative \nmethods for increasing foster care adoptions. However, today, tens of \nthousands of children are still waiting for families. There is still \nmore work to be done.\n  According to current federal estimates, there are 114,000 children in \nfoster care with the goal of adoption. Of these, only 13 percent are \nliving in a pre-adoptive home. Moreover, each year in the public child \nwelfare system, more children are made eligible for adoption than find \npermanent adoptive homes. For example, in fiscal year 2005--the most \nrecent year for which statistics are available--states finalized 15,000 \nmore terminations of parental rights than adoptions. Taken together, \nthese statistics describe a tremendous pool of children lingering in \nfoster care, waiting for a ``forever family.'' We know the longer \nchildren languish in foster care, the more they are at risk for \ndeveloping a range of psychological, behavioral, and educational \nproblems. Therefore, permanence for these children is essential.\n  Child welfare professionals across the country lament a lack of \nadoptive families for children in foster care. However, an untapped \nresource exists. A recent study conducted by the Evan B. Donaldson \nAdoption Institute in collaboration with Harvard University and the \nUrban Institute notes that, in a given year, 240,000 people will call \nfor information about adopting a child from foster care, but only a \nfraction will see the process through to adoption. This research states \nthat prospective parents are often alienated from the adoption process \nat an early stage; these individuals experience unpleasant initial \ncontacts and report difficulty in navigating the adoption process. Out \nof frustration, they abandon their pursuit of bringing a foster child \npermanently into their home.\n\n[[Page S14642]]\n\n  Therefore, I am pleased to introduce the Adoption Improvement Act of \n2007. This legislation establishes funding for a demonstration project \naimed at reducing the attrition of prospective parents from the \nadoption process. Participating states will implement a rigorous \nprogram that strengthens the first contact prospective adopters have \nwhen they make that critical, initial inquiry into adopting a child. \nThe bill calls on programs to include a specialized adoption hotline; \nhire employees who are trained to respond to callers' requests \nsensitively and efficiently; and incorporate the input of parents who \nhave already adopted children from foster care. In addition, programs \nwill provide explicit information to parents about how to make their \nway through the various adoption procedures; describe the rewards and \nchallenges of the adoption process; and establish a buddy system that \npartners prospective parents with those who have already adopted foster \nchildren successfully. Finally, all agencies in the demonstration \nproject will participate in a thorough program evaluation.\n\n  This month is National Adoption Month, and tomorrow, November 17, \n2007, is National Adoption Day--a day to celebrate the families that \nhave already been joined through adoption, and to call attention to the \nthousands of children still waiting for permanent homes. I am delighted \nto join Senators Landrieu and Coleman in their forthcoming resolution \nacknowledging the importance of National Adoption Month and National \nAdoption Day. I encourage my colleagues in Congress to take the \nmessages of this resolution and my bill with them, beyond just this \nNovember, into the future.\n  The national data compel us to take action. Too many children in our \nNation's foster care system are in desperate need of stable, loving \nhomes, and there are thousands of potential parents out there yearning \nto provide them. I would like to thank my colleague Senator Rockefeller \nfor joining me in this important effort. Please join me in bringing \nthese groups together so that children in foster care can find the \nfamilies they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 2396. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nmodernize the quality improvement organization (QIO) program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I join with Senators Rockefeller, \nLott, and Kennedy to introduce the Medicare Quality Improvement \nModernization Act of 2007, S. 2396.\n  As background for my colleagues, Medicare's Quality Improvement \nOrganization, QIO, program has been in existence for 35 years. The \nprogram's intent has always been to assure that Medicare's \nbeneficiaries receive high quality medical care. The program has \nundergone a steady evolution. What began as a program that called \nattention to hospitals and physicians whose care deviated from the \nnorms of medical practice has morphed into one that seeks to help \nphysicians, hospitals, nursing homes and other providers develop \nsystems to improve their quality of care.\n  The program has changed as the definition of quality changed. When \nMedicare's peer review program was initiated, high quality care for a \nMedicare beneficiary was simply not to be among the unfortunate few \nwhose medical care deviated from the norms of local medical practice. \nFortunate for them, however, quality today is the routine adherence of \nproviders to nationally accepted standards of care.\n  The legislative changes we propose for the QIO program reflects an \never-advancing definition of quality medical care and a focus on \nhelping providers obtain it.\n  The QIO program has three functions. First, the program reviews the \nmedical care of beneficiaries who have complaints about their care and \nprovides the beneficiaries opinions. Second, the program supports \nintensive work with practitioners, nursing homes, managed care plans \nand hospitals to develop delivery systems that improve the quality of \ntheir care. Third the program publicly reports system-level performance \nmeasures.\n  The bill I introduce today is faithful to the results of a \ncongressionally-mandated review of the QIO program reported in \nFebruary, 2006. In that review, the IOM concluded ``The QIO program \nprovides a potentially valuable nationwide infrastructure dedicated to \npromoting quality health care.'' For example, the QIO program is \nresponsible for a substantial part of the National Healthcare Quality \nReport published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n  The IOM report called for changes in the QIO program. Its principal \nfindings and recommendations were that the local QIO boards are heavily \nphysician-dominated with little consumer representation. Existing \nlegislation requires specific levels of physician involvement, an \noutmoded board structure.\n  Also, the QIO functions should be harmonized with other federal \nquality Initiatives.\n  It found that the QIOs were ``. . . restricted from contracting with \nhealth care providers in its state for technical assistance or review \nservices similar to those covered by its core Medicare contract.'' The \nIOM committee concluded that QIOs would be able to serve more providers \nand expand their function beyond Medicare beneficiaries to the \nentire healthcare system if they could contract for services to \nsupplement their CMS funds.\n\n  The Committee also recommended removal of restrictions on public \naccess to the QIO's findings. For instance, beneficiaries have been \nunable to review the results of investigations that they requested.\n  The IOM recommended that beneficiary reviews be removed from the \nlocal QIOs.\n  The IOM committee concluded that Congress and the secretary of DHHS \nand CMS should improve program management by enhancing the contracting \nprocess and improving communication with the QIOs.\n  The legislation I propose seeks to strengthen the QIO's \ninfrastructure to fit with an ever-tightening standard of quality in \nmedicine, believing that doctors and hospitals want to do the right \nthing but also that patients should have their say.\n  Many of the changes recommended by the Institute of Medicine's \nexperts and accepted by the experts at CMS do not require statutory \nchange, but some do. Some program modifications are sufficiently \ncritical to Medicare's beneficiaries, that while statutory language may \nnot be required to affect them, a Congressional mandate is needed to \nassure them.\n  First, the Quality Improvement Organization Modernization Act of 2007 \nspecifies that the Quality Improvement Organizations offer education, \ninstruction, and technical assistance to providers, practitioners, and \nMedicare Advantage plans. It incorporates plans and providers in urban, \nrural, and frontier areas and providers that treat racial and ethnic \nminorities.\n  Second, our bill strengthens the review process for individual \nMedicare beneficiaries. The QIOs must actively educate beneficiaries of \ntheir right to bring any concerns to the QIOs. The QIOs must work with \nproviders who are reviewed to correct deficiencies where they exist and \nto improve communication with patients where they do not.\n  The bill specifies that the findings of the review must be disclosed \nto the beneficiary requesting the review but not before giving the \nprovider an opportunity to respond to the findings. The review \nfunctions are left with the local QIOs and not delegated to other \nentities to perform.\n  The bill specifies that the findings of reviews may not be used in \nmedical malpractice litigation, otherwise the QIOs would serve more to \nscreen cases for litigation than they would to improve the quality of \ncare.\n  Third, in order to be certain that the QIOs are appropriately judging \nthe severity of the errors they find and appropriately recommending \nsanctions to the Secretary, the Office of Inspector General will \ncontract for an audit of 10 percent of one year's QIO reviews during \neach 5-year contract period.\n  Fourth, program administration is strengthened and its goals focused. \nThe program's scope of work must incorporate the priorities of local \nstakeholders.\n  A strategic advisory committee will advise the Secretary on program \ngoals, on program performance, and on harmonization of the QIO's \nquality functions with other federal and non-federal quality \ninitiatives.\n\n[[Page S14643]]\n\n  The GAO is instructed to report on implementation of program changes \n1 year after the first 5-year contract period following enactment of \nthis legislation. The adequacy of funding allocated to the QIOs for \nlocal initiatives has been in dispute among the QIOs. Congress is to \nreceive an independent report about the adequacy of QIO financing \nbefore the initiation of each contract period.\n  The contracting process is strengthened by mandating timely \ncontracting with the QIOs by CMS and by lengthening the contract period \nfrom 3 to 5 years. All QIOs must bid competitively every 5 years.\n  Fifth, local boards have been physician-dominated with little \nconsumer representation. Our bill eliminates the requirement that QIOs \nmust be physician sponsored organizations. Our bill improves local QIO \naccountability by strengthening the authority of the Secretary over \nboard structure and function. It authorizes the Secretary to ensure \nthat non-physician quality experts and qualified consumers are given \nappropriate representation on state QIO boards. It authorizes the \nSecretary to ensure that the board structure is appropriate, that the \ncompensation of board members and executives is market-based and that \nconflict of interest among board members is mitigated.\n  Sixth, as the QIOs focus more of their energies on working with \nproviders to improve quality the demand for their services in this \nendeavor exceed their resources. For example, the number of doctors \nrequesting help from the Utah QIO in selecting information technology \nfor their offices far exceeds the resources available to it from its \nCMS contract.\n  Our bill allows a QIO to contract with a provider or organization if \nit meets one of several requirements. Among them are that the QIO must \nreceive no more than 5 percent of its revenue from a single provider or \norganization, or if the contracting organization is subject to review \nby the QIO, conflict of interest must be mitigated by using an out-of-\nstate QIO to perform the reviews that the local QIO would otherwise \nperform.\n  The QIO program differs from other Federal health care quality \nprograms in that it does not just measure quality; it works with \nproviders to attain it. The Medicare Quality Improvement Organization \nAct of 2007 strengthens the rights of beneficiaries, strengthens the \nadministration of the program and the contracting process, provides for \nmore accountability of contractors, and focuses the program on creating \nquality systems.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in strengthening the QIO \nprogram. It is one of the cornerstones of the quality initiative not \njust for Medicare but for all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S.J.

A bill to authorize the voluntary purchase of certain \nproperties in Treece, Kansas, endangered by the Cherokee County \nNational Priorities List Site, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nprotect the residents of Treece, Kansas from the potential danger of \nremaining in an area that is undergoing a Superfund cleanup. I commend \nmy fellow Kansas colleague, Congresswoman Nancy Boyda, for introducing \nsimilar legislation in the House.\n  Treece is located in Cherokee County, Kansas. The Cherokee County \nsite encompasses 115 square miles of former mining area. Mining in this \narea dates back to the early 1900s and at one time contained the \nrichest lead and zinc ore production in the world. Although the \ndrilling stopped in 1970, the effects of over 60 years of mining can be \nseen for miles around with mountains of milling left behind. Below \nthese mountains, and surrounding areas, are enormous holes large enough \nto fit a football stadium, and they continually threaten the everyday \nsafety of the residents of this community.\n  Cherokee County is part of a larger area known as the Tri-State \nMining District that encompasses cities in southeastern Kansas, \nsouthwestern Missouri and northeastern Oklahoma. Within the Tri-State \nMining District are two towns of particular importance, Treece, Kansas \nand Picher, Oklahoma. While these two towns are separated by a State \nline they are only a mere two miles away from one another. These two \ncommunities share more than a State line; they share a major highway, \nlocal stores, and most importantly the concerns of the aftermath of \nover 60 years of mining on their health, safety and the ultimate \nsurvival of their towns.\n  Currently Picher, part of the Tar Creek Superfund site, is undergoing \na Federal buyout. The residents of Treece rely heavily on the services \nprovided to them by Picher. Without that support the economic stability \nand ultimate survival of their town is in danger. Therefore, in order \nto assist the residents of Treece, I offer this legislation today to \nauthorize the Environmental Protection Agency to make available to the \nstate of Kansas $6,000,000, in 2009. This money will be used for the \nvoluntary purchase of certain properties in Treece and will also allow \nfor the relocation of community residents. This legislation will \nprovide the residents of Treece an opportunity to relocate to another \ntown of their choosing. An opportunity that they may not have without \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's assistance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 2384. A bill to authorize the Chief of Engineers to conduct a \nfeasibility study relating to the construction of a multipurpose \nproject in the Fountain\n\n[[Page S14628]]\n\nCreek watershed located in the State of Colorado; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Fountain Creek \nFeasibility Study Act of 2007. This bill is an important piece of a \nlarger vision to transform and restore the Fountain Creek watershed, \nwhich lies in the Arkansas River Valley between the cities of Pueblo \nand Colorado Springs in my State of Colorado.\n  The Fountain Creek watershed is a major tributary to the Arkansas \nRiver and is home to a wide variety of plants and wildlife. Anyone who \nhas traveled the 1-25 corridor between Colorado Springs and Pueblo can \nattest to the natural beauty of this region. The watershed itself \ncomprises 927 square miles, but the impact of its waterflow extends far \nbeyond its strict boundaries. According to the 2000 census, more than \n500,000 people live in the watershed's boundaries. Water from the \nwatershed serves municipal, industrial and agricultural uses. Creeks \nwithin the watershed contribute about 15 percent of the drinking water \nfor Colorado Springs and are a source of irrigation for over 100 farms \nand ranches. The fertile farmland there produces wheat, com, hay, oats, \nand vegetable crops; there are also many working livestock ranches \nalong Fountain Creek.\n  Today there are major problems with Fountain Creek. In recent years, \ninstead of serving as an important link for commerce and recreation, \nthe Fountain has divided the area. Decades of neglect, increased \nwaterflows in the Fountain as a result of major urban development in \nthe north half of the watershed, increased stormwater discharges, and \nsewage spills have all harmed the region. The watershed is subject to \nfrequent flood damage, erosion, and sedimentation. In 1999 a major \nflood caused millions of dollars of damage to public and private \nproperty, and destroyed the foundations of numerous homes and roads. \nIndeed, just this spring there was minor flooding from the Fountain in \nthe Pueblo area. Farmers and ranchers near the downstream end of the \nwatershed in particular have suffered substantial losses of productive \nfarmland. Degradation of the water quality and thus aquatic and wetland \nhabitats is accelerating due to wastewater spills, loss of natural \nvegetation, and high water volume. Simply put, Fountain Creek \nwatershed's ecological conditions are unstable and under constant \nthreat.\n  This bill is a foundation stone for the idea of restoring Fountain \nCreek and turning the corridor between Colorado Springs and Pueblo into \nan environmental, agricultural, and recreational ``crown jewel'' for my \nState.\n  This bill would task the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a study \nof the feasibility of constructing one or more dams and reservoirs to \nprovide more reliable flood and sediment control, to conserve fish and \nwildlife and preserve their ecosystem, and to improve the water quality \nthroughout the watershed. The Corps' expertise and experience will be \ncritical to determining the options for restoring the health and \nstability of the Fountain Creek watershed.\n  The idea of such a multipurpose project on the Fountain is not new. \nIt was first proposed in 1970 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after \nthe 1965 flood that inundated communities along the Fountain Creek, \nincluding particularly the city of Pueblo. The proposal was supported \nby the States of Colorado and Kansas and local officials, and was even \nthe preferred option of the Army Corps for addressing flooding in the \nFountain. I believe a similar proposal should be evaluated again, in \nlight of changed conditions and increased flows in Fountain Creek \nresulting from urban development in the Colorado Springs metro area. \nBecause the Fountain contributes a significant amount of water to the \nArkansas River Valley below the confluence of the Fountain Creek and \nArkansas River in Pueblo, this project may very well help address the \nvarious concerns of residents and communities of the Arkansas River \nValley from Pueblo to the Kansas State line.\n  Last year I laid out a vision to revitalize Fountain Creek and \nconnect the communities along its bank in a regional project. My plan \ninvolves the cleanup and revitalization of Fountain Creek; creating a \nlinear state park along the river corridor with camping facilities, \nhundreds of miles of new trails, restored wildlife and natural habitat \nand new flat water recreation opportunities; protecting farms and \nranches along the creek and in the lower Arkansas Valley; and ensuring \na greenbelt separator between the communities of Colorado Springs and \nPueblo.\n  My vision is to restore and transform this vital watershed. I hope \nthat all levels of Government can work together to bring unmatched \nrecreational opportunities, create an environment for plants and \nwildlife to flourish, ensure that agricultural lands remain productive, \nand address the flood control and water quality issues on Fountain \nCreek. This bill is an essential step towards achieving this goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. BOXER):\n  S. 2386. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act, to authorize temporary mortgage and rental \npayments; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a series of \nbills, S. 2386, S. 2387, S. 2388, and S. 2390, designed to better \nprepare for catastrophic wildfires like the ones that recently \ndevastated Southern California.\n  The Nation watched as these fires swept, uncontrolled, through \nseveral counties.\n  They caused the evacuation of an estimated 750,000 people--the \nlargest evacuation in California history.\n  They burned more than 500,000 acres. Destroyed more than 2,000 homes.\n  Killed 10 people. Injured 130.\n  The financial damage is estimated in the billions.\n  Simply put: This was a major disaster.\n  It was not the first. Southern California suffered similar wildfire \nlosses just 4 years ago.\n  We must face the fact that catastrophic wildfires are in California's \nfuture, and the future of other states.\n  California is tinder-dry. Global warming is real, leading to extended \ndroughts and longer fire seasons.\n  Fires are larger, and they burn hotter and with more intensity.\n  More and more people are living in areas at high risk of wildfire. \nThere are more than 5 million homes in California alone in this high-\nthreat ``wildland-urban interface.''\n  Across the rest of the country, there are nearly 40 million more \nhomes in the wildland-urban interface.\n  So the question comes: What can be done?\n  There is no doubt that we cannot fully eliminate wildfires.\n  But I believe we can take steps now to better protect communities, to \nimprove firefighting capabilities, and to improve relief and recovery \naid.\n  The four bills introduced today will get this process started. They \nare the Fire Safe Community Act, which would establish new incentives \nfor communities at risk of wildfires to adopt a new model Fire Safe \nordinance; the Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act, to make sure \nthat qualified individuals, displaced by major disasters, can make \ntheir mortgage and rental payments; the Disaster Rebuilding Assistance \nAct, to increase the amount of Federal dollars available to homeowners \nwhose rebuilding costs outstrip their insurance coverage; and the \nManaging Arson Through Criminal History, MATCH, Act, requiring states \nto create registries of convicted arsonists.\n  Let me go into greater detail on each of these bills.\n\n\n                        Fire Safe Community Act\n\n  This bill will help protect our communities from the catastrophic \neffects of wildfires.\n  Most importantly, it does three key things: it instructs the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology to develop a model ordinance that \nwill serve as a baseline for communities seeking to protect their homes \nand property from wildfire; it encourages local participation by \nallowing for greater Federal reimbursement of firefighting costs in \ncommunities that adopt the model ordinance; and it creates a grant \nprogram to encourage responsible development practices that meet model \nguidelines in the wildland-urban interface.\n  In effect, the Federal Government would become the partner to local \ngovernments as they seek to make their communities fire-safe.\n  As I have said, we can never stop wildfires. But we can take \nimportant\n\n[[Page S14629]]\n\nsteps to make these fires less destructive.\n  This bill starts with the first step of creating a model ``Fire \nSafe'' ordinance--with clear, unambiguous language that sets a national \nstandard for how to address all aspects of fire threat.\n  The National Institute of Standards and Technology would provide this \nstandard guideline for communities, in conjunction with the U.S. Forest \nService, the Bureau of Land Management, and the U.S. Fire \nAdministration.\n  States are also encouraged to adopt model ordinances tailored to the \nneeds of their own communities for fire-safe development.\n  These guidelines will address water supply, construction materials \nand techniques, defensible space, vegetation management, and \ninfrastructure standards.\n  The next step is to put this model ordinance to use.\n  The bill authorizes a $25 million per year grant program, \nadministered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Office of \nGrants and Training.\n  It will help communities implement these standards, and bring the \nsafest development practices to their neighborhoods.\n  This grant program will be available to local governments located in \nthe wildlife-urban interface, and to high-threat regions that have \nadopted--or plan to adopt--the model ordinance.\n  They will have the option of adopting either the federal model \nordinance, or one produced by their own state.\n  As further incentive, this bill would improve Fire Management \nAssistance Grants to communities adopting a model ordinance.\n  Today under the Fire Management Assistance Grant program, the Federal \nGovernment covers 75 percent of the cost of fighting wildfires.\n  Under this bill, communities adopting a model ordinance would be \neligible for federal reimbursement of up to 90 percent of their \nfirefighting costs.\n  The Fire Safe Community Act will also make grants available to States \nto help them compile their own fire maps.\n  The mapping grants will be matched 50-50 by State funds, and will \nencourage development of comprehensive fire hazard maps that indicate \nthe exact locations of high-threat fire areas.\n  This vital information will aid firefighting efforts at all levels.\n  It's important to note that the model ordinances at the core of this \nbill are not mandatory--they would provide voluntary guidelines that \ncommunities can adopt, or not.\n  It does not step on the toes of local government. Rather, it would \nhelp all of us reach a common goal.\n  I come from local government--I'm 9 years a mayor, 9 years a county \nsupervisor--and I recognize that zoning is the province of local \ngovernment.\n  But we have a real problem here: We know that development in the \nwildland-urban interface is accelerating, making fires more costly.\n  So we need to take steps to improve fire safety in these areas.\n  This bill is an important step toward becoming better prepared.\n  Now I want to discuss two bills intended to improve recovery aid \nafter disaster strikes.\n\n\n                Mortgage and Rental Disaster Relief Act\n\n  This bill will provide much-needed relief to families hit hard by \ndisaster--including people displaced by the recent fires.\n  It would authorize FEMA to make mortgage and rental assistance \navailable for qualified individuals in communities designated by the \nPresident as disaster areas.\n  It is based on an important point: While catastrophic wildfires and \nother disasters can destroy homes, they don't relieve people of the \nfinancial obligations that come with home ownership or lease \nagreements.\n  In most cases, these payments must still be made, even if the \nresidence has been wiped out.\n  This burden is too much for many families. They incur additional \nexpenses--such as hotel or lodging costs--that come with being \ndisplaced following a major disaster.\n  FEMA used to provide mortgage and rental assistance. But it was \neliminated by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000.\n  This bill would reauthorize the program, and make several changes to \nensure that assistance is provided only to those most in need.\n  First, to qualify for assistance applicants must demonstrate that \nthey face significant economic hardships and suffered disaster-related \nincome loss.\n  The disaster-related income loss must fit into one of the following \ncategories: Your employer, or your own business, must be located in the \narea declared a major disaster by the President; you lose your job \nbecause your employer or business has a significant business \nrelationship with a company located within the Presidentially declared \ndisaster area; or you live in a Presidentially declared disaster area, \nand have suffered financially due to travel restrictions and road \nclosures post-disaster.\n  To qualify for this aid, applicants must also provide proof that \ntheir employment was discontinued as a result of disaster.\n  They must also show imminent delinquency, eviction, dispossession, or \nforeclosure.\n  Finally, this assistance is available only for up to 18 months, and \nis subject to income caps.\n  Only households with adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or less, in \nhigh-cost States such as California, would be eligible.\n  Households in lower-cost States could be eligible if their annual \nadjusted gross incomes do not exceed $75,000.\n\n\n                   disaster rebuilding assistance act\n\n  This second disaster relief bill would increase the amount of money \nFEMA can provide--for rebuilding and temporary housing--in high-cost \nStates such as California.\n  It is designed to help disaster victims whose rebuilding costs exceed \ntheir insurance coverage.\n  Sadly, many Californians hit by the wildfires are now learning that \ntheir insurance coverage was insufficient.\n  This is a real problem in California; in fact, California Insurance \nCommissioner Steve Poizner estimates that as many as 25 percent of the \nvictims of the recent fires may be underinsured.\n  Let me be clear: This bill will not cover the full costs of \nrebuilding.\n  But it will help close the gap, for qualified households in areas \ndeclared by the President to be disaster areas.\n  Today, FEMA can provide up to roughly $28,000 to individuals and \nhouseholds whose rebuilding costs exceed their insurance coverage.\n  This assistance can be used for rebuilding costs, as well as \ntemporary housing.\n  This bill would increase this amount to $50,000.\n  The legislation also gives the President the discretion to increase \nthis cap, if necessary, to cover rebuilding expenses in high-cost \nStates.\n  I believe this bill will provide an important step toward giving \nAmericans the chance they need to rebuild their lives after suffering \nthrough a major disaster.\n  The last bill in this package takes aim at criminal arsonists.\n\n\n              managing arson through criminal history act\n\n  This bill--also known as the MATCH Act--is the Senate version of a \nbill introduced in the House by California Representatives Mary Bono \nand Adam Schiff.\n  It would establish Federal and State arson registries; require \nconvicted arsonists to register and update certain specified \ninformation for 5 years after a first conviction, 10 years after a \nsecond conviction, and for life after a third conviction; and authorize \ngrants and incentives so that these registries will be operational \nwithin 3 years.\n  It is important that we improve our ability to keep track of \narsonists, because it is clear that some of these recent wildfires were \nno accident.\n  The Santiago Fire in Orange County--which burned at least 27,000 \nacres--has officially been declared an arson fire.\n  Would-be arsonists tried to start new fires as the wildfires raged.\n  In San Diego County, authorities arrested an adult and a juvenile \nsuspected of starting a blaze in Vista.\n  In San Bernardino, a suspect was charged with setting a brush fire \nnear Victorville.\n  There were several arson-related arrests in Los Angeles County--one \nsuspect died in a gunfight with police.\n  The arsonist who started the Santiago fire remains at-large.\n  There is a reward--it now stands at $250,000--but law-enforcement \nofficials\n\n[[Page S14630]]\n\nsay an arrest will likely depend on a tip from the public.\n  It does not have to be that way.\n  This bill would give fire investigators and law-enforcement officials \nup-to-date information on potential arsonists.\n  This is common-sense legislation. It will provide a readily \naccessible database, and help investigators rule out persons of \ninterest and zero in on arson suspects.\n  We owe it to our brave firefighters to give fire investigators this \nimportant new tool, so they can help bring arsonists to justice.\n  Catastrophic wildfires are not going away. In fact, the evidence \nstrongly suggests they will occur with greater frequency and ferocity.\n  But we can take important steps--now--to make our communities safer.\n  To strengthen our firefighting capabilities.\n  To ensure that more relief and recovery aid is provided to victims, \nso they can get back on their feet as soon as possible.\n  These bills are not a panacea. But they are an important first step. \nI urge my colleagues to vote for them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 2391. A bill to provide for affordable housing relief, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED Mr. President, today I introduce the Government Sponsored \nEnterprise Mission Improvement Act of 2007. This bill would amend the \nHousing and Community Development Act of 1992 to dramatically \nstrengthen the affordable housing mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac. I believe that deepening Fannie and Freddie's responsibilities \ntowards affordable housing must be a part of any type of GSE reform \nthat we undertake in the Senate.\n  The problems caused by the shortage in affordable housing are well \npublicized. But the impact of the shortage, which most commonly affects \nthose near the bottom of the income scale, receives less attention. \nWorse, there is currently no Federal housing program that increases the \nsupply of housing affordable to those with the most severe needs. The \nbill I am introducing today, the Government Sponsored Enterprise \nMission Improvement Act, would provide $500 to $900 million per year in \nfunding to help those with worst case housing needs.\n  Across the U.S., the 17 million renters and owners with lowest \nincomes have by far the most critical housing problems. About three-\nfifths of renters and owners with incomes below 30 percent of area \nmedian income pay more than half of their meager incomes for housing.\n  Families must pay such excessive amounts because there are too few \naffordable units. Nationally, according to HUD's analysis of 2005 \nAmerican Housing Survey data, there were 10 million renters with \nincomes below 30 percent of area median income in 2005, but only 6.7 \nmillion units with rents affordable to those with such incomes.\n  This bill I am introducing today would require Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac to set aside 4.2 basis points on each dollar of unpaid principle \nbalance of total new business purchases for an Affordable Housing \nProgram.\n  Sixty-five percent of this set-aside would go towards an Affordable \nHousing Block Grant Program. This program would be managed by the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development and in the first year after \nenactment, would be allocated to the states by formula grant to help \naddress the current subprime mortgage crisis. These grants could be \nused to facilitate loan modification and refinance options for low- and \nmoderate-income borrowers facing foreclosure. Some of the funding could \nalso be used to help low- and moderate-income homebuyers purchase \nproperties that have been foreclosed upon to help stabilize \nneighborhoods.\n  After 2008, the funding would be distributed by formula grants to the \nstates for the development, construction, and preservation of housing \nfor very low- and extremely low-income families. This funding would \ncomplement other Federal and State programs, such as the HOME \nInvestment Partnerships and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit programs, to \nbring down costs enough to primarily target the income group most \nneeding housing that is truly affordable to them, extremely low-income \nrenters.\n  The other 35 percent of this set-aside would be allocated for a \nCapital Magnet Fund managed by the Secretary of the Treasury. This \nfunding would go out through competitive grants for financial \nactivities that leverage affordable housing development, construction \nand preservation for low-, very low-, and extremely low-income \nfamilies. It could also be used for economic development activities or \ncommunity service facilities, such as day care centers and health care \nclinics, that in conjunction with affordable housing activities \nimplement a concerted strategy to stabilize or revitalize a low-income \ncommunity or underserved rural area.\n  The Government Sponsored Enterprise Mission Improvement Act also \nwould strengthen Fannie and Freddie's Affordable Housing Goals. In \nparticular, it would align their goals with current Community \nReinvestment Act income targeting definitions, which I believe should \nhelp the lower end of the conventional market become more liquid.\n  Finally, this legislation would create a new statutory duty for \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac to serve ``underserved markets'' that lack \nadequate credit through conventional lending sources such as \nManufactured Housing; Affordable Housing Preservation; Subprime \nBorrowers; Community Development Financial Institutions; and Rural \nHousing. I give teeth to this provision by making compliance with this \nduty subject to Section 1336 enforcement provisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and to help make \nit an integral part of any GSE reform that is taken up by the Senate. \nThis bill makes it clear that with Fannie and Freddie's Government \nbenefits come many important responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2391\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify, modernize, and improve public notice of and access to tax \nlien information by providing for a national, Internet accessible, \nfiling system for Federal tax liens, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Good \nGovernment Contractor Act of 2007.\n  This legislation represents my continuing efforts targeting federal \ncontractors with tax debt. For several years, as Chair and now as \nRanking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I have \nled a bipartisan Subcommittee effort, with the assistance of the \nGovernment Accountability Office, that has uncovered tens of thousands \nof deadbeat civilian and defense contractors.\n  What we are dealing with here are not everyday tax delinquents, but \nrather federal contractors who do not pay their fair share of taxes--\ndespite receiving billions of dollars from American taxpayers each \nyear. So far, since PSI began this effort, we have learned that 27,000 \nFederal contractors at the Department of Defense owed about $3 billion \nin unpaid taxes; 33,000 Federal contractors at civilian agencies owed \nback taxes amounting to $3.3 billion; 3,800 Federal contractors who \ncontract with the General Services Administration owe back taxes amount \nto $1.4 billion.\n  These contractors are not just cheating the American taxpayer but in \nmany cases cheating their own employees by using payroll taxes for \ntheir business or personal use. The Subcommittee has learned of \ncontractors who have bought luxury cars, boats, and multi-million \ndollar properties, even though they owed hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in unpaid taxes.\n  At the end of the day, these contractors are not only shifting the \nburden to honest taxpayers but also depriving the Treasury of funds \nthat could be used to address critical priorities from education to \nhealth care to the fight against terrorism. Accordingly, as part of my \non-going effort to safeguard the interest of the American taxpayer and \nhonest federal contractors, I am introducing legislation to better \ntarget tax cheating contractors.\n  More specifically, my legislation will amend the Federal Acquisition \nRegulations to consider a responsible contractor as one without any tax \ndebt; require the Department of Defense, GSA and NASA to issue a final \nrule relating to tax delinquency; establish a national electronic tax \nlien filing system; create a Federal tax conviction database for the \npurposes of verifying contractor tax information; and establish as \ncause for debarment or suspension for knowingly making false statements \nregarding Federal tax information or prior convictions or civil \njudgments for Federal tax evasion or other Federal Tax offenses.\n  My bill will also repeal the indiscriminant three percent tax \nwithholding requirement on all contractors, something which the vast \nmajority of responsible, tax-paying government contractors, as well as \nState and local units of government, will appreciate. Last year, \nCongress passed into law a well-intentioned but highly problematic \nmeasure establishing a three percent withholding tax on all government \ncontractors. Section 511 of the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005 will impose a 3 percent withholding tax on \nFederal, State and local payments for goods and services beginning in \n2011, except for local governments with annual spending of less than \n$100 million for goods and services. While this measure will obviously \ncapture the bad apples, it unfortunately will also hit honest \ncontractors--some of whose business livelihoods could well be \njeopardized as a result. Another serious side effect will be the \nadministrative burden on State and local governments, which could \nultimately heighten the cost of doing business in a much larger sense.\n  Rather than this broad and cumbersome approach, my Good Government \nContractor Act of 2007 will replace the blanket three percent \nwithholding requirement with measures focused on just the bad actors. \nIn closing, my bill will protect taxpayers, State and local \ngovernments, and law-abiding government contractors by holding deadbeat \ncontractors accountable in a strict but fair way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an adoption process improvement pilot \nprogram; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce legislation \nin honor of National Adoption Day that will address the needs of \nchildren waiting to be adopted from our Nation's foster care system. \nThese are children who are unable to return home to their natural \nparents and are in need of permanent, loving, adoptive homes. In recent \nyears, Congress has acted to implement supports for this population by \ncreating programs that allow states to pursue creative and innovative \nmethods for increasing foster care adoptions. However, today, tens of \nthousands of children are still waiting for families. There is still \nmore work to be done.\n  According to current federal estimates, there are 114,000 children in \nfoster care with the goal of adoption. Of these, only 13 percent are \nliving in a pre-adoptive home. Moreover, each year in the public child \nwelfare system, more children are made eligible for adoption than find \npermanent adoptive homes. For example, in fiscal year 2005--the most \nrecent year for which statistics are available--states finalized 15,000 \nmore terminations of parental rights than adoptions. Taken together, \nthese statistics describe a tremendous pool of children lingering in \nfoster care, waiting for a ``forever family.'' We know the longer \nchildren languish in foster care, the more they are at risk for \ndeveloping a range of psychological, behavioral, and educational \nproblems. Therefore, permanence for these children is essential.\n  Child welfare professionals across the country lament a lack of \nadoptive families for children in foster care. However, an untapped \nresource exists. A recent study conducted by the Evan B. Donaldson \nAdoption Institute in collaboration with Harvard University and the \nUrban Institute notes that, in a given year, 240,000 people will call \nfor information about adopting a child from foster care, but only a \nfraction will see the process through to adoption. This research states \nthat prospective parents are often alienated from the adoption process \nat an early stage; these individuals experience unpleasant initial \ncontacts and report difficulty in navigating the adoption process. Out \nof frustration, they abandon their pursuit of bringing a foster child \npermanently into their home.\n\n[[Page S14642]]\n\n  Therefore, I am pleased to introduce the Adoption Improvement Act of \n2007. This legislation establishes funding for a demonstration project \naimed at reducing the attrition of prospective parents from the \nadoption process. Participating states will implement a rigorous \nprogram that strengthens the first contact prospective adopters have \nwhen they make that critical, initial inquiry into adopting a child. \nThe bill calls on programs to include a specialized adoption hotline; \nhire employees who are trained to respond to callers' requests \nsensitively and efficiently; and incorporate the input of parents who \nhave already adopted children from foster care. In addition, programs \nwill provide explicit information to parents about how to make their \nway through the various adoption procedures; describe the rewards and \nchallenges of the adoption process; and establish a buddy system that \npartners prospective parents with those who have already adopted foster \nchildren successfully. Finally, all agencies in the demonstration \nproject will participate in a thorough program evaluation.\n\n  This month is National Adoption Month, and tomorrow, November 17, \n2007, is National Adoption Day--a day to celebrate the families that \nhave already been joined through adoption, and to call attention to the \nthousands of children still waiting for permanent homes. I am delighted \nto join Senators Landrieu and Coleman in their forthcoming resolution \nacknowledging the importance of National Adoption Month and National \nAdoption Day. I encourage my colleagues in Congress to take the \nmessages of this resolution and my bill with them, beyond just this \nNovember, into the future.\n  The national data compel us to take action. Too many children in our \nNation's foster care system are in desperate need of stable, loving \nhomes, and there are thousands of potential parents out there yearning \nto provide them. I would like to thank my colleague Senator Rockefeller \nfor joining me in this important effort. Please join me in bringing \nthese groups together so that children in foster care can find the \nfamilies they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 2396. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nmodernize the quality improvement organization (QIO) program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I join with Senators Rockefeller, \nLott, and Kennedy to introduce the Medicare Quality Improvement \nModernization Act of 2007, S. 2396.\n  As background for my colleagues, Medicare's Quality Improvement \nOrganization, QIO, program has been in existence for 35 years. The \nprogram's intent has always been to assure that Medicare's \nbeneficiaries receive high quality medical care. The program has \nundergone a steady evolution. What began as a program that called \nattention to hospitals and physicians whose care deviated from the \nnorms of medical practice has morphed into one that seeks to help \nphysicians, hospitals, nursing homes and other providers develop \nsystems to improve their quality of care.\n  The program has changed as the definition of quality changed. When \nMedicare's peer review program was initiated, high quality care for a \nMedicare beneficiary was simply not to be among the unfortunate few \nwhose medical care deviated from the norms of local medical practice. \nFortunate for them, however, quality today is the routine adherence of \nproviders to nationally accepted standards of care.\n  The legislative changes we propose for the QIO program reflects an \never-advancing definition of quality medical care and a focus on \nhelping providers obtain it.\n  The QIO program has three functions. First, the program reviews the \nmedical care of beneficiaries who have complaints about their care and \nprovides the beneficiaries opinions. Second, the program supports \nintensive work with practitioners, nursing homes, managed care plans \nand hospitals to develop delivery systems that improve the quality of \ntheir care. Third the program publicly reports system-level performance \nmeasures.\n  The bill I introduce today is faithful to the results of a \ncongressionally-mandated review of the QIO program reported in \nFebruary, 2006. In that review, the IOM concluded ``The QIO program \nprovides a potentially valuable nationwide infrastructure dedicated to \npromoting quality health care.'' For example, the QIO program is \nresponsible for a substantial part of the National Healthcare Quality \nReport published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.\n  The IOM report called for changes in the QIO program. Its principal \nfindings and recommendations were that the local QIO boards are heavily \nphysician-dominated with little consumer representation. Existing \nlegislation requires specific levels of physician involvement, an \noutmoded board structure.\n  Also, the QIO functions should be harmonized with other federal \nquality Initiatives.\n  It found that the QIOs were ``. . . restricted from contracting with \nhealth care providers in its state for technical assistance or review \nservices similar to those covered by its core Medicare contract.'' The \nIOM committee concluded that QIOs would be able to serve more providers \nand expand their function beyond Medicare beneficiaries to the \nentire healthcare system if they could contract for services to \nsupplement their CMS funds.\n\n  The Committee also recommended removal of restrictions on public \naccess to the QIO's findings. For instance, beneficiaries have been \nunable to review the results of investigations that they requested.\n  The IOM recommended that beneficiary reviews be removed from the \nlocal QIOs.\n  The IOM committee concluded that Congress and the secretary of DHHS \nand CMS should improve program management by enhancing the contracting \nprocess and improving communication with the QIOs.\n  The legislation I propose seeks to strengthen the QIO's \ninfrastructure to fit with an ever-tightening standard of quality in \nmedicine, believing that doctors and hospitals want to do the right \nthing but also that patients should have their say.\n  Many of the changes recommended by the Institute of Medicine's \nexperts and accepted by the experts at CMS do not require statutory \nchange, but some do. Some program modifications are sufficiently \ncritical to Medicare's beneficiaries, that while statutory language may \nnot be required to affect them, a Congressional mandate is needed to \nassure them.\n  First, the Quality Improvement Organization Modernization Act of 2007 \nspecifies that the Quality Improvement Organizations offer education, \ninstruction, and technical assistance to providers, practitioners, and \nMedicare Advantage plans. It incorporates plans and providers in urban, \nrural, and frontier areas and providers that treat racial and ethnic \nminorities.\n  Second, our bill strengthens the review process for individual \nMedicare beneficiaries. The QIOs must actively educate beneficiaries of \ntheir right to bring any concerns to the QIOs. The QIOs must work with \nproviders who are reviewed to correct deficiencies where they exist and \nto improve communication with patients where they do not.\n  The bill specifies that the findings of the review must be disclosed \nto the beneficiary requesting the review but not before giving the \nprovider an opportunity to respond to the findings. The review \nfunctions are left with the local QIOs and not delegated to other \nentities to perform.\n  The bill specifies that the findings of reviews may not be used in \nmedical malpractice litigation, otherwise the QIOs would serve more to \nscreen cases for litigation than they would to improve the quality of \ncare.\n  Third, in order to be certain that the QIOs are appropriately judging \nthe severity of the errors they find and appropriately recommending \nsanctions to the Secretary, the Office of Inspector General will \ncontract for an audit of 10 percent of one year's QIO reviews during \neach 5-year contract period.\n  Fourth, program administration is strengthened and its goals focused. \nThe program's scope of work must incorporate the priorities of local \nstakeholders.\n  A strategic advisory committee will advise the Secretary on program \ngoals, on program performance, and on harmonization of the QIO's \nquality functions with other federal and non-federal quality \ninitiatives.\n\n[[Page S14643]]\n\n  The GAO is instructed to report on implementation of program changes \n1 year after the first 5-year contract period following enactment of \nthis legislation. The adequacy of funding allocated to the QIOs for \nlocal initiatives has been in dispute among the QIOs. Congress is to \nreceive an independent report about the adequacy of QIO financing \nbefore the initiation of each contract period.\n  The contracting process is strengthened by mandating timely \ncontracting with the QIOs by CMS and by lengthening the contract period \nfrom 3 to 5 years. All QIOs must bid competitively every 5 years.\n  Fifth, local boards have been physician-dominated with little \nconsumer representation. Our bill eliminates the requirement that QIOs \nmust be physician sponsored organizations. Our bill improves local QIO \naccountability by strengthening the authority of the Secretary over \nboard structure and function. It authorizes the Secretary to ensure \nthat non-physician quality experts and qualified consumers are given \nappropriate representation on state QIO boards. It authorizes the \nSecretary to ensure that the board structure is appropriate, that the \ncompensation of board members and executives is market-based and that \nconflict of interest among board members is mitigated.\n  Sixth, as the QIOs focus more of their energies on working with \nproviders to improve quality the demand for their services in this \nendeavor exceed their resources. For example, the number of doctors \nrequesting help from the Utah QIO in selecting information technology \nfor their offices far exceeds the resources available to it from its \nCMS contract.\n  Our bill allows a QIO to contract with a provider or organization if \nit meets one of several requirements. Among them are that the QIO must \nreceive no more than 5 percent of its revenue from a single provider or \norganization, or if the contracting organization is subject to review \nby the QIO, conflict of interest must be mitigated by using an out-of-\nstate QIO to perform the reviews that the local QIO would otherwise \nperform.\n  The QIO program differs from other Federal health care quality \nprograms in that it does not just measure quality; it works with \nproviders to attain it. The Medicare Quality Improvement Organization \nAct of 2007 strengthens the rights of beneficiaries, strengthens the \nadministration of the program and the contracting process, provides for \nmore accountability of contractors, and focuses the program on creating \nquality systems.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in strengthening the QIO \nprogram. It is one of the cornerstones of the quality initiative not \njust for Medicare but for all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S.J.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in introducing a resolution \nin support of the designation of a week as National Cardiopulmonary \nResuscitation and Automated External Defibrillator Awareness Week.\n  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in this country. \nApproximately 325,000 of the 450,000 coronary heart disease deaths that \noccur annually in the U.S. are due to sudden cardiac arrest suffered \noutside of the hospital or in hospital emergency departments. About 80 \npercent of the out-of-hospital cardiac arrests happen at home, so being \nproperly trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation--or CPR--can mean the \ndifference between life and death for a loved one.\n  Sudden cardiac arrest in adults is most often caused by an abnormal \nheart rhythm. While approximately 95 percent of sudden cardiac arrest \nvictims die before reaching the hospital, death from sudden cardiac \narrest is not inevitable. Prompt delivery of CPR can more than double \nan individual's chance of survival by helping to maintain vital blood \nflow to the heart and brain, increasing the window of opportunity in \nwhich an electric shock from an automated external defibrillator--or \nAED--can be effective.\n  AEDs are easy-to-use, computerized devices that can shock a heart \nback into normal rhythm and restore life to a cardiac arrest victim. \nEven when used by an untrained bystander, AEDs are safe and can be \nhighly effective in restoring a normal heart rhythm. They must, \nhowever, be used promptly. For every minute that passes before a \nvictim's normal heart rhythm is restored, his or her chance of survival \nfalls by as much as 10 percent.\n  In 2000, Senator Feingold and I introduced the Rural AED Act to \nincrease access to AEDs for small towns and rural communities where \nthose first on the scene may not be paramedics or others who would \nnormally have AEDs. The Rural AED Act was subsequently signed into law \nand, since its passage, has provided rural communities with more than \n$40 million to purchase AEDs. This has greatly increased access to \nthese life-saving devices.\n  Now it is time to take another step. Increasing the number of \nAmericans who are trained in CPR and AED use will help us to \ndramatically improve sudden cardiac arrest survival rates. The \ndesignation of a week as National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and \nAutomated External Defibrillator Awareness Week will complement the \ncampaigns that the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross, \nand the National Safety Council are preparing to increase public \ntraining in CPR and AED use and to increase public access to AEDs. I \ntherefore urge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14645-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 55--COMMEMORATING THE CENTENNIAL \n    ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAILING OF THE NAVY'S ``GREAT WHITE FLEET'', \n  LAUNCHED BY PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT ON DECEMBER 16, 1907, FROM \n   HAMPTON ROADS, VIRGINIA, AND RETURNING THERE ON FEBRUARY 22, 1909\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Webb) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I am pleased that we can take a break from \nthe tired, partisan sniping from the other side of the aisle. With the \nconsideration of this nomination the Senate continues making progress \nconfirming judicial nominations. The complaints we hear more and more \nloudly as we approach an election year ring hollow.\n  The Judiciary Committee has now reached a milestone by agreeing to \nreport 40 nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench \nthis year. That exceeds the totals reported in each of the previous 2 \nyears, when a Republican-led Judiciary Committee was considering this \nPresident's nominees.\n  Today we consider one of the nominations reported this week. Reed \nCharles O'Connor has been nominated to fill a vacancy in the Northern \nDistrict of Texas. Reed is well known to many of us on the Judiciary \nCommittee as he has been on detail for the last two years to serve as \nSenator Cornyn's counsel on the committee and before that with the \nRepublican staff of the committee. Before that, Reed spent a year on \ndetail with the general counsel's office of the Executive Office of \nUnited States Attorneys. With his confirmation, Reed will return home \nto Texas, where he previously served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for \nthe Northern District of Texas and before that as an Assistant District \nAttorney in Tarrant County District Attorney's Office in Fort Worth. \nBorn in Houston, Reed graduated from the University of Houston in 1986 \nand the South Texas College of Law in 1989.\n  I thank Senator Cornyn and Senator Hutchison for their consideration \nof this nomination and Senator Whitehouse for chairing his confirmation \nhearing.\n  When we confirm the nomination we consider today, the Senate will \nhave confirmed 36 nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal \nbench this session alone. That is more than the total number of \njudicial nominations that a Republican-led Senate confirmed in all of \n1997, 1999, 2004, 2005 or 2006. It is 19 more confirmations than were \nachieved during the entire 1996 session, more than double that \nsession's total of 17, when Republicans stalled consideration of \nPresident Clinton's nominations.\n  When this nomination is confirmed, the Senate will have confirmed 136 \ntotal Federal judicial nominees in my tenure as Judiciary chairman. \nDuring the Bush Presidency, more circuit judges, more district judges--\nmore total judges--were confirmed in the first 24 months that I served \nas Judiciary chairman than during the 2-year tenures of either of the \ntwo Republican chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities.\n  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts will list 46 judicial \nvacancies and 14 circuit court vacancies after today's confirmation. \nCompare that to the numbers at the end of the 109th Congress, when the \ntotal vacancies under a Republican controlled Judiciary Committee were \n51 judicial vacancies and 15 circuit court vacancies. That means that \ndespite the additional vacancies that arose at the beginning of the \n110th Congress and throughout the year, the current vacancy totals \nunder my chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee are below where they \nwere under a Republican led-Judiciary Committee. They are about half \nwhat they were at the end of President Clinton's term, when Republican \npocket filibusters allowed judicial vacancies to rise to top 100 before \nbeing left at 80, 26 of them for circuit courts.\n  This week, while the White House was complaining about nominations, I \nwas sending a letter to the President urging him to work with me, \nSenator Specter, and home State Senators to send us more well-\nqualified, consensus nominations. Now is the time for him to send us \nmore nominations that could be considered and confirmed as his \npresidency approaches its last year, before the Thurmond Rule kicks in.\n  As I noted in that letter, I have been concerned that several recent \nnominations seem to be part of an effort to pick political fights \nrather than judges to fill vacancies. For example, President Bush \nnominated Duncan Getchell to one of Virginia's Fourth Circuit vacancies \nover the objections of Senator Webb, a Democrat, and Senator Warner, a \nRepublican. They had submitted a list of five recommended nominations, \nand specifically warned the White House not to nominate Mr. Getchell.\n  When the President consults and sends well-qualified, consensus \nnominations, we can work together and continue to make progress as we \nare today.\n  I congratulate Reed and his family on his confirmation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14655-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 55\n\n       Whereas the launching of the Great White Fleet marked the \n     emergence of the United States as a true global seapower, \n     able to dispatch 16 new battleships on a worldwide deployment \n     for 14 months;\n       Whereas these battleships were painted entirely white, with \n     gilded scrollwork on their bows, and subsequently came to be \n     known as the ``Great White Fleet'';\n       Whereas the 4 squadrons of 4 battleships each, manned by \n     14,000 sailors, sailed 43,000 miles and made 20 port calls on \n     6 continents;\n       Whereas the Fleet, in conducting visits to important \n     nations such as Australia, served to reinforce a friendship \n     and partnership that continues to this day;\n       Whereas the Fleet, in providing a tangible demonstration of \n     the forward naval presence of the United States in the \n     Pacific, also reinforced the message of how important \n     maritime stability and security are to the United States;\n       Whereas the Fleet, in response to one of the worst natural \n     disasters in European history, was able to immediately divert \n     to Messina, Sicily, to offer humanitarian aid to the Italian \n     people; and\n       Whereas the Fleet, in executing a range of missions and \n     returning to the United States after 14 months at sea, \n     displayed to the world a number of core American values, \n     including compassion, showed its flexibility by responding to \n     unforeseen events, and demonstrated the ability of the United \n     States to project maritime power as a stabilizing force: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) commemorates the wisdom of President Theodore Roosevelt \n     in developing and launching the Great White Fleet;\n       (2) supports a one-time designation of a day to celebrate \n     the 100th centennial of the Great White Fleet and the special \n     role the Fleet played in building enduring friendships with \n     important allies and partner nations;\n       (3) commends efforts by the Department of the Navy to \n     maintain and strengthen our cooperative partnerships with \n     foreign nations and to safeguard our Nation's interests in \n     the maritime domain;\n       (4) commends efforts by the Department of the Navy in \n     leading the development of a Cooperative Strategy for 21st \n     Century Seapower; and\n       (5) honors the sacrifices made and services rendered by the \n     servicemembers of the Navy, Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard \n     and the civilians who constitute our maritime services.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14660-1", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENCOURAGING PEACEFUL TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY IN BURMA\n\n  Mr. WEBB.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Res. 56\n\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of citizens of Burma have \n     risked their lives in demonstrations to demand a return to \n     democracy and respect for human rights in their country;\n       Whereas the repressive military Government of Burma has \n     conducted a brutal crackdown against demonstrators, which has \n     resulted in mass numbers of killings, arrests, and \n     detentions;\n       Whereas Burma has been a member of the Association of \n     Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) since 1997;\n       Whereas foreign ministers of other ASEAN member nations, in \n     reference to Burma, have ``demanded that the government \n     immediately desist from the use of violence against \n     demonstrators'', expressed ``revulsion'' over reports that \n     demonstrators were being suppressed by violent and deadly \n     force, and called for ``the release of all political \n     detainees including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi'';\n       Whereas the foreign ministers of ASEAN member nations have \n     expressed concern that developments in Burma ``had a serious \n     impact on the reputation and credibility of ASEAN'';\n       Whereas Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations (UN) Special \n     Envoy to Burma, has called on the member nations of ASEAN to \n     take additional steps on the Burma issue, saying, ``Not just \n     Thailand but all the countries that I am visiting, India, \n     China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the UN, we could do more'';\n       Whereas the ASEAN Security Community Plan of Action adopted \n     October 7, 2003, at the ASEAN Summit in Bali states that \n     ASEAN members ``shall promote political development . . . to \n     achieve peace, stability, democracy, and prosperity in the \n     region'', and specifically says that ``ASEAN Member Countries \n     shall not condone unconstitutional and undemocratic changes \n     of government'';\n       Whereas the Government of Singapore, as the current Chair \n     of ASEAN, will host ASEAN's regional summit in November 2007 \n     to approve ASEAN's new charter;\n       Whereas the current Foreign Minister of Singapore, George \n     Yeo, has publicly expressed, ``For some time now, we had \n     stopped trying to defend Myanmar internationally because it \n     became no longer credible'';\n       Whereas, according to the chairman of the High Level Task \n     Force charged with drafting the new ASEAN Charter, the \n     Charter ``will make ASEAN a more rules-based organization and \n     . . . will put in place a system of compliance monitoring \n     and, most importantly, a system of compulsory dispute \n     settlement for noncompliance that will apply to all ASEAN \n     agreements'';\n       Whereas upon its accession to ASEAN, Burma agreed to \n     subscribe or accede to all ASEAN declarations, treaties, and \n     agreements;\n       Whereas 2007 marks the 30th anniversary of the relationship \n     and dialogue between the United States and ASEAN;\n       Whereas the Senate passed legislation in the 109th Congress \n     that would authorize the establishment of the position of \n     United States Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs, and the President \n     announced in 2007 that an Ambassador would be appointed; and\n       Whereas ASEAN member nations and the United States share \n     common concerns across a broad range of issues, including \n     accelerated economic growth, social progress, cultural \n     development, and peace and stability in the Southeast Asia \n     region: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) joins the foreign ministers of member nations of the \n     Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that have \n     expressed concern over the human rights situation in Burma;\n       (2) encourages ASEAN to take more substantial steps to \n     ensure a peaceful transition to democracy in Burma;\n       (3) welcomes steps by ASEAN to strengthen its internal \n     governance through the adoption of a formal ASEAN charter;\n       (4) urges ASEAN to ensure that all member nations live up \n     to their membership obligations and adhere to ASEAN's core \n     principles, including respect for and commitment to human \n     rights; and\n       (5) would welcome a decision by ASEAN, consistent with its \n     core documents and its new charter, to review Burma's \n     membership in ASEAN and to consider appropriate disciplinary \n     measures, including suspension, until such time as the \n     Government of Burma has demonstrated an improved respect for \n     and commitment to human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/11/16/senate-section/article/S14660-2", "month": "11", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14660-S14661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 3703, H.R. 3997\n\n  Mr. WEBB.
