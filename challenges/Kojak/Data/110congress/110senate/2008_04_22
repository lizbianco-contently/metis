Mr. President, yesterday I spoke on the floor indicating \nthat I thought it was really too bad that the Republicans held up \nanother bill, this one dealing with veterans health benefits. We have \nhundreds of thousands of veterans returning from Iraq. Twenty percent \nof them have severe problems as a result of post-traumatic stress \nsyndrome, many of them caused by those terrifying explosions over there \nthat occur all the time, around them and to them. We have 150,000 men \nand women now in Iraq serving our country bravely.\n  The veterans' benefits legislation was reported out of the committee \n9 months ago, and we have been trying to get permission from the \nRepublicans to bring it to the floor, and they have refused. It expands \neligibility for traumatic injury insurance; extends eligibility for \nadapted housing for those who have been severely burned; it increases \nbenefits for veterans pursuing apprenticeships or on-job training \nprograms; and 80 other provisions that are very important. But we \nlearned yesterday from the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee that the reason they have held this bill up and intend to \ncontinue holding it up is because this legislation restores veteran \nstatus to Filipino veterans who served under U.S. command during World \nWar II.\n  This legislation is important. While our Republican friends are \nstalling for time, trying to maintain the status quo, our veterans--men \nand women, young and old--who served with distinction continue to wait \nfor the support, care, and services they have earned. They are waiting \nfor Congress to act.\n  As I have indicated, the Republicans have followed the lead of the \nranking member of the committee and opposed the provision in the bill \nthat provides pensions to Filipino veterans who fought by our side in \nWorld War II.\n  I say what I said yesterday: If you know nothing else about World War \nII, watch Tom Hanks' documentary of\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\nWorld War II, what went on in the Philippines. We depended on the \nFilipinos. They fought bravely, valiantly by our side. So I find this \nopposition baffling. With threats emerging from every corner of our \ncomplex world, America needs allies. We need to set an example that we \nstick by our friends. We should be sending a message to the world that \nwe need you to stand with us. We cannot fight the global war on terror \nalone.\n  What kind of example does this set? What better message can we send \nto our global allies than we will honor the past service of men and \nwomen born on foreign soil who rallied around our flag and fought for \nour freedom?\n  My friend from North Carolina, distinguished Senator Burr, argues we \nshould not be providing pensions for Filipino soldiers who served our \ncountry but who were not injured during World War II.\n  World War II was a different war from the war we are fighting now. In \nIraq, everybody is fair game to the terrorists. It was not that way in \nWorld War II. Only 20 percent--one in five--served on front lines \ntaking enemy fire. The other 80 percent provided support services and \nengaged in intelligence gathering. They transported and maintained \nequipment. They took care of the ammunition. They repaired combat \nvehicles. They were in the Quartermaster Corps making sure the uniforms \nand other equipment the soldiers needed got to where they were supposed \nto go. They cooked the food. They acted, as we know, as nurses. It \ncannot be argued those 80 percent were any less a part of that war. It \ncannot be argued that sacrifices do not count. It cannot be argued that \nthese men and women are less entitled to the benefits of veteran \nstatus. This legislation would give them $300 a month. Don't they \ndeserve that? Doesn't this country owe that to them?\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to break away from this foolishness \nand join us in providing a pension for the brave Filipino troops who \nstood with us, fought with us, and helped us win World War II. I hope \nthe Republicans will support all components of this legislation. It is \ngood legislation, but it should be known that I have reached out to \nRepublicans on this issue on many occasions, with no takers.\n  As I said to Senator Burr on the floor yesterday, if he does not like \nthis provision, why hold up the whole bill? We should have been on the \nbill Thursday night, Friday, Monday. It is Tuesday now. Offer an \namendment. Say: I don't believe these people who were not front-line \nsoldiers deserve anything. They are old. The average age is 84. They do \nnot deserve anything. Let's strike that with an amendment.\n  Let's have a debate on it and vote on it, not hold up the whole bill. \nBut that is what is being done. If a majority of the Senators vote for \nthe amendment, the bill will be altered. That is how the legislative \nprocess is supposed to work. We should not have to invoke cloture on a \nmotion to proceed simply to begin to legislate.\n  So I hope cloture will be invoked and, if it is, we do not have to \nuse the postcloture 30 hours to sit around and do nothing. We should be \nable to start legislating on this bill. I am not even asking \nRepublicans to support the bill at this point, just support allowing us \nto move to the bill so we can start legislating.\n  This is an example; almost 70 times in a little over a year, the \nRepublicans have stopped us from moving legislation. Is it any wonder \nthat today it is reported ``Bush's disapproval rating worst of any \npresident in 70 years''? That is no surprise. Holding up legislation, \neven legislation with which they agree, hold us up, just to stall, to \nmaintain the status quo. What is the status quo giving the American \npeople? Nothing. And that is how they feel about President Bush. That \nis why we see this headline in today's paper.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3214-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, of course the bill is not being held \nup, and of course the majority does not need permission from us to take \nup the bill. Today we will, in fact, vote on the cloture motion to \nproceed to the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. It is my \nbelief cloture should be invoked and will be invoked.\n  There is actually much to commend in this bill. It will improve the \nlives of our veterans by supplementing the level of assistance for \ndisabled veterans for the purchase of automobiles and increasing \nassistance for those veterans who need to modify their homes to \naccommodate their disabilities.\n  I wish to recognize with admiration my colleague from North Carolina, \nthe ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and thank him \nfor his hard work on this bill. Yesterday, he made clear that he will \noffer a substitute that seeks to correct the one glaring flaw contained \nwithin S. 1315, a provision that would divert $221 million over the \nnext 10 years to create a special pension for Filipino veterans of the \nSecond World War living in the Philippines who have no service-\nconnected disability. That money, of course, would be diverted at the \nexpense of American veterans living in America. The Senator from North \nCarolina spoke eloquently about the fact that diverting these resources \nfrom our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan represents \nmisplaced priorities, and I agree with him.\n  My expectation is the Senate will have a healthy debate concerning \nthis provision. Senators on my side of the aisle will have ample \nopportunity to amend the committee bill so we can have a bill that will \npass with bipartisan support and be signed into law. It is my hope we \ncan work together on this bill and produce another strong, bipartisan \nachievement for our veterans. I expect that to happen certainly in the \nvery near future. We will have an opportunity in our conference at noon \nto discuss going forward, but we anticipate moving forward with the \nBurr amendment early in the process. I think we are going to be able to \nget a strong, bipartisan accomplishment in the very near future in the \nSenate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the world to hear what the Republican \nleader just said: We are not holding up the bill. That simply is \nwithout any basis of fact. That is why we are going to vote at noon on \nbeing able to move to the bill. In years past, it was done \nautomatically. Rarely did we have to file a motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed. It is Orwellian, what my friend just said. Of \ncourse they are holding up the bill. And we have asked other times to \nmove to this legislation, as far back as November 2007.\n  So, Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that following morning \nbusiness, we move to the bill, we vitiate the need to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed, that all germane amendments would be in order--\nand certainly what Senator Burr said he wanted to do would be totally \ngermane. It is a striking provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following morning business, the Senate \nmove to the bill that is before the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I really \nthink any observers will find all of this quite silly, really. We are \ngoing to discuss the measure at noon. Many in my conference are not on \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee and have not had an opportunity to hear \nfrom Senator Burr about this issue. Yesterday was a no-vote day. \nMembers were not around. We are going to discuss the matter at noon.\n  I already indicated to my good friend the majority leader that we are \ngoing to be able to move forward, I think, with dispatch on this issue, \nand we are going to get a bipartisan accomplishment. No amount of \ntrying to steamroll the minority into giving up its rights is going to \nwork. Maybe that is one of the reasons this Congress has a lower \napproval than the President of the United States. My good friend the \nmajority leader never misses an opportunity to talk about the President \nnot being very popular. Every time in the future the majority leader \nwants to bring up the President's popularity, I will bring up the \npopularity of this new\n\n[[Page S3215]]\n\nmajority which makes the President's popularity look really good.\n  What I think the American people would like for us to do is to quit \nthis silly sparring back and forth, and finger-pointing, and legislate. \nWe have a very good chance to begin this week with a strong bipartisan \naccomplishment, and I think we ought to get about it. As soon as lunch \nis out of the way and Senator Burr has had an opportunity to brief our \nMembers on this measure, with which many of them are not yet familiar, \nwe will sit down, as we always do, the majority leader and I, with \nsmiles on our faces, and figure out how to go forward. And I think we \nwill be able to get there in the relatively near future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. So that it is very clear, the statement of the Republican \nleader was untrue. He can talk all he wants about finger-pointing. All \nwe want to do is legislate. That is what we want to do. And it would \nseem to me, as this legislation has been pending for 9 months--reported \nout of the committee 9 months ago--that since we are dealing with the \nveterans, the people for whom we want to do the very best we can \nbecause they deserve it, that in 9 months the Republican caucus would \nhave been able to focus on veterans and health care and not wait until \ntoday, April 22--or whatever today is, 9 months after the legislation \nwas reported out of the committee--to determine what is in the \nlegislation. Senators need to be briefed on how to take care of our \nsoldiers medically? I think that is without any foundation.\n  I will also say this, Mr. President: I feel very good about my job as \na Senator. I am very grateful to the people of Nevada for allowing me \nto serve in the Senate. But I am never going to come to the floor and \ndenigrate this body, as my Republican friend obviously wants to do. The \nrating of the Senate, over the history of the country, the rating of \nthe Congress is tied to the President. If the President is unpopular, \nthe Congress is unpopular, the city council is unpopular. If you have a \npopular President, everybody feels good about the Government itself. So \nI will never come to the Senate or anyplace else and denigrate my job \nand those of my 99 colleagues. I think we have important \nresponsibilities, and I think we should live up to those in a manner \nthat is best in keeping with the Senate tradition.\n  I came here this morning to state a fact. I want to legislate on \nbehalf of the Senate on legislation dealing with the medical care of \nour veterans, and it is being held up by the Republicans. That is \nclear. That is what I said, and I stand on that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. At the risk of prolonging this a little longer, I \ndon't think, at the end of the day, anybody in the country is going to \nbelieve we are obstructing this bill. This is a serious effort to \nlegislate. Senator Burr has taken it very seriously. He has an \nimportant amendment to be offered, which will be offered later today. \nThe Senate will have an opportunity to consider it.\n  Look, the way you get things done in the Senate is on a bipartisan \nbasis, and the rules around here give the minority an opportunity to be \ninvolved. This is not the House of Representatives. I wish we had been \nable to get more done last year, but one of the reasons we didn't is \nbecause we had 34 Iraq votes. Some of my friends in the other \nconference told me last year that any week they weren't voting on Iraq \nwas a bad week. We spent an awful lot of time on sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions on Iraq last year.\n  Floor time is at a premium in the Senate, as the majority leader used \nto say repeatedly when he was the leader of the Democratic Party and in \nthe minority. The Senate is not the House. Things don't move as \nspeedily. Most observers of the Senate understand that. By Senate \nstandards, this bill is going to move forward in relatively rapid order \nafter the rights of the minority to offer amendments have been \nprotected.\n  So I don't know what this little back and forth this morning is all \nabout because I do think we are going to have an opportunity to get a \nbipartisan accomplishment in the very near future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. What this is all about is the truth. That is what it is all \nabout.\n  Senator Durbin, assistant majority leader, on November 8, 2007, said \nthis: This is Senator Durbin speaking, Mr. President.\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that the Senate may proceed to the \n     consideration of calendar No. 336, S. 1315, at any time \n     determined by the majority leader following consultation with \n     the Republican leader; that when the bill is considered, the \n     only amendments in order to the bill, other than the \n     committee-reported amendment, be first-degree amendments that \n     are relevant to the subject matter of the bill and that they \n     be subject to relevant second-degree amendments; that upon \n     disposition of all amendments, the committee-reported \n     substitute amendment, as amended, if amended, be agreed to; \n     the bill, as amended, be read the third time, passed, and the \n     motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n\n  The Presiding Officer asked: Is there objection?\n  The Republican side: Objection.\n  The objections to this go back months. So what is this about today, \nthe Republican leader says? It is about the truth. It is about the \nRepublicans stalling everything that comes up--everything--and then to \nhave the audacity to come to the floor and say: We are not stalling \nanything.\n  We should have been on this bill a long time ago.\n  And during the period of time the Republican leader complains we were \nhaving numerous Iraq votes, we were trying to change the course in \nIraq, Mr. President, because it needed changing, and it still does.\n  We have been here I don't know how many seconds this morning, but \nevery second we have been here we have been spending $5,000 in Iraq--\n$5,000 a second or $12 billion a month. During the period of time he \ncomplains about our offering amendments related to the war in Iraq, our \ntroops were getting killed at the rate of more than one a day. Tens of \nthousands have been wounded. A third of them are missing eyes. Their \nminds aren't good. One-fifth of them have brain problems--injuries to \ntheir brains. We have more than 3,000 double amputees and thousands and \nthousands of single amputees. We have an obligation to the American \npeople to talk about the war in Iraq, and we are going to continue to \ndo that.\n  So we don't apologize to anyone for the votes we took on Iraq. The \nfirst many years of this war--a 6-year war now--the war went along with \nthe Republican leadership in the House and the Senate doing nothing \nabout the war except patting the President on the back. We have not \ndone that. We have been critical of the operation of the war in Iraq, \nbut we have done everything we can to support our troops. We were the \nfirst to call for more body armor for the troops. We were the first to \ncall for up-arming the vehicles so they wouldn't be killed as easily in \nthose vehicles. We have done everything we can to support the troops. \nWe have done everything we can to change the course of the war in Iraq.\n  The President has not allowed us to change the course of the war in \nIraq, and we are here today for the truth. The truth is, we are trying \nto legislate for the American people and change the status quo. The \nRepublicans want to maintain the status quo.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with all due respect to my good friend, \nthe majority leader, the American people are giving Congress such low \napproval ratings principally because of the rhetoric and the tone and \nthe feeling that we can't accomplish anything.\n  I don't know why, on this particular Tuesday morning, at about the \ntime we are going to go to a bill on which we could achieve an \nimportant bipartisan accomplishment, we want to engage in this kind of \nrancorous debate. We will have plenty of highly contentious issues to \ncome before us. That is the nature of the legislative process. And \ncertainly we have spirited debates in the Senate. But on the measure \nthat we are about to go to later today, I think there will be very \nlittle difference of opinion, and at the end of the process we are \nlikely to have a bipartisan accomplishment that we can all feel good \nabout.\n  So I would hope we could improve our moods and attitudes this week as\n\n[[Page S3216]]\n\nwe go forward and see if we can't accomplish something important for \nthe veterans of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3216-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I, too, am confident that we will pass \nimportant legislation on a bipartisan basis this week to provide the \nbenefits to veterans that they have earned and that they deserve, but \nwe can't forget the unfinished business of this Congress last December \nwhen we wrapped up the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bill and we left \na balance of more than $100 billion that the Department of Defense said \nit needed to fight the global war on terror.\n  In other words, it is important to support our veterans, but I would \nsubmit it is equally important to make sure we are supporting our \ntroops currently in the fight and in harm's way, and this Congress has \nan unfortunate record of delaying that and playing political games with \nthat money. It is time that should end.\n  In the Army alone, this shortfall amounts to $66 billion. As a \nresult, the Army will run out of pay for Active Duty and National Guard \nsoldiers in June unless Congress acts promptly.\n  At the same time, funding for extra vehicle armor, hospital \nconstruction and renovation, and new service vehicles will dry up. Our \ntroops will not have the resources they need to carry out their mission \nunless we act soon to pass this emergency supplemental appropriation.\n  Provincial reconstruction teams will also run out of funding. These \nteams are an integral part of our strategy in Iraq and go a long way to \nfostering growth, freedom, and good ties to the Iraqi communities and \nensuring we win the battle for hearts and minds as well.\n  We have also appropriated less than half of what the military leaders \nin Iraq tell us they need for the Commanders' Emergency Response \nProgram, or CERP, which is essential for continued bottom-up \nreconciliation efforts. We should not hold this funding hostage to \npolitical gains, and it should not become a vessel for porkbarrel \nprojects and bloated spending.\n  We should pass a clean emergency supplemental funding bill for our \ntroops as soon as we possibly can, and I hope immediately following the \npassage of this legislation we are on today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3216-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant Justin Young\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is my honor to speak today about a \nyoung man whose courage and strength have earned him the Silver Star, \nand more importantly the respect and admiration of all those who have \nheard about his story.\n  SSG Justin Young was born in Mesquite, TX, just outside of Dallas. \nThe son of John Young and Kathy Sutton, Justin was a swimmer for the \nBoerne High School Greyhounds. After graduating, he told his dad he \nneeded to find his priorities and his focus in life. That level of \nmaturity and insight is rare for someone so young, and it already tells \nyou something about the character of Justin Young.\n  Justin decided what was best for him was to join the U.S. Army. I \ndoubt anyone in this body would deny that the U.S. Army has a long and \nstoried history of taking young men and women with strong character and \ntransforming them into proven soldiers, and also into courageous \nleaders as well. Justin was no exception.\n  Just over a year ago, on March 24, Justin and the rest of the 82nd \nAirborne were conducting operations in Diyala Province in Iraq. As the \nsquad leader with C Troop, Justin led his nine-soldier squad into a \ncompound in Qubbah, Iraq, a location where known enemy fighters were \nentrenched.\n  Once inside the compound, Justin and his troops quickly encountered \narmed insurgents. Justin disarmed and detained a guard before pressing \non. In the confusion of the initial entry, Sergeant Young was ambushed \nby a hidden fighter about 10 feet away. The enemy fired his AK-47 \nassault rifle, hitting Justin's rifle three times and striking Justin \nonce in the chest. The force of these shots sprayed shrapnel up into \nJustin's neck and knocked him off his feet.\n  Injured, and with a broken weapon, Justin killed his attacker and got \nto his feet. Now, it is difficult for us here in the comfort of our \nNation's Capitol to imagine what such a fight for one's life must be \nlike. We can only try to imagine the chaos and confusion, the \nadrenaline, the pain, and the fear. You wouldn't blame anyone for \npulling back after something like that. But, frankly, that is one thing \nthat makes these young men and women so exceptional, and that is what \nmakes them the U.S. Army.\n  Justin got up, took a confiscated enemy AK-47 and three magazines, \nand refusing medical attention, continued to lead his troops through 5 \nmore days of fighting. That is, Mr. President, the kind of courage, \nstrength, and selflessness that ought to leave all of us in awe.\n  Justin finished out his 15-month assignment in Iraq in August and \ncame home, a hero to many--perhaps not the least of which being his \nfather. Try as he might, his dad John simply could not put into words \nhow proud he was and is of his son. After having dinner with Justin's \nunit at Fort Bragg, he said simply, ``He's unbelievable and so are his \nfriends.'' Both Justin and his father would be quick to remind us that \neven though Justin received this medal, it is all the men and women \nserving in our military who deserve our admiration and respect.\n  John told me that while ``Justin was there for his buddies, they were \nthere for him, too.'' Soldiers like Justin and his squadmates are a \nprime example of the great commitment all of our troops share, not only \nto each other but to our country as well. As such, they serve two of \nthe most noble principles the world will ever know.\n  What is Justin doing now? Having found his focus and oriented his \npriorities, with an example of true courage and dedication, Justin \nreenlisted in the Army just before finishing his first tour. Despite \nhis harrowing experience, Justin stood in the sands of Iraq and he \nraised his right hand and swore to continue his service to the defense \nof our great Nation. Recognizing his great courage and leadership, \nJustin is now training with the hopes of joining the special forces.\n  That is why I wanted to come to the floor today and honor Justin's \nexemplary service to our country. He is just one example of the \nbravery, courage, and strength of thousands of Texans, both past and \npresent, who have served in the U.S. military.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3216-5", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3216-S3218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Texas putting \na personal face on this war. Our young men and women are making \ntremendous sacrifices. We here in the Congress should be willing to do \nour part to ensure they succeed in their mission. Hearing a story like \nJustin's simply confirms that we should redouble our efforts to fund \nwhat they need to carry out their mission.\n  The majority leader talked a little bit earlier about delays with the \nlegislation that is currently pending before the Senate. It is going to \ntake us 2 or 3 days, presumably, to complete this legislation that is \ncurrently pending--2 or 3 days. That is not a big delay in the Senate. \nBut 14 months is a big delay, and that is the time since the President \nfirst asked for the supplemental\n\n[[Page S3217]]\n\nappropriations to help fund our troops fighting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan--14 months ago. That is a real delay. It is because I \nbelieve the majority party believed they could delay and delay and \nthereby apply pressure to accomplish one of two objectives--either put \npressure on the administration to back off of the war effort or, \nknowing we are now really up against a funding crunch, put pressure on \nthe President to accept a lot of unrelated spending, spending that has \nto do with our pet projects here at home. That is on the theory that \nthe President would have to sign a bill because our troops are so \ndesperate for the funding they need, even if that bill includes a lot \nof unrelated spending Members of Congress want for their folks back \nhome. We should not submit to what I would refer to as legislative \nblackmail, to hold our troops hostage, in effect, for this domestic \nspending. Nothing else explains this 14-month delay.\n  We have already been told by the Secretary of Defense that it is \ncritical that this supplemental funding be provided to the troops to \nprevent a slowdown in daily efforts in training and equipping, the \nhalting of military operations and enabling us to replace lost or \ndamaged equipment for ongoing operations. All of these are implicated \nby this delay.\n  General Petraeus, when he was back here, added another reason. He \nstressed the importance of this supplemental appropriations to further \nprogress in Iraq. Here is what he said:\n\n       The Commander's Emergency Response Program, the State \n     Department's Quick Response Fund, and the USAID programs \n     enable us to help Iraq deal with its challenges. To that end, \n     I respectfully ask that you provide us by June the additional \n     CERP funds requested in the supplemental. These funds have an \n     enormous impact.\n\n  In other words, it is not just the funds to buy the equipment and \nsupport our troops for their mission there but also to enable our \nmilitary to provide what is necessary to enable the Iraqi people and \nthe Iraqi Government there to succeed.\n  All of these are reasons for acting with speed. Yet for 14 months \nCongress has delayed the supplemental funding.\n  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jim Nussle, \nstated during his testimony last week to the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee that if the supplemental request is not provided to the DOD \nby Memorial Day, then the Army and Marine Corps will be forced to take \nfunding from other areas of their operations budget and will even have \nto start laying off civilians and contractor personnel. It will \ncertainly force the Pentagon to use short-term expedients which are \nvery costly. In other words, instead of having the ability to spread \nout their contracts over time, which is a much more economical way of \nacquiring services and equipment, the Pentagon is forced to pay a \npremium for short-term contracting, and it is forced to move funds from \ngeneral accounts to support priority expenditures specifically related \nto the conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is already adversely \nimpacting the Department of Defense.\n\n  Clearly, military planners are leery of engaging in a new operation \nwhen they do not even know that the material assets they are going to \nneed for that operation are going to be available or that what they \nhave available today is not going to be replaced in the future because \nthis supplemental funding has not been provided.\n  We have no more important obligation as Members of the Senate than \nfunding our troops when they are in the middle of a battle. That is \nprecisely the situation right now.\n  In fact, let me just quote something that was said just a couple of \ndays ago by Ayman al-Zawahiri, currently the leader of al-Qaida. Here \nis what he said in a long audio message, among other things:\n\n       Iraq today is now the most important arena in which our \n     Muslim nation is waging the battle against the forces of the \n     Crusader-Zionist campaign. Therefore, backing the Mujahidin \n     in Iraq, led by the Islamic State of Iraq, is the most \n     important task of the Islamic nation today.\n\n  We are in a war, and what Zawahiri said in one sense is right. This \nis the most important arena in which this conflict is currently playing \nitself out. We have a choice: to leave in defeat or to continue to \nassure victory.\n  We have sent our troops in harm's way to achieve their mission. They \nare accomplishing it. The surge General Petraeus has implemented is \nworking. It is up to us to do our part in this effort. All we have to \ndo is have a brief debate and a vote, and the vote is to send money the \ntroops need to sustain their operation. We have known this now for 14 \nmonths, yet Congress continues to dither. Now we have run out of time.\n  There has been a suggestion that in this effort to fund our troops, \nwe should combine all of the spending into one massive appropriations \nbill. It would be well over $100 billion. If all it does is fund the \ntroops, then that is fine. But if it is used, as I said before, as a \nway for the majority to sneak through either unrequested defense \nspending or our favorite other domestic pet projects, that would be a \ngrave injustice to our troops.\n  I note the distinguished chairman of one of the subcommittees in the \nHouse of Representatives on the Appropriations Committee has revealed \nthat he is ready to move the particular bill here because he is going \nto use it as a way to add other items to the Pentagon, including \nadditional Navy warships and the procurement of new C-17s and F-22 \nfighter planes beyond what the Defense Department has budgeted. Maybe \nthose are good defense expenditures, maybe not, but the reality is that \nthey should stand on their own two feet as part of a general \nauthorization and appropriations process and not be put on the backs of \nthis supplemental appropriations bill which is what is needed to fund \nour efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Others have been looking at the supplemental as an opportunity to \nincrease funding for their favorite nondefense programs. It has been \nsuggested by members of the Senate Appropriations Committee last week \nthat some $24 billion in nondefense spending might be added for that \npurpose.\n  As I said, Congress should not be extorted into supplying nonwar \nspending on this supplemental appropriations bill, the emergency bill \nto fund our war effort. Any effort to do that I suggest should be \nrejected--among other things, because we know the President has said he \nwill veto a war supplemental funding bill that contains nonwar-related \nitems or strings attached such as some kind of a timetable for troop \nwithdrawal from Iraq. Knowing that is going to be vetoed, it would be \nirresponsible for the Congress to go ahead and send him a bill and take \nadditional time to get the bill back and redo it in a way that will be \nnot vetoed.\n  The bottom line is that we have to take care of our troops. We have \nto support them in the mission we have sent them to achieve. It is time \nthat we get about that, and I urge my colleagues, when the war \nsupplemental comes to this body--hopefully next week--to act with \nalacrity, we will pass it and not hold it hostage to our other spending \npriorities that do not relate to our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a minute talking about \nwhat a supplemental is because oftentimes the words we use up here do \nnot have the clarity for the American public as to what they really \nmean. A supplemental appropriation is an appropriation that is outside \nthe budget. What does that mean and what does that mean to the average \ntaxpayer? That means all the money that is used to pay for the \nsupplemental will be borrowed. It is not coming from taxes today. It \ndoes not fit inside the pay-go rules. It purely and simply is borrowed \nfrom our children.\n  I have significant problems with that. If you look back at our \nhistory, President Roosevelt cut 29 percent out of his favorite \ndomestic programs during World War II. President Truman cut 26 percent \nout of domestic programs to pay for the Korean war. We routinely, year \nafter year, charge the war to our children.\n  I raise the issue for two points. No. 1 is that is the way the \nPresident has chosen to do it, and I fault him as well as the Congress. \nBut No. 2 is this great propensity of ``legislators'' who add \neverything including the kitchen sink to it because it is a free pass \nand it is outside the budget.\n  The last appropriations bill that we did that was a supplemental had \n$17\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\nbillion added to it that did not have anything to do with the war, \ndidn't have anything to do with priorities in this country, didn't have \nanything to do with that other than adding things on because it was \noutside the budget so they could spend more inside the budget.\n  I am in my fourth year in the Senate. One of the things we have done \never since I have been here is try to root out waste, fraud, and abuse. \nThere is no question right now that in the Federal budget--almost $3 \ntrillion--over $300 billion right now that is in the appropriated \nprograms and in the mandatory programs is lost to fraud, waste, and \nabuse. So we are going to be bringing a bill to the floor for $120 or \n$107 billion, plus probably another $10 or $15 billion that the porkers \nwill add to it and oink all the way, and nobody is going to offer \nanything to offset it out of the fraud, waste, and abuse--the waste we \nhave because we are not paying attention to the running of the \nGovernment. We hear this big debate about earmarks, the prerogative to \nmake sure that we point to things. The fact is, the way you point out \nthings is to do oversight on the waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  If you think this is not accurate, let me give you a list of where \nthe waste is. There is $90 billion worth of fraud in Medicare right \nnow, and there is $10 billion that we pay that we inherently pay \nwrongly. So that comes to over $100 billion in Medicare alone that \nshould not be going out the door. We are not doing a thing about it. \nNobody is going to offer an amendment. It will not even be judged as in \norder with the rules, to get rid of the fraud in Medicare. Medicaid is \nsame thing--$30 billion in fraud, $15 billion in overpayments for \npeople that we just made a mistake in paying. No, there is not going to \nbe anything offered during the supplemental to fix that, so right there \nyou have $125, $130 billion that would pay--just in fixing Medicare and \nMedicaid fraud.\n  There will not be a rule that will allow us to vote on that. There \nwill not be a way for us to do it because that is hard work, and we do \nnot want to do the hard work.\n  Social Security disability fraud, $2.5 billion; the governmentwide \noverpayments, improper payments, overpayments for other things, $15 \nbillion. These are not my numbers, these are documented numbers by \neither the GAO, the Congressional Budget Office or the IGs; $8 billion \nthat the Defense Department pays out for bonuses for companies that did \nnot earn the bonus or performance awards.\n  There is not going to be anything in this to fix that. It is not even \ngoing to be made in order. And $4 billion that we are being defrauded \non a crop insurance modernization program, where we allow for crop \ninsurance a higher rate of return than any other casualty or insurance \ncompany could earn.\n  No bid contracts, $5 billion. U.N. contributions that are purely \nwaste, that get defrauded and wasted, $2 billion. We buy $64 billion \nworth of IT projects a year, and at least 20 percent of it is wasted. \nThat is another $12.8 billion.\n  Nobody is going to fix that on this. No, we are going to borrow the \nmoney from our children. So I raise the issue that we are going to pass \na supplemental, and the games are going to be played on it like they \nare every year. People are going to add things that are not a priority; \nthey are going to add them in--they are not in the budget--knowing they \nare going to go straight to the debt. Is it in our interest for us to \nconsider, as we do the supplemental, what we are spending right now per \nAmerican family on different things?\n  Let me spend a minute to outline that every American family is paying \n$8,668 for Medicare and Social Security every year; every American \nfamily is paying over $5,000 a year to defend this country; we are \nspending $3,752 for antipoverty programs every year; we are spending \n$2,000 a family for interest on the national debt, which is going to be \nhigher next year because we are going to borrow all the supplemental \nand add that to our debt.\n  Federal employee retirement benefits cost every family in this \ncountry $1,000 a year--$1,000 a year for every family. Veterans' \nbenefits, $750 per family; health research and regulations, $692; \neducation, $578; highway mass transit, $455; unemployment benefits, \n$320; international affairs, $300.\n  We have a deficit that is going to be $800 billion this year. While \nCongress sits on its heels and has debates about legislating or not \nlegislating, we are going to continue the same bad habits of not \nholding agencies accountable, not being transparent about what we are \ndoing, and we are going to say we funded the war, but we are not going \nto make any of the hard choices about it.\n  When this bill comes to the floor, it is going to have $17 to $20 \nbillion that does not have anything to do with the war but has \neverything to do with political directives outside the budget so we can \nspend more money.\n  Washington does not need a raise, it needs a cut. It is time for us \nto pay for the war by getting rid of the waste, fraud, and abuse in \nthis Federal Government. Unfortunately, there is not the character or \nthe courage in either the House or the Senate to take on that fight \nbecause it might impact political careers.\n  So as you listen to the debate when we come up with the supplemental, \nwe need to fund our troops, there is no question about it, but we \nshould not be funding our troops on the backs of our children. We \nshould be funding our troops on the backs of us, and we ought to be \ndoing that every time.\n  So I am going to do all in my power to try to offer amendments to \noffset the funds in this war supplemental. I know the rules will \nprohibit me from doing many of them. But I am not going to stop \ntalking. I am not going to stop talking about the $350 billion that \ngoes down the drain and steals the future and opportunity from our \nchildren.\n  That is exactly what we are going to be doing. And we are going to be \nsmiling all the way through and patting ourselves on the back that we \nfunded the war. But we did it on the backs of those who do not have the \nsame opportunities we were given. We are going to steal those \nopportunities from the next two generations.\n  It is time for Congress to start doing its job. That means tough, \nrigorous oversight and staying within the budget guidelines and \nspending the money like it was ours, not like we had an unending credit \ncard that never comes due.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, thank you very much. I too wish to speak \nas in morning business.\n  All over America today, people are celebrating Earth Day. But we, the \nwomen of the Senate, have another day we are commemorating, it is \ncalled Pay Equity Day. That means women should get paid equal pay for \nequal or comparable work.\n  You are going see the women of the Senate dressed in red today. We \nare going to be on the Senate floor, we are going to be in our \ncommittees, and we are going to be doing our job. But we wear the color \nred with solidarity for women all over who say: We are red in the face \nbecause of the way women have been treated in terms of our pay.\n  Right now, in the year 2008, women still make less money per hour \nthan men for the same or comparable job. If that was not hard enough \nabout the business practices, we actually have a Supreme Court that \nagreed with discrimination.\n  So today we come to the floor with legislation that has been \ndeveloped, on a bipartisan basis, to reverse a Supreme Court decision \ncalled the Ledbetter decision.\n  You have to hear this. Last May, the Supreme Court made an outrageous \ndecision that said women cannot get equal pay for equal work if they do \nnot do it within the first 180 days that a discrimination occurs. The \ndecision was sexist, it was biased, and it did not understand the \nreality of women's lives or the reality of the workplace.\n  Their decision was a step backward for women, and it hit women right \nin the pocketbook. It violates the American concept of fairness and \njustice and equal treatment under the law.\n  Let me tell you about Lilly Ledbetter, who brought the case to the \nSupreme Court. I met her in the HELP Committee--the Health, Education, \nLabor Committee--when we were listening to the testimony about it. I \nlistened to her story. This is a woman\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\nnow who is beyond middle-age, who has worked 19 years for the Goodyear \nCorporation.\n  Systematically, she was underpaid from the day she walked in that \ndoor. Not only did she get less pay for the work that she did, but she \ndid not get comparable raises when the men got theirs.\n  What does that mean? Not only did she have less earnings in her work, \nthough she worked as hard, received excellent ratings, and was \npromoted, but it also now will show up in her pension; she will get \nless Social Security and she will get less pension. So remember, when \ndiscrimination begins, it is compounded over a lifetime.\n  Now, Lilly Ledbetter is a real American. She fought the system on her \nown time and with great risk. She fought the discrimination and took it \nto the Equal Opportunity Commission, took it to the courts, and then \ntook it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Along the way, she had to \nraise her own money to do this, while the big corporate interests at \nGoodyear had fat-cat, billable-hours lawyers against her.\n  She faced sexual harassment in the workplace because she dared to \nspeak up and speak out. Well, Lilly Ledbetter would not give up. If she \nwas the only case in America, it would be wrong, but this is a \npersistent pattern in the workplace. And also it has now been approved \nby the Supreme Court.\n  The Supreme Court said: Someone cannot sue their employer over \nunequal pay if that person does not file suit within 180 days after the \npay was established.\n  Once again, the Supreme Court does not get it. How many women know \nthe salary of their coworkers, especially in the first 6 months on the \njob? The reality of the workplace is that often people are forbidden to \ntalk about their salaries. What if you were hired at an equal rate with \nyour male counterpart, but he gets a raise every few months and you do \nnot? The Supreme Court decision was outrageous. It was so bad that \nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, God bless her, God bless Justice Ruth, she \nstood up and actually spoke from the bench to read her dissenting \nopinion.\n  That is unprecedented. Usually, they file it and let it go into the \nhistory books. But Justice Ginsburg wanted to put the world and this \nCongress on notice that we better act. Justice Ginsburg said in her \ndissenting opinion:\n\n       In our view, the court does not comprehend or is \n     indifferent to the insidious way in which women can be \n     victims of pay discrimination.\n\n  She encouraged the Congress to fix it, and we will fix it. We will. \nUnfortunately, wage discrimination exists. Woman now earn 77 percent \nfor every dollar our male counterpart makes. Women of color even get \npaid less. African-American women get paid 68 cents for every dollar a \nWhite man makes. That is almost a 40-percent difference.\n  The Supreme Court decision will make it almost impossible for women \nworkers to close this wage gap and to get the remedy they deserve, and \nwhat they should get, under our doctrine of fairness, is equal pay for \nequal or comparable work.\n  From the bench, Justice Ginsburg did call on the Congress for action. \nShe said, ``Correct the mistake.''\n  Well, when Justice Ruth speaks, and by the way, do we not miss our \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor? Justice Alito wrote the primary assenting \nopinion. They told us the Court made a mistake and the Congress could \nfix it. Well, fix it we will. We will be soon voting on the legislative \nprocess in the bill itself to right this wrong. We will be voting on \nlegislation that will correct this mistake.\n  This legislation was authored by our great Galahad in the Senate, \nSenator Kennedy. He did it in consultation with we, the women in the \nSenate: Senator Clinton, myself, Senator Snowe, women on both sides of \nthe aisle. He reached out to us. We reached out to the best legal \nthinking.\n  This bill will amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This \nbill will amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964, so the statute of \nlimitations for an employee to file a wage discrimination suit runs \nfrom the date of the actual payment of the discriminatory wage, not \nfrom the hiring. So every time you get a paycheck, it will be an act of \ndiscrimination, which will reset the clock so you can file your case.\n  That means employees can sue employers based on each discriminating \npaycheck, and it does not limit the time a worker can get the remedy \nshe deserves. This bill is about fairness, justice, and respect. Is it \nnot time, is it not time? When we think about Lilly Ledbetter and all \nthose wonderful women similar to her, a woman who worked for 19 years, \nshe was not exactly sure when the disparity developed, she could not \nquite get to all that.\n  A jury found they had discriminated against her. They awarded her \n$400,000 in backpay. The Supreme Court took it away from her. Well, \ntoday, we are going to give it back to her. We are going to make sure \nshe and her guts and her grit, in standing up for herself, has stood up \nfor all women.\n  We who are the women of the Senate stand up as well, I believe also \nwith the very good men who work with us. Men of quality never fear \nwomen who seek equality. We are doing that today. We believe in this \ncountry all people are created equal. We need to make sure it is in the \nFederal law books and in your personal checkbook.\n  All people are created equal in the Federal lawbook and in your \npersonal checkbook. People should be judged by their skills, their \ncompetence, and by the job they do. Once you get that job because of \nyour skills and talent, you should get equal pay for equal or \ncomparable work.\n  Lilly Ledbetter was an honest and hard-working person for 19 years. \nShe is entitled to every cent she worked for. Because Lilly Ledbetter \nstood up, we rise with her. We are going to correct the Supreme Court \ndecision. We are going to pass this reform legislation that is called \nthe Fair Pay Restoration Act. We ask the Presiding Officer to join with \nus today. For all of us who wear red, this is going to be a great \nvictory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to join my colleague from \nMaryland, the distinguished Senator Mikulski, who has always fought for \nwomen's rights because she knows that is what will make our country \nstrong. I serve on the Health, Education, and Labor Committee with the \nSenator from Maryland. We saw Lilly Ledbetter come before our committee \nto speak about her experience in a factory where she was not given fair \npay. Over time it went all the way to the Supreme Court, where she lost \nher right in her own lifetime to ever be compensated for the pay she \nlost because she wasn't treated fairly. She came before our committee, \nand she was such a woman of dignity and courage, not speaking for \nherself--anything we do on the floor won't help her personally--but \nspeaking for all women who will come behind her for decades, to make \nsure they have the right to get equal pay when they are performing an \nequal job.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for her leadership and urge our colleagues \ntomorrow to vote with us so we can go to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct and once and for all assure that our daughters and future \ngenerations will have access to equal pay.\n  This Senate has a very proud history of working across the aisle to \npass civil rights laws. Those historic laws ensure that all people have \nequal rights, regardless of race, religion, gender, or national origin. \nI am proud that they ensure that my daughter now has the right to work \nin the same jobs and achieve the same success as my son. But even \nthough women are doing the same jobs as men and working as hard every \nday, they still are not equal on one important day. That is payday. On \npayday, women will take home 77 cents for every dollar paid to their \nmale coworkers. That pay gap is even wider for African-American and \nLatino women. African-American women earn 67 cents on the dollar and \nLatino women earn 56 cents for every dollar a white man makes. I know \nsome people out there say: That can't be true. It is true.\n  I rise on Equal Pay Day to recognize that we still have a lot of work \nto do to ensure fairness in society. Tomorrow is the day the Senate can \ngo on record saying we in this country are going to stand behind the \nwomen and men and their children who rely on them to bring home a \npaycheck.\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\n  The pay gap that exists is true regardless of skill or education. It \nis so deeply engrained in society that many jobs dominated by women pay \nless than jobs dominated by men, even when the work they do is almost \nexactly the same. In my State of Washington, a woman with a college \ndegree earns about $20,000 less than a man with the same education. \nAccording to a study by the American Association of University Women, \nthe difference in pay starts as soon as that woman enters the \nworkforce. That study found that within a year after graduating from \ncollege, a woman will already earn less than her male classmates in \nnearly every major. So that is a problem when one starts out. It is \nalso a lifelong problem, because by the end of her career, a female \nworker will have lost an average of $250,000 in earnings.\n  It is just as important to make it clear that the pay gap is a \nproblem for everyone. This disparity hurts millions of families. In \nalmost 10 million households, mothers are the only breadwinners, and in \nmany cases those women are also supporting parents and extended family \nmembers. In far too many of those households women have to struggle to \npay for rent or heat or food or gas, especially today as prices are \nrising. Think of how much better off families would be if a woman were \npaid a wage equal to men, especially as the economic downturn grows \nworse and expenses rise.\n  If women and men made an equal wage, single working women would have \n17 percent more income each and every year. Ensuring they earn a fair \npaycheck could cut the poverty rate in half. Wage disparity follows \nthose women into retirement. Women today are twice as likely to live in \npoverty over the age of 65. Women are more dependent upon Social \nSecurity for a greater percentage of their retirement income. All of us \nare staring down the looming Social Security crisis. Think how much \nbetter off we would be if women could save a little more for retirement \nand contribute more to Social Security.\n  My colleagues and I should not have to be here talking about this \ntoday. I should not have to come to the floor in the year 2008 to make \na case for equal pay. Not only is it a no-brainer, but fairness and \nequality are fundamental American values. We are not asking for special \ntreatment. We are here because, despite all the work done to ensure \nequal rights, women haven't achieved equality. We are here because we \nrun the risk that pay discrimination laws are growing weaker, not \nstronger, if we don't act.\n  As Senator Mikulski discussed, the Supreme Court last May took a big \nstep backward with its decision on Ledbetter v. Goodyear. That decision \nwent against Congress's intent and 40 years of EEOC practice. It made \nit almost impossible for workers who suffer pay discrimination to now \nseek justice.\n  Today on Equal Pay Day, we urge our colleagues to support legislation \nthat would reverse that decision and ensure workers have a fair shot at \nfighting discrimination. The Ledbetter decision requires many workers \nto file a claim within 180 days after their employer discriminates \nagainst them, but it does not recognize that in many cases workers \ndon't even know they have been discriminated against for years. It may \ntake them much longer than 180 days to gather the proof. Frankly, for \nwomen in the workplace to be aggressive in finding out how much other \npeople get paid in order to even file a case is very difficult. This \nsounds an awful lot like the Supreme Court is asking our workers to be \nmindreaders. That is unfair. It is not what Congress intended when we \ncreated that law in the first place.\n  The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act will allow workers to file a claim within \n180 days of any discriminatory paycheck. It gives workers the ability \nto discover the facts and to challenge ongoing discrimination. Although \nthe Ledbetter case involved gender discrimination, the decision applies \nto all kinds of discrimination, including religion, race, age, \ndisability, and national origin.\n  Our Nation was founded on the principle that all of its citizens are \ncreated equal. We think they ought to be equal on payday as well. As a \nmother and grandmother, I want my children to live in a country where \nmy daughter can earn as much as my son. Now is the time to ensure that \nthat can be true by strengthening our pay discrimination laws. Now is \nthe time to ensure the Senate's history of civil rights cannot be \neroded.\n  Tomorrow is an important day for women and men. I urge my colleagues \nto vote with us to consider the Fair Pay Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I also rise to talk about Lilly \nLedbetter and some practical realities regarding this issue. I had the \nhonor of representing a number of people on discrimination cases during \nthe time I practiced law in Kansas City. I represented people on age \ndiscrimination, race discrimination, and gender discrimination. I am \nfamiliar with the law before Ledbetter. The thing about this decision \nthat is hardest for me is how unpractical it is. When I was a single \nmom with three small kids in a job with a lot of responsibility and \nlong hours, I had to be very practical in the way I lived my life. \nWorking women across this country are very practical people. They have \nto prioritize. They make multitasking a way of life.\n  I look at this decision from a practical standpoint. Here is what \nsticks in my craw. They are acting as if when you get a paycheck, \nimmediately some switch is turned on in your head that says: My \npaycheck is discriminatory.\n  There is no way women in the workplace can look at their paycheck and \nimmediately determine they have been discriminated against. They don't \nknow what everybody else is making. If you are going to say that \nsomeone only has 180 days to file a complaint on discrimination from \nthe date the decision is made to make that complaint, what you are \nsaying is that everybody in the workplace, whether they are an elderly \nperson, whether they are a minority, whether they are a woman, they are \ngoing to have to turn into a detective every time they get a paycheck. \nThey are going to have to run around and interview their colleagues as \nto how much money they are making to make sure their paycheck is fair. \nThat is dumb. That is just dumb.\n  First, you are not even supposed to talk about your paycheck in the \nworkplace. In many places of employment, the boss says it is against \npolicy to discuss with other people what their salary is or what your \npay is. So what we are saying to the women and to the older workforce \nand to members of minorities is: Now you have to figure out what is in \nthe head of your employer. And by the way, you have 6 months.\n  If I were an employer in America, I would say: Hey, talk about \nhurting productivity.\n  Instead, doesn't it make sense that we should be able to show a \npattern of discrimination that is reflected in a series of paychecks? \nOf course, it does. Who has the best knowledge as to whether someone is \nbeing discriminated against? I will guarantee you, it is not the person \nreceiving the check. I think about the cases I represented and what \nkind of incredibly high bar it would have been for each one of those \nindividuals to figure out in 180 days whether their paycheck was fair.\n  It is funny how people around this place talk about activist judges. \nI have a feeling that when we debate this issue today and tomorrow, and \nas this vote occurs, we won't hear a word from the other side about \nactivist judges. This was, in fact, a Supreme Court decision that \nradically changed the law as we knew it, as it has been practiced in \nthis country, as it has, in fact, been embraced by this country. This \nCourt, by the narrowest of margins, said 5 to 4 that they were going to \nupset all that law and make it very difficult for people in the \nworkplace to have their day in the bright sunshine of justice.\n  I am tempted to call it an activist judiciary. They are out of \ncontrol. We have to do something about the judiciary. Instead, what we \nneed to do is what we have always done in our history. We have to \ncorrect it. By the way, that decision spoke to us in terms of asking \nus, in the dissent, to take the steps necessary to put the law back \nwhere it was before that fateful day last summer when the Supreme Court \nsaid to the people who have been discriminated against: We are going to \nmake it really hard for you to hold your employer accountable.\n  This is not a twilight zone of liability for companies. This is a \nsituation where all the damages that someone\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\ncan receive is just 2 years, regardless of how long the discrimination \nhas gone on. Mr. President, 180 days is a very short period of time in \nterms of filing a complaint--much shorter than any other statute of \nlimitations that is out there for any wrong anyone suffers in our \ncountry.\n  I think people need to remember how Lilly found out about this. The \njury found in her favor. The EEOC found in her favor. The law was in \nher favor--until the Supreme Court overturned it.\n  How did she find out she was being discriminated against? She had \nbeen there all these years. She had started out on an even keel with \nthe colleagues who were men. Someone slipped her an anonymous note. \nThere is not a tote board somewhere she could have checked. Someone \nslipped her an anonymous note in the workplace and said: Hey, do you \nrealize what is happening to you? You need to start asking some \nquestions about what is happening to your pay.\n  This is not just about women. This is also about the older workforce. \nBy the way, with the economy the way it is right now, under this \nadministration, people are having to work longer. People who used to \nthink they could retire at 62--forget about that--they are working into \ntheir late sixties, into their seventies. In fact, we have many Members \nin this body who are working hard every day who are well beyond their \nearly seventies who are contributing on a daily basis to this place. \nShould those people be discriminated against because they are older? \nShould they have to figure out in 180 days that a younger colleague is \nmaking a bigger paycheck?\n  What about the minorities in this country? This is not just about \nwomen. This is about discrimination. We need to send a very clear \nsignal to the rest of the country that we understand we have to fix \nthis and we have to fix it quickly.\n  This is not a bunch of whining over something that is not important. \nThat 22 cents in Missouri that a woman makes less than a man is \nimportant. It is important to pay for the gas. It is important to pay \nfor the daycare. It is important in order to make the bills come out \neven.\n  In Missouri, the figure is that women earn 78 cents for every $1 \nearned by men. The median annual income for a man with a college degree \nin Missouri, from the years 2004 to 2006, was $59,000. For a woman with \nthe same amount of education, it was $46,000. The American Association \nof University Women did that study in the State of Missouri.\n  We need to unite behind this legislation. This is not going to be \nonerous for employers out there. It is fair. It is just fair. It is \nwhat we pledge allegiance to every day in this room: equal justice for \nall. Let's make sure we fix this. Let's make sure we move and pass this \nbill and send it to the President. I will tell you what, if this \nPresident has the nerve to veto this bill, I know a lot of women in \nAmerica who are going to wake up and get busy before November.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized, if I could. \nI ask to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold the suggestion?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3221-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VETERANS' BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning on the floor of the Senate is \na bill entitled the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. Nine \nmonths ago, this bill came out of committee, and this bill is now on \nthe floor and to be considered.\n  Back in November of last year, I asked for permission to bring this \nbill up for consideration in the Senate and have amendments. It is the \norderly process of the Senate, a deliberative process: a debate--and \none might expect that is what we do around here. But, sadly, at that \npoint the Republican minority objected to bringing up the Veterans' \nBenefits Enhancement Act, even though it had passed out of the \ncommittee with an overwhelmingly positive vote.\n  What is included in this bill? A long list of important changes in \nthe law, changes which will give to our veterans, especially those \nreturning now disabled from combat, benefits they absolutely need: \nhousing, education.\n  In addition, there is a provision in here which I support--was happy \nto join as a cosponsor--related to Filipino World War II veterans. I \nthink it is long overdue that the U.S. Senate recognize the \ncontribution made by so many Filipinos in World War II to the success \nof our war effort. They fought so gallantly and courageously and stood \nby our troops at a moment we desperately needed their help. Those who \nare not students of history may have forgotten or never read that our \nfight in the Philippines was a bitter, long, and tragic battle that \nended well but only after great sacrifice by the Filipino people, by \nthe Filipino soldiers, and by our American soldiers.\n  This provision in the bill related to veterans:\n\n     would deem certain service before July 1, 1946, in the \n     organized military forces of the Philippines and the \n     Philippine Scouts as active military service for purposes of \n     eligibility for veterans benefits.\n       [It] would provide that the children of deceased or \n     totally-disabled service-connected Filipino veterans who \n     qualify for educational benefits would be paid at the same \n     rate and under the same conditions as the children of other \n     veterans.\n\n  Mr. President, this is long overdue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, would the clerk report the motion to \nproceed to the bill at this point, or should I proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is appropriate to close morning business \nand then report the motion to proceed.\n  Morning business is closed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3221-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3221-S3227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         VETERANS' BENEFITS ENHANCEMENT ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume the motion to proceed to S. 1315, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the bill (S. 1315) to amend title \n     38, United States Code, to enhance life insurance benefits \n     for disabled veterans, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I see Senator Klobuchar on the floor. I \nthink she was coming to speak in morning business, and I may have used \nthe minute or two that was remaining for her. I wish to address the \nmotion to proceed to the bill that is pending, but since she is on the \nfloor, I would like to give her a chance to speak at this moment before \nI do. So I ask--if it meets with the approval of the Senator from North \nCarolina--unanimous consent that the Senator from Minnesota be \nrecognized for----\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Five minutes, and that following her remarks, I be \nrecognized for 10 minutes to speak on the pending motion to proceed.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not \nplan on objecting, if the 5 minutes is to come out of the majority's \ntime for the debate--which the time is split between now and 12 o'clock \nbetween the majority and minority--if Senator Klobuchar's time comes \nout of the majority's time, fine.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding Senator Akaka wants \nto speak for up to 10 minutes. So I am trying to figure out--we have 38 \nminutes remaining before the vote, so that would allow 19 minutes per \nside. If Senator Akaka needs 10 minutes, I would ask for 4 minutes and \nyield 5 minutes to Senator Klobuchar, if that meets with the Senator's \napproval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Illinois, \nthank you very much. I appreciate the time. If I go less than 5 \nminutes, I will give you back the rest of the time.\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\n                             Equal Pay Day\n\n  Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleagues today, many of \nwhom were here earlier--Senator Mikulski, Senator Murray, Senator \nBoxer, and Senator McCaskill--in support of Equal Pay Day.\n  In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Eleanor Roosevelt as \nchairwoman of the President's Status on Women Commission.\n  In 1963, the Commission's findings enumerated rampant discrimination \nagainst women in the workplace: in hiring, in accommodations, and in \npay. This was part of the larger catalyst to finally pass--that same \nyear--the Equal Pay Act.\n  It is a sad reality that still, 88 years after the 19th amendment \ngave women equal voting power and 45 years after the passage of the \nEqual Pay Act, it takes women 16 months to earn what men can earn in 12 \nmonths. In other words, today, Equal Pay Day, marks the day it takes \nwomen to finally catch up to where men were back in January.\n  But Eleanor Roosevelt was a strong, wise woman, and she brought to \nthat first Commission her personal philosophy that ``It's better to \nlight a candle than to curse the darkness.'' That is why it is so \nimportant that the Senate take up the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act on \nthe floor this week. We must light a candle to the pay discrimination \nwomen continue to experience across the country.\n  This important legislation will reverse a 2007 Supreme Court ruling--\nLedbetter v. Goodyear--that significantly limited the rights of \nindividuals to sue for gender-based pay discrimination.\n  The facts that gave rise to Lilly Ledbetter's case are all too common \ntoday. Lilly Ledbetter was a hard worker, working at Goodyear Tire as a \nmanager for 20 years. When she started at Goodyear, all the employees \nat the manager level started at the same pay. She knew she was getting \nthe same pay as the men did. But early in her tenure as manager, the \ncompany went to another system. Payment records were kept confidential, \nand Lilly did not think to ask what her colleagues were making. She did \nnot think to look at her pay raise and ask if men in the department \nwere getting the same. As the years passed by, the pay differential \nbetween what she made and what the male managers were making just kept \ngetting bigger. She only found out about it from an anonymous note from \na coworker.\n  At trial, she was able to prove discrimination. But the company \nappealed the jury's finding, and the Supreme Court, in a five-to-four \ndecision, decided that Lilly filed her charge too late. Essentially, \nthey read the law to say that she would have had to file it within 180 \ndays of Goodyear making its first discriminatory decision.\n  Although this decision completely ignores the realities of the \nworkplace--that employee records are kept confidential and that there \nis no way to know when it starts unless we require women to start the \nembarrassing practice of asking what men make--we can do what Eleanor \nRoosevelt says. We can bring the realities to the light. We cannot \nexpect women to challenge practices they do not know are happening, and \nby passing this law we can start to give women those 4 months back--\nthose extra months it takes to allow them to catch up to their male \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act \npassed out of the committee 9 months ago, and 6 months ago I came to \nthe floor and asked that we consider it. I could not imagine there \nwould be any delay in wanting to bring critical help to our veterans.\n  This legislation expands eligibility for traumatic injury insurance \nunder the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance Program. It extends \nhousing benefits to individuals--veterans--with severe burns. It \nincreases benefits for veterans in apprenticeship or on-job training \nprograms. And it restores veteran status to Filipino veterans.\n  The bill had a positive vote coming out of committee, and the \nRepublican minority objected, 6 months ago, to bringing it up. Then, \nlast week, when we tried to bring up this bill to help the veterans \nagain, the Republicans initiated a filibuster trying to stop us from \nbringing this bill forward.\n  This morning, the Republican leader explained it was because the \nRepublicans need to sit down at noon and talk about the bill so they \nunderstand it. The bill has been out of committee for 9 months. It is \nvery clear what is in this bill. There was no need for a filibuster--\nexcept for the fact that is the strategy of the Republican minority.\n  So far, the Republicans have filed, during this legislative session, \n66 filibusters--and continue to file them--66 filibusters, including a \nfilibuster against this veterans' benefits enhancement bill. They \ncontinue to file these filibusters in an effort to slow down or stop \nthe Senate from considering legislation.\n  Last week, they wanted to stop a technical corrections bill that made \ncorrections in spelling and grammar and a few references in a bill \npassed years ago. It took us a full week to pass a bill, which should \nhave taken no time at all, because the Republicans slowed us down.\n  This week is even worse--that they would force a filibuster on a bill \nto help veterans. Why? Why in the world would they do that? From the \nbeginning, we said if they had an objection to any provision in this \nbill, they could offer an amendment. I know the Senator from North \nCarolina objects to giving Filipino war veterans--who served next to \nAmerican soldiers, risked their lives and died on behalf of Americans--\nthey object to the idea of giving $300 a month to the 18,000 surviving \nFilipino World War II veterans who would be eligible. They object to it \nbut will not come to the floor and just offer a motion to strike. No. \nThey will filibuster to drag this out for days at a time. This is not \nfair. It is not fair to the veterans who wait on this important \nlegislation. It certainly is not fair to the Filipino veterans.\n  You have to understand that during World War II, President Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt issued a military order calling to service the \nCommonwealth Army of the Philippines to stand next to American soldiers \nto fight and die. This entitled--many believe--those who served beside \nU.S. troops to some recognition from the United States of America. My \ngoodness, how many more years will we wait? Those 470,000 Filipino \nveterans risked their lives to save American lives and their homeland \nand to fight for the same values we treasure, and we have put them off \nthat long. A cloture motion was filed, forcing a vote today at noon.\n  I can tell you that the continued efforts by the Republican minority \nto stop and stall any efforts for change and progress is being noted by \nthe American people. We only have 51 Democrats. It takes 60 votes to \novercome a Republican filibuster, which means we need nine of them to \njoin us. Maybe they will at noon. But the obvious question is, Why did \nwe have to go through this? Why did we have to wait when there was an \nobjection last November? Why did we have to face a filibuster? It is \ncritical to pass the Veterans Benefits Enhancement Act and do what is \nright for our veterans and the Filipinos who stood beside our troops \nand fought in World War II.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me say this. It is disingenuous to come \nto the floor and suggest that I, or any Member of the minority, have \nstood in the way. I have stood in the way when the conditions to move \nforward were such that it diluted the minority's ability to represent \nits Members but, more importantly, the American people, and to limit us \nin the time of debate and in the amount of amendments. Yes, sir, it was \nnot offered to have a full and open debate. We are in the process--and, \nas I said, I urge my Members to vote for cloture. I am sorry we have to \nhave the vote, but that is the only thing that assures us the ability \nto have the time to debate these issues.\n  I think what you will find is how much we are all in agreement, which \nis 98 percent, and there is 2 percent on which we have a difference. I \nrespect the chairman and other Members who believe a special pension \nshould be set up for Filipino veterans who live in the Philippines and \nhave no service-connected injury. But I disagree with that as a \npriority over our guys.\n  So I plan to offer an amendment that I have never had an opportunity \nto\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\noffer which embraces 98 percent of what the chairman has in his bill, \nbut it elects to prioritize our soldiers in enhanced benefits over the \n$221 million that is now devoted to Filipino veterans who live in the \nPhilippines and have no service-connected injury.\n  I believe it is time for us to stand up for our guys versus that \nselect group to whom there was never a promise made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I again urge my colleagues to vote for \ncloture and express their support for consideration of S. 1315, the \nproposed ``Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007.'' This \ncomprehensive bill, reported by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nwould improve benefits and services for veterans, both young and old. \nWe should be debating and voting on this bill now. It has been on the \ncalendar since last August.\n  It is well past time for this body to address and resolve the \ndifferences of opinion on provisions in this bill--so active duty \nservice members, veterans, and their survivors can receive improvements \nto benefits for which they may be entitled without further delay.\n  Mr. President, I respect the fact that Members have different points \nof view on parts of this bill, but I do not understand why there is an \nunwillingness to debate.\n  As I noted yesterday, for seven months, all I have asked for is \ndebate on this bill. I reached out in October, November, and December \nof last year, in an effort to come to an agreement to hold that debate. \nThis session, my efforts to reach a time agreement or to negotiate, \nincluding in February after the committee's ranking member introduced \nan alternate bill to S. 1315, have been rejected time and time again.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that members of the minority have \ncontinually stood in the way of veterans receiving the enhanced \nbenefits they deserve. I am discouraged that they have not been willing \nto engage in debate--the business of the Senate. This is not the way \nthat we should be conducting business on behalf of those who have \nserved under the U.S. flag.\n  A number of things were mentioned yesterday by my colleague, the \ncommittee's ranking member, which seem to demonstrate significant \nconfusion about the process that has brought us here.\n  For example, the ranking member spoke of being asked to agree to no \namendments and limited debate time. That is simply not true. What I \nasked for was an agreement to limit amendments to the bill to only \nthose that relate to the bill. After identifying such amendments, we \nwould then seek to define the time needed to debate these amendments. \nThis represents the way the Senate most often gets its business done \nand certainly is the process that the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nfollows on those occasions when there is a need for floor debate.\n  It may be that my colleague does not believe there should be any \nlimitation on amendments to this bill.\n  If there is no limitation on what amendments can be offered during \ndebate of this bill, I anticipate that other Senators will bring \nforward a significant number of amendments. Some will be based on \nmeasures considered by the committee and not adopted. Some will be \nbased on measures that were debated by the committee and included in \nother bills now pending on the calendar. Some will represent issues not \nyet considered by the committee and thus not subjected to the hearing \nand debate process. And lastly, I am certain that a number of \namendments will represent issues not under this committee's \njurisdiction.\n  That does not appear to me to be a desirable way to get our business \ndone. However, if that is the ranking member's preference, let him say \nso.\n  Another misleading statement made by the ranking member was his \nsuggestion that the committee was not willing to talk about changes to \nthe bill. That statement cannot refer to the actual committee process \nlast year--where the provision relating to Filipino veterans was \nnoticed--and an amendment was offered--and debated.\n  After the bill was reported, I clearly expressed my willingness--on \nmultiple occasions--to reach a compromise on the pension provision. As \nI noted yesterday, the only debate raised in the committee was on the \namount of the pension for Filipino World War II veterans, not on \neliminating the pension entirely.\n  The provision prevailed in committee. Now the ranking member offers \none option: to give these elderly Filipino veterans nothing. That is \nnot a compromise.\n  I am ready to debate the core issue--but I am not prepared to abandon \na provision that I believe is right.\n  I believe it is the moral obligation of this Nation to provide for \nthose Filipino veterans--who fought under the U.S. flag during World \nWar II. We must act to ensure that these veterans are not left to live \nout their twilight years without acknowledgment that their service \nduring World War II is valued. I am not going to abandon them without a \nfight.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to agree to begin the process of \ndebating this bill. If cloture on the motion to proceed is achieved, I \nhope that the ranking member will join me and our party leaders to \ncraft a workable agreement that allows for a full debate on this bill--\nand on his amendment to it--along with any other amendments to \nprovisions in the bill. Once this bill is disposed of, our committee \nwill be in a position to bring forward other bills, including whatever \nbills we report out of committee later this year.\n  I look forward to a spirited and in- depth debate on this bill. This \nis a debate we could have had two months ago or even late last year. \nLet us not waste any more time. Let us work together to join the issues \nand have the Senate do its business. I ask my colleagues to join in \nvoting for cloture.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I have a deep respect for my chairman and \nfriend, Senator Akaka. I think the Senator has suggested that over the \ncourse of the last half year we have had some disagreements. I don't \nexpect him to know everything that has been communicated to staff or \nthat my staff communicated to his staff.\n  The reality is that we are here today, and we each respect each \nother. We are both honored to serve in the Senate. We both have the \nsame responsibility to the same people--and that is the American \ntaxpayers--to make sure we are fiscally responsible but, more \nimportantly, that we are prudent, that we prioritize things where they \nare needed the most.\n  At noon today we will have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to \nS. 1315. For one, I have mixed feelings about where we are in the \nprocess. I share the frustrations of Chairman Akaka. The proud \ntradition of the Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs has been to \nwrite laws that improve benefits and services for our veterans. Those \nlaws typically enjoy bipartisan support. As a result, the committee's \nbills have almost always passed by unanimous consent. In fact, I asked \nthe Senate Library to confirm that for me.\n  Since 1990, there have been only two rollcall votes on bills reported \nfrom the Committee on Veterans' Affairs: the first in the 102d Congress \nwhich cleared by a vote of 99 to 0; the second was in the 105th \nCongress and cleared by a vote of 98 to 0. There were no amendments \nthat received rollcall votes on either of those bills.\n  This tells me that Republicans and Democrats have always been able to \nreach a compromise on committee bills out of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. There has been no need for floor debate or rollcall votes \nwhen it comes to the veterans bills. The norm is to find a common \nagreement before moving forward, even on policy issues with which one \nside or the other may not agree.\n  This has changed during this Congress with the unprecedented vote on \ncloture that we will have today. The chairman, in the spirit of our \nrelationship, sent me a letter on, I believe, the 10th of the month \nrequesting that we work on this. The next day, the majority leader of \nthe Senate filed cloture. I am not sure how quickly I am supposed to \njump through the hoop for him, but I didn't do it fast enough. I say \nthat with the knowledge that the chairman and I both have that we are \nnot in charge. We don't always make the decisions on the course the \nSenate will follow.\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\n  Let me briefly outline for my colleagues the key disagreement that \nhas held up this bill for so long; namely, the provision that seeks to \nuse $221 million over the next 10 years to create a special pension for \nFilipino veterans who have no war injuries, are not U.S. citizens, and \nwho reside in the Philippines.\n  There are four groups of Filipino veterans. Here is a chart. There \nare the old scouts, who enlisted in the U.S. Army. They are veterans of \nthe U.S. Army through and through. You see in the benefits that is \nexactly what is displayed. We have the Commonwealth Army of the \nPhilippines, Recognized Guerilla Forces, and new Filipino Scouts, \nindividuals committed to the Armed Forces of the Philippines and, yes, \nat times were under U.S. command.\n\n  The important thing to notice is our disagreement is with the pension \nfor nonservice-connected disability and the death pension for \nsurvivors. It is the $221 million that is suggested to create a special \npension for 13,000 individuals whom I do not dislike. I do not want any \nMember of this Congress to think in any way that I devalue what they \ndid. But I have researched this in history, which we will get into over \nthis debate, that Congress never intended for something such as this to \nbe extended.\n  I, again, have profound respect for the World War II service of \nFilipino veterans. Their contribution to victory in the Pacific is a \nmatter of historical record. We honor them--I honor them--their \nservice, their sacrifice. We have good friends in the Philippines. But \nthe issue at hand is not the merit of the service rendered by Filipino \nveterans. The issue is whether creating a special pension for them in \nthe Philippines is responsive to the following questions:\n  Is it the right priority in time of war when the needs of our men and \nwomen serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are so great?\n  Two, is it appropriate policy, given the purpose of VA pensions and \nthe vast differences in the United States and Filipino economies?\n  And last, is it fair to U.S. pension recipients from whom this money \nis taken to pay for this special pension in the Philippines?\n  Let me ask that another chart be put up because I think it is \nabsolutely crucial that we understand exactly what we are talking about \nin a $300, or $221 million, special pension.\n  For a U.S. veteran, if they qualify for a special pension, we are \ngoing to get their annual stipend to $11,181, which is 17 percent of \nU.S. median income. We are going to take American veterans slightly \nabove the poverty level. If it is a married veteran couple, we are \ngoing to get them to $14,643, which is 22 percent of the median income \nin the United States and slightly above the level of poverty. Special \npensions were designed to make sure a veteran was out of poverty. We \nwere not putting them into the middle class in the United States, but \nwe were getting them out of poverty because that was the right thing to \ndo. If it is a surviving spouse in the United States, they get a \npayment of $7,498, which is 11 percent of the median income in the \nUnited States.\n  Today in the Philippines, the Filipino Government provides $120 a \nmonth pension for these 13,000 individuals Senator Akaka is targeting. \nI am not taking into account the $120 a month that the Philippine \nGovernment is providing for each one of these 13,000. But if they are a \nsingle veteran in the Philippines with the stipend that Senator Akaka's \nbill has, we will provide $3,600 a year, which will be 87 percent of \nthe median income of the Philippine economy. If you add in to that \nnumber the $120, we see they far exceed the median income of the middle \nclass of the Philippines. If, in fact, it is a married couple, the \nstipend from the United States in a special pension for a Filipino \nliving in the Philippines with no service-connected injury is $4,500, \n108 percent of the median income of a Philippine family; in the case of \na surviving spouse, $2,400, or 58 percent of the median income.\n  It is important to understand that the VA pension is designed for \nveterans who have no service-related injuries and who are poor, \naccording to the U.S. definition of poverty. The maximum VA pension \npayable to a U.S. veteran puts them 10 percent above the poverty \nthreshold and 17 percent of median income.\n  The Philippine Government, as I said, already provides a monthly \npension to Philippine veterans, putting them at roughly 400 percent \nover poverty with the $120 pension that the Philippine Government \nprovides, and 35 percent of the average income of the household. Adding \nan additional VA pension on top, as considered in S. 1315, would put a \nsingle Filipino veteran at roughly 1,400 percent over the Philippine \npoverty level.\n  What are we talking about in simplistic terms? We are going to allow \na U.S. veteran to get slightly over the poverty level. The percentage \nwas 10 percent. But we are going to create a special pension for \nFilipinos who live in the Philippines and have no service-connected \ndisability that is going to make their percentage over poverty 1,400 \npercent when U.S. veterans are at 10 percent over the poverty line and \n21 percent above the average household income.\n  A VA pension benefit is not designed to put a veteran in the middle \nclass. It certainly does not in the United States. I do not believe it \nis our responsibility to do it in the Philippines, and I do not believe \nin this time of war that it is a priority of this country.\n  It is meant to ensure that no wartime veterans suffer the indignity \nof poverty, whether you are in the Philippines or whether you are in \nthe United States. We have defined that in the United States as 10 \npercent above the poverty line.\n  I can argue that is not good enough, but I can certainly make the \ncase that going to 1,400 percent above the poverty line is not right. \nIt is not the right policy, and it is certainly not the right priority. \nCreating any new pension benefits for Filipinos in an effort to rectify \nwhat some call an injustice would only serve to create a new injustice \nfor U.S.-based veterans because of an enormous discrepancy in the two \nNations' economies.\n  As I said, I have deep respect for Senator Akaka. We will have a \nspirited debate, I am convinced, over the next 2 days, 3 days--whatever \nour leadership decides. That is where it gets out of our hands. I am \nwilling to do it. I have done my homework. I am willing to get into the \n1946 Senate hearings when the Senate debated an act where they took \nbenefits away because they researched it to find out if we promised \nveterans' benefits be extended. And the court's interpretation was they \nextended it and, quite frankly, the Congress in 1946 legislatively took \nthose benefits away that the court had awarded.\n  I have Senate hearings from 1948. And in the 1990s, I have the \nClinton administration that came to this body and lobbied that this was \nnot the right thing to do; they were not supportive of it. I am willing \nto share that information with all our colleagues, and over the next \ncouple of days, I think everybody will get a great history lesson on \nwhat happened with our decisions and who has testified since 1944 to \nthe Senate about this issue.\n  I do not expect any American who listens to be less than educated on \nwhether this is the right move or the wrong move. But I also believe my \ncolleagues will recognize the fact if we are establishing 10 percent \nabove poverty for U.S. veterans and we are down here talking about a \nspecial pension to individuals who live in the Philippines who have no \nservice-connected injury that is going to be 1,400 percent over \npoverty, this is the wrong thing for the Senate to do.\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield to my good friend and former \nranking member of the committee. But I do want to say before I yield to \nhim, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the cloture motion. I \nwant to proceed. I want to debate this issue. I want to make sure every \nMember of the Senate has an opportunity to hear the full breadth of \nwhat has happened since 1946, and I am prepared to do exactly that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand we are under a unanimous \nconsent agreement for a vote at 12 o'clock?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief, only to amplify what \nSenator\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\nBurr spoke to clearly and, I hope, understandably. First and foremost, \nunderstand that my relationship with the chairman of Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Danny Akaka, is a personal one and one of great affection. \nHere is a man today attempting to do the right thing and probably, in \nall fairness, is leading with his heart, and that I respect greatly.\n  There is no question, there remain in the Philippines 13,000 veterans \nwho fought gallantly to save their island from Japanese domination and \nfought with us and under our flag to do just that. They deserve to be \ncompensated, and they have been compensated.\n  Immediately following the war, the United States Government put $620 \nmillion into the repairs of the Philippines. In today's dollars, that \nis $6.7 billion.\n  Then we left a VA hospital in place so that these veterans could \nreceive first-class health care. And we did and they do and it is still \nthere and it is still operating.\n  Then we added $22 million--and that is worth $196 million in today's \ndollars--for equipment and construction. America did its part then, and \nit does its part today. The question is what is reasonable and right \ncompensation.\n  I stepped down as ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nlast September. In doing so, I was well aware of this bill, and the \nchairman knew at that time that I agreed with 99.9 percent of it. It is \na good bill. It is an important bill for America's veterans, and it \nought to be passed.\n  At that time, I thought I offered what was a reasonable compromise; \nthat we would reduce the level of the proposed increase in compensation \nto nonservice-connected Filipino veterans living in the Philippines; \nthat we would not lift them to the standard to which Senator Burr has \njust spoken; that they would deserve some help. The chairman had found \nan offset in a court ruling that took money away from our veterans, and \nit was sitting there.\n  I would have much preferred rewriting the law and reinstating that \nmoney to our veterans to abrogate the court decision, but we did not do \nthat. So I offered a compromise at that time. It was roundly rejected \nby the committee. It simply did not fit where the chairman wanted to \ngo. Therefore, from that point forward, I opposed the bill. It is a \nmatter of fiscal responsibility. It is a near quarter of a billion \ndollars over the next 10 years, and it does exactly what the ranking \nmember, Senator Burr, spoke to. It lifts these Filipino veterans above \ntheir poverty line into a middle-class status in Filipino society. \nWell, that is OK; none of us should deny that. But we don't do that for \nour veterans who live here. If you are a Filipino veteran living here \nlegally, you get full compensation as a veteran living in this country.\n  We do tie a benefit to a poverty level and a cost-of-living standard, \nand we always have. I certainly wish we could do more, but this budget \nis nearing $100 billion. The overall VA budget is nearing $100 billion. \nFour years ago, 11 percent; 3 years ago, 12 percent; 2 years ago, 13 \npercent; last year, an 18-percent increase. No budget in America, other \nthan defense, has increased that much. And why are we doing it? Because \ncollectively this Senate and this Congress have always believed in fair \nand responsible compensation to America's veterans--America's veterans.\n  We also try to compensate those who support us and work in our behalf \nas the veterans of the Filipino society did what is right and what is \nreasonable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I believe what the Senator has offered in \nthis Senate bill that is on the floor, S. 1315, is too much. There is a \nmiddle ground. I offered it once, and it was rejected. I hope we can \nrevisit that as a reasonable amendment when we get to the amendment \nprocess.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Akaka and Senator Burr, for their work \non this legislation. It is good legislation. With a little fine-tuning, \nthen it will be fair, and we ought to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I commend my ranking member and former \nranking member for their comments. I look forward to a good debate. I \nthank them for joining in asking for Senators to vote for cloture.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 336, S. 1315, the Veterans' Benefits \n     Enhancement Act.\n         Harry Reid, Daniel K.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 1315, a bill to amend title 38, United States \nCode, to enhance life insurance benefits for disabled veterans, and for \nother purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, would the Chair advise me, was the last \nvote 94 to nothing?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to say to the Chair and to all those \nfollowing this debate, we wasted 4 days of the Senate's time, 4 days to \ncome to a bill for veterans' benefits. We tried to bring this bill up \nlast November. The Republicans objected. We tried to bring it up last \nThursday, and they started a filibuster so we had to burn off 4 or 5 \ndays.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We had to burn off 4 or 5 days of doing nothing because \nof another Republican filibuster. So far in this Congress the \nRepublicans have initiated now 67 filibusters. The record in the \nCongress before this Republican minority was 57 filibusters over a 2-\nyear period of time. They have now broken that record by 10, and we \nstill have 8 months to go this year.\n\n[[Page S3226]]\n\n  We are wasting more time. When I ask the Republicans why did you \nfilibuster a bill for veterans' benefits, they said because when we \nhave lunch today, we want to talk it over.\n  This bill was reported by the veterans committee 9 months ago. How \nmany veterans have been created in 9 months? How many more have needed \njob training, health care benefits, and housing, and now our Republican \nminority wants to talk it over?\n  If we are going to do the people's business in this Chamber, this \nfilibuster mentality on the Republican side has to come to an end. \nThere are critically important issues. Wouldn't it be great if we had \nfinished the veterans health bill last Thursday and could have started \ndebating today the cost of gasoline across America; the impact of high \ndiesel fuel prices on truckers; what the jet fuel costs are doing to \nthe airline industry? But no, another Republican filibuster, the 67th \nfilibuster in this session.\n  I hope the people of the United States understand what the problem \nis. To break a filibuster, it takes 60 votes. There are only 51 \nDemocrats. The voters of America will have their chance to vote in \nNovember.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Isn't it the case the vote we had is on the motion to \nproceed? This is not on the issue, this is on the motion to proceed to \nan issue? So we have a filibuster on the question of shall we proceed. \nTime after time after time, isn't it the case that even on motions to \nproceed, we discover the other side demands 60 votes, then demands to \nhave the full 30 hours elapse after the vote has taken place? This one \nwas, I think, 94 to zero. There was a requirement that we go to a \nmotion to proceed--94 to zero--so it was not controversial, it was a \nmatter of bleeding time. It makes no sense, with all that we have to \ndo.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair I say in response to the Senator: That \nis exactly the case. I would like to make a unanimous consent request \nthat we go to the bill immediately and entertain germane amendments to \nthe bill. Let's start this bill right now. Let's get this done for the \nveterans. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I object.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President? I would like to \nask the Senator from Illinois if germane amendments include a \nsubstitute amendment? I have heard the debate, or at least the \nstatements of the two Senators. But the issue is not going to the bill. \nWe have not filibustered the motion to proceed. It was unanimous. The \nquestion is are the minority rights going to be recognized? Will we be \nable to offer amendments, germane amendments, substitutes?\n  I would like to know, before we proceed further to the bill, if we \nare going to be able to have enough amendments so the minority rights \nare protected.\n  That would be my question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Chair identify the Senator who objected to the \nunanimous consent request to move to the bill immediately and consider \nall germane amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I happened to be here for the vote. You know, this is a \ngame that has been played by both sides, last year and this year too. \nThe majority calls up a bill, they generally file cloture. And, \nfrankly, that does not mean there is a filibuster. As you can easily \nsee, the vote was basically unanimous to going ahead with the bill.\n  What bothers me is that time after time we have had situations where \nwe were not able to even offer amendments, even a limited number of \namendments. But generally we get to that point around here because we \nhave to. And it is the only right the minority has. So that is one \nreason that occasionally the minority will require cloture.\n  But there is also too much of this filing cloture by the majority the \nminute the bill comes up. That, of course, is a game, frankly, with no \nintention on our side to filibuster the bill or stop the bill.\n  So these high numbers that are said are mythical, to be honest with \nyou. And, frankly, I hope someday we can realize that this is a \nlegislative body where both sides have certain rights and that one side \ncannot roll over the other side without at least giving them an \nopportunity to file amendments.\n  Frankly, the other side, the majority side, has been able to win on \namendments anyway in many cases. I think to stand and say that the \nRepublicans are causing all of this mixup is not quite as accurate, as \nI think the record will show.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     International Food Assistance\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Last year, the World Health Organization reported that \n25,000 people died every day from hunger-related causes. Let me repeat \nthat number: 25,000 people who died every day last year.\n  The World Health Organization further reported that of that 25,000 \npeople who died, 18,000 were children. That means that in the time it \ntook me to say that last sentence, a child somewhere in the world has \ndied. It also means before I finish this sentence, another child will \nhave died from hunger. For lack of food, a child dies every 4.8 \nseconds.\n  As grim as these facts are, things have grown worse, much worse. We \nare witnessing what could be called a perfect storm of world hunger. \nThe world's supply of food is down, food demand is up, the climate is \nchanging, and crops are failing.\n  Food production resources are shifting every day to energy \nproduction, food costs are skyrocketing, and, indeed, entire societies \nare falling apart as a result. This is not another round of appeals for \nhumanitarian food assistance. There is something new and very troubling \noccurring.\n  One of the greatest responsibilities of Government is to assure \npeople the basic necessities of life. When that assurance fails, \ngovernments fail with it, and an already insecure world moves that much \ncloser to chaos. The most basic need, of course, is the need for food. \nHowever, in recent events around the globe, 33 countries have \nexperienced riots and violence because of a failed food supply, \nincluding countries in this hemisphere. In the face of hunger, order \nbreaks down, and reason is lost. People are painfully realizing that \nfood production is not keeping up with food demand, and this is a \nrecipe for global disaster.\n  Last month, the Director of the World Food Program, Joesette Sheeran, \nwrote to President Bush on the immediate need for increased food \nassistance due to rising food and related costs. I met with Director \nSheeran last week and got a firsthand appraisal of the dire situation.\n  Rising food and transportation costs have created a $750 million hole \nin the World Food Program budget which had assumed that the U.S. \ncontribution this year would include a pending $350 million \nsupplemental request for PL 480.\n  Unless this Congress acts, thousands of people will die, and an \nincreasing number of societies and nations will be at risk. This is \nindeed a world crisis.\n  Last week, OMB Director Nussle appeared before the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, and when asked to state whether he thought \nthere was a need to provide food assistance above the President's \nrequest of $350 million, he declined. He dodged the question.\n  There is no way to dodge this problem. This is a problem of world \nsecurity. This is a problem of U.S. security and our place in the \nworld. We must and we will respond.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, I take \nthe issue of international food assistance very seriously. Although the \nPresident's supplemental request of $350 million was predictable--after \nall, he has requested the exact same amount for 3 years in a row--it is \ntotally blind as to what is happening in the world. It is therefore \nvery dangerous.\n  If the United States wants to maintain its role as a world leader, \nthere is no better way to do that than to step forward now, take full \naccount of what is happening, and take meaningful steps to stop the \nsuffering, to stop the\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\nhunger, stop the dying. In fact, it is time to be a leader.\n  So I will continue to work for food funding assistance at a level \nthat does not turn a blind eye to the suffering in the world, nor the \ndanger to the world community. So I ask other Senators to join me in \nstating support to fight this perfect storm of world hunger and to \nsupport action to do something about it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, tomorrow we will have a vote to proceed--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has an order to recess.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 6 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank you all for indulging me.\n\n\n                              Fair Pay Act\n\n  Tomorrow we will have a vote to proceed to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair \nPay Restoration Act. Four of my Democratic female colleagues spoke on \nthis earlier today--four or five. I wanted to add my voice to their \nvoices because, as I stand on the floor of the Senate some 45 years \nafter passage of the Equal Pay Act, it is unfortunate that workers \nthroughout the Nation will suffer pay discrimination based on gender, \nrace, religion, national origin, disability, and age. They still suffer \nthis.\n  We still have a long way to go on equal pay for equal work. It stuns \nsome people to learn that women still earn 23 percent less than men, \nand the pay disparity is still so great that it takes a woman 16 months \nto earn what a man earns in 12 months.\n  In 2006, an average college-educated woman working full time earned \n$15,000 less than a college-educated male. According to the American \nAssociation of University Women, working families lose $200 billion in \nincome per year due to the wage gap.\n  This is an important point because so many women now work. We know \nthis. So families are struggling to make ends meet with higher gas \nprices, higher college tuition, higher food prices, higher health care, \nall of that. We know there is not an easy solution that will eliminate \nall pay discrimination, but the bill we hope to go to tomorrow, the \nEqual Pay Restoration Act, will ensure that when an employer \ndiscriminates based on gender or race or any other factor, the employee \ncan take his or her case to court.\n  There was a very bad decision that was made by the Supreme Court \nwhich reversed decades of legal precedent, and this was the Ledbetter \ndecision. With its decision, the Court imposed a serious obstacle for \nequality, equal pay, by requiring workers to file a pay discrimination \nclaim within 180 days of when their employer first starts \ndiscriminating.\n  Now, that is an impossible standard to meet. You really do not know \nwhen that moment occurs. What was important about this decision is it \nthrew out the law that had always worked well and would have protected \npeople such as Lilly Ledbetter from discrimination.\n  Her story is not unfamiliar to many female employees. She was a \nfemale, she was a manager at an Alabama Goodyear Tire plant when she \ndiscovered, after 19 years of service, that she was earning 20 to 40 \npercent less than her male counterparts for doing the exact same job.\n  It took her a long time to ferret this information out. As Justice \nGinsburg noted in her dissenting opinion, the pay discrepancy between \nLedbetter and her 15 male counterparts was stark. In 1997, her last \nyear of employment at Goodyear, after 19 years of service she earned \n$5,600 less than her lowest paid male coworkers, and she earned over \n$18,000 less than her highest paid male coworkers.\n  Evidence submitted at her trial showed that Mrs. Ledbetter was denied \nraises, despite receiving performance awards, and in some cases female \nsupervisors at the plant were paid less than the male employees they \nsupervised.\n  So when Ms. Ledbetter discovered this, she took Goodyear to court, \nand the jury awarded her full damages. But the company, Goodyear, \nappealed the jury's decision.\n  In 2007 the Supreme Court made this very bad decision and said she \ncould not sue for back pay despite--and with which they agreed--the \noverwhelming evidence that her employer had intentionally discriminated \nagainst her because of her gender.\n  But, they said, it took Lilly Ledbetter longer than 6 months to \ndetermine she had been a victim of years of pay discrimination. So, in \nother words, because it took her more than 6 months to figure this out, \nshe was denied any kind of help.\n  It does take a significant amount of time in many cases for the truth \nto be known. Here in the Capitol, if you work for the Government, \neverybody's pay is on record. And you can see it; it is a public \ndocument. But in a private sector plant there may be no way to find \nout.\n  As Justice Ginsburg pointed out: Compensation disparities are often \nhidden from sight for a number of reasons. Many employers do not \npublish their employees' salaries, and other employees are not anxious \nto discuss what they earn. So this controversial decision is having \nserious impacts.\n  In the 10 months since the decision was handed down, the Ledbetter \nprecedent has been cited 207 times by Federal district courts and \ncourts of appeal. So it means, it seems to me from what I gather, from \nthat statistic alone, many people are being denied equal treatment \nunder the law: equal pay, equal treatment.\n  So what does the bill do that we want to go to, we Democrats on \nWednesday, tomorrow? It simply restores the law to what it was in \nalmost every State in the country before the Ledbetter case was \ndecided. It does so by helping to eliminate the unreasonable barrier \ncreated by the Supreme Court and allows workers to file a pay \ndiscrimination claim within 180 days of each discriminatory paycheck. \nThat was the law before Ledbetter.\n  The Ledbetter decision was a giant step backward in the fight for \nequal opportunity and equal rights. Goodyear engaged in chronic \ndiscrimination against female employees, but because of the Ledbetter \ndecision, the Court must treat intentional ongoing pay discrimination \nas lawful conduct.\n  Employers who can conceal their pay discrimination for 180 days can \ncontinue this practice, and there is no redress. We must ask ourselves: \nIs this the standard that Congress should be proud of? Is this the kind \nof standard that we should support, where somebody is treated in an \nunfair fashion, is paid less than somebody else simply because of their \ngender?\n  It is not right. It seems to me, if we are going to have fairness and \njustice in America today, the least we can do is overturn the Ledbetter \ndecision. Justice Ginsburg told us: ``Congress, the ball is in your \ncourt.''\n  That is why I am so pleased that Senator Reid is bringing this \nopportunity before us tomorrow. Today, as we reflect upon the \nimportance of fairness and equity to our society with a celebration of \nEqual Pay Day, we must restore this important protection and return the \nlaw to its meaning. I hope tomorrow when we get a chance to move to \nthis bill our colleagues will all vote aye because what is fair is fair \nand what is wrong is wrong. We need to fix this problem. Equal pay for \nequal work is a value that we should hold dear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3227-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask a few minutes of the Senate's time \nto\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\ntell you about four men and a little boy.\n  Last Friday, Stanko Bojanovic decided to take advantage of a warm, \nbreezy spring afternoon to enjoy a walk with his 2-year-old grandson \nalong Lake Michigan near Belmont Harbor in downtown Chicago.\n  Mr. Bojanovic was sitting on a park bench at Belmont Harbor with his \ngrandson nearby strapped in a stroller at his side, when a strong gust \nof wind blew up. Witnesses said the wind sent soda cans sailing by. \nThat wind also pushed the stroller into the harbor with the little boy \nstill strapped in.\n  Mr. Bojanovic, the grandfather, immediately jumped into the harbor. \nPassersby saw him bobbing in the water, clinging to the side of the \nbreakwall, and pleaded with him to try to swim to a nearby rescue \nladder but the grandfather refused. In broken English, he kept yelling, \n``Boy! Boy!''\n  Those standing nearby grabbed their cell phones and called 9-1-1.\n  At the moment the call came in, a helicopter carrying Chicago Fire \nDepartment divers Brian Otto and Bill Davis was lifting off from nearby \nMidway Airport, where they had stopped for fuel. The men were already \nin scuba gear for a drill. Four minutes later, their helicopter landed \nat the harbor.\n  At almost the same moment, another crew of a dozen Chicago Fire \nDepartment rescue divers were finishing an underwater training exercise \nat a pool not far from the harbor. They changed into scuba gear and \narrived at the harbor just seconds after the helicopter.\n  Divers Brian Otto, Bill Davis, Cedric Collins, and Bob Skwarek dove \ninto the water near where the grandfather had pointed. There was zero \nvisibility in the murky water so they searched in a grid pattern, \nfeeling their way along the harbor's rocks.\n  Diver Cedric Collins told a Chicago Sun Times reporter that he \nprayed, ``Let me find him.''\n  Less than 3 minutes after the firefighters arrived, diver Brian Otto \nspotted the little boy's hair waving in the water.\n  As he tried to lift the toddler, Otto realized that the boy was still \nstrapped into his stroller. He was going to have to lift the little boy \nand his stroller 10 feet to the water's surface.\n  Otto, who has a little 4-year-old son of his own, told the Sun Times: \n``You see this kid underwater, and you're a firefighter, you're a \nrescue diver, but you're also a father. I held nothing back.'' He told \nhimself: ``No matter what, we're going to get to the surface. And we're \ndoing it now.'' He lifted the little boy, stroller and all, to \nparamedics waiting on the pier.\n  Three minutes passed between the time the firefighters arrived and \nthe time they pulled the little boy, Lazar Ognjenovich from the water. \nHis body was pale blue and icy cold. It is estimated that he was under \nwater for 15 minutes.\n  Today, little Lazar Ognjenovich remains in critical condition at \nChildren's Hospital in Chicago.\n  Medical researchers not involved in the case say there is reason to \nhope. They note that toddlers are sometimes able to survive long \nperiods underwater better than adults and point to a Utah girl who was \nsubmerged in water for 66 minutes in 1986. Two years later, when an \narticle about her appeared in a medical journal, she had made a full \nrecovery.\n  Lazar's grandmother said Sunday that the little boy is showing signs \nof improvement. She notes that last Saturday--the day after his \nrescue--was ``Lazarus Saturday,'' a special holiday for Serbian \nchildren. She told a Sun Times reporter that she believes God was \nwatching over her grandson.\n  As for the brave men who rescued the little boy--Brian Otto, Bill \nDavis, Cedric Collins and Bob Skwarek, members of the Chicago Fire \nDepartment's Air Sea Rescue Unit and Scuba Team 687--they were all back \nat work the next day.\n  In a story in this morning's Sun Times, Bob Skwarek said that rescue \ndivers train for moments like the one they experienced last Friday. \nStill, he said, ``You really do feel 10 feet tall'' after a rescue.\n  Bill Davis and Cedric Collins have both been with the Chicago Fire \nDepartment for 9 years and with the scuba team for about a year and a \nhalf. Brian Otto has been with the department for 18 years and a diver \nfor 3\\1/2\\ years. And Bob Skwarek has been with the fire department for \n28 years and a diver for about 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  They come from the neighborhoods of North and South Chicago: Mount \nGreenwood, Hegewisch, Roseland and Gage Park.\n  They have won praise from Chicago Fire Commissioner Ray Orozco and \nfrom people all over that great city who have read or heard about their \nheroism. They deserve every word of that praise.\n  In his great book Working, Studs Terkel, the legendary Chicago \nwriter, and a great friend interviewed all kinds of everyday working \npeople about their jobs.\n  Many of the jobs involved risk and backbreaking labor. Some of the \npeople Studs spoke to disliked the work they did.\n  He also spoke to a firefighter, who said he liked his work very much \nbecause you can actually see what a firefighter produces. You see the \nresults of firefighters' work and sacrifice in homes saved, families \nrescued. And sometimes you see the results of their heroism in little \nboys pulled miraculously from the waters of Lake Michigan.\n  On 9/11, we all received a poignant and painful reminder that the \nreal heroes very often are not famous. Most are known only to their \nfamilies and friends and the people with whom they work.\n  Many times since 9/11, we seem to have forgotten that basic truth.\n  Last Friday at Belmont Harbor, four firefighters from the great City \nof Chicago reminded us.\n  I ask that this Senate join me in saluting their courage and the \ncourage of all the working men and women in this country who take risks \nand make sacrifices to rescue others, literally and figuratively. They \nare truly American heroes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                             Equal Pay Day\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our majority leader and our \nleadership for scheduling a vote on what is known as the Ledbetter \nlegislation tomorrow. We expect that we will have that vote tomorrow \nevening sometime. I think it is important that the membership \nunderstand that we will. It is appropriate today that we have a number \nof our colleagues speak about the importance of this legislation \nbecause today is Equal Pay Day. It has been designated Equal Pay Day. \nIt has been Equal Pay Day for a number of years.\n  What do we mean by Equal Pay Day? We mean equal pay for equal work. \nThat has been a goal of this country going back actually to 1963, when \nwe passed the Equal Pay Act. At that time, the disparity between men \nand women for doing the same job was 60 cents to the dollar that the \nmen were getting. We have seen that figure close over time, now to 77 \ncents, but still there is a disparity. As long as we have had a \ndisparity, it has been and is wrong.\n  As a country, we have tried to remove forms of discrimination, \nbigotry, and prejudice that have existed in our society, and the \nbigotry and prejudice that exist in terms of pay has been there for \nsome time. Since 1963, the Congress has taken action not only on pay \nfor women but in terms of other groups as well. It has made progress in \nmaking sure that African Americans are not going to feel a disparity. \nWe did that in 1964 with Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act under \nPresident Johnson. Look at the Senate vote, the ultimate vote, 73 to \n27. Republicans and Democrats alike said--the Civil Rights Act was \nprimarily focused on public accommodations provisions but also had \nanother very important provision--we will not permit a disparity and \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, national origin, gender, or \nreligion in terms of pay. African Americans and other workers were \ngoing to be able to get equal pay.\n  Then, we have the age discrimination. We said, under President \nJohnson, if individuals are going to be able to do the job, and they \nhappen to be older but yet they have the competency and the skills and \nthey are going to be able to do an equal job, we are going to make sure \nthey are not going to be discriminated against. We have said women will \nnot be discriminated against, minorities will not be discriminated \nagainst, and people will not be discriminated against by age.\n  In 1973, we said: Well, what about those who have some disability? We\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\nsaid we are not going to discriminate against those people either. \nMaybe they have a mental or a physical disability, but if they are able \nto do the job, and they are qualified to do the job, they ought to get \npaid for doing the job. That is what we said. We saw that vote was a \nvoice vote, under President Nixon, supported by the administration.\n  Then, we had later provisions: the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nwhich was enacted to provide greater kinds of protections for the \ndisabled; additional civil rights protections; and others; the Civil \nRights Restoration Act. So the sum total, since 1963, has been a \nconstant drumbeat, a constant march, a constant statement by the \nCongress and by the administrations by, as we have seen, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, that said: When it comes to equal pay, it is going \nto be equal pay for women and for men, it is going to be equal pay for \npeople with disabilities, older workers, African-American workers, \nHispanic workers, and others. This chart shows the various groups that, \nunder the EEOC'd laws, have found out they have been discriminated \nagainst.\n  This chart shows, as of a year ago, in 2007, the EEOC had received \nmore than 7,000 pay discrimination claims. Here it is for disability \ncases--as I mentioned earlier, we passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act--and for national origin cases--we have protections \nfor that group, those people who come from different kinds of ethnic \nbackgrounds--for age, race, and gender discrimination as well.\n  We see that with regard to race, there have been 2,300 claims; with \nregard to gender, there have been some 2,400 claims. There are the \ncases for those with disabilities and the national origin cases. These \nare cases that were brought because we passed laws over the period of \n40 years that said: If you are going to work, and work hard, in the \nUnited States of America, and you are going to do effectively the same \njob as someone else, you should be paid the same. We have not solved \nall the problems of comparability in this legislation. That is another \nissue which is enormously important and one we should address, and I \nhope we will address, in this Congress because it is extremely \nimportant. All we are trying to do is deal with the pieces of \nlegislation that I have mentioned and restore a remedy. We can have a \nright and, as all of us understand, a right is not worth very much if \nwe do not have a remedy. That is what this legislation is all about: to \ngive a remedy to victims of pay discrimination, like Lilly Ledbetter. \nThe remedy is that when workers are given unfair pay for doing \neffectively comparable work, that they are entitled as a matter of \nright and a matter of law to fair compensation.\n  It is interesting, in the dissent in the Ledbetter case, the dissent \nasks for congressional action. We are giving congressional action. That \nis why I am going to be interested in the arguments of those who are \nopposed to it. Here a Justice of the Supreme Court invites the Congress \nto take the action. We are taking the action. What we are effectively \ndoing is restoring the law to what it was prior to the Supreme Court \ndecision--nothing more than that.\n  I will review what exactly this law does here. What this legislation, \nthe Ledbetter legislation, does, is it reverses the Supreme Court's \nunfair Ledbetter decision. It holds employers accountable for ongoing \ndiscrimination. As we pointed out, the Supreme Court held that Lilly \nLedbetter should have known she was being discriminated against by her \nemployer on pay, even though the employer controlled the books, \ncontrolled all the documents and was not sharing that information with \nthe employees. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court said: Well, she should \nhave found out in any event. If she did not, it is tough luck on her. \nTough luck on you. Tough luck on you. Imagine, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, after all of the legislation and all of the \ncongressional intent in the last 40 years, saying: Tough on you.\n  So the employer holds it in a safe, and Lilly Ledbetter cannot find \nit. Tough on her. Doesn't have a remedy. Too bad. Go ahead and continue \nto discriminate. In the United States of America, after what we have \ngone through in terms of civil rights--the battle to knock down the \nwalls of discrimination over the period of these last 40 years? Tough \non you.\n  Is that what we have come to? Is that what the Supreme Court is \nsaying to a hard-working mother who has worked hard, tried to provide \nfor her children, has demonstrated and won award after award for good \nperformance? Tough on you. You could not find it in that sacred safe of \nthe employer. Too bad. You lost your remedies. Too bad.\n  That is what this is all about. What we are doing is restoring \ncongressional intent.\n  So what this legislation does not do: It does not encourage workers \nto delay the filing of claims. It does not eliminate the statute of \nlimitations in the pay cases. It does not increase the litigation. We \nhave the CBO's analysis. I have referred to it. It does not create new \ngrounds for filing lawsuits. We answered all of these arguments. This \nis what it does not do. We have given the answers. They are not just my \nanswers, they are the answers of the CBO's independent review.\n  What we are basically doing, and the reason why we are doing it, is \nto effectively restore the law to what it was previously. As this chart \nindicates: the lighter green being what the law was previously--that is \nwhat we are returning it to--the darker green being what the law was as \ninterpreted by the EEOC, and the orange were the dissenting states. So \nthis is going back to the previous rule.\n\n  This would be right to do at any time, but it is particularly \nimportant now. The reason it is particularly important now is because \nof the kind of economic conditions we are facing in this country at \nthis time, where families are being squeezed. Working families are \nbeing squeezed. The middle class is being squeezed. In that squeeze, no \none is getting squeezed harder than the women in our society, \nparticularly working women. Their participation pension and retirement \nplans is falling. Look at what has happened to women's participation in \npensions over the last 6 or 7 years. It has dropped, I think, close to \n10 percent. We are finding out that their rates of unemployment are \nincreasing faster than the unemployment figures in terms of men. Their \nsavings are down. Women's savings are down. So they have a greater \ndifficulty in dealing with the economic reversals we are facing at the \npresent time. They have more home foreclosures because their savings \nhave been down. So they are under an incredible squeeze.\n  This chart is an example of how adult women are seeing a sharper rise \nin their unemployment rate. Their rate is going up 21 percent as \ncompared to 15 percent for men. On earnings, women's earnings are \nfalling faster than men's. So their earnings are going down faster. We \nare finding out that their unemployment is going up faster and their \nearnings are going down faster.\n  If you take what happens to different women within the general group, \nlook at women's net worth. Unmarried women have $13,000 less in net \nsavings than unmarried men. Here it is, the difference, as shown on \nthis chart. So in this time of recession and economic stress, these \nissues become much more acute. This is the right answer at any time, \nbut it is particularly something that can be done now that can make a \ndifference to these working women--something that can be done now: \nrestore a right. That is what this is basically all about.\n  As I mentioned, this is targeted on women, but the application is \nacross the board. It affects other groups in our society. It affects \nAfrican Americans and Hispanics, and they have been hard hit by the \neconomic downturn. If pay is discriminatory against African Americans \nand Hispanics--and we saw the pie chart, which shows it is, with \nthousands of claims every single year--they are going to be denied the \nremedy. This legislation applies to women. It applies to minorities. It \napplies to people discriminated against because of their religion. It \napplies to the disabled. It applies to older workers. Otherwise, they \nare going to get shortchanged. They are facing the economic realities \nin a much harsher way now.\n  We have an opportunity to do something about it. The House of \nRepresentatives has done something about it. Tomorrow we can do \nsomething about it. Show me something, anything, any piece of \nlegislation that can have a better, more positive impact in terms of \nthe income of working women than this vote tomorrow. That is what it is \nabout.\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\n  Finally, let me give you these figures to demonstrate what this meant \nto Lilly Ledbetter. This is a reflection of what was actually in the \nCourt's decision. She was making $44,000 a year. She received $5,600 \nless than the lowest paid male coworker during her last year at \nGoodyear. The highest paid male coworker was getting $62,000. She had \nthe qualifications and was doing the job the same as her colleague who \ngot $62,000. The lowest paid male worker--whose skills were much less \nthan Lilly Ledbetter's--was still getting paid more. You cannot get it \nany clearer than this chart about what the facts are. These are not \nfacts I am making up. These are the facts accepted by the courts, not \nquestioned by the Supreme Court. There it is.\n  The most powerful is listening to Lilly Ledbetter herself. She has \ntestified. Anyone who is interested ought to read her testimony, and \ncan read through the hearings in our committee about this. She explains \nit in great detail: how she first heard about it, and how she was \ntreated, and what the Supreme Court decided. She has taken a double \nwhammy because not only has she suffered, and will not recover her \nwages. We have a 2-year limitation on back pay--you can only recover in \nterms of the 2 years. Her retirement was based upon what she earned and \nso that has also been lost during this period of time. That was lost, \nwill be lost, continues to be lost. Imagine that. Imagine the \nunfairness of that. We are not addressing that. We are not dealing with \nthat. We should be, but we are not. That is basically and fundamentally \nwrong.\n  I mentioned earlier the CBO. The Congressional Budget Office agrees \nthat the Fair Pay Restoration Act will not increase the litigation. The \nFair Pay Restoration Act will not establish a new cause of action for \nclaims in pay discrimination. CBO experts said the bill would not \nsignificantly affect the number of filings with the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission. What they are basically saying is, what this \nwill do is it will have the law enforced and people will pay attention \nto it.\n  Many employers are, obviously, good employers, and are playing by the \nrules. But not all of them are. Those who are not playing by the rules \nshould not be able to exploit people in the workplace on the basis of \ntheir gender, race, national origin, religion, disabilities or age.\n  Finally, we have seen--and I have shown this chart previously of the \nvarious groups that support this legislation. These are only some of \nthe groups. I have included a more complete list in the Record. We have \nthe groups representing the disabilities community, the American \nAssociation of People with Disabilities; elderly people, the AARP feels \nvery strongly about the discrimination against the elderly; the NAACP, \nfor the obvious reasons, not only because of discrimination on the \nbasis of race, but all the forms of discrimination they continue to \nfight and oppose. We have the auto workers, who see prejudice and \ndiscrimination and who are fighting for full rights and equality. We \nhave the National Congress of Black Women and the Religious Action \nCenter, because of the moral issues raised by this. And we have the \nU.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  We will have an opportunity to address this and speak more about it. \nI cannot think of an issue where it is more an issue of fundamental \nfairness. Americans try to understand some of the complex issues about \nwhich we deal here. They are not always easy to understand and to catch \nand find their way through. Probably one of the great mysteries is the \nERISA law, which was put in by our old friend Jacob Javits. An amusing \naspect of that was when Jacob Javits passed on to his eternal reward, \nhe took all the knowledge about ERISA with him. All of us find \ncomplexities in trying to deal with that. It has important implications \nin terms of health and the job market.\n  This is simple. Everyone gets it. The American people understand it, \nbecause it is about fairness. If there is one issue Americans \nunderstand, it is fairness. They believe that when somebody works, they \nought to be adequately paid. Americans don't believe one person ought \nto be paid a different rate for doing the same job as another person. \nThey don't believe that because their skin is a different color, or \nbecause of gender, or because of disability, or because of sexual \norientation they should be paid less. They don't believe it. If the \nperson is qualified to do the job, and does the job, they ought to get \nequal pay. This Senate has gone on record time and time and time and \ntime again over the last 40 years, by overwhelming votes, against pay \ndiscrimination. We have our chance tomorrow to restate that commitment. \nI hope the vote will be overwhelmingly in favor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           High Energy Prices\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, our Nation faces record high energy \nprices, affecting almost every aspect of daily life. The price of \ngasoline, home heating oil, and diesel is creating tremendous hardships \nfor American families, for truckdrivers, and for small businesses. High \nenergy prices are a major cause of the current economic downturn.\n  It is clear we need a dramatic change in our energy policy to protect \nourselves from rapid increases in oil prices, without sacrificing our \nenvironment for future generations. We must rally around a national \neffort to achieve energy independence for our economic, environmental, \nand national security.\n  I have recommended that we establish a national goal of energy \nindependence by the year 2020. I don't know if we can get all the way \nto energy independence by that year, but I do know if we do not \nestablish a goal, if we do not strive to achieve energy independence by \na date certain, we will never get there. I believe that had our country \nembraced this goal in the 1970s, when we were reacting to the embargo, \nwe would be nearly at energy independence right now.\n  I am proposing today a 10-point plan to get us started on this \nimportant effort. It is a plan that includes both actions that we can \ntake in the short run to help mitigate the impact of high prices, as \nwell as actions to achieve energy independence in the long term.\n  Many causes appear to be responsible for the skyrocketing increase in \noil prices: the timing of Government purchases for the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve; speculative trading on futures markets; increased \nglobal demand for crude oil; instability in the Middle East, Mexico, \nand Venezuela; supply decisions of the OPEC cartel; insufficient U.S. \nrefining capacity; and the declining value of the dollar.\n  We will always use oil for part of our energy needs, but we need to \ndecrease our reliance on foreign oil and be smarter about managing our \nsupplies. It is appropriate that Senator Levin is in the chair as I \ndiscuss the first step that I believe we should take right now to help \ncurb the increase in oil prices.\n  The administration's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nwhen oil prices are at all-time highs defies common sense. As the \nPresiding Officer is well aware, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is an \nemergency stockpile of oil that already contains some 700 million \nbarrels. In 2005, the Presiding Officer, Senator Carl Levin of \nMichigan, and I joined forces on a bipartisan amendment that directed \nthe Department of Energy to better manage the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve by requiring the Department to avoid purchases when prices are \nhigh.\n  There are two reasons why that should be done. First, the Federal \nGovernment should not be removing oil from the marketplace at a time \nwhen there is a lot of pressure on supplies, as there is right now.\n\n  Second, it makes absolutely no sense for the Department of Energy to \nbe buying oil at the height of the market. That is a bad deal for us as \ntaxpayers. Unfortunately, I don't believe the Department of Energy is \nabiding by the Levin-Collins law. We questioned the Department at a \nrecent hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and \nthere was no indication that the kind of analysis the law requires is \nbeing done. So I have called upon the President to stop filling the \nreserve until prices drop. It simply\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\ndoes not make sense for the administration to be making purchases right \nnow.\n  The Energy Information Administration has estimated that the impact \non gas prices of these purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is \nbetween 4 and 5 cents a gallon. Other experts believe it is \nconsiderably higher than that. At the hearing I mentioned, one energy \nexpert said:\n\n       DOE's actions added between 5 and 20 percent to the price \n     of oil.\n\n  The Department of Energy should stop purchasing oil for the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, and it should stop immediately. There is simply no \ncompelling homeland security or national security reason for these \npurchases to be made now.\n  No. 2, we need to extend Federal regulation to the oil futures \nmarkets. Excessive speculation on futures markets is likely another \nfactor pushing up oil prices. Unfortunately, there is a lack of \npublicly available data to track the effect of speculation on prices, \nand manipulation can go undetected on certain electronic markets that \nare unregulated. Experts testifying before our Investigations \nSubcommittee all agreed that greater transparency and better reporting \nof trades could help prevent abuses such as were documented in the \nnatural gas markets in 2006. One of the experts testified that he \nbelieved the current high oil prices are inflated by as much as 100 \npercent--driven by excessive speculation. Other experts think it is not \nthat high. But shouldn't we know and the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, which oversees the trading of agricultural commodities on \nthe futures markets and also oversees the regulation of the energy \nfutures markets as well? That would not prevent these markets from \nperforming their important risk-hedging functions, but it would allow \nregulators to spot and act quickly upon evidence of deliberate attempts \nto distort prices and excessive speculation.\n  No. 3, we should curtail the tax breaks for major oil industry \ncompanies and, instead, redirect those funds to consumers and to \nalternative energy.\n  With net profits of a single oil company reaching almost $10 billion \nin a single quarter, we simply should not expect taxpayers who are \nstruggling to pay their energy bills to continue to subsidize the oil \nindustry. Congress should act to repeal the needless tax breaks for big \noil companies and instead use those billions of dollars to fund the \nremaining proposals that will move us toward energy independence.\n  During consideration of this year's budget resolution, the Senator \nfrom Michigan and I joined forces again to provide for the rescission \nof needless tax breaks for major oil companies. Our proposal would \nredirect the revenue to support renewable energy and energy efficiency \ninitiatives. Our amendment was accepted as part of the Senate budget \nresolution. We need to build on that momentum and quickly take up \nlegislation to enact this proposal once and for all.\n  The fourth step we can take in the short-term: One program with an \nimmediate impact is the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nbetter known as the LIHEAP program. It is the Federal grant program \nthat provides vital funding to help our low-income and elderly citizens \nmeet their home energy needs. Nationwide, over the last 4 years, the \nnumber of households receiving assistance under this program increased \nby 26 percent, but during that period, Federal funding increased by \nonly 10 percent. So the obvious result is that, at a time of record \nhigh prices, the average benefit under the LIHEAP program actually \ndropped.\n  We need to fully fund this program. I tell my colleagues that while \nit is a glorious spring here in Washington, Maine and many other States \nare still struggling with temperatures that drop into the thirties at \nnight. We need to fully fund the LIHEAP program at the authorized level \nof $5.1 billion. And for the long term, we should also restructure this \nprogram to make it more flexible so that States can take a reasonable \napproach to low-income energy issues and better balance energy bill \nassistance so we can provide some grants to winterize the homes of \nthose who qualify for low-income heating assistance.\n  No. 5--and now I am getting into the long-term aspects of this plan--\nwe need to improve energy efficiency.\n  Let me discuss the six steps toward the goal of energy independence. \nFirst is to make more efficient use of the energy to heat and power our \nhomes, our offices, and our buildings.\n  I have introduced a comprehensive energy bill that would double \nfunding for the Department of Energy's weatherization program. On \naverage, weatherizing a home reduces heating bills by 31 percent, and \noverall energy bills by $358 per year.\n  The legislation would also provide predictable funding for the \nvaluable Energy Star Program, which helps consumers buy energy-\nefficient appliances. It would extend the renewable energy tax credit \nthrough 2011 and the residential investment tax credit for solar and \nenergy-efficient buildings through 2012.\n  It also includes an energy efficiency performance standard for \nutilities that would help them improve their efficiency. According to \nthe Alliance to Save Energy, an energy efficient performance standard \nfor utilities could save consumers $64 billion and avoid the need to \nbuild 400 powerplants, preventing 320 million metric tons of carbon \ndioxide emissions. Making buildings, appliances, and utilities more \nenergy efficient would dramatically reduce our use of oil and save \nmoney for consumers at the same time.\n  No. 6, we need to implement a renewable electricity standard. Another \ncomponent in my 10-point energy plan would revamp the way we produce \nelectricity in this country. We need a national renewable electricity \nstandard that would require the utilities to generate at least 15 \npercent of their electricity from environmentally sound, renewable \nenergy sources by the year 2020. This would move us away from a \nreliance on coal and natural gas for electricity and diversify our \nenergy supply to provide more price stability.\n  (Mr. Sanders assumed the Chair.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. There are 28 States, including Maine, that already have \na renewable electricity standard. We should follow their lead and \nestablish a national renewable electricity standard.\n  I do wish to say, in enacting a standard, we need to make sure the \nbenefits of renewable electricity reach rural areas, and that means \nbuilding adequate transmission capabilities.\n  I know the new Presiding Officer, the Senator from Vermont, is also \nvery committed to this goal.\n  No. 7, we should invest in cellulosic ethanol and renewable fuels. I \nwant to distinguish between cellulosic ethanol versus corn-based \nethanol. We have oversubsidized corn-based ethanol. It is causing \ntremendous distortions. It is causing shortages in food supplies. It is \ndriving up the cost.\n  I have talked with a baker in Lewiston, ME, who cannot buy rye flour \nanymore because it has been displaced by farmers switching to grow \ncorn. That is not what I am talking about. I am talking about the very \npromising development of cellulosic ethanol which could be made, for \nexample, from switchgrass and from wood chips, waste wood, for example. \nThat is why I am proposing to expand tax credits for cellulosic \nbiomass. At the same time, those fuels have a much smaller life cycle \nenvironmental footprint than does corn-based ethanol and traditional \nfuels.\n  We can do so much in this area. I am proud researchers at the \nUniversity of Maine have been at the forefront of developing \ncommercially viable technologies to produce ethanol from cellulosic \nsources.\n  In addition to cellulosic ethanol, my 10-point energy plan calls for \nthe expansion of other sources of clean renewable energy. During the \nheight of the oil crisis in the 1970s, many Maine families turned to \nwood as an affordable way to heat their homes. With oil prices soaring, \nwood is once again the fuel of choice for an increasing number of \nconsumers.\n  Unfortunately, many of the wood stoves that were purchased three \ndecades ago are outdated, they are inefficient, they waste fuel, and \nthey contribute to air pollution. The good news is the new style wood \nstoves emit 70 percent fewer emissions, and they produce as much energy \nwith 30 percent less wood. This is a real breakthrough that allows \nconsumers to get more energy out of their wood stoves and also to \nreduce the air pollution from wood stoves. In fact, I saw a \ndemonstration where you could not see any\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\nemissions at all coming from these new clean-burning wood stoves \nbecause there is a second burn of the emissions so they are far more \nefficient.\n  Unfortunately, making that change from an old dirty, inefficient wood \nstove to a modern, clean, and safer wood stove or a wood pellet stove \nis expensive. That is especially difficult for many families today. \nThat is why I have introduced legislation to provide a tax credit so \nconsumers can afford to trade in to these better wood stoves, and I am \ndelighted the authors of the housing bill we recently passed agreed to \ninclude, at my behest and at the urging of others, a $300 tax credit \nfor consumers who purchase these new clean-burning wood or pellet \nstoves.\n  Wood is a renewable resource and its increased use for home heating \nis inevitable in these times of high oil prices. We now have the \ntechnology that makes their use better for the environment and for \nhuman health, as well as safer and more affordable.\n  No. 8, we need to promote tidal, geothermal, solar, and wind energy. \nOther clean renewable energy sources include the tide in our oceans and \nthe moderate temperatures that can be tapped under our land.\n  The U.S. wave and tidal energy resource potential that could \nreasonably be harnessed is about 10 percent of national energy demands. \nWe have to put all these sources together and look at the broader \ncomprehensive picture.\n  Once again, I am very proud that a consortium of the University of \nMaine, the Maine Maritime Academy, and industry is poised to become a \nkey test bed for improved tidal energy devices.\n\n  It still is more costly than traditional electricity production, and \nthat is why we need to provide some tax incentives to spur this kind of \nalternative development in tidal, geothermal, solar, and wood energy.\n  No. 9, we need to improve vehicle efficiency and alternatives to \ngasoline. We must provide more efficient transportation options. Last \nyear, we took a giant step forward because Congress enacted, and the \nPresident signed into law, a long overdue increase in fuel economy \nstandards for automobiles, SUVs, and light trucks that will save a \nmillion barrels of oil a day. That is a great start, but we can do even \nmore.\n  The amount of gasoline used in transportation amounts to 9.2 million \nbarrels of oil a day. That is almost half our national consumption of \n20 million barrels of oil each day. Currently, we import about 12 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. So if we reduce the consumption of oil \nproducts for transportation purposes, it goes a long way toward \nreducing our reliance on foreign oil and decreasing overall energy \nprices, or at least stabilizing them for consumers.\n  Flex-fuel vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles can help us meet the \nchallenge of energy independence and lower prices. We should extend the \nexisting tax credits for alternative fuel vehicles and consider \nproviding a tax credit for consumers who modify their existing vehicles \nto be flex-fuel capable.\n  We need to put more money into research, into plug-in hybrid \nvehicles, and expand the tax credits in that area as well.\n  Plug-in hybrids hold great promise. If all the new vehicles that are \nadded to the American fleet for the next 10 years were plug-in hybrids, \nan additional 80 billion gallons of gasoline could be saved each year. \nThat translates into almost 2 billion barrels of oil. It is \nsignificant. It cannot happen overnight, but let's put in place the \npolicy that will help us get there.\n  We also must do more to help existing vehicles be more energy \nefficient. The Energy bill I have introduced would direct the \nDepartment of Transportation to create a national tire fuel efficiency \nprogram that would include tire testing and labeling, energy-efficient \ntire promotions through incentives and information, and the creation of \nminimum fuel economy standards for tires. That makes a difference as \nwell.\n  Heavy-duty vehicles also deserve our attention. They move our \neconomy. The Energy bill I have introduced would help keep them on the \nmove while helping to reduce both fuel consumption and emissions. It \nwould require the Department of Transportation to develop a testing and \nassessment program to determine what is feasible to improve the \nefficiency of heavy-duty vehicles and then develop appropriate fuel \neconomy standards.\n  Additionally, we should provide a Federal tax credit for the purchase \nof idling-reduction technology for heavy vehicles, such as big trucks. \nThat could save a trucker almost $1,600 in fuel costs and $2,000 in \nmaintenance costs each year. It seems almost every week I read or hear \nor talk with another trucker in Maine who has gone out of business \nbecause of the cost of diesel. Think if through these policies we could \nhelp those truckers save that kind of money in fuel costs and \nmaintenance each year. It would make the difference for many truckers \nbetween staying in business or being forced out of business.\n  Finally, the 10th point of my plan involves public transportation. \nPublic transportation is difficult in a State such as the Presiding \nOfficer's and mine. There are only three cities in Maine that have \nregular public transportation. But it is important for the overall goal \nnationally of energy independence that we focus on public \ntransportation for those areas where it is feasible.\n  It is one of the most efficient ways we can get more passenger miles \nper gallon of gasoline. The energy legislation I have introduced would \npromote the development of the use of public transportation by \nsubsidizing fares, encouraging employers to assist their employees with \nfares, as we do in the Senate, where we subsidize the employees who use \nthe subway, and by authorizing funding to build energy-efficient and \nenvironmentally friendly modes of transportation, such as clean buses \nand light rail.\n  The bill would direct the Department of Transportation to designate \n20 transit-oriented developmental corridors in urban areas by the year \n2015 and 50 by the year 2025. These corridors could be developed with \nthe aid of grants to State and local governments to construct or \nimprove facilities for motorized transit, bicycles, and pedestrians. We \nhave to look at everything.\n  In these times of high energy prices, when American families are \nstruggling with the costs of filling their gas tanks and heating their \nhomes, we must act in the short term to provide them some relief, and \nwe must embrace fervently a national effort to achieve energy \nindependence.\n  This Nation has demonstrated time and time again throughout our \nhistory our ability to rise to the challenge. I remember when President \nKennedy, in the 1960s, challenged our Nation to be the first to land a \nman on the Moon and how everyone rallied toward that challenge and we \nachieved the goal that the President set forth for us. Let's now \nestablish another goal and embrace it as fervently. Let's establish the \ngoal of energy independence by the year 2020. It is vital to our \neconomic, our environmental, and our national security. If we embrace \nthis goal, Mr. President, I am confident we can achieve it.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am glad Senator Akaka from Hawaii is on \nthe Senate floor. As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, he \nhas done terrific work on this bill. S. 1315 was reported out of \ncommittee 9 months ago--9 months ago. Senator Akaka has worked on a \nbipartisan basis to come up with a new set of benefits for our \nveterans, benefits that are long overdue to help those veterans who are \nreturning from war and faced with serious medical challenges--to help \nthem with housing, with education, and job training, and to right a \nwrong.\n  Since World War II, we have realized those Filipinos who fought next \nto our soldiers in that war have not been treated fairly, and I want to \nthank Senator Akaka and Senator Inouye for their leadership in making \ncertain the Filipinos who were there when we needed them in World War \nII have a chance in this bill to receive at least some benefit for that \nservice.\n  There were some 470,000 who originally served. There may be only \n20,000\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\nleft. Time has taken its toll. But for those remaining veterans, we owe \nthem a debt of gratitude, and we should compensate them for service \nrendered on behalf of the United States. President Franklin Roosevelt \ncalled on the Army of the Philippines to stand with us, and they did. \nThey fought and many were wounded. Some died in the process. If the \nUnited States is going to be known as a country that remembers its \nfriends, we should remember our friends in the Philippines.\n  This provision is opposed by the Republican side--maybe not all, but \nsome, and they object to it. They will have a chance to debate that, \nand I hope we can draw a conclusion soon and move this bill forward.\n  It is unfortunate that this bill, as important as it is for the \nveterans of the United States, has been subjected to a filibuster by \nthe Republicans. They have done everything they can to stop this bill \nfrom coming to the floor. You would think that something as basic as \nveterans' benefits would be bipartisan. It certainly was in the \ncommittee. It should be on the floor of the Senate.\n  Last Thursday, Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, \ntried to call up this bill, and he was told no; that he would have to \nfile cloture. To put that in common terms, it means we would have to \nwait--wait over the weekend, not finish the bill last week--and have a \nvote, which we had earlier today. The vote was at 12 o'clock, a vote \nwhich the Republicans insisted on before going to the bill. The final \ntotal on that vote was 94 to nothing. There wasn't a single Senator of \neither political party who voted against proceeding to this bill.\n  So all we did was delay this bill for another 4 or 5 days, and we \nfind ourselves at this very moment in the same position. The \nRepublicans refuse to come forward and offer a plan for considering \namendments under the bill. The time may come, and I hope it doesn't, \nwhen we face another cloture motion, another effort to stop this, a \ndelay tactic from the Republican side of the aisle.\n\n  Last week, the Republicans used this delay tactic to stop a technical \ncorrections bill, a bill which just cleaned up some mistaken language--\npoor grammar, poor spelling--in a bill passed years ago, and a bill \nthat was important because it related to highway and bridge projects \nand that created good-paying jobs in the United States. The Republicans \nfilibustered that bill. It went on for days and days and days. We \nthought, well, when it comes to a veterans bill, they are not going to \nuse that filibuster again. But they did.\n  To date, the Republicans have engaged in 67 filibusters during this \nsession of Congress. They have broken the record. I guess it is a \nsource of pride within their Republican conference. The previous record \nwas 57 filibusters over a 2-year period. They have broken that record \nin 16 months with 67 filibusters. Each and every time they engage in \nthese delaying and stalling tactics, it is an effort to stop \nlegislation that would move us forward either in creating jobs, which \nare important for an economy that is facing a recession, or creating \nveterans' benefits for the thousands of veterans who expect and need a \nhelping hand.\n  The Republicans continue to use this strategy. I don't know, perhaps \nsomeone has inspired them to do this, but I wish they would think \ntwice. This country's veterans and their families expect us to work in \na bipartisan way to try to help them. We have many times. But in this \nbill, in this critically important bill on veterans' benefits, the \nRepublicans have thrown every obstacle in our path that they can \nlegally under the rules of the Senate. That still leaves us with a \nmajor responsibility. We owe it to the veterans to get this job done.\n  I am glad Senator Akaka is here, keeping his lonely vigil on the \nSenate floor. I know in a minute we are going to recess and come back \nin about an hour, but I thank him for his leadership on this important \nbill. I am hopeful after the break we can come back to the floor and \nfinally find an accommodation and agreement on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                         Tribute to John Little\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I am honored today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding member of my staff. When I was elected to the Senate, one \nof the first things I had to do was to select and hire a chief of \nstaff. It didn't take long for me to find John Little. He came to work \nfor me in December 2004, even before I was sworn in as a Senator.\n  When I first met John, he was legislative director for the junior \nSenator from Alabama, my colleague Jeff Sessions. I asked Jeff if it \nwould be all right if I approached John and hired away a key member of \nhis staff. He was very gracious, and he told me that although he would \nbe hard to replace, he thought it would be a great opportunity for John \nand wanted to make sure he didn't stand in his way in any way.\n  One of the reasons I came to Washington was to be engaged in the \nissues of the day and try to find solutions to the problems facing \nFloridians and all Americans. Having spent my entire public career in \nthe executive side of Government, I didn't know the inner workings of \nthe Congress and looked for someone with that skill and knowledge. John \nLittle brought that legislative experience from day one to my office \nand has been an invaluable member of my staff and someone I have relied \non and counted on every single day I have been in the Senate.\n  John's experience on the Hill started when he was a very young \nlawyer, fresh from passing the bar and eager to work in Government. He \nworked his way up from being a young staffer writing legislative \ncorrespondence to becoming a legislative aide handling policy in the \nareas of education and health care. John had the respect of his peers \nand would eventually become legislative director. He is known in the \nHill community for being bright, aggressive, conservative and even-\nkeeled. He knows the implications of both large and small shifts in \npublic policy and the impact they might have on families and \ncommunities. He brought to the people of Florida a great amount of \nknowledge and experience and was a problem solver when we had problems \nwe faced.\n  Through his work and in getting to know John personally, I have come \nto admire him greatly for his strength of character, a trait I greatly \nadmire in him. In the face of challenges, John courageously rose to \nmeet those challenges. He never wavered in his love of this institution \nor his love of this country, and he has served the people of Florida \nand the Senate, an institution that I know he loves, very well.\n  Over these last few years, John has demonstrated tireless dedication \nand loyalty to me and the people of Florida. We have successfully \nturned back attempts to breach Florida's ban on offshore drilling. We \nhave sought and secured funds for restoring the Everglades. We have \nfought to ensure Florida's military people and bases have the resources \nthey need to perform their duties. Throughout these and other \nachievements, John has remained humble and committed to ensuring the \npolicies we have pursued were in the best interests of the people of \nFlorida.\n  For those who know the life of a chief of staff for a Senator, it is \nnot glamorous. The hours are long, the issues are complex and \ninnumerable, and you rarely have the opportunity for an uninterrupted \nweekend. For these reasons, John has accepted a position in the private \nsector--a great opportunity for John. This speaks to his skill and \nknowledge as one of the great\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\nqualities he possesses as chief of staff in the Senate. I am sad to see \nhim go, but I am confident he will continue to find ways to serve the \npublic good. He will be missed.\n  I thank him for his service, and I wish him all the best in all his \nendeavors. John is truly a friend. I will miss my personal day-to-day \ncontact with him, but he is someone with whom I hope to have a lasting, \nlifelong relationship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                               Tony Blair\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, last evening I had the honor of \nattending a dinner of the Atlantic Council, and at that dinner they \nhonored the former Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Right Honorable \nTony Blair. I want to quote from his speech, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to have his whole speech printed in the Record after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. He said this:\n\n       The transatlantic alliance is, of course, a product of \n     historical connection, culture, language and tradition. But \n     most of all it is an alliance of belief, of shared values, of \n     a common outlook not just about nations and their common \n     interest but about humanity and its common destiny. Out of \n     the travails of the twentieth century, the alliance drew its \n     history and its strength. In the fight against fascism, and \n     communism, it confronted and defeated totalitarian ideology. \n     Millions of our citizens died for the victory. Through their \n     sacrifice, we gained our freedom.\n       More than that, we came to a profound understanding about \n     what it is to be free. We realized through the pain and \n     suffering, the difference between deferring to those in power \n     and deciding who they are; between the rule of law and the \n     caprice of dictatorship; between the right to speak out and \n     the silence of the fearful.\n       Now with those twentieth century battles over, it is \n     tempting to think that this alliance has served its purpose. \n     But here is the important point about it. It was never, and \n     is not now, an alliance only of interests. It was and is an \n     alliance of conviction. We, in the West, don't own the idea \n     of freedom. We didn't fight for it because of the \n     happenstance of birth in Europe or America. It is there, in \n     the DNA of humankind. It is universal in nature and appeal. \n     We developed it, but we didn't invent it.\n       Now is the time to stand up for it. If we want our values \n     to govern the twenty-first century, we must combine hard and \n     soft power. We must show unhesitating resolution in the face \n     of threats to our security; and we must show that our values \n     are indeed universal, that they encompass not only freedom \n     but justice, and not for us alone but for the world as a \n     whole. We must show these values are global. And build \n     alliances accordingly, starting with the renewal of our own. \n     And we need to do it with energy and urgency. In the Middle \n     East this is time critical. We must act now.\n       Two things I now perceive more clearly than in office. The \n     first is: the fundamental shift of the centre of gravity, \n     politically and economically, to the East, to China and of \n     course India, but more broadly to the Middle and Far Eastern \n     nations.\n       This evening I will focus elsewhere, but suffice it to say \n     that we are still, in the West, not in the state of \n     comprehension or analysis we need to be, fully to grasp this \n     shift. China and India together will over the coming decades \n     industrialize on a scale, and at a pace, the world has never \n     seen before. In China especially, the implications are huge. \n     Whatever the present controversies, a strong strategic \n     relationship with it is vital; as it is with India. We are so \n     much better able to fashion the terms of such a relationship \n     if we do it in unison. That alone would justify and re-\n     justify our alliance.\n       This is a challenge of diplomacy and statesmanship of one \n     kind.\n       The other challenge arises from the security threat that \n     occupied so much of the last years of my premiership. Today, \n     as we meet, our armed forces face the prospect of a \n     continuing campaign in Afghanistan and Iraq. I hope one thing \n     unites us all. Whatever the debate about the decisions that \n     brought us to these countries, there should be no debate \n     about the magnificent and sustained heroism of our armed \n     forces. British and American troops and the forces of \n     other allied nations deserve our full support and our \n     gratitude.\n       But this struggle is not limited to those fields of \n     conflict. Out in the Middle East, it is there in the \n     activities of Hezbollah in Lebanon, of Hamas in Palestine; it \n     is played out in the street of Arab opinion every day. It has \n     spread across the world. More than a score of nations have \n     suffered terror attacks in the last year, still more have \n     foiled them. They do not include only the usual list, but \n     Thailand, Nigeria, China itself.\n       In the Middle East, the ideology that drives the extremism \n     is not abating. The Annual Arab Public Opinion survey \n     published last week was not striking simply for its specific \n     findings but for its overall picture. The basic ideological \n     thrust of the extremists has an impact way beyond the small \n     number of those prepared to engage in terror. In sum, it \n     shows an alarming number of people who buy the view that \n     Islam is under attack from the West; the leaders to support \n     are those like Nasrallah and Ahmadinejad who are perceived to \n     take on the West; and there is a contrast between Governments \n     and their people that is stark.\n       The extremism is a tiny minority activity; the ideas, \n     prejudices and sentiments that drive it, are not. The truth \n     is that the roots of this global ideology are deep, far \n     deeper than I first thought in the aftermath of September 11.\n       I believe the eventual outcome is not in doubt. But it is \n     possible, dangerously, to underestimate the size of this \n     challenge. And it is possible completely to misunderstand its \n     origins.\n       This global ideology is based on a total perversion of the \n     true faith of Islam. Its revolutionary rhetoric and \n     attachment to so-called liberation movements is a sham \n     designed to hide its profoundly reactionary and regressive \n     character. It is totalitarian in nature and compromising with \n     it will lead not to peace but to a ratcheting up of demands, \n     none of which are remotely tolerable.\n       But it plays cleverly on the insecurities and uncertainty \n     deep within Islam. It speaks to a sense that the reason for \n     its problems is not to be found within, but as victims of \n     outside aggression.\n       So today the issue hangs in the balance. The Middle East is \n     without doubt a region in transition; but in which direction \n     will it travel?\n       Like it or not, we are part of the struggle. Drawn into it, \n     Europe and America must hold together and hold firm. Not \n     simply for our own sake, but for that of our allies within \n     Islam. If we do not show heart, why should they?\n       If they don't see our resolve, how much more fragile is \n     theirs?\n       So how is this battle won?\n       We have to recognize that though the circumstances and \n     conflicts of the twentieth century are very different from \n     ours, nonetheless, one thing remains true in any time and for \n     all time: That if under attack, there is no choice but to \n     defend, with a vigour, determination and will, superior to \n     those attacking us. Our opponents today think we lack this \n     will. Indeed they are counting on it. They think that if they \n     make the struggle long enough and savage enough, we will \n     eventually lose heart, and our will fade. They are fanatics \n     but they have, unfortunately, the dedication that accompanies \n     fanaticism.\n       We cannot permit this to happen. Where we are confronted, \n     we confront. We stand up. And we do so for as long as it \n     takes. This ideology now has a nation, Iran, that seeks to \n     put itself at the head of extreme Islam. They need to know \n     what we say, we mean and, if necessary, will do. If we \n     exhibit this attitude, peace is more likely; because they \n     will not miscalculate or misread our character. But if they \n     think us weak, they will fight all the harder and risk all \n     the more.\n       They need to see our belief. We should not apologize for \n     our values, but wear them with pride, proclaim their virtues \n     loudly; show confidence; ridicule the notion that when people \n     choose freedom this is somehow provocation to terror; and do \n     so together, one alliance.\n       This struggle did not begin on September 11th 2001. It \n     isn't the fault of President Bush, of Israel, or of Western \n     policy. The idea that we suppress Muslims in the West is \n     utterly absurd. There is more religious freedom for Islam in \n     London than in many Muslim countries.\n\n  Madam President, I found his statement very convincing. I urge \nSenators to read it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                Speech by the Right Honorable Tony Blair\n\n       The transatlantic alliance is, of course, a product of \n     historical connection, culture, language and tradition. But \n     most of all it is an alliance of belief, of shared values, of \n     a common outlook not just about nations and their common \n     interest but about humanity and its common destiny.

It \n     isn't the fault of George Bush, of Israel, or of Western \n     policy. The idea that we suppress Muslims in the West is \n     utterly absurd. There is more religious freedom for Islam in \n     London than in many Muslim countries.\n       You can argue about the rights and wrongs of the military \n     invasion of Iraq or Afghanistan, but to allow for a single \n     instant that this action justifies not simply terrorism but \n     the idea that the West is innately hostile to Islam, only has \n     to be contemplated, rationally, momentarily, for its nonsense \n     to be manifest. We get rid of two brutal dictatorships; put \n     in place a U.N. led democratic process; plus billions of \n     dollars in aid: Where exactly is the hostility to Islam? And \n     the only reason our troops are forced to stay is because of \n     terror attacks carried out by this ideology in defiance of \n     the democratically expressed wishes of the Muslim people of \n     both countries.\n       And if it is hard and bloody, how bizarre to blame the \n     allied forces, there under a U.N. mandate and who are trying \n     to keep the peace, rather than those using terror to disturb \n     it.\n       Yet this paradigm that it is `our' fault that this terror \n     threat is with us, has infiltrated a large part of Middle \n     Eastern public opinion and actually influences significantly \n     a large part of our own. It has to be taken on.\n       And here is the good news. The same poll shows most Muslims \n     want peace. Most support a two-state solution in Israel and \n     Palestine. The modern minded rulers of the successful Arab \n     economies are also admired. People in Iran don't hate America \n     even if its leader does. Go beneath the surface and there are \n     allies out in the region and within Islam; people who believe \n     strongly in their faith, but know that the twenty-first \n     century is not about civilisations in combat but in alliance. \n     In other words people are open to persuasion.\n       And here is the point. To win this struggle, we must be \n     prepared to confront; but we must also be prepared to \n     persuade.\n       This is a battle that can take a military or security form. \n     But it can't be won by military or security means alone. It \n     is a baffle of ideas. To win, we must persuade people of what \n     we stand for and why; and we must do so in a way that answers \n     their concerns as well as our own.\n       We believe in freedom and democracy. We also believe in \n     justice. We believe in equality. We believe in a fair chance \n     for all, in opportunity that goes beyond an elite and \n     stretches down into the core of society. That, after all, is \n     the American dream; free not just in politics but free to \n     achieve, to fulfil your ambition by your own efforts and hard \n     work, to make something of yourself, to give your children a \n     better start than you had.\n       To win this battle, we must demonstrate these values too. \n     That is why the Middle East peace process matters. It is the \n     litmus test of our sincerity. We should not in any way dilute \n     our commitment to Israel's security. We simply have to show \n     equal commitment to justice for the Palestinians.\n       In the coming months, we have a chance to put it on a path \n     to peace. It will require Israel to do more to lift the \n     burden of occupation and give the Palestinians a sense that a \n     state is possible. It will require the Palestinians to do \n     more to get the robust capability on security to give the \n     Israelis a sense that a state is possible. It will require a \n     different and better strategy for Gaza. And it will require a \n     relentless, insistent focus on the issues, from the U.S. and \n     the international community, macro- and micro-managing it as \n     necessary, to get the job done. President Bush and Secretary \n     Rice have made that commitment. This can be done. It has to \n     be done. It is not optional. It is mandatory for success.\n       The origin of this extremism does not lie in this dispute; \n     but a major part of defeating it, lies in its resolution.\n       Then, wider than this, we have to work with the modern and \n     moderate voices within Islam to help them counter the \n     extremism and show how faith in Islam is supremely consistent \n     with engagement in the twenty first century, economically, \n     politically, and culturally. There is a vast amount of toil \n     and time and energy to be expended in building bridges, \n     educating each other about the other, creating the civic \n     and social networks of reconciliation.\n       I would go further still.\n       In Africa, we have a cause of justice which cries out to be \n     pursued; one that is, at the same time, a moral imperative \n     and a strategic investment; one that needs the attention of \n     East and West. In climate change, we have an issue that \n     demonstrates that justice is also part of the compact of \n     responsibility between this generation and those of the \n     future.\n       My argument is therefore this. The struggle can be won. But \n     it can only be won by a strategy big enough and comprehensive \n     enough to remove the roots as well as the branches. The \n     battle will, in the end, be won within Islam. But only if we \n     show that our values are theirs also.\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\n       The problem with so much of Western politics is that the \n     argument is posed as one between the advocates of hard power \n     and soft power, when the reality is, we need both.\n       This is where America and Europe, united, should act. \n     America has to reach out. Europe has to stand up. Not a \n     single one of the global challenges facing us today is more \n     easily capable of solution, if we are apart; if we let the \n     small irritants obscure the fundamental verities; if we allow \n     ourselves to be assailed by doubt about the value of our \n     partnership, rather than affirm, albeit self-critically, its \n     strengths.\n       We need now a powerful revival of our alliance. In the \n     world so rapidly changing around us, we cannot take a narrow \n     view of our interests or a short-sighted view of our destiny. \n     We can't afford to take fright at these changes and go back \n     into isolationism. We can't avoid the challenges. But we can \n     master them. Together.\n       The transatlantic partnership was never just the foundation \n     of our security. It was the foundation of our way of life. It \n     was forged in experience of the most bitter and anguished \n     kind.\n       Out of it came a new Europe, a new world order, a new \n     consensus as to how life should be lived.\n       Today times are different. Every era is different. What is \n     necessary is to distinguish between what endures for one time \n     and what endures for all time.\n       In our history, we discovered the values that endure. We \n     learnt what really matters and what is worth fighting for.\n       And we learnt it together.\n       Today, the challenge to those values is different. But it \n     is no less real. Our propensity to avow those values will \n     shape the way the twenty first century is governed. Will \n     these values become, as they should be, universal values, \n     open over time to all human beings everywhere; or will they \n     be falsely seen as the product of a bygone age? That is the \n     question. It is fundamental. It is urgent. It is our duty to \n     answer it.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I wish to address another matter, as I have a moment. I \nunderstand there is no time limit now; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, before the Senate now is a bill, the \nVeterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. It is a very important \npiece of legislation. It would expand a series of benefits to our \nveterans, including traumatic injury insurance, adapted housing grants, \nand burial allowances. As a veteran, I am delighted this bill is here, \nand I am pleased the Senate has invoked cloture so we may debate it and \nfind a way to reach an accommodation on it with those who may find some \nfault with it or some matter they may wish to try to change.\n  What I wish to address is the provisions for the Filipino veterans \nlegislation. In this part of this bill, as far as I am concerned, we \nare talking about honor, the honor of the United States. In 1941, on \nJuly 26, President Franklin Roosevelt ordered all military forces of \nthe Philippines into the service of the United States to fight the \nJapanese. They were a province of the United States at that time. They \nwere not an independent nation right then. The President had the power \nto do that. He, in fact, conscripted all men 18 years of age and over \ninto their military. He took them all, and they fought, they fought \nhard, they fought almost to the death as, really, I think any American \nknows who knows about the Long March and Corregidor and what it meant \nin terms of the time these people delayed the Japanese so we could find \na way to rearm this Nation and find a way to eventually overthrow the \nthreats of tyranny that existed as manifested in the attack of Japan on \nDecember 7, 1941.\n  After the war, these people were recognized as veterans by our U.S. \nVeterans' Administration. All of the Filipinos who went into the \nservices were entitled to full VA benefits. In 1946, Congress changed \nthat. They said that those veterans who came to the United States would \nget full benefits of being in the military service but those who stayed \nin the Philippines would not.\n  I think to deal with this you have to think about the fact that there \nwere 470,000 Filipino World War II veterans still alive after the war. \nMillions died. Millions died in defense of our country. Yet here, \ntoday, there are 18,000 veterans still alive.\n  My distinguished friend from Hawaii, who is chairman of our Defense \nSubcommittee, and I went to the Philippines recently and visited with \nsome of them. I am the oldest Member of the Senate on my side. My good \nfriend is, I think, the second oldest on his side of the Senate. We \nfound ourselves junior to these people who are still there. Those men \nwho fought over there, who are still with us now, are very much in need \nof our help. They deserve what this bill would give them.\n  This benefit that this bill would extend to them is one-third the \namount they would have received had they come to this country. That is \nwhat was intended to give them in the first place--one-third--taking \ninto account really the cost of living and various other aspects of \ntheir life in the Philippines. They would get the benefits, one-third \nof the amount they would receive if they came to this country. If they \ncame to this country, they would have been entitled to the veterans' \nbenefits, to the GI bill, to all of the other benefits we gave the \nveterans after World War II.\n  Do you know why Congress gave that to those veterans? Because there \nwere too many men seeking a job. They had to take the 16 million of us \nwho survived and spread us out over the economy. They did so by giving \nus benefits--training as a pilot, we could build our own home and get \nthe money to do that, we could go to school through the GI bill. These \npeople thought they had that right, too, but Congress cut it off in \n1946.\n  These people, who are the survivors now of that almost half-million \npeople who survived as veterans, Filipino veterans of World War II, and \nwho stayed in that country, those 18,000, have asked us for help, to \nfinally be recognized once again for what they did.\n  The cost is really minimal. The Senate will hear all kinds of \nestimates on the amount. But 18,000 people--the youngest age involved \nis 82. They are just not going to be with us that long. Anyone who \ngives you some estimate of billions of dollars that it is going to cost \nto take care of these people and give them what they were entitled to \nlong ago--I think it is overestimating it.\n  Again, I come back to my point. It is a matter of honor, the honor of \nthe United States is at stake.\n  These people put on our uniform, wore our uniform, fought with our \ncomrades, almost to the death, all the way to Corregidor, and the \nsurvivors were denied what they should have had.\n  If they came to the United States, they had the right to become \ncitizens automatically. But if they stayed with their families and \ntried to reconstruct their country, we denied them that right, even \nthough by staying at home they would have gotten one-third. If they got \nto come over here and be citizens they would have the benefits. There \nwere no GI bills over there. If they came over here as citizens, became \ncitizens, they had the full range of benefits.\n  Now, I do not get excited too many times on this floor. This one, \nthis bill, excites me. There are very few of us left from World War II. \nWhen I came to the Senate, almost every person who was a Member had \nserved in World War II. There are five of us left now. I hope the \nSenate will listen to the five of us because we are united. We say this \nis a wrong that has to be rectified. We urge the Senate not to change \nthis bill, to support the bill that has been introduced by the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii and his colleague with my \ncosponsorship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I understand my distinguished \ncolleague from Alabama has a colloquy with Senator Martinez for 5 \nminutes or so. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized after the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                         Tribute to John Little\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank my colleague, Senator \nMenendez, for his courtesy. I will adhere to that timeframe. I ask to \nbe notified in 4 minutes.\n  I would express my appreciation to Senator Stevens for his service to \nhis country during World War II, and Senator Inouye, our decorated \nWorld War II veteran himself. Both served in harm's way for their \ncountry. We do value their opinions on so many important issues.\n  John Little, a native of my hometown of Mobile, AL, a product of UMS \nHigh School, a good high school in Mobile, graduated from Southern \nMethodist University with a BA in history,\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\ngot his juris doctorate from Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham, \nAL, a fine law school.\n  He interviewed and then joined my staff 9 months into my term, just \nas I had come to Washington. We hired John, and we told him he would \nhave to start at the bottom. And he did. He handled judiciary issues \nand correspondence with constituents back home. But within a year, \nusing his excellent writing and research, it was obvious he was \ndestined to take on more responsibility.\n  John had great talent, and we made him our legislative counsel and \ngave him the responsibility of several issues, including education, \nlabor, drug caucus work, welfare, and campaign finance reform.\n  In 2000, John was promoted to legislative assistant and counsel and \nhe dove right into the largest issues of our time, at that point the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act debate. We were dealing with a \nvery important issue in education, in particular, the special ed or \nIDEA reform, the need to create a thoughtful, disciplined standard and \nreform for students and teachers in the classroom. It was a big \nproblem. We were hearing a lot about it. John spent countless hours of \nwork on this project as my legislative assistant and helped foster the \nstrong reform that eventually would be accepted in the IDEA reform bill \nwhich was signed into law that is affecting positively every school in \nAmerica today.\n  After 2 years spent on education, labor, and welfare and judiciary \nissues, I promoted him to my deputy legislative director and counsel. \nHis portfolio grew on a whole host of issues. He also became a key \npoint man in my office on nominations issues.\n  So after the departure in 2003 of my legislative director, John was \nthe obvious choice to take over and manage the day-to-day legislative \noperations of my office. He and I spent countless hours together \nworking on IDEA reform and other issues that were so important.\n  He spearheaded my efforts to promote our plans for a strong national \ndefense, lower taxes, less regulation, and the thoughtful application \nof commonsense conservative values to promote and pass good public \npolicy.\n  After the elections of 2004, a new Senator, my good friend and \ncolleague from Florida, Mr. Mel Martinez, heard of the outstanding work \nof my young legislative director and counsel. I suppose he heard about \nthat because he called me to ask if he could interview him. And I \ncertainly agreed to that.\n  I think he sought out John's leadership, know-how, interpersonal \nskills, and a command of the inner workings of the Senate, and he \neventually asked if he could bring John on as his chief of staff.\n  Although I would lose a strong counselor and a legislative leader and \nfriend, my loss was indeed Senator Martinez's gain. So it has been for \nthe past 3 years that John has been at the helm with Senator Martinez \nas his chief of staff.\n  He will leave the Senate family now but will be taking on another \nimportant challenge in the corporate world. I know John Little well and \nthe values and high ideals he holds dear. He truly loves the Senate and \nrespects her traditions. He loves America. The Senate was a better \nplace with him here.\n  Thank you, John, for your friendship, your strong personal support, \nand your service to the Senate and our great country. It has been a \npleasure and an honor to work with you. We wish you every success in \nyour chosen endeavors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                        Fair Pay Restoration Act\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I am here today to stand up for equal \npay for women. Now, that is something we have been working toward for a \nlong time, but we are still falling short of the goal.\n  For decades we have come together across party lines to help men and \nwomen earn the same wage for the same work. The Senate voted \noverwhelming for equal pay when President Kennedy was in office. We \ngave our support to the Civil Rights Act under President Johnson. We \nrenewed that support during President Reagan's term and during the term \nof the first President Bush.\n  So we have had this history of supporting this proposal, this rule of \nlaw, under both Democratic and Republican Presidents. Even after all \nthe progress we have made, we still have a long way to go. But last \nyear, five conservative Supreme Court Justices threw a roadblock \nagainst fair pay for women.\n  Here is what happened. A woman named Lilly Ledbetter was one of only \na few supervisors at a tire plant. She worked 12-hour shifts and \nconstantly had to endure insults from her male bosses just because she \nwas a woman doing what was thought to be a man's job.\n  It was not until late in her career that she discovered her company \nwas cheating her, paying her up to 40 percent less--40 percent less--\nthan her male colleagues earned doing the same exact job.\n  Lilly filed a claim, and a jury awarded her full benefits, full \ndamages. But the Supreme Court said she was entitled to nothing--to \nnothing--simply because she did not discover the pay discrimination \nearly enough.\n  According to the Court, in the narrow 5 to 4 decision, if you do not \ndiscover that you are being discriminated against right after your \nemployer starts doing it, you might have to suffer the consequences for \nyour entire career, and not only for your career of being shortchanged \nfair pay for what, in fact, you were doing equal to anybody else, man \nor woman on that company's agenda, but at the same time having a \nconsequence as it relates to your pension and your benefits and your \nSocial Security because all of those were factored by the income you \nmake.\n  So when your income is discriminated against, even though you are \ndoing the same job as anyone else in the company in that category, not \nonly do you not receive the income during your working life, but you \nhave a consequence for the rest of your life, in your retirement.\n  It is a discrimination that keeps on discriminating. Today we have a \nchance to change that, to make things right. Discrimination is \ndiscrimination no matter when it happens. If someone breaks the law, \nthey should be held accountable for it.\n  This body must make it clear that women should be treated the same as \nmen. We must make it undeniably clear that every worker should be paid \nfairly for their labor. We must proclaim in a unified voice the same \ntypes of voices that have previously held together in this body almost \nunanimously: that discrimination will not be accepted in the workplace, \ndiscrimination will not be tolerated in America.\n  The idea behind the Fair Pay Restoration Act is simple. It would \nrestate the rule that the clock for filing a wage discrimination claim \nstarts running from the day a worker receives a discriminatory \npaycheck, not the day the employer first decides to discriminate. This \nis, in essence, what the law was before the Court decision. It was the \nlaw of the land for a long time. All we simply say is, the Court is \nwrong. And even one of the Justices from the bench in a dissenting \nopinion said: ``This is something that Congress needs to change.''\n  If a female worker sees her wages are continuously falling behind \nthose of her male counterparts, she should be able to challenge her \nemployer, even if the original decision to discriminate was made years \nago. As long as the discrimination continues, the right of a worker to \nchallenge it should continue as well.\n  This does not only benefit women, it helps all in our country if they \nare getting cheated in their paycheck on account of their age, or their \nrace, a disability, their national origin, or what religion they belong \nto.\n  Now, as usual, there are those who are trying to defend the status \nquo and scare us into believing that this law would cause a flood of \nlitigation and undercut corporations' bottom lines. Unfortunately for \nthem, history is not on their side in terms of those false fears.\n  We know this legislation is workable and fair because it was the law \nof the land for decades, for decades before the Supreme Court made its \nruling. All this bill would do is make the law what it was before it \nwas widely interpreted to be only 1 year ago. We simply want to return \nthe standard to be able to protect an individual at the workplace from \ndiscrimination simply as the law was for decades before.\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\n  And this is not exposing companies to unlimited damages either. The \nfact is, liability is still limited to 2 years of back pay following \nthe standard set in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  We will hear a lot of goblins here, but the reality is the \nlegislation we are considering as it was limits a company's liability \nto 2 years of back pay. Now, some of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will ask why workers often cannot file their claim within 180 \ndays from the first instance of discrimination.\n  Well, there are good reasons. There are good reasons for that. To \nbegin with, many workers have difficulty comparing their salaries to \ncoworkers, with many businesses actually prohibiting it, prohibiting an \nemployee from making or attempting to make these comparisons.\n  Why would a company be concerned about the comparisons among people \ndoing the same job within the context of a company? Why? What is it \nthat they have to fear? What is it they have to hide? Even if a worker \nsees their pay is lower than their coworkers, they may not recognize it \nwas a result of discrimination.\n  If a worker does recognize it as discrimination, they often have to \nwait to contact the EEOC or decide not to due to feeling ashamed or, \nmore often, they fear retaliation by their company, and that is a real \nfear.\n  They fear the consequences of rocking the boat and figure a job in \nwhich they are discriminated against is better than being fired and \nhaving no job at all. Certainly, in this economy today, an economy that \ndoes not work for working families, those who are fortunate enough to \nhave a job have to think about that extra burden of raising their voice \nagainst discrimination because they might, in fact, lose a job. So when \npeople ask: Why can't they within 180 days go ahead and file their \ncomplaints, it is because it simply doesn't always work that way. I \nwould ask those who raise the question: What happened during the \ndecades of the standard of the law that existed? No one raised those \nconcerns then.\n  Here is what it comes down to. If you vote against this bill, you are \ngoing on record and telling an entire nation you want to make it harder \nfor a woman to get paid the same as a man for the same work. It is not \nabout working less. It is not about having a privileged role. It is \nabout being able to achieve pay for doing the same exact job, with all \nthe pressures, all the challenges, all the skills anyone else would \nhave, male or female.\n  These are challenging economic times, and the challenges are \nespecially tough for women. For every dollar a man gets paid, women get \npaid 77 cents. Women's earnings have fallen six times as much as men as \nour economy began sliding toward a recession last year. The truth is, \nthe glass ceiling might be a little higher than it was, but it is still \nthere.\n  I don't want my daughter, who is fortunate to have gone to a great \nuniversity, graduated, incredibly smart, to realize less in her power \nto earn simply because she is a woman compared to those with whom she \nis competing. Yet if we let the law stand the way it is, that very well \ncan be institutionalized as something that may happen.\n  It is our responsibility as legislators, as Americans, as human \nbeings to make sure this country holds the same promise for women as it \ndoes for men and that in the future our daughters have the same \nopportunities as our sons. Restoring a woman's opportunity to fight for \nfair pay is a big part of that. It has to be part of a broader strategy \nto get our economy back on track. We have to bring down the cost of \nhealth care, create green-collar jobs, and help workers get the \ntraining and education they need to succeed in a global environment in \nwhich intellect is the greatest asset the Nation is going to have, a \nworld that has been transformed, where the boundaries of mankind have \nlargely been erased in the pursuit of human capital so an engineer's \nreport is created in India and sent back to the United States for a \nfraction of the cost, a radiologist's report is done in Pakistan and \nread in a local hospital by your doctor for a fraction of cost or, if \nyou have a problem with your credit card, as I recently did, you end up \nin a call center in South Africa. The reality is that for the delivery \nof services created by an individual, we are globally challenged. For \nAmerica to continue to be the leader economically, it needs to be at \nthe apex of the curve of intellect, the most highly educated generation \nof Americans we have ever had.\n  Even as we move toward achieving those educational goals, what is it \nworth if my daughter graduates from Harvard but still makes 77 cents on \nthe dollar that a man makes? It is fundamentally wrong. If we are going \nto prosper as a nation, that prosperity must be shared. I have said it \nbefore and it is as true as it ever was: Only a society with no second-\nclass citizens can be a first-class society. Today it is time to act on \nthat principle. It is time to vote for fair pay and ease the way to \nprosperity and justice for all. That is our choice. That is our \nopportunity. That is the responsibility of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, when the Spanish-American War ended in \n1898, the Philippines became a possession of the United States. It \nbecame a colony of the United States. We hate to use that word because \nwe frown upon colonial powers, but we became a colonial power. As such, \nwe exercised complete power over the people of the Philippines. \nLegally, we could arrest them. We could do anything we wanted. However, \nin 1934, we decided the status should change a little bit, and they \nbecame a commonwealth; however, not citizens of the United States.\n  Then in July of 1941, when war clouds began to appear in the Asia-\nPacific area and the Japanese were invading other countries, the \nPresident of the United States issued an order forming the Commonwealth \nArmy of the Philippines. The Commonwealth Army of the Philippines had \n470 members. They were all Filipinos. They were assured, if combat \nshould come about and they participated, they would be granted American \ncitizenship, if they so desired. And they would receive all the \nbenefits veterans of the United States would receive.\n  Well, December 7, 1941, became history. Two weeks later, the Congress \npassed a bill making it a very formal order of the day that if a \nFilipino came forward and volunteered to serve in the uniform of the \nUnited States and pledged to stand in harm's way on our behalf, at the \nend of the conflict, they would be granted citizenship, if they so \ndesired, and receive all the benefits Americans received.\n  The Japanese invaded the Philippines. There were two great battles, \nthe battle of Corregidor and the battle of Bataan. The battle of Bataan \nhas been made part of the history of this Nation. We have seen \ncountless movies on the Bataan Death March, one of the better known \ndeath marches in our history. In that death march, there were 75,000 \nprisoners of war. Of that number, 54,000 arrived at the prisoner of war \ncamp; 15,000 died on that march. The distance wasn't too long. It was \n75 miles. But they were given no medicine, no food, no water, and \n15,000 died on the way. Six thousand escaped to become guerillas. Of \nthe movies I have seen which show Americans being bayonetted, Americans \nbeing shot on the march, you never saw a Filipino on the march. Yet the \nrecord will show that of the 75,000 who participated in the death \nmarch, 15,000 were Americans and 60,000 were Filipinos.\n  Most of those who died before arriving at the prison camp were \nFilipinos. Strangely also, though they spent much time on the \nfrontlines attacking Japanese, carrying out heroic acts, they received \nno medals, no Purple Hearts, no Bronze Stars, no Silver Stars, and no \nDSCs. They were serving under American command.\n  Well, we were victorious. But before we were victorious, General \nMacArthur left the Philippines and said: ``I shall return.'' The men \nwhom he left in the Philippines were Filipinos. They had the job of \nharassing the Japanese, keeping them occupied so they wouldn't be \nmoving to other areas to cause havoc. The casualties mounted in the \nthousands. Thousands died in our defense.\n  So what happens? Surrender terms are signed on the USS Missouri, and \nlaw and order is restored in the Philippines. Happy day. About a month \nand a half later, Washington sent one man\n\n[[Page S3239]]\n\nto serve in the Embassy, to take applications of those men who wanted \nto become citizens of the United States. But a month later, we called \nhim back. That promise we made, if you want to become a citizen, you \nhad to do it in some office in the United States, not in the \nPhilippines. That is why they sent that man down there to represent us. \nWhen that man left Manila and returned to Washington, there was no one \nto take applications.\n  Then in mid-February of 1946, the Congress, our predecessors, passed \na bill repealing that law they passed in December of 1941. They \nrepealed it.\n  It is a matter of honor, as Senator Stevens pointed out. Here was a \npromise, a solemn promise on the part of Americans. And by \ncongressional action, we break that promise.\n  Here we have a bill before us that will restore this honor. It will \nsay to the Filipinos, since your cost of living is not as great as \nours, your pension will be one-third of ours. Well, one can say that is \nbetter than nothing. But if they want to become citizens, they can do \nit in Manila or in Honolulu or anywhere else.\n  There are 18,000 who want to become citizens. There are many others \nwaiting. But as Senator Stevens pointed out, the youngest surviving \nFilipino veteran is 82 years old.\n  As I speak, men are dying. By the time we consider this measure and \npass it, there will be hundreds more who will die.\n  It is not a matter of money. It is a matter of honor. It is the \nAmerican thing to do. If we make a solemn promise, we should be \nprepared to keep it. In this case, they were willing to stand in harm's \nway for us. The least we can do is to recognize this and to salute them \nas fellow Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I have deep respect for Senator Inouye, who \njust spoke. He is passionate. There is no American who can look at \nSenator Inouye and not see an American war hero. He has committed so \nmuch, and his perspective on history is important for all of us to \nrecognize. Before him, Senator Stevens spoke, one of the foundations of \nthe U.S. Senate. I find myself troubled to some degree that I am at \nodds with both of them on this issue.\n  I want Senator Inouye to know how much I respect him and how much \nresearch I have done on this issue, and I will try to make my case for \nwhy I do not think this is a priority but to do it in the most \nrespectful way I possibly can to individuals, such as Senator Inouye, \nwho have so much invested not just in their knowledge but in the \ncommitment and sacrifices they have made.\n  Mr. President, we started debating S. 1315 earlier today. Where I \nended off in that earlier debate was pointing out to my colleagues and \nthe country how this special pension, a special pension we intend to \nprovide to a very small group of Filipino veterans who were not \nenlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces but were under control of U.S. forces \nand command of U.S. forces--I just want to point this out to everybody: \nCurrently, the Filipino Government provides a $120-per-month pension to \nthis select group of individuals. That pension puts every veteran at \n400 percent over the poverty line in the Philippines. What S. 1315 \nattempts to do is to create a new special pension funded by the \nAmerican taxpayers that would take the average income of this select \ngroup of Filipino veterans to 1,400 percent above the poverty line in \nthe Philippines.\n  Now, let me put that in direct comparison to the United States. We \nhave special pensions in the United States that apply to our veterans \nbecause we believe it is important to say no veteran should live in \npoverty. Our commitment is such that it is roughly over $10,000 a year. \nLet me compute what that $10,000 means relative to the poverty line. It \nmeans they are 10 percent above the poverty line in the United States.\n  So with all due respect to my colleagues, I am supposed to come down \nhere on behalf of my constituents, my taxpayers, my veterans, \nsuggesting there is equity in providing a 1,400-percent pension stipend \nfor Filipino veterans over the poverty level but only 10 percent for \nU.S. veterans? Well, I cannot do that. That is why I am at odds with \nsome of the people whom I really love and respect in this institution.\n  As I said earlier today, I have done a tremendous amount of research \non this issue because so many people have suggested with a high degree \nof certainty there was a promise that was made. Well, I cannot find \nthat promise. According to information provided at a 1998 congressional \nhearing, the Department of the Army examined its holdings on GEN \nDouglas MacArthur and President Franklin Roosevelt and ``found no \nreference by either of these wartime leaders to postwar benefits for \nFilipino veterans.''\n  Now, I am going to ask that another chart be put up that displays the \ndifference in Filipino veterans because I think most would believe \nthere is one target we are after. What you see here is four different \ngroups. You see Old Scouts. These are the Filipino soldiers who signed \nup with the U.S. Army, and they served side by side in the U.S. Army. \nToday, they receive every benefit, except for those living in the \nPhilippines and outside of the United States. And medical care is only \nprovided at a clinic that the VA has in the Philippines. Every other \nbenefit they get. They are getting pensions. They are getting death \npensions for their survivors. They are getting burial benefits. They \nare getting everything because they were part of the U.S. Armed Forces, \neven though they are Filipino.\n  The other three categories you see: the Commonwealth Army of the \nPhilippines, recognized guerilla forces, New Philippine Scouts--yes, \nthey were under the command of U.S. forces. Everybody in the Pacific \nwas under U.S. force command. But they actually enlisted in the \nFilipino forces. We never solicited them. They could have joined the \nU.S. Army. They chose not to.\n  The reality is that just about every benefit, except for two, was \nextended to even the three groups that are the Filipino veterans. The \ntwo glaring exceptions are pensions for nonservice-related \ndisabilities--nonservice-connected disabilities--and the death pension \nfor survivors.\n  So what I want everybody to understand is, in a bill that totals over \n$900 million--that, I might add, we are funding. We are offsetting it \nbecause a court ruling took this away from U.S. veterans. We took money \naway in benefits from U.S. veterans. We are now using this $900 million \nthe courts extracted to say we are going to enhance the benefits for \nour veterans here at home. As a matter of fact, over $300 million of it \nis life insurance changes we are making. And, yes, our veterans are \nbenefiting from it. But $100 million of that $900 million is going in \nthis category to beef up our commitment to Filipino veterans. But there \nis $221 million that is going to create a special pension, a pension \nfor those Filipino troops who served as part of the Filipino military \nwho were commanded by U.S. forces and never injured in combat. Let me \nsay that again: Filipinos who live in the Philippines who were under \nU.S. command who served in the Filipino Army and have no service-\nconnected disability.\n\n  This is not about disabilities. This is about a windfall. This is \nabout a windfall that exceeds what our standard is here for our \nveterans, which is 10 percent above poverty, and currently the Filipino \nveterans are over 400 percent above poverty; and some in this \ninstitution suggest that the right thing for us to do is to raise their \npension to 1,400 percent over the poverty level in the Philippines.\n  Some might say: Was it Congress's intent to grant full VA benefits to \nFilipino veterans? It is important to note that it was a 1942 VA legal \nopinion which concluded that Filipino veterans had served ``in the \nactive military or naval service of the United States'' and on that \nbasis were eligible for VA benefits.\n  Senator Carl Hayden, chairman of the subcommittee on appropriations, \nhad this to say about the VA's legal determination regarding Philippine \nArmy veterans during committee proceedings on March 25, 1946:\n\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\n\n       There is nothing to indicate that there was any discussion \n     of the meaning of that term, probably because it is generally \n     well recognized and has been used in many statutes having to \n     do with members or former members of the American armed \n     forces. It would normally be construed to include persons \n     regularly enlisted or inducted in the regular manner in the \n     military and naval service of the United States.\n\n  I go on:\n\n       But no one could be found who would assert that it was ever \n     the clear intention of Congress that such benefits as are \n     granted under . . . the GI bill of rights--should be extended \n     to the soldiers of the Philippine Army. There is nothing in \n     the text of any of the laws enacted by Congress for the \n     benefit of veterans to indicate such intent.\n\n  This is our colleague in 1946.\n  I go on:\n\n       It is certainly unthinkable that the Congress would extend \n     the normal meaning of the term to cover the large number of \n     Filipinos to whom it has been suggested that the Servicemen's \n     Readjustment Act of 1940 applies, at a cost running into \n     billions of dollars, aside from other considerations, without \n     some reference to it either in the debates in Congress or in \n     the committee reports.\n\n  Now, I am quoting from the history of our congressional hearings, of \nour Senate hearings, in 1946, from the chairman of the subcommittee on \nappropriations.\n  Again, we have the Department of the Army examining the records of \nGEN Douglas MacArthur. We have the Department of the Army examining the \npapers of Franklin Roosevelt. They find no references by either of \nthese wartime leaders to postwar benefits guaranteed to Filipinos. We \nhave the records of the congressional hearing, and Senator Carl Hayden \nsays: I have looked. There is nothing that suggests that this promise \nwas ever made. Yet individuals come to the floor and they make this \nclaim.\n  Now, I am convinced that--we are dealing with something 50 years \nlater--it is very possible that memories are not exactly the same, that \none person's recollection may be different today than it was in 1942 or \n1944 or 1946. All the basis we have is to go back in history, to look \nat the documents, to see what the commitments were, and, more \nimportantly, to try to get inside the heads of our colleagues then, to \nunderstand: If it was not in the letter of the law, what was the \nintent? Senator Hayden makes it very clear: It is not only not the \nletter of the law, it is not the intent of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  Now, what factors influenced Congress's decision to limit certain VA \nbenefits to Filipino veterans in what is known as the Rescissions Act \nof 1946?\n  You see, in the United States we have the rule of law. When the \ncourts determined, under their understanding, this set of benefits \nwould apply, Congress actually passed legislation to rescind what the \ncourts had awarded.\n  Again, quoting Senator Hayden:\n\n       The GI bill of rights is intended to benefit an American \n     who served in the armed forces and who, upon discharge from \n     the service, returns to civil life in the United States, \n     where American standards of living prevail. . . . Whenever \n     any part of the GI bill of rights is extended to Filipino \n     veterans, the cost of living in the Philippines and other \n     economic factors must be given careful consideration.\n\n  Let me go back to the chart I referenced. That is all we are \napplying. That is the only standard I am asking my colleagues to look \nat: that when we apply what sounds in the United States like a meager \namount--$120 a month--what we are talking about is 400 percent over the \npoverty level. When we talk about increasing by $300 a month the \npension, what we are doing is we are taking potentially a Filipino \nveteran who is already 400 percent over poverty, or more--assuming they \nhave no other income--and we are putting them at 1,400 percent over \npoverty, which puts them way above the middle class of the Philippines. \nThis is a tremendous windfall when you look at it from the standpoint \nof the size of the Philippine economy.\n  Mr. President, in total, S. 1315 proposes about $900 million worth of \nspending over 10 years. I will ask that a chart be put up so everybody \ncan see what S. 1315 does. I think many have construed that I am \nopposed to S. 1315. I am the ranking member. I only have one piece I am \nopposed to. I have been accused of holding the bill up since last \nAugust. I have tried to negotiate this one piece since last August. \nWhat you see there is the Filipino piece, which is No. 1 on the list--\n$332 million out of $900 million. The actual pension issue is $221 \nmillion. There is the term life insurance program, $326 million for our \nkids; the State approving agencies, $60 million; mortgage life \ninsurance, $51 million. You can go down the list. It is $909 million \nworth of benefits. I am only addressing a small sliver. It is a quarter \nof it in dollars, but it is a small piece. I am for everything else.\n  If you take the Filipino special pension out, today I will propose to \npass it under unanimous consent. I made the offer to the majority \nleader yesterday. This chart lists all of the provisions of S. 1315, \nfrom the most expensive provision to the least expensive provision. \nAgain, you can see that the Filipino piece is the most expensive \nprovision in S. 1315.\n  During a time of tight budgets, and when multiple commissions have \nrecommended that Congress focus our resources to improve the benefits \nof our U.S. returning combat veterans, it is plain wrong to put the \nneeds of Filipino veterans, with no service-related injuries, who are \nresiding in the Philippines, ahead of our own service-injured men and \nwomen returning from war. I am not sure it is defensible to suggest \nthat we are going to institute that special pension, which means we are \nnot going to divert that $221 million to our men and women.\n  I will have a substitute amendment tomorrow. The only change in my \nsubstitute amendment is that it keeps intact everything but the special \npension. It diverts the special pension and it enhances the ability for \nhousing upgrades for our disabled troops to be made from $50,000 to \n$55,000. It provides additional grants for disabled veterans who need \nupgrades to their vehicles that they drive; it will up the special \ngrants by $1,000. We are going to address additional burial benefits. \nWe are going to address some discrepancies in education benefits for \nour Guard and Reserve. We are using the $221 million solely to divert \nit to our veterans.\n  Each of us has met with veterans organizations and constituents who \nhave asked us to address the needs that exist in the veterans \ncommunity, particularly the needs of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines who are defending us in the war on terror. The distinguished \nmajority leader touched on this very point last Friday. Frankly, after \nreading his comments, I was hopeful he might support the amendment I am \noffering, the substitute amendment. On Friday, he talked about the \nnumber of Americans who died in Iraq. He talked about those who are \ncoming home with physical and mental wounds. He made the following \nstatement:\n\n       At the height of this war, with soldiers being wounded \n     every day and soldiers coming home from Iraq every day, we \n     can't even get a bill to deal with their health to the Senate \n     floor.\n\n  All I have ever asked for is a fair opportunity to amend the bill and \na fair length of time to debate the bill. The majority leader has to \nmake decisions as to whether he files cloture motions. He has filed 67 \nof them, because 67 times they tried to short the minority on our \nability to exercise the rights we have as the minority, which are not \nmany.\n  But 67 times it has been done, so 67 times he filed a cloture motion. \nThat is part of leading; I am sorry.\n  But don't suggest that the No. 1 thing that you are for is our guys, \nwhen $221 million of this is going to set up a new special pension fund \nfor Filipinos, who live in the Philippines, with no service-connected \ndisability. It is disingenuous.\n  There is consensus in this body for everything else in S. 1315, \nexcept for one provision. We have tried for months to negotiate that \none provision. For my colleagues who want to know why this bill has \nbeen at a standstill, it is because we have been trying to shift the \nmoney to our kids--our children and our grandchildren. At the committee \nmarkup last June, Senator Craig put forward an amendment to redirect \nthe Filipino pension fund to other priorities. It was rejected on a \nstraight party-line vote--another rarity in the Veterans' Committee. We \ndon't have party-line votes in the Veterans' Committee. For some \nreason, this year we have now had them.\n  In December, shortly after the Dole-Shalala disability commission \nrecommended we improve a host of benefits for war-injured veterans, I \noffered\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\nanother proposal to redirect the spending on pensions for Filipinos to \nhigher priorities. It too was rejected. Any claim that there has not \nbeen an attempt to try to negotiate what is in this bill is ludicrous. \nI put that proposal in the form of a bill, S. 2640. We cannot hide from \nit. We will vote on it. Members will be asked to choose between our \nveterans and a 1,400-percent pension over the poverty line in the \nPhilippines. That will happen tomorrow.\n\n  This comes down to where our priorities are--the Senate and this \nCongress. I believe our priorities should be on increasing the benefits \nthat apply to our guys. I believe that the substitute amendment I will \noffer that increases housing grants for profoundly disabled veterans \nwho need their homes modified is important. It should be a priority. I \nbelieve the auto grants for profoundly disabled veterans who need the \nfreedom of mobility to live independently is a priority. I believe \nimprovements to the education benefits for returning Guard and \nReservists is a priority. I am sad to say that we do increase the \nburial benefits. I am sorry it is a provision that people have to take \nadvantage of. But burial benefit increase is a priority of this \ncountry. I believe all of these things are absolutely crucial.\n  I met a veteran from North Carolina last year, Eric Edmundson. He \nneeded a vehicle because of his disabilities. An unbelievable soldier; \nan unbelievable American. He will never fully recover. He will only be \nmobile with the help of the aids we can make available to him. The \nEdmundsons found an accessible van to accommodate Eric's injuries for \n$45,000. They had to pay $14,000 out of pocket.\n  Can we put the need of that van for Eric Edmundson as a top priority? \nWe can if, in fact, we shift the $221 million that is going to people \nwho have no service-connected disability, don't live in the United \nStates, aren't U.S. citizens, didn't serve in the U.S. Army, but were \nunder U.S. command during World War II. We are not going to be able to \ndo it if, in fact, we don't shift the money.\n  My amendment would increase the auto grant benefit to $16,000 and, \nmore importantly, in the case of the housing benefit, the auto benefit, \nand the burial benefit, it would index it so that annually we don't \nhave to go in and legislate an increase. It increases with inflation, \nso for the first time what Congress does is actually thinks about the \nfuture and makes sure our veterans receive a benefit that is reflective \nof the inflation in between times that we have legislated.\n  Creating a pension in the Philippines, I suggest, is simply bad \npolicy. I will make a comment on why the Philippine pension is not only \nthe wrong priority, it cannot be justified as a matter of fairness. It \nis important to understand that VA pensions are designed for veterans, \nas I said earlier, to stay out of poverty. When we left the \nPhilippines, we made some commitments to the Filipino Government. We \ntransferred to them multiple hospitals and all the equipment that was \nin those hospitals. As a matter of fact, we granted them, at the time, \na tremendous amount of money. That money, in today's standards, would \nbe well into the billions of dollars. We didn't walk away and leave \nanybody without. We made sure that we rebuilt the country, but we also \nleft the infrastructure that was most needed.\n  Let me suggest to you that this pension creates a new inequity. There \nwere a lot of troops in the Second World War under U.S. command. They \nmight not have been a territory of the United States, but they signed \nup for their army, and they were under U.S. command. What is to keep \nthem from claiming they are owed a special pension from the United \nStates? They have never done it. These are the only ones who have. If \nyou think of all of our global partners who could claim, based upon \nthis precedent, quite frankly, it would be a difficult thing for this \ncountry to deal with.\n  As I said earlier, this new spending is paid for by reversing the \neffects of a U.S. Court of Appeals decision for veterans' claims \ndecision that granted extra pension benefits to elderly and poor U.S. \nveterans in a manner that was never intended by Congress.\n  Let me explain in layman's terms what that means. The VA made \nenhanced payments to U.S. veterans--benefits that were never intended \nin the letter of the law or in the intent of Congress. When the courts \ndetermined that, they pulled back about a billion dollars from this \ncountry's veterans. It is that billion dollars that is used in the \noffset for the $909 million spending plan we have in front of us today. \nI may argue the court's decision, but to take money from veterans in \nthe United States, who are slightly above the poverty threshold, and \nspend it on a new special pension for Filipino veterans, who are \nalready 400 percent above poverty in the Philippines, is flat wrong.\n  Let me say that again. What the court exercised was to take money \naway from U.S. veterans who are slightly over poverty, and I have said \nconstantly what we do with special pensions in the United States, we \nget about 10 percent over the poverty line. We have Filipinos today at \n400 percent over the poverty line, and the debate we are having is \nwhether we go to 1,400 percent over the poverty line.\n  One of the largest service organizations, the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, agrees. It passed a resolution in August urging Congress to use \nfunds from reversing the effects of the court decision on U.S. veterans \nand not to create new benefits for Filipino veterans. If my colleagues \nadopted that approach, as many of us have urged from the beginning, S. \n1315 would have become law in August 2007.\n  The chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee is a good man. He is \na friend. He sent me a letter on April 10, asking for my cooperation on \na way forward with some of the contentious issues in S. 1315--primarily \nthis--but on the very next day the majority leader was already talking \nabout filing a cloture motion on the bill. I was perplexed a little. On \nthe one hand, I had an offer to negotiate a way forward; but on the \nother hand, I have a cloture vote being proposed. I am not sure where \nthe disconnect is. I don't like to look back. I believe we should look \nforward.\n  I am prepared to go to the bill. I believe it would be extremely \nhealthy for this Congress and for the American people to be educated on \nexactly what this is about because this truly does beg where we place \nour priorities from the standpoint of the Senate. Are our priorities to \nfund our veterans, our kids with service-connected disabilities, or is \nour goal to set up a special pension for non-U.S. citizens who live in \nthe Philippines, with no service-connected injuries, and to divert that \nmoney away from our kids?\n  The answer is pretty simple for me. I believe our priority is to make \nsure our troops get it. I believe our priority should be to make sure \nour soldiers get whatever they need, to make sure the Eric Edmundsons \nof the world have the van they need for their disabilities, to make \nsure those who need adaptive housing because of their severe \ndisabilities from war have the money they need to upgrade their house \nso they can maneuver in it.\n  I daresay, a $1,000 increase on the auto grants and a $5,000 increase \non the adaptive housing is not enough. I can tell my colleagues, we \nneed to do more, and I am committed to say today I will do more. But \nhow are we going to do more if we show something as irresponsible as a \ndecision to spend $221 million that we have taken from U.S. veterans, \naway from people slightly over the poverty level, to allow it to go to \nindividuals who are going to be above the middle class in the \nPhilippines?\n  How can any veteran in America believe we are serious about \nprioritizing how we spend money in the future if, in fact, we display \nthis type of judgment and willingness to extract money from our \nveterans to create new programs?\n  I am fairly confident we have a number of Members who would like to \nspeak on this bill this evening. It is my hope we will have an \nopportunity to turn to consideration of the actual bill and to \nentertain any amendments our colleagues plan to offer on this bill.\n  When the majority leader left the floor earlier today, he said it was \nhis request that we move as quickly to conclusion of this bill as we \npossibly can. I have given my colleagues a small snippet tonight of \nwhat the history I looked at says of our leaders at the time. There was \nno documentation, there was no hearsay, there was no intent of those \nleaders or the Congress to\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\nactually extend a benefit such as those that have been described by \nsome of my colleagues.\n  Clearly, this Congress, as any Congress of the future, could elect to \nadd a benefit. For 50 years, the Congress could have added this \nbenefit. The further we get from the 1942 act and the interpretation by \nthe Court and the further we get from the 1946 Senate hearings that \ninitiated the Rescissions Act that took the Court's interpretation of \nwhat the Filipinos were due away, I am convinced it requires somebody \nto do their homework and come to the floor and remind us of where our \npriorities are in this country; that until we have more than our kids \nneed, the right priority is to spend it on ours and not necessarily on \nsomebody else's.\n  I reiterate the fact that our veterans and our VA pension is designed \nfor veterans who have no service-related injuries and who are poor, \naccording to the U.S. definition of poverty, and the maximum VA pension \npayable to a U.S.-based veteran puts him at 10 percent above poverty \nand at 17 percent of the median average household income.\n  Again, the Philippine Government currently provides a $120 pension to \nthis brave group of Filipino veterans, putting them at roughly 400 \npercent of poverty in the Philippines and 35 percent of the average \nhousehold income. Adding an additional VA pension today, adding the \npension that is already in S. 1315, would put a single Filipino veteran \nat 1,400 percent of the Filipino poverty level and 21 percent above the \naverage household income.\n  Think about that. Our special pension is going to put them 21 percent \nover what the average Filipino makes annually.\n  If the argument I have made is not credible from the standpoint of \nprioritizing our spending, that it should be our kids and not \nnecessarily their veterans, then I ask my colleagues: Is this our \nresponsibility? Our responsibility is to take individuals and to put \nthem 21 percent over the average working Filipino? I do not believe so. \nI do not believe that is a good thing. I believe it is wrong. But that \nis what we are being asked to do.\n  I am not sure the VA was intended to take people and put them in the \nmiddle class or, in the case of the Philippines, to put them above the \nmiddle class. It was to make sure our soldiers and their soldiers do \nnot live in poverty. Clearly, they are doing better than we are today, \nand I challenge us to do more about ours, or maybe it describes for us \nthe choice we have before us, that this would be ill-advised for us to \nproceed forward.\n  Since World War II, the United States of America has provided a \ntremendous amount to Filipino veterans. Congress authorized the \nconstruction and equipping of a hospital for the care of Filipino \nveterans. The Filipino Memorial Hospital Center VMMC was dedicated in \n1955 and turned over to the Filipino Government free of charge. \nCongress authorized the transfer of another hospital located at Fort \nMcKinley in the Philippines, including all the equipment contained in \nthe hospital, to the Republic of the Philippines. Congress provided \nthat annual grants be made to the Philippines to purchase equipment and \nmaterial for the operation of these hospitals. Congress also authorized \ndisability compensation, survivor compensation, funeral and burial \nbenefits, dependents' educational benefits at the rate of 50 cents on \nthe dollar for individuals residing in the Philippines and full-dollar \nbenefits for those residing in the United States. Full eligibility for \nVA health care was provided to Filipino veterans legally residing in \nthe United States.\n  We have done a lot. I am sure it is not as much as some want. We are \nfaced with a job where we have people come in and ask every day--there \nis something everybody needs. I learned very early in life that the \ntoughest thing to learn in life is to say no because that means \nsomebody is upset with you. But you cannot go through life without \nlearning the word ``no.'' You cannot do it in business, and you clearly \ncannot do it in politics. Maybe that is why Charles de Gaulle said \npolitics is too serious a matter to leave up to politicians. It \nrequires a participation level of the American people.\n  My hope is, over the next day, 2 days--whatever the leadership \ndecides is the future of this bill--that we will have an opportunity to \neducate the American people and, at the same time, we will educate \nMembers of the Senate that no matter how far you want to look back, no \nmatter how much you want to try to speculate what went on, that when \nyou stick with the written word, when you look at what President \nRoosevelt said, when you look at what General MacArthur said, when you \nlook at what the Senate did and Senator Hayden--and they were there at \nthe time and the Senate was charged with determining whether this \nbenefit was appropriate--that from all the information in real time \nthey looked at, their decision was the Rescissions Act, to take away \nwhat the courts had awarded.\n  Now, 50 years later, we are being asked not to apply what they \nthought was correct but to apply what we think today. Even if you use \nthat standard, I daresay you cannot make a claim that a special pension \nthat puts Filipino veterans who live in the Philippines, with no \nservice-connected injury, 21 percent over the median income in the \nPhilippines is the right thing for us to do.\n  I know there are several Members who are going to come over shortly. \nI expect Senator Chambliss any minute.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Earth Day and Global Warming\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 38 years ago this week, Senator Gaylord \nNelson of Wisconsin, a great environmentalist and a good friend of many \nof our colleagues who are still here, came to the Senate floor with a \nnovel idea. He proposed one day each year to honor our planet, an \noccasion to rededicate ourselves to stewardship of the Earth and the \nfight against pollution. He called his idea Earth Day.\n  When Senator Nelson proposed the first Earth Day in 1970, our \ncountry's environmental outlook was grim. Smog choked the air of Los \nAngeles, New York, and other great American cities; many communities \ndumped raw sewage and untreated industrial waste in our greatest \nrivers, including the Mississippi and the Illinois and the Hudson. \nPolluted air and fouled water weren't the only challenges troubling our \ncountry. We had endured a series of tragic assassinations of great \nleaders, we were torn over a war in Vietnam, and we had seen civil \nrights riots and antiwar demonstrations in our streets. The Nation was \ndivided and, frankly, losing the self-confidence for which Americans \nhave always been known.\n  But Gaylord Nelson was an optimist. He believed that with imagination \nand dedication, despite all the problems going on in the world, we \ncould attack at least one of our country's problems, and that was the \nproblem of pollution. With the commitment of our people and the \nleadership from our Government, we could devise ways to clean up our \nrivers and our lakes and the air we breathe. He was right.\n  Since 1970, when Congress passed the Clean Air Act, we have greatly \ncut the amount of noxious substances in the air we breathe. Emissions \nof carbon monoxide have fallen by 50 percent since 1980, according to \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, lead emissions are down 97 \npercent, and sulfur dioxide emissions have dropped by nearly 50 \npercent.\n  Since 1972, when the first clean water legislation passed, we have \nset high standards for water cleanliness and given our cities and towns \nthe resources they need to stop dumping untreated waste. Our great \nrivers--the Mississippi, the Ohio, and the Hudson--are healthier today \nthan they were 30 years ago.\n  Now, this doesn't mean we don't have challenges with the Clean Water \nAct and the Clean Air Act. As a member of the environmental committee, \nI know some of the problems we have seen with this administration in \nterms of rollbacks of some of these great strides. Nevertheless, we all \nknow things have improved with the Clean\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\nWater Act and the Clean Air Act since Gaylord Nelson declared Earth \nDay.\n  On Earth Day 2008, however, we confront a new environmental \nchallenge. It is a challenge of equal and perhaps greater magnitude. I \nam talking here about global climate change.\n  For several years, our country had a debate over whether climate \nchange was real or some sort of hoax perpetuated by doomsayers. That \ndebate is over. There is now an undeniable scientific consensus that \nthe Earth is warming. Study after study demonstrates that global \nwarming is real and that it is affecting us now.\n  Early last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued \nits latest report on the science of climate change. This report was \nproduced by some 600 authors from over 40 countries. Over 620 expert \nreviewers and a large number of government reviewers also participated. \nThis is a very cautious group of scientists with a very conservative \nprocess for meticulously reviewing the evidence and reaching their \nconclusions through consensus. What did they conclude? Well, they \nconcluded that changes in climate are now affecting physical and \nbiological systems on every continent.\n  Last November, the IPCC issued a followup report. It concluded that \n``warming of the climate system is unequivocal,'' based on observations \nof increases in global average air and ocean temperatures. It said that \nevidence from every continent shows dramatic changes in physical and \nbiological systems, including melting of the permafrost, rising water \ntemperatures, and changes in the habitat range of migratory animals.\n  So how did this all come about? Well, certain types of gases--most \nnotably carbon dioxide but also methane and nitrous oxide--accumulate \nin the atmosphere and then absorb or trap the sun's heat as it bounces \noff the Earth's surface. The problem is that carbon dioxide doesn't \ndissipate quickly; it stays in the atmosphere for five decades or more, \ncausing the Earth's temperatures to rise. This means that most of the \ncarbon dioxide produced in the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, and the \n1980s--as I look at our pages, Mr. President, I realize many of them \nwere not even born when this carbon dioxide was released--well, that \ncarbon dioxide is still in our atmosphere today. And it means that \ncarbon dioxide produced today will still be in our atmosphere in 2050 \nand beyond. All of that carbon dioxide has been trapping heat in our \natmosphere. Over time, it makes global temperatures rise. In turn, sea \nlevels rise--both because the water expands as the oceans warm and \nbecause melting glaciers and icecaps add more water.\n\n  Global warming is real, with enormous consequences for our world and \nfor our economy. For example, here is a chart which shows the rising \ntemperatures. Mr. President, 2006 was the hottest year ever in this \ncountry, capping a 9-year streak unprecedented in the historical \nrecord. The winter of 2006 was the warmest on record worldwide. Almost \nevery State in our country is seeing higher temperatures.\n  You can see what we have here, with the coldest being 1, the warmest \nbeing 112. And you can see for several of the States it was the record \nwarmest, and for most of the States it was much above normal, as in the \nPresiding Officer's State of New Jersey. Maybe you remember the year of \n2006--it wasn't that long ago--and you can see how hot it truly was \nwhen you look at it from a worldwide perspective. It doesn't mean you \nwon't have a year here or there that won't be normal, but when you look \nat the actual trend over the last decades, you see an increasing \nwarming temperature.\n  Worldwide, glaciers are rapidly melting. In fact, almost everything \nfrozen on our Earth is melting. A few months ago, it was reported that \nglaciers in the European Alps will be all gone by the year 2050. \nExperts believe that in 25 years there won't be a single glacier left \nin Glacier National Park. So if people are planning a vacation to visit \nGlacier National Park to see the glaciers, they better do it soon \nbecause experts predict that in 125 years there won't be any left.\n  Globally, sea levels have risen 4 to 10 inches over the past century. \nThe frequency of extremely heavy rainfalls has increased throughout \nmuch of the United States.\n  The impact is especially dire in Greenland and the Arctic region. The \ntemperature changes there have been the greatest, resulting in \nwidespread melting of glaciers, thinning of the polar icecap, and \nrising permafrost temperatures. You can see here in our picture that \nsince 1979, more than 20 percent of the polar icecap has melted away. \nThere is the North Pole, and you see the Arctic sea boundary that we \nhad in 1979, and now we have 20 percent melting of this icecap.\n  Well, I saw this firsthand, Mr. President, when I visited Greenland \nlast summer with my colleagues from the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Greenland has been called the canary in the coal mine for \nclimate change. They have seen vast changes. We talked to local \nresidents, and there are still more dogs than residents--more sled \ndogs--but we talked to some of the local residents who said they can \nremember the days when there was ice in their front yards, and now they \nare growing potatoes. They have lost the size of Texas and Arizona \ncombined into the sea from the icecap in Greenland.\n  Other changes, such as the recent increase in the severity of \nhurricanes and other extreme or destructive weather events, are \nconsistent with the kinds of changes scientists expect to occur on a \nwarming planet. They are early indicators of even more dramatic climate \nshifts and economic damage that await us if we don't reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions and attack the problem of global warming. So here you \nhave related economic losses, and these are, of course, from increased \nstorms and wildfires.\n  I think we all remember well the wildfires in California. I remember \nthis well because during the same time the wildfires were raging in \nCalifornia, we had a hearing in our Environment Committee where we had \nthe commission on disease control testify. We noticed, when we looked \nat the written testimony, it seemed kind of chopped up. It turned out \nit had been edited by the administration. Among other things, of the \nparts that were edited out was a part about the effect climate change \nwould have on disease and the mortality rates in our country. There was \nactually a part edited out that said it would lead to more wildfires in \nthe Western States, just as the wildfires were raging in California.\n  So this is an example of the increased economic loss we have seen \nthat are weather related in this country. You can see that from 1960 to \n1969, and then you go up to 1988 to 1997, and of course I am sure you \nare going to see more now.\n  We have had fires in Minnesota and floods in Minnesota, and the \npeople of our State are starting to see this in a very different way. \nIn our State, one economic loss that isn't one of these hurricanes or \nfires is the decreasing levels of Lake Superior. That will be \nsurprising to people who think sea levels are rising because \nGreenland's ice sheet is melting. Why would the level of our Great \nLakes be going lower? They are going lower because the ice is melting \nmore quickly, so the water evaporates, and Lake Superior is now at its \nlowest level in 80 years.\n  Now, you might think: Oh, Lake Superior is so cold, hardly anyone can \ngo swimming anyway. Who cares? Well, it affects our economy in \nMinnesota because the barges are not able to come in. We have shipped \nsomething like 300 tons less, by my memory--we will have to correct the \nrecord if I am wrong--300 tons less of traffic because these barges \ncannot carry as much because the water level of Lake Superior is so \nlow.\n  By that example, this is truly an issue that has finally moved out of \nthe science labs and the classrooms and the seminar rooms and has \nentered the everyday conversations of people in my State. I hear it \nfrom hunters across Minnesota, who notice how our valuable wetlands are \nchanging. I have heard it from the heads of our snow mobile \nassociations, who testified at a forum I had with our Governor on \nclimate change in January, because they have seen decreasing snow \nlevels. I hear about it from ice fisherman because they have seen it \ntakes longer for the ice to freeze and they can't put their fish houses \nout as early as they would like.\n  Just yesterday, USAToday had a story about the shrinking number of\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\nmoose in northern Minnesota. Biologists think that global warming is \naffecting the habitat of these moose and making them more vulnerable to \nparasites, causing an incredible reduction in the number of moose.\n  This is how real people in the real world are talking about this. \nThey are worried about what is happening to their planet and the \nconsequences that will have for all of us and our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  So the question is, How will we respond in Washington? I am actually \ngoing to give a talk on this every single week, Mr. President, up to \nour debate on this bill in June, and I figured a good day to start was \nwith Earth Day. But just to summarize--and I will go into more detail \nin other floor remarks I will make--how will Washington respond?\n  In December, the Environment and Public Works Committee approved a \nlandmark bipartisan bill to get our country moving in the fight against \nclimate change. I thank my colleagues, Senators Warner and Lieberman, \nfor their work on this legislation, and I thank Senator Boxer, the \nchairwoman of our committee, for her leadership in developing this bill \nand moving this bill through the committee.\n  This legislation is visionary, but it is also practical. The bill \nwould, for the first time, set mandatory caps on carbon dioxide \nemissions, on greenhouse gas emissions. It would establish a cap-and-\ntrade system to use market forces so that the private sector can reduce \ngreenhouse gas pollution in the most efficient way possible.\n  And I can tell you, we have learned from experience. We did this with \nacid rain, and it was very successful. We have seen from what the \nEuropean Union did what is good and bad, so we can learn from that \nexperience and do, I would say, a better job in this country, if we can \nget this right.\n  This legislation, in its first title, also contains my proposal, the \nbill I introduced with Senator Snowe, for a carbon counter, which is a \nnational greenhouse gas registry, because you can't fix a problem if \nyou can't measure it. Right now, we have 33 States off on their own \nstarting a climate registry, which shows how absurd the situation is \ngetting. They want to act because they are hearing from the people in \ntheir States. They know they can't wait, so they have started their own \nclimate registry, instead of what makes sense, which is a Federal \nregistry. And that is the first title of this bill.\n  In a few weeks, we are going to bring the Lieberman-Warner bill to \nthe floor, and we will have a chance to take a historic step on behalf \nof our country--in fact, on behalf of the entire world. As we prepare \nto consider this important legislation, there is something else we need \nto remember, and that is that global warming is, of course, a huge \nchallenge, but it also presents opportunities for our country. It gives \nus the opportunity to develop new technologies, new jobs, and new \nindustries. It gives us the opportunity to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil, which just hit another record of $117 per barrel this \nweek. It gives us an opportunity to give consumers new, cheaper \nalternatives to fossil fuels. Whether it is an electric car, a hybrid \ncar, or looking at what Brazil did with sugar cane, where they became \nenergy independent, so they are not dependent on foreign oil, we know \nthere are things we can do beyond what we are doing now with \nswitchgrass, prairie grass, and all kinds of alternative \ntechnologies. But we have to set the standards as a government so we \ncan encourage that kind of investment. We are not going to have a \nsilver bullet here. As we like to say in Minnesota, we will have silver \nbuckshot. We are going to have a number of proposals and alternatives, \nbut we have to get moving by setting the standards.\n\n  This is an opportunity that we must seize now. I am proud to \ncelebrate Earth Day today, to join with my colleagues and millions of \nAmericans in honoring our planet. But in the decades since Gaylord \nNelson sponsored the first Earth Day, the occasion has often turned \ninto a symbolic event, a day for teach-ins at our schools and rallies \nat our State capitols. I participated in them myself.\n  But today, 38 years after its inception, we have the opportunity to \nreturn to the original spirit of Earth Day and celebrate the occasion \nwith action, the action of investing in the farmers and the workers of \nthis country instead of the oil cartels of the Mideast; the action of \nfinally doing something to set that investment in place so we can \ndevelop the next generation of new technology, as we did when we said \nwe were going to put a man on the Moon. It was great to put a man on \nthe Moon and beat Russia--and look at what came out of that: the CAT \nscan and infrared technology. I remember in the 1970s my family went on \ncamping trips with those little chocolate space sticks that came out of \nthat trip to the Moon--hundreds and hundreds of new technological \ndevelopments because our Nation put its mind on one goal.\n  This is another time to take action. We will have a chance to pass \nthis climate change legislation that is forward looking, that is \nbipartisan, and that is pragmatic. We will have the chance to answer \nthe call of the people in this country--the little kids with the \npenguin buttons, the hunters of Minnesota who see the changes of their \nwetlands. They see the urgency of this issue. We have a chance to \nregain world leadership on the most pressing environmental challenge of \nour day. We will have a chance to take our place in a great tradition \nof environmental stewardship in the Senate and to renew the promise \nthat Americans made on the first Earth Day, 38 years ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are \npostcloture and I have up to 1 hour, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend for a moment, please.\n  The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S. 1315, but to \nspeak in favor of Senator Burr's alternative bill, S. 2640, the \nVeterans' Benefit Act of 2008. As we continue to prosecute the global \nwar on terrorism and take care of our veterans who are returning from \nthat effort, as well as take care of veterans from all our past \nconflicts, our Nation has an obligation to these veterans and their \nfamilies who make the greatest sacrifices to defend our Nation and \nfreedom across the world. This obligation extends to providing our \nbrave young men and women with the optimal rehabilitation care, \ncompensation packages, and long-term benefits for their service.\n  This is a very familiar issue to me, and I was pleased to offer \nseveral amendments with my Senate Armed Services Committee colleagues \nduring last year's markup of the wounded warrior bill, which will go a \nlong way to improving the treatment and benefits these wounded warriors \nwill receive, both now and in the future. Both of the bills at issue \ntoday go a long way to further improving the care of our veterans and \nwounded warriors, and it is very clear that both Senator Burr and \nSenator Akaka worked very hard to craft bills that will benefit our \nveterans and their families.\n  S. 1315 makes many significant changes in the area of insurance, \nhousing, labor, and education benefits for our veterans. However, the \nbill pays for these increased entitlements by reversing a 2006 court \ndecision, which would effectively take $2,000 annually from poor, \nelderly, disabled wartime U.S. veterans.\n  Also included in the bill's spending is $221 million to create a new \npension benefit for Filipino veterans residing in the Philippines, all \nof whom are not U.S. citizens and none of whom have any disabilities \nrelating to World War II service.\n  There are two significant problems with the new spending on Filipino \nveterans. First, it takes money from poor veterans in the United \nStates, to in effect create a middle class of non-United States \nveterans residing in the Philippines. Second, it comes at the expense \nof benefit improvements that are needed for our returning combat \nveterans of the war on terror.\n  Under current law, a VA pension benefit paid to an individual U.S. \nveteran cannot exceed $11,181 a year, which is roughly 17 percent of \nthe United States average household income. S. 1315 would create a new, \nspecial pension benefit for Filipino veterans in the Philippines that \nwill put them at over 87 percent of average household income in the \nPhilippines!\n  As Senator Burr stated on the floor earlier today, the contributions \nof Filipino veterans during World War II is a\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\nmatter of public record and is without dispute. We do owe them a huge \ndebt. They fought on the side of the allies and made a significant \ncontribution to the war effort. However, it is not fair to fund a \npension for these veterans at the expense of poor U.S. veterans, which \nthis bill unfortunately does.\n  I hope the supporters of S. 1315 will hear me when I say that a vote \nagainst this bill is not a vote against the contribution that the \nFilipino veterans made to the effort in World War II. Rather, it is a \nvote against taking an existing benefit away from a U.S. veteran.\n  Senator Burr's alternative, S. 2640, will provide veterans with \nimproved life insurance policies, enhance the veterans mortgage life \ninsurance program, improve disabled veterans housing benefits by 10 \npercent, as well as index future housing benefits to inflation.\n  S. 2640 also provides for automatic annual increases in burial \nbenefits for our veterans families as well as improved educational \nopportunities to our National Guardsmen and Reservists who serve for a \ntotal of 2 years in an active-duty status.\n  In relation to Filipino veterans, S. 2640 provides a pension plan to \nFilipino veterans who have resided in the United States and have not \nreceived any benefits from the Filipino Government. In addition, it \nprovides for full disability compensation for Filipinos residing \nanywhere in the world.\n  Our Nation's commitment and number 1 priority must rest with taking \ncare of our current veterans, particularly those who have disabilities \nresulting from their service, which 2640 provides. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support S. 2640, which provides the right compensation \nand the right policies for the right servicemembers.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Burr.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank my friend and colleague from Georgia.\n  I think my colleague put it very well. The big question is, has the \nU.S. Government met its obligation to Filipino veterans? I think that \nis at the heart of what some Members have raised with respect to this \nspecial pension. Let me say, Filipinos who fought under U.S. command in \nWorld War II were no doubt invaluable to the victory in the Pacific. \nYes, they were U.S. nationals at the time, but they were also on a \ntimetable to transition to a newly independent, sovereign Philippine \nUnion. Thus, their welfare has always been a shared responsibility \nbetween the U.S. Government and the Philippine Government.\n  Here is what the U.S. taxpayer has already funded to meet United \nStates commitments to the Filipino veterans. After the war the U.S. \nprovided $620 million--that is $6.2 billion in today's dollars--for \nrepair of public property, war damage claims, and assistance to the \nPhilippine Government. VA compensation for service-related disabilities \nand survivor compensation was also provided, paid at a rate that \nreflected differences in the cost of living in the Philippines.\n  Let me suggest, about this cost of living consideration, the first \ntime it has been raised is not today by me. It was actually applied in \nthe 1940s, at the conclusion of the conflict, to the United States.\n  No. 2, the United States provided $22.5 million--$196 million in \ntoday's dollars--for the construction and equipping of a hospital in \nthe Philippines for the care and treatment of Filipino veterans. In \naddition, the United States provided annual grants for operation of the \nhospital which was later donated to the Filipino Government. The grant \nassistance continues to this day.\n  Survivors of Philippine veterans who died as a result of service are \neligible for educational assistance benefits, paid at a rate that \nreflects the differences in the cost of living.\n  All of a sudden we have second reference to payments being made in \nthe Philippines at the conclusion of the conflict where the cost of \nliving differential was considered in what the United States payment \nwas.\n  Filipino veterans legally residing in the United States are entitled \nto a full rated compensation, full rate cash benefits, full access to \nthe VA health clinics and medical centers, and burial in our Nation's \nnational cemeteries.\n  In addition to that, I have mentioned another hospital at Fort \nMcKinley that was donated to the Philippine Government.\n  The big question for Members of the Senate and members of the \nRoosevelt administration, the Secretary of War at the time, was how can \nwe best help the Filipino people? How can we best help these veterans? \nIt was to reconstruct the country. It was to create an infrastructure \nwhere health care could be delivered. It was to repair roads. It was to \nrepair the infrastructure so the Philippines post war could have an \neconomy, not dissimilar to the Marshall plan in Europe where the United \nStates and others--primarily us--funded the reconstruction of much of \nEurope. That is because we knew a country without an economy, without \nthe ability to manufacture something, without the ability for its \npeople to earn something, probably would not survive.\n  We made the right decision. We pumped into the infrastructure \nbillions of dollars by today's standards. We gave them hospitals. We \nbuilt them hospitals. We gave them equipment. We bought them equipment. \nToday we still provide a grant assistance to the Philippines for the \ncare of Filipino veterans.\n  Some might say if we had a different administration maybe things \nwould be different. On July 25, 1997, the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs heard testimony of Stephen Lemons, Acting Under Secretary for \nBenefits, in opposition to the bill granting full VA benefits to \nFilipinos. It was not the Bush administration, it was the Clinton \nadministration. This has spanned 50 years. Think of the numbers of \nadministrations. The quote then was:\n\n       Its enactment would upset decades-old policies which have \n     authorized some but not all VA benefits based on this \n     service.\n\n  I go on:\n\n       History shows that the limitations on eligibility for U.S. \n     benefits based on service in these Philippine forces were \n     based on a carefully considered determination of the \n     government's responsibility towards them.\n\n  I also continue:\n\n       Current law appropriately recognizes our two nations' \n     shared responsibility for well-being, and should not be \n     changed as proposed by this bill.\n\n  The Clinton administration lobbied Congress not to do what we are \nconsidering doing in S. 1315. What is it? To extend a new, special \npension to Filipino veterans who live in the Philippines, who have no \nservice-connected disability, that, along with the Philippine pension \nthat is currently in place, would put these individuals at 1,400 \npercent over the poverty line and 27 percent over the average median \nincome of the Philippine people.\n  Now, I went a little bit further. I checked out this book from 1948. \nIt is called House Committee Hearings. I want to turn to one section I \nthink is pertinent to this debate. Because 1946 was the year we passed \nthe Rescissions Act. The Rescissions Act revised the Court's \ninterpretation of what were VA benefits. This sheds a tremendous amount \nof light on the difference between my understanding and what those who \nwere charged with investigating U.S. obligations at the time were.\n  There was a Father Haggerty who testified in front of the committee. \nThese are Father Haggerty's words:\n\n       It was constantly promised that as the Ambassador mentioned \n     in radio broadcasts, official American broadcasts to the \n     Philippines during the war, it was definitely promised by \n     General MacArthur, General Wainwright, and also it has been \n     acknowledged, I believe, that Filipino groups recognized the \n     guerillas, acting as members of the United States Armed \n     Forces, were entitled at one time to the complete GI bill of \n     rights; that is, they were included. I believe that is \n     correct, and were later left out.\n\n  Mr. Allen, a member of the committee:\n\n       May I say this, Father, I know you are sincere about it. \n     But I think you are in error there because there are three or \n     four of us here on the committee who were present when the GI \n     bill was written. And I do not think this was ever entered \n     into.\n       The chairman: ``It did not come up?''\n       Mr. Allen: ``The Filipinos never entered into it.''\n       Father Haggerty: ``I am also speaking of the impression \n     that they all had.''\n       Mr. Allen: ``We are not responsible for impressions, of \n     course.''\n\n  I said earlier I have tremendous respect for my colleagues who are on \nthe\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\nopposite side of this issue with me. I am sure their recollections--\nthey served, I did not--are probably as accurate as Father Haggerty, \nwho in 1948, voluntarily, I think, went in front of a House committee, \nprobably the veterans committee, along with an ambassador, and the \nAmbassador swore: ``This is what I understood.''\n  Father Haggerty said:\n\n       This was what I--I heard it, I heard the American \n     Government say it. I heard General MacArthur say it, General \n     Wainwright say it.\n\n  Well, I said earlier to those who were listening, we had testimony \nfrom the Army that said: We looked at General MacArthur's records. We \nlooked at President Roosevelt's records. There was never an intent for \nthis to be extended.\n  Now, what we find in the Congressional hearing in 1948 is those \nspecific questions were asked by members, and Father Haggerty swears \nthis was accurate, that we said this, that this was the intent of the \nGI bill.\n  And Mr. Allen, a member of the committee:\n\n       May I say this, Father? I know you are sincere about it. \n     But I think you are in error. You are in error because there \n     are three or four of us on this committee who were present \n     when the GI bill was written, and I do not think this was \n     ever entered into.\n\n  I am sure as we go through this, we are going to find others who come \nto the floor and say: Listen, I know this was the intent of Congress. \nIt is probably the way they envisioned it today. But when you go back \nto the actual records of the 1940s, when you go back to the 1948 \ntestimony, when you go back to the 1946 rescissions bill, when you go \nback to 1944, and Senator Hayden, this has been explored over and over \nand over. In every case, with different members, they came to the same \nconclusion. Let me read from a more recent committee hearing, the \ncommittee hearing that took place last year with Senator Craig, who was \nthen ranking member of the committee, as he talked to Mr. Ron Aument.\n  He said:\n\n       Ron, let me take off from where the chairman has gone with \n     a couple of questions. If the committee were to structure a \n     pension benefit for those residing in the Philippines that \n     had the same purchasing power that a pension recipient in the \n     United States had, what would be the equivalent maximum \n     pension benefit? Have you ever done any calculations based on \n     S. 57?\n       Mr. Aument: Yes, we have, Senator Craig. It has not been a \n     simple calculation because some of the economic statistics \n     that we would be turning to are not as readily available to \n     us. Having said that, if we take a look at what today's \n     pension rate for an American veteran is with one dependent, \n     we mentioned it was around $14,000 annually, and contrast \n     that to the average household income for the most recent \n     census statistic we had at around $46,000 annually, it is \n     around 30 percent of the average household income.\n       If we were to compare that to the average household income \n     in the Philippines of around $2,800, we are speaking around \n     $820 annually in the form of a pension.\n\n  So last year, to bring on par with the United States, on what we do \nwith special pensions for veterans, we made a commitment that they will \nnot live in poverty. What Mr. Aument said was:\n\n       If we calculated today the Filipino pension, that would be \n     identical to the U.S. pension, it would be $820. The existing \n     Filipino pension to the Filipino veterans is $120 a month, \n     which equates to 400 percent above poverty.\n\n  Our own witness early last year basically said that the average \nhousehold income in the Philippines was $2,800, and $820 annually would \nput a Filipino veteran on the same par with an American veteran \nreceiving a special benefit, a special pension.\n  Yet what we are here to debate over the next several days is whether \nthe Senate is going to extend to these Filipino veterans who live in \nthe Philippines, who have no service-connected disability, a pension, \nin combination with the Philippine Government, that will equal 1,400 \npercent above poverty, that will equal 27 percent above the median \nincome in the Philippines.\n  We base this all off the belief that we made a promise we are not \nkeeping. I gave three specific instances before, I read from the \ncommittee hearing from last year, that dispel any belief that there was \never a promise. The 1948 account I read from the House committee \nhearing is not the only one; it is the 1946 Rescissions Act, it is the \n1944 hearing with Senator Hayden. All of them point to the fact that \nthose people who were involved in crafting, writing, and passing the GI \nbill had no intent for this benefit to ever be extended.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will see the priorities we are faced with \nas it relates to our own veterans, that they will look at these \nseverely disabled soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines who are \ncoming back from Afghanistan and Iraq today, having given their all, \ninjured in a way we cannot replace but with an opportunity to \nsupplement their quality of life.\n\n  We can supplement that through a number of different fashions. We can \nsupplement that by extending and raising the housing provisions for \ntheir ability to adapt their houses to their disability, $5,000 more \ndollars; we can raise the grant allowance for cars so individuals such \nas Eric Edmundson's family is not stuck with $14,000 out-of-pocket to \nmake sure they have a van that his wheelchair can go into, that lifts \nhim up, and gives him the ability to have some degree of mobility.\n  I think that is the priority. That is the choice tomorrow that \nMembers of this body will be given in a substitute that I will propose, \nthat still embraces the majority of what Senator Akaka had in his bill \nbut eliminates one glaring thing, it eliminates the special pension for \nFilipino veterans who live in the Philippines, with no service-\nconnected disability.\n  It replaces it with an expansion of veterans' benefits for our \nsoldiers or our airmen, our soldiers, our marines. I am convinced this \nis not only the right thing to do, that we have a historical blueprint \nthat tells us that folks before us who held our jobs have already \njudged that this is not a promise that is broken; that when you look at \nthe numbers, I am not sure you can be more compassionate. We are not \nthis compassionate to our own troops, to our own veterans.\n  How can anybody come to the floor and make a claim that providing a \npension 1,400 percent above the poverty rate, when our veterans are at \n10 percent above poverty, is equitable or fair; that there should be \none taxpayer who should be asked to contribute to something that does \nnot affect increasing the quality of life of our veterans first and \nforemost.\n  I think America would hold a different compassion if the current \nPhilippine pension did not provide a cushion between poverty and the \nstipend they get of 400 percent. I think we can make the case that it \nis not a big enough cushion to have American veterans only 10 percent \nabove the poverty line.\n  But we have an opportunity not to grow it from 400 to 1,400 and to \nuse that extra 1,000 percent to actually affect the lives of our \nservice personnel who are severely disabled who are coming home every \nsingle day.\n  It is my hope and my belief that tomorrow my colleagues will \nunderstand the importance of my substitute amendment. It does not \ndevalue the contribution the Filipino veterans made to the United \nStates and to the war in World War II. What it does is recognize the \ncommitment we already made to the Philippines, to its people, \nrecognizing the fact that the group that we are talking about was part \nof the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines, not the Army of the United \nStates; that even though they were commanded by Americans, they were \npart of a military that existed within the Philippines, and to suggest \nthat being part of somebody else's Army but commanded by us would \nsuggest that most everybody who was under U.S. command in World War II \nin the European theaters would now be eligible if this precedent went \nthrough for a special pension, that is not the intent of this Congress, \nit is not the intent of past Congresses, and certainly I do not think \nit is the intent of the American people.\n  I believe the responsible thing to do is to pass this package that \nhas over $900 million worth of benefits, $800 million under the \nsubstitute that would go to our children and our grandchildren, and 100 \nmillion that would go still to Filipino veterans who live in the United \nStates or live in the Philippines but have service-connected \ndisabilities.\n  We are not an uncompassionate country. We do not believe our \ntaxpayers should help to drive an income level of someone else to a \npoint that we are not willing to commit to our own. When we have our \nveterans at 1,400 percent of\n\n[[Page S3247]]\n\npoverty, I am willing to come to the floor and talk about putting their \nveterans to 1,400 percent of poverty.\n  But those who have held our job before us have already determined \nthere is not a promise, there is not an obligation, there is not a \npiece of paper that said we were going to do this. A lot of people \nthink there was. But there was not.\n  I look forward to the opportunity to debate the amendment and to \ndebate in more depth the history of this benefit and this obligation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a \ncosponsor of S. 1315.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I come to the floor this evening to speak on behalf of \nthe Veterans' Benefits Enhancement Act embodied in S. 1315. This \nlegislation passed the Veterans' Affairs Committee in August of 2007. I \nknow the work that goes on in that committee because I served on that \ncommittee with Senator Akaka and many Members. It is an important \ntradition that committee has worked in a bipartisan spirit to make sure \nthe United States honors the debt we owe to our veterans, some 25 \nmillion veterans in America and 1.4 million, 1.5 million veterans of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. It is through \nthat committee that legislation emerges to make sure the promise this \nNation makes to its veterans is a promise we keep.\n  In my view, the fact that so much time has passed since S. 1315 came \nout of the Veterans' Affairs Committee in August 2007 until we have it \ntoday on the floor is, frankly, inexcusable. At the end of the day, the \ncommittee worked to put together legislation to better serve the \nNation's veterans.\n  The legislation before us does some very important things. It expands \neligibility for traumatic injury insurance. That is very important, \nespecially today when we see the kind of trauma and injuries our \nveterans are facing coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. We have now \nover 30,000 veterans who have been grievously wounded in that war. I \nknow most of my colleagues have been to Walter Reed or to veterans \nhospitals where they have seen the kind of wounds our veterans are \nexperiencing because of explosions of IEDs and other kinds of attacks \nmade on our troops. The expansion of traumatic injury insurance is \nimportant for our men and women who serve.\n  The bill also extends the eligibility for specially adapted housing \nunits to veterans with severe burns. I know in my visits to those who \nhave been wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, I have seen many who are in \nburn units who have suffered the scars of this war. This benefit for \nhousing units that are specially adapted for those who are suffering \nburn injuries is a very important provision in this legislation that \nwill be part of our efforts to make sure we are providing support to \nour veterans who have served.\n  This legislation is also important because it increases benefits for \nveterans pursuing apprenticeships or on-the-job training programs. \nAcross the country and in my State of Colorado, we know there are many \nveterans who are unemployed. In fact, in most States, about half of the \nhomeless population comes from the veterans ranks. So providing on-the-\njob training opportunity for these veterans is important. This \nlegislation does that.\n  For all of the good things this legislation does, we could have taken \nit through this Chamber, through the House of Representatives, and to \nthe President's desk, and we could have had that legislation already in \nlaw. We could have the framework of a law now honoring the veterans of \nAmerica in the way they should be honored. Yet because of one provision \nof this legislation, it has been held up not 1 month, 2 months, but \nsince August of 2007, to the point where today it is already April of \n2008, and we are on the floor of the Senate trying to break a \nfilibuster over legislation that is supposed to provide a benefit to \nour veterans in important ways.\n  The provision which some on the other side have objected to--not all \nof them but some of them--has to do with the treatment of Filipino \nveterans during World War II. I join, proudly, my colleagues--Senator \nInouye and Senator Stevens--in support of the legislation that would \nrestore the benefits to Filipino veterans by granting them full \nveterans' status for the sacrifices they made during World War II.\n  Over the last half century, the treatment of Filipino World War II \nveterans, in my view, has been a stain on our national honor.\n  The Philippines became a possession of the United States in 1898, \nwhen it was ceded by Spain following the Spanish-American War. During \nthat time period, and for the following 60-some years, the United \nStates essentially controlled the territory and the people of the \nPhilippines.\n  It was in 1934, then, that the Congress enacted the Philippine \nIndependence Act. That provided a 10-year timeframe for the \nindependence of the Philippines. But it was during that 10-year \ntimeframe, when the Philippines essentially were in a commonwealth \nstatus relationship to the United States of America, that the clouds of \nwar and the horrific war of World War II beset the entire globe.\n  Between 1934 and 1946, the United States retained powers over the \nPhilippines, including the right as a government to call the military \nforces organized by the Commonwealth Government into the services of \nthe Armed Forces of the United States.\n  On July 26, 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt issued a military \norder calling on the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines to serve with \nthe Armed Forces of the United States in the Far East.\n  The Filipinos who served were entitled to full veterans' benefits by \nreason of their service under the command of our Armed Forces.\n  Of the 470,000--that is 470,000; that is nearly half a million--\nFilipino veterans who volunteered, approximately 200,000 served in the \nPhilippine Commonwealth Army, the Philippine Army Air Corps, and the \nPhilippine Army Offshore Patrol--all under the command of the United \nStates of America and our military.\n  We, I believe, in America cannot forget the sacrifice of our Filipino \nfriends who fought side by side with American soldiers in World War II.\n  They constituted the vast majority of the 80,000 soldiers who \ndefended the Bataan Peninsula against the Japanese invasion.\n  They constituted the vast majority--the vast majority--of the \nsoldiers who were forced on the Bataan Death March.\n  They fought side by side with American soldiers to defend Corregidor \nin 1942.\n  They fought as guerrillas after the Japanese captured the \nPhilippines.\n  They worked behind enemy lines to provide intelligence to the \nAmerican Army. More than half the battalion that was tasked with \nproviding intelligence from the occupied Philippines later received the \nBronze Star for their heroic service.\n  When President Roosevelt signed a bill for the Filipinos to enlist in \nthe U.S. Army, the Army stood up two entirely new regiments--the 1st \nand 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiments.\n  The 1st and 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiments participated in the \nbloody combat and mop-up operations at New Guinea, Leyte, Samar, Luzon, \nand other major battles in the Philippines.\n  Members of the 1st Regiment were also attached to the U.S. 6th Army, \nand they were working often behind enemy lines to help free the Allied \nprisoners from the death camps in 1945.\n  In my view, the Filipinos who served in World War II were entitled to \nfull veterans' benefits by reason of their service with our Armed \nForces. Despite all their sacrifices--despite all their sacrifices--\nafter the war was over, after the Philippines gained officially their \nindependence, the Congress passed the Rescissions Act of 1946, now \ncodified in our U.S. law.\n  The 1946 act precluded most of the Filipino World War II veterans \nfrom receiving veterans' benefits that were available to them prior to \n1946 and that are available to all other veterans of\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n\nour Armed Forces today regardless of race, national origin or \ncitizenship status.\n  S. 1315, today, would restore veterans status to those World War II \nheroes and, in particular, it would provide pension benefits to aid \nFilipino veterans residing in the Philippines during their twilight \nyears.\n  The pension benefits under S. 1315 would amount to less than one-\nthird--to less than one-third--of the basic pension amount provided to \nveterans living in the United States of America today. The average \nincome of persons residing in the Philippines, however, is considerably \nlower than their counterparts in the United States. So the pension \nbenefits under S. 1315 would provide a decent standard of living to \nthese veterans.\n  Our Nation cannot abandon those who have served under our flag and \nwho have served under our command. We must rally in support of these \nproven friends of America and act to redeem our Nation's debt in honor \nof their service.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1315 in its entirety, and to \nsupport granting the benefits that the Filipino veterans from World War \nII, in my view, have earned.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of the \nVeterans' Benefits Enhancement Act of 2007. This bill expands much \nneeded and long overdue benefits for the men and women in uniform who \nhave served overseas in difficult and dangerous circumstances to keep \nAmerica safe.\n  We must honor our U.S. soldiers who have died in the name of their \ncountry. These service men and women are America's true heroes and on \nthis day we pay tribute to their courage and sacrifice by bringing this \nbill to the Senate floor. Some have given their lives for our country. \nAll have given their time and dedication to ensure our country remains \nthe land of the free and the home of the brave. We owe a special debt \nof gratitude to each and every one of them.\n  Our Nation has a sacred commitment to honor the promises made to \nsoldiers when they signed up to serve our country. As a member of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, I fight hard each year to make sure \npromises made to our service men and women are promises kept. These \npromises include access to quality, affordable health care and a proper \nburial for our veterans.\n  That is why I am an enthusiastic supporter of the Veterans' Benefits \nEnhancement Act of 2007. This bill provides an increase in burial \nbenefits for the families of our wounded or disabled veterans, which I \nhave been fighting for since 2001. This means that service-connected \nburial benefits will increase by $2,100 for a total of $4,100; non \nservice-connected burial benefits will increase by $900 for a total of \n$1,200; and, plot allowances will increase by $445 for a total of $745. \nThese benefits will increase annually to keep up with inflation.\n  I am also proud to support this bill because it takes an important \nstep in recognizing the sacrifices made by our men and women of the \nNational Guard and Reserve by expanding the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, outreach program. This program provides important \ninformation about benefits and services that veterans and their \nspouses, children and parents may be eligible for through the VA. By \nexpanding this program we are ensuring that our citizen soldiers and \ntheir families have the resources and help they need to make a \nsuccessful transition back to civilian life after answering our \nNation's call.\n  This bill also recognizes the sacrifices of veterans who are \nsuffering from the physical, permanent wounds of war. It expands \neligibility for traumatic injury insurance and specially adapted \nhousing benefits to veterans with severe burns. It also restores \nveteran status to Filipino veterans who served under United States \ncommand in World War II.\n  Whether fighting to defend democracy overseas or standing sentry on \nthe home front, America's veterans have been there for us. We have a \nsacred commitment to honor all of the promises made to them when they \nsigned up to fight for us. That's why I am fighting hard today and \neveryday in the U.S. Senate to ensure that the federal government \nmaintains its commitment to veterans. Promises made must be promises \nkept.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3248-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3248-S3249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1315 AND H.R. 2831\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, here we are again not being able to go to \nthe bill. I would hope we could go to this bill tomorrow and debate it \nall day. As everyone, I think, knows, we would like to have a vote \ntomorrow night at 6 o'clock on the reversal of the Ledbetter decision.\n  So I have conferred with the manager of the bill and told him I was \ngoing to ask consent that in the morning we have the opportunity to go \nto the bill and legislate--have people offer amendments on it \ntomorrow--that we would go at 6 o'clock tomorrow to the cloture vote--\nthe motion has been filed--on the Ledbetter decision. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would my friend like me to be a little more \nspecific?\n  Mr. BURR. I would love for that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, \nApril 23, following a period of morning business, the motion to proceed \nto S. 1315 be agreed to; and that the vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, occur at 6 \np.m., with the time from 5 to 6 p.m. equally divided and controlled \nprior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURR. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. We had a unanimous vote earlier today to proceed to the \nbill. I believe it has been a productive day. I believe Members have \nlearned a lot in the debate, and I think it is important to get the \nhistory of the issue on the record for all Members.\n  Having said that, I am prepared to begin consideration of the bill \nand for the amendment process to begin as well. Under the rules, my \nunderstanding is the cloture vote on Ledbetter would proceed an hour \nafter we convene.\n  Now, I am not in a position to delay the Ledbetter bill, but I am in \na position to agree to go immediately in the morning to consideration \nof S. 1315. The way the majority leader has worded his unanimous \nconsent request would push off the rules of the Senate, requiring that \nthe Ledbetter vote be in the morning. So, therefore, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think my friend may have misunderstood my \nconsent request. I think it is appropriate--we would not have to have \nmorning business in the morning. We could go directly to the bill in \nthe morning. We could convene at 9:30, 10 o'clock--whatever would be \nconvenient to the minority--and we would legislate on that all day \ntomorrow, offer amendments. My friend wants to, I am sure, offer an \namendment to change the provision in the bill as it relates to \nFilipinos. That would be fine.\n  At 6 o'clock we would have a vote on a motion that has already been \nfiled to invoke cloture on Ledbetter. That would take 20 minutes. That \nis all it would take. And then, if cloture, of course, is invoked, then \nwe would be on Ledbetter. If it were not invoked, then we would be \nright back on S. 1315.\n  So again, I say to my friend, I think it is a good idea we go to the \nlegislation in the morning. I wanted to do it Thursday night. We did \nnot do it Thursday night. We did not do it Friday. We did not do it \nMonday. We have not done it today. So I would hope on Wednesday morning \nwe could do that. That was my consent: We go to that, we take a brief \npause at 6 o'clock tomorrow evening to vote on cloture on\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\nLedbetter. It would take, as I said, no longer than 15 minutes, maybe \n20 minutes if somebody is late for the vote, but that is how long it \nwould take.\n  So that seems appropriate.\n  Mr. BURR. May I ask a question of the majority leader?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  Mr. BURR. My understanding in the unanimous consent request is that \nas to the rule that would require us to vote on cloture on the \nLedbetter issue 1 hour after we started business tomorrow, under the \nunanimous consent request, the majority leader has asked that to be \npostponed until 6:30 tomorrow night. Am I correct?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. What I did ask is that the vote on Ledbetter would be \nat 6 o'clock tomorrow.\n  Mr. BURR. Six o'clock. I apologize.\n  Mr. REID. The reason being--and it is certainly no secret to anyone--\nwe have a number of Senators who want to vote on that matter, and we \nwould ask that be the schedule.\n  I would say no one would be inconvenienced with that. If my friends \ndo not accept the consent request I offer, then the only alternative we \nhave is to waste another day because we are postcloture with 30 hours. \nThat time expires at 6 o'clock tomorrow. That is what time it expires. \nThat is why that arbitrary 6 o'clock time was chosen.\n  As I repeat, Thursday we could have been on the bill. Friday we could \nhave been on the bill. Monday we could have been on the bill. Tuesday \nwe could have been on the bill. As I have indicated--and I am certain \nmy friend has heard some of the statements that have been made today \nabout our not being able to legislate--we have had to invoke cloture so \nmany different times it is difficult to comprehend, but it is \napproaching 70 times. It would seem to me it would not be a fruitful \nuse of the time not to be in session until 5 o'clock tomorrow. Because \nunder the rules--my friend is right--cloture happens automatically an \nhour after we come into session. So it is going to happen at 6 o'clock \nno matter what.\n  It would seem to me, as to this important piece of legislation, we \nshould be legislating on it from 9:30, 10 o'clock in the morning--\nwhatever time would be convenient to come in. This request I am making \nis certainly not an unusual request. We almost always, with rare \nexception, have cloture votes by consent because, as I have indicated, \nthe rules call for cloture votes taking place 1 hour after we come into \nsession.\n  Today, we set the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 1315--\nthat was by consent. We, with rare exception, do it by consent. It is \nnot as if we are here suddenly trying to invent the wheel.\n  Simply stated again, Mr. President, I am saying, at 6 o'clock \ntomorrow, we are going to have a vote on the Ledbetter reversal. \nPreceding that, we can have a very productive day and work on this \nveterans bill. Or we can follow the rules and be out of session all day \ntomorrow and come in at 5 o'clock and have an hour of debate prior to \nthe cloture vote. So it is established we are going to have a cloture \nvote at 6 o'clock. The question is, should we have a productive day? We \nwant to have a productive day. We want to legislate over here on this \nimportant issue.\n  I agree with my friend, the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, we have had a good debate today. I was extremely impressed \nwith Senator Inouye's statement. For someone who is a Medal of Honor \nwinner, I think it means a lot coming from him that we all have a \nmisconception of a lot of things that went on in World War II, not the \nleast of which is the Bataan Death March.\n  In all the movies and everything you see about the Bataan Death \nMarch, you see a bunch of White men being driven by the Japanese, many \nof them to their deaths. That death march had 15,000 Americans and \n60,000 Filipinos. That was very educational for me. We have had a \nnumber of good statements here today. So I would renew my consent \nrequest.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Continuing my reservation, Mr. President, as I understand \nthe leader, it is not the minority and it is certainly not me who is \nsuggesting that tomorrow be unproductive; it is the majority leader's \ndesire to change the Senate rules and to move a vote on cloture on the \nLedbetter issue from 1 hour after we come into session to 6 o'clock \ntomorrow night to accommodate people who are not in Washington, \nsupposedly when the Senate is in session.\n  I think the Senator makes some great observations about the debate \ntoday. I agree with him about the heroism of Senator Inouye and others, \nSenator Stevens, who performed bravely in the Pacific in World War II, \nand the debate we have had today. If we have learned anything, it is \nthat we have brave Senators, but we also have the history to look at as \nto whether this benefit was intended for these individuals. That is why \nthe debate was so important that Senator Reid and I discussed earlier \nyesterday and we continue now. But with the insistence that we change \nthe Senate rules and delay the vote on Ledbetter, I would have to be \nopposed to the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the comments of my \nfriend from North Carolina. The record is very clear. This is a \ncontinuation of my friends on the Republican side wanting to accomplish \nnothing rather than something. I understand that. I accept that. I have \ngotten used to it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Earth Day has been celebrated on April 22 \nevery year since 1970. Much has changed since then. Americans have \ngrown increasingly aware of importance of environmental stewardship for \nthe wellbeing of our country. New challenges have emerged, though, that \nwe didn't recognize in 1970. New sources of pollution threaten our air \nand water. In recent weeks, for instance, we have been reminded that \nthere are chemicals and pharmaceuticals entering our waters whose \neffects on the environment are largely unknown.\n  Perhaps our most important challenge perhaps the greatest problem \nmankind has ever faced--is global warming. Disruptive climate change \nthreatens our ecosystems, our national security, and our economy. \nLandmark laws such as the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act have \ndone much to protect America. Now, though, our generation is being \nasked to step up to save our planet as a whole.\n  The science is unequivocal: global warming is real and manmade \ngreenhouse gases are the root cause. The scientific debate is over, and \nthe time for action is at hand.\n  Congress is taking this responsibility seriously. Several bills have \nbeen introduced in the 110th Congress that would attempt to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Among them is America's Climate Security Act, \nthe bill crafted by Senators Lieberman and Warner.\n  The Lieberman-Warner bill has the potential to reduce America's total \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 and 66 percent by 2050 \ncompared to 2005 levels. These cuts would restore U.S. leadership in \ninternational climate change negotiations and help avoid the worst \nconsequences of global warming.\n  There is no doubt. We need to start cutting greenhouse gases now. \nWhat have we heard from the White House on this? Last week, President \nBush said America's goal should be to start to reduce the rate of \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2025. Representative Edward Markey, \nchairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and \nGlobal Warming, described the plan this way. The President's short-term \nplan for global warming is: Do nothing. His intermediate plan is: Do \nnothing much. And his long-term plan is: Do nothing close to what is \nrequired to avoid global catastrophe.\n  The White House plan is not nearly good enough. As global warming \nprogresses we can expect more coastal\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nflooding, more inland droughts and wildfires, more severe storms, more \nglobal water and food crises, and more stress on species and habitats \nthat are already at risk for survival. A White House policy of \n``business as usual''--of continuing to allow greenhouse gas emissions \nat an unchecked, accelerating pace--will sentence America to an \nincreasing number of catastrophes--catastrophes that will be costly in \nterms of dollars and of human life and health.\n  We in Congress have another choice--the choice to honestly debate a \nrational plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enacting laws \nthat protect our planet and America's future.\n  The founders of Earth Day created a legacy that lives with us today. \nAmericans recognize that our well-being is founded on a clean and \nhealthy environment. We have seen much improvement in the environmental \nstewardship shown by our nation's citizens and industry. Congress can \nbe proud of the role it has played, too. Today, on this Earth Day, \nAmerica is faced with a new set of environmental challenges. I look \nforward to working with my Senate colleagues as we do what Congresses \nbefore us have done: set aside our personal and partisan differences to \ndo what is right for our country.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Earth Day. \nThirty-eight years ago, 20 million people from across our country \ncelebrated Earth Day for the first time. This has since become an \nimportant annual tradition, not only in America, but across the globe. \nWhat started as a day to voice concerns over smog, litter and dirty \nrivers is now a global movement to clean our air, land, and water for \nfuture generations.\n  I am pleased that we have found many commonsense solutions to \ndifficult environmental problems since the first Earth Day in 1970. For \nexample, in 1978 we banned chlorofluorocarbons in aerosol cans because \nof their devastating affect on the ozone layer. In 1990 we passed the \nClean Air Act Amendments to stop acid rain. And in 2003 we passed the \nClear Skies legislation to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide \nthat pollute our air. Although all of these accomplishments make sense \nto us today, it wasn't always easy to convince leaders and even the \npublic that these actions were essential to protect our environment.\n  Some folks had concerns about the actual effects of the legislation, \nwhile others had concerns about the economic costs. Their concerns are \nnot unlike the concerns of some in the current debate about global \nclimate change. A number of my colleagues and I support a cap and trade \nsystem. But no matter how we deal with climate change we know that this \nwill be a complex and vigorous debate. The discussions about the impact \nand costs are legitimate debates to be had. But I firmly believe that \ninaction is not an answer to this growing crisis.\n  On this Earth Day, which is celebrated by our Federal, State, and \nlocal governments; grassroots organizations; citizens of North \nCarolina, the United States, and the rest of the world, we set out a \nvision of how things can be. We can be energy independent and secure, \nwe can de-carbonize our electric generation, and we can wean ourselves \noff foreign oil. We can leave the cause of this day--the Earth--cleaner \nand more vibrant. It will not be easy, but we as a nation can and must \nlead the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3250-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On the night of March 7, 2008, Lance Neve was with his boyfriend at a \nbar in Spencerport, NY. Neve told police that a man at the bar had been \nyelling anti-gay slurs at him and his boyfriend and continued to harass \nthem using derogatory comments throughout the night. The aggressor then \nallegedly asked to shake Neve's hand, explaining that he had never \nshaken hands with a gay man. When Neve refused, he says the man \nattacked him and continued to beat him after he had fallen to the \nground, knocking him unconscious. Neve was hospitalized with a \nfractured skull, nose, left eye socket, and jaw as a result of the \nattack. Police have arrested 24-year-old Jesse D. Parsons of \nSpencerport, NY, and charged him with second-degree assault designated \nas a hate crime in connection with the attack.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3250-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3250-S3251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Major Mark E. Rosenberg\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Major \nMark E. Rosenberg--a father, a husband, and a soldier. Major Rosenberg \nwas on his second tour in Iraq when a bomb exploded near the Humvee \nthat was carrying him through the streets of Baghdad. The explosion \ntore through his vehicle, killing him. He was 32 years old.\n  Major Rosenberg was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 29th Field \nArtillery Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, out \nof Fort Carson. The 3rd Brigade Combat team has lost 32 soldiers in \nIraq, nine since deploying in November. Major Rosenberg was the 236th \nFort Carson soldier killed in Iraq.\n  Words cannot begin to measure the magnitude of Major Rosenberg's \nsacrifice, or the void left by his loss. Those who knew Mark remember \nhim as a dedicated and dutiful soldier full of jokes and smiles. ``He \nwas the life of the party,'' his sister recalls. ``Everybody wants to \nbe around him.'' By all accounts, he was an extraordinary husband to \nhis wife, Julie, and father to his two young sons, Joshua and Maxwell. \nMajor Rosenberg was planning to come home on leave in June to celebrate \nMaxwell's second birthday.\n  Mark entered the Army in the footsteps of his father, Burton \nRosenberg. He graduated from the New Mexico Military Institute in 1996 \nand received his commission shortly thereafter. He spent a year in \nKorea in 2001-2002 and a year in Iraq in 2004-2005. For his honorable \nservice, he earned the Army Commendation Medal, the National Defense \nService Medal, the Global War on Terror Service Medal, and the \nHumanitarian Service Ribbon.\n  Mark's second deployment, which began last November, was scheduled \nfor 15 months. His unit was tasked with training the Iraqi military, a \njob in which Major Rosenberg was committed to making a difference. He \ncarried the spirit of a peacemaker and understood the humanitarian \nmission that a soldier could fulfill.\n  Major Rosenberg was the type of `great man' who the activist and \nhumanitarian Jane Addams described in a 1903 address to the Union \nLeague Club in Chicago. In the remarks she offered in honor of George \nWashington's birthday, Addams argued that ``when we come to the study \nof great men it is easy to think only of their great deeds, and not to \nthink enough of their spirit. What is a great man who has made his mark \nupon history? Every time, if we think far enough, he is a man who has \nlooked through the confusion of the moment and has seen the moral issue \ninvolved; he is a man who has refused to have his sense of justice \ndistorted; he has listened to his conscience until conscience becomes a \ntrumpet call to like-minded men, so that they gather about him and \ntogether, with mutual purpose and mutual aid, they make a new period in \nhistory.''\n  Major Rosenberg, as Jane Addams describes, was able to see through \nthe ``confusion of the moment'' and understand the moral dimensions of \nhis work. He was able to inspire and lead his soldiers, and the Iraqis \nwhom he was training, with his vision and his heart. He worked in one \nof the most\n\n[[Page S3251]]\n\ndangerous places in the world, yet was able to lift those around him \nwith his spirit and his optimism. Hope is at a premium in Iraq, and he \nwill be sorely missed.\n  It is at home, of course, that Major Rosenberg's absence is most \nstrongly felt. To Julie, Joshua, and Maxwell, to his mother Sheila, to \nhis sister Lori, and to all his family and friends, our thoughts are \nwith you. I know of no words that can assuage the grief and pain you \nfeel. I pray that you will find some consolation in knowing that Mark \nwill never be forgotten and that his country will always honor his \nsacrifice. He was among the noblest of our citizens--a great man \ncommitted to justice, humanity, and duty. May his legacy lift us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3251-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     RETIREMENT OF DWIGHT WHITTAKER\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I am proud to honor an Idahoan \nwho has devoted his adult life to helping the disabled, and the past 37 \nyears, doing this by leading the Development Workshop Incorporated, \nDWI, the largest community rehabilitation program in Idaho. DWI \nprovides work and life skills and job training to those with \ndisabilities, and helps them move into gainful employment. When Dwight \nfounded DWI in 1971, it served 12 individuals; now, it's grown to a \ncompany that serves 700 to 800 people with locations in five eastern \nIdaho counties.\n  Dwight's steady leadership, renowned courtesy and high integrity led \nDWI to success and earned him the Milton ``Milt'' Cohen Leadership \nAward from the National Industries for the Severely Handicapped in \n2006. Dwight led efforts over the years to preserve funding and promote \nlegislation at both the State and national level for individuals with \ndisabilities. In his position, he has consistently sought out \ncommonsense solutions to service and funding challenges and has surely \nbeen most rewarded by seeing DWI grow into an organization of such \nesteem and reputation.\n  The face of community rehabilitation in southeast Idaho has undergone \na significant transformation over the past four decades, and the \ncitizens of Idaho Falls and the surrounding areas have Dwight to thank. \nI wish him well in his retirement and am certain that he will bring the \nsame gifts of leadership, comity and energy to whatever path he chooses \nto walk next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3251-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF KALAMAZOO COLLEGE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure, along with that \nof my colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, to recognize the 175th \nanniversary of Kalamazoo College. Kalamazoo College enjoys the \ndistinction of being Michigan's oldest college and one of our Nation's \n100 oldest colleges. This occasion will be marked by a series of \ncelebrations this spring, beginning with the Founder's Convocation on \nApril 24, 2008. It is with pride that Senator Stabenow and I bring this \nmilestone to the attention of the Senate.\n  Since its inception in 1883, Kalamazoo College has made immeasurable \ncontributions to the academic, economic, and cultural life of the \nGreater Kalamazoo area, the State of Michigan, and the world community. \nFounded by Baptists as the Michigan and Huron Institute, this \ninstitution was formally named Kalamazoo College in 1855.\n  Devoted to the study of liberal arts and sciences and with an \nenduring mission ``to prepare its graduates to better understand, live \nsuccessfully within and provide enlightened leadership to a richly \ndiverse and increasingly complex world,'' Kalamazoo College has earned \na national reputation as a respected, private, 4-year coeducational \ncollege. Central to this mission is the Kalamazoo Plan, a program \nestablished in 1962 that integrates career development internships and \nstudy abroad experiences with a rigorous academic curriculum and an \nindividualized senior project. The Kalamazoo Plan was initiated under \npresident Weimer Hicks and seeks to create an academic community where \nstudents are engaged in leadership and connected to their global \nsurroundings.\n  This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the college's study \nabroad program. Kalamazoo College offers over 50 study abroad programs \non 6 continents, and more than 80 percent of its students participate \nin these programs, which is among the highest of any college in the \nNation. In addition, Kalamazoo College ranks among the top 10 in the \nnumber of alumni participating in the Peace Corps. Guided by the \nconcept of ``fellowship in learning,'' Kalamazoo College has continued \nto strive to meet the challenges presented by an ever changing and \nincreasingly interdependent world.\n  Notably, Kalamazoo College ranks among the top 20 liberal arts \ncolleges in the country for students receiving Fulbright awards and \n19th nationally in the percentage of graduates who earn doctoral \ndegrees. In addition, the college received the State of Michigan \nGovernor's Service Award in 2006, with the Kalamazoo Public Schools, \nfor the AMIGOS Program, a bilingual program for mentoring middle school \nstudents.\n  Kalamazoo College is an NCAA Division III school and offers eight \nintercollegiate sports for both men and women. An especially impressive \nathletic accomplishment is the tennis team's record of 69 successive \nMIAA championships, from 1936 to 2007, the longest streak by any \nathletic team at any level at any time. Kalamazoo College is also proud \nto have hosted the USTA Boys 18 & 16 national tennis championships \nsince 1943.\n  We know our Senate colleagues will join us in congratulating the past \nand current faculty, staff, and students of Kalamazoo College as they \ncelebrate the school's 175th anniversary. We wish them continued \nsuccess in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3251-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PHIL BLADINE\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President. ``To live fully,'' wrote Oliver \nWendell Holmes, ``is to be engaged in the passions of one's time.'' I \nrise today to pay tribute to Phil Bladine, a remarkable Oregonian, who \npassed away last week at the age of 89. There can be no doubt that Phil \nBladine lived a very full life, as he devoted much of it to making a \npositive difference in the issues of his time.\n  A native of Iowa, Phil first arrived in McMinnville, OR, as a 14-\nyear-old, when his father purchased a community newspaper. After \ngraduating from high school and college, Phil did as did so many others \nof the ``Greatest Generation''--he wore the uniform of our country. \nPhil joined the Navy in 1940, and eventually would become an Executive \nOfficer of an LST, a 228-foot ship that carried U.S. Marines and \nlanding crafts in the Pacific Theater.\n  After the war, Phil would return to McMinnville, where he would spend \nmuch of the next half century at the helm of the McMinnville News-\nRegister. Under his commonsense leadership, the News-Register became a \npositive and respected force for progress in Yamhill County and all of \nOregon.\n  Phil was a natural leader who lent his time and talent to countless \norganizations and worthy causes, including the Oregon Newspaper \nPublishers Association, the Republican Party, St. Barnabas Episcopal \nChurch, the McMinnville Chamber of Commerce, Associated Oregon \nIndustries, and the Oregon Economic Development Commission. I am just \none of many elected officials who, over the years, counted on Phil for \nadvise and counsel. I always knew that instead of telling me what I \nwanted to hear, he would tell me what I needed to hear.\n  Mr. President, I extend my condolences to Phil's wife Margaret \n``Meg'' Bladine; his daughter Pam; his son Jeb; and all the members of \nthe Bladine family. May they find solace in the words of the Greek \npoet, Sophocles, who wrote, ``One must wait until the evening to see \nhow splendid the day has been.'' I am confident that in the evening of \nhis time on earth, Phil Bladine could look back at a life filled with \nfamily and friends, a life filled with making a difference for his \ncountry, his state, and his community, and he could say, ``The day has \nindeed been splendid.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3251-4", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3251-S3252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               ENROLLED BILL AND JOINT RESOLUTION SIGNED\n\n  At 12:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S3252]]\n\nMs. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill and joint resolution:\n\n       H.R. 1119.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     pass the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008; to the Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affair.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 306\n\n       Whereas, the cascading impact of houses that are lost to \n     foreclosure for failure to pay the mortgage is becoming \n     increasingly evident in many locations. The impact of the \n     foreclosures over the past year is so great that it is \n     estimated by some that as many as one homeowner in ten now \n     owes more on their house's mortgage than the house is worth. \n     All homes, even those without a mortgage, lose value quickly \n     as houses stand empty. For many neighborhoods, the prospect \n     of vacancy is accompanied by justifiable concerns over \n     safety; and\n       Whereas, Congress is considering the Foreclosure Prevention \n     Act of 2008 as a means of bringing a swift response to \n     reverse the destructive trend of people walking away from \n     homes because of loans they cannot possibly pay. This \n     legislation offers a range of provisions, including \n     allocations for foreclosure prevention counseling, expanding \n     the capacity of governmental entities to redevelop \n     properties, allowing housing finance agencies to help home \n     buyers and issue refinancing bonds for owners with subprime \n     loans, and empowering bankruptcy judges to change the terms \n     of loans facing foreclosure. The bankruptcy adjustment \n     provision would be consistent with the power bankruptcy \n     judges already have for other kinds of debts, including those \n     for vacation homes and rental properties; and\n       Whereas, clearly, the severity of the mortgage foreclosure \n     crisis demands vigorous and swift action. Less comprehensive \n     approaches and voluntary programs alone are not enough: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States pass and the \n     President to sign the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation. Adopted by the House \n     of Representatives, March 20, 2008.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-311. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Kentucky urging Congress to \n     act swiftly to renew the exemption of the Delta Queen from \n     the Safety of Life at Sea Act of 1966; to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 109\n\n       A Resolution urging the United States Congress to act \n     swiftly to renew the exemption of the Delta Queen from the \n     Safety of Life at Sea Act of 1966.\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen is an integral part of the culture \n     and character of the Ohio River valley; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen has made a lasting impression as a \n     beloved part of the past in the hearts of passengers and crew \n     members; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen is a part of the National Register \n     of Historic Places, a National Historic Landmark, and a jewel \n     of the United States's inland navigable water system; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen is the last of its kind, a \n     sternwheel overnight passenger\n\n[[Page S3253]]\n\n     steamboat like those that contributed to this nation's \n     westward expansion; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen has been and continues to be a \n     safe and reliable vessel; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen was constructed in 1926 to operate \n     as a passenger vessel in northern California, during World \n     War II was used in the United States Navy as a ferry for \n     wounded being treated in San Francisco; and\n       Whereas, after being purchased in 1946 by Greene Line \n     Steamers of Cincinnati, Ohio, the Delta Queen was carried \n     from California, to and along the Mississippi and Ohio \n     Rivers, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for refurbishment in \n     order to carry passengers on the nation's inland navigable \n     water system; and\n       Whereas, the Safety of Life at Sea Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-\n     777) mandates that all passenger vessels having berth or \n     stateroom accommodations for 50 or more passengers obey \n     safety requirements, particularly fire safety requirements; \n     and\n       Whereas, after this act was passed, the wooden construct of \n     the Delta Queen was treated with fire resistant materials and \n     a modern sprinkler system, thereby making this vessel \n     considerably more fire resistant; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen has historically been exempted \n     from the Safety of Life at Sea Act; and\n       Whereas, the Delta Queen's safety records do not indicate \n     that she is any less safe today then at any point since the \n     passage of the act in 1966; and\n       Whereas, the current exemption for the Delta Queen is to \n     expire in 2008, and the United States Congress has not acted \n     to grant another exemption for the Delta Queen to allow her \n     to continue operating: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1. The House of Representatives of the Commonwealth \n     of Kentucky hereby urges the United States Congress to act \n     swiftly to continue the exemption of the Delta Queen from the \n     Safety of Life at Sea Act of 1966.\n       Section 2. The Clerk of the House of Representatives shall \n     forward a copy of this Resolution to the Clerk of the United \n     States Senate, the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and all of the members of Kentucky's \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-312. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to review and consider \n     eliminating provisions of federal law which reduce Social \n     Security benefits for those receiving the benefits from \n     government retirement or pension plans; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 3\n\n       To memorialize the Congress of the United States to review \n     and consider eliminating provisions of federal law which \n     reduce Social Security benefits for those receiving pension \n     benefits from federal, state, or local government retirement \n     or pension systems, plans, or funds.\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal and \n     survivor Social Security benefit, and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned Social \n     Security benefit for any person who also receives a federal, \n     state, or local retirement or pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, the intent of Congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, or local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same Social Security benefit as a person who \n     had worked only in employment covered by Social Security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of Congress in enacting these \n     reduction provisions was to provide a disincentive for public \n     employees to receive two pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security; and\n       Whereas, because of these calculation characteristics, the \n     GPO and the WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on \n     employees working in lower-wage government jobs, like \n     policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, because the Social Security benefit statements do \n     not calculate the GPO and the WEP, many public employees in \n     Louisiana are unaware that their expected Social Security \n     benefits shown on such statements will be significantly lower \n     or nonexistent due to the service in public employment \n     through which they are required to be members of a Louisiana \n     public retirement or pension system, plan, or fund; and\n       Whereas, these provisions also have a greater adverse \n     effect on women than on men because of the gender differences \n     in salary that continue to plague our nation and the longer \n     life expectancy of women; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of her citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     GPO and the WEP Social Security benefit reductions and to \n     consider eliminating or reducing them; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-313.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Kansas urging Congress to amend the No Child Left Behind Act; \n     to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 1831\n\n       A RESOLUTION urging the Congress of the United States to \n     amend the No Child Left Behind Act so that states will be \n     allowed to continue to work toward the goal of closing the \n     achievement gap without overly prescriptive federal rules, \n     unfunded mandates and the coercion of losing federal funds.\n       Whereas, The purpose of the No Child Left Behind Act \n     (NCLB), which was enacted on a bipartisan basis and scheduled \n     to be reauthorized in 2008, is to increase the academic \n     achievement of all students in language arts, mathematics and \n     science, and to close achievement gaps among various \n     subgroups of students; and\n       Whereas, The NCLB sets expectations for all students to be \n     100% proficient by school\n\n[[Page S3254]]\n\n     year 2013-2014; however, the specific requirements are \n     unreasonable for students with limited English proficiency \n     and students with disabilities, making it impossible for all \n     schools to comply with the law; and\n       Whereas, The NCLB requires highly qualified teachers in \n     core academic areas, which conflicts with the process for \n     certifying special education teachers and overlooks the fact \n     that many categories of teachers, including special education \n     teachers and middle school teachers in small rural schools, \n     often teach several subjects; and\n       Whereas, The NCLB coerces participation by placing punitive \n     financial consequences on states refusing to participate; and\n       Whereas, The NCLB is an under-funded mandate, with actual \n     funding falling over $70 billion short of the authorized \n     levels, placing the burden on states and school districts to \n     spend their own limited resources to implement the NCLB; and\n       Whereas, States should be allowed to use multiple measures \n     of student achievement and school effectiveness in their \n     state accountability plan, and to use a student-growth \n     approach in their state accountability plan; and\n       Whereas, States should have the flexibility to allow school \n     districts to design appropriate instructional interventions \n     and incorporate differentiated interventions for any school \n     not making adequate yearly progress so that a school that \n     falls short in only a small number of federal criteria is not \n     treated in the same manner as a school that falls short on \n     all such measures, and to allow a district not making \n     adequate yearly progress to be the supplemental educational \n     services provider; and\n       Whereas, States should be given sufficient time for \n     improvement plans to take effect before applying sanctions, \n     and sanctions should not be applied if they undermine \n     existing effective reform efforts, or states should be \n     permitted to replace sanctions that do not have a consistent \n     record of success with interventions that enable schools to \n     make changes that result in improved student achievement; and\n       Whereas, States and school districts should have the \n     flexibility to determine the appropriate standards upon which \n     to base assessments for students with disabilities and to \n     utilize the results from assessments based on such standards \n     in calculating adequate yearly progress without arbitrary \n     federal limitation on the use of such assessments; and\n       Whereas, States and school districts should have the \n     flexibility to exclude assessment results of newly arrived \n     limited-English proficient students in adequate yearly \n     progress calculations for an appropriate number of years to \n     ensure that such tests are measuring students' academic \n     content knowledge and not just their English-proficiency \n     levels; and\n       Whereas, Funding for supplemental educational services and \n     school choice transportation should be funded by the federal \n     government, and not come from diverting up to 20% of school \n     districts Title I funds for such purposes: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of Kansas: That we \n     memorialize the President and the United States Congress to \n     make a serious commitment to improving the quality of the \n     nation's public schools by substantially increasing funding \n     for the preauthorized version of the No Child Left Behind \n     Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge the Congress of the United States to \n     amend the No Child Left Behind Act so that states will be \n     allowed to continue working toward the goal of closing the \n     achievement gap without overly prescriptive federal rules, \n     under-funded mandates and the coercion of losing federal \n     funds; and be it further\n       Resolved: That the Secretary of the Senate provide an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and to \n     each member of the Kansas Congressional Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3254-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LIEBERMAN, from the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs, without amendment:\n       S. 1046.

A bill to provide for the release of certain land from the \nSunrise Mountain Instant Study Area in the State of Nevada; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Orchard \nDetention Basin Flood Control Act for myself and Senator Ensign. This \nAct will release approximately 65 acres of land managed by the Bureau \nof Land Management in Clark County, NV, from the Sunrise Mountain \nInstant Study Area. The release will allow for the construction of an \nimportant flood control project.\n  The Orchard Detention Basin project is part of the Clark County \nRegional Flood Control District's Master Plan to protect the Las Vegas \nValley. This comprehensive floodplain management program is designed to \nprotect private and public lands from flood damage and to save lives in \nthis rapidly growing metropolitan area. When completed, the Orchard \nDetention Basin project will protect approximately 1,200 acres of urban \ndevelopment from flooding, including 2,500 homes and three schools. The \nproject will also reduce the magnitude of flooding further downstream.\n  The boundary change executed by this legislation is needed because a \nportion of the detention basin project lies within the boundaries of \nthe Sunrise Mountain Instant Study Area. An ``instant study area'' \ndesignation places development restrictions on public lands similar to \nthose on wilderness study areas. This designation currently prevents \nthe construction of this important flood control project, leaving the \nland and residents living downstream vulnerable to flood damage.\n  Even though the Las Vegas Valley is a desert, flash flooding is an \nall too common problem affecting the people in Las Vegas. In just the \nlast decade, Las Vegas Valley has been hit with five 100-year storm \nevents. A severe thunderstorm in 1999 dropped over 3 inches of rain in \n1\\1/2\\ hours, resulting in a disaster declaration. Along with property \ndamage and deaths related to flooding, Clark County residents \nexperience inconvenience resulting from impassable roads during \nflooding events. Support services such as police, fire and ambulance \ncan also be delayed, creating life-threatening incidents.\n  The House of Representatives has already taken up and passed this \nlegislation during the current Congress. The version that I am \nintroducing today reflects the amendments that were adopted in the \nHouse. I look forward to working with the Energy Committee and my other \ndistinguished friends to move this bill in a timely manner during the \ncurrent session.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2898\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (J) the management assistance programs delivered by \n     resource partners on behalf of the Small Business \n     Administration, such as small business development centers, \n     women's business centers, and the Service Corps of Retired \n     Executives, are provided with the Federal resources necessary \n     to do their jobs; and\n       (6) urges that the Administrator of the Small Business \n     Administration have an active role as a member of the \n     President's Cabinet.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I am pleased to take this opportunity during National \nSmall Business Week to introduce a bipartisan Senate resolution \nhonoring the entrepreneurial spirit of small business owners and urging \nthe federal government to continue to improve upon its efforts to \nprovide the guidance and assistance that has proven so valuable to \nsmall businesses across the nation. As Chairman of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am privileged to have as my \nRanking Member Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine, and other Committee \nmembers who provide a voice for small business concerns and who \nadvocate for the efficient and effective implementation of small \nbusiness programs.\n  Almost 27 million small businesses power this Nation's economy, \nrepresenting 99.7 percent of all businesses, creating more than \\2/3\\ \nof all new jobs, and producing more than a quarter of our exports. \nAdditionally, America's entrepreneurs are the minds responsible for \ninnovations and advancing technologies that make this country resilient \nand competitive in the global economy and keep us on the cutting edge \nof technology.\n  The marketplace can be a daunting arena for entrepreneurs to wade \ninto, and, though they rise to the challenge with great ideas, \ninventive products, and thorough business plans, there remains a great \ndeal of financial risk and uncertainty in running a small business. The \nsupport, guidance, and financial assistance offered by Small Business \nAdministration programs have been of incredible importance to small \nbusinesses working to succeed.\n  Mr. Robert Delhome from Wilmington, Massachusetts, is being honored \nby the Small Business Administration as the Massachusetts 2008 Small \nBusiness Person of the Year for his work as President of Charter \nEnvironmental, Inc. This civil and environmental contracting firm is \nnot only at the forefront of the emerging green collar industry, but is \nalso an example of a tremendously successful business that was able to \ntake advantage of the SBA's 8(a) Business Development Program and \ntransform $300 in seed capital into a $30 million a year business. What \nbegan with two determined employees and a good idea has become a \nbusiness of over 100 employees providing vital services and solutions \nto confront challenging environmental problems. The 8(a) program offers \nassistance to socially and economically disadvantaged small business \nowners competing for Federal contracts, and Robert is but one of many \nentrepreneurs to have benefitted from this program.\n  As we celebrate Earth Day today and discuss the necessity of acting \nquickly to find workable solutions to our environmental problems, \nRobert's business is both an inspiration and an indication of the \neconomic and environmental success this industry promises. As we \nconsider the gravity of our environmental challenges, I will continue \nto promote the essential role that small businesses must play in the \nprocess of turning America green, moving us away from our dependence on \nforeign oil, and creating the innovative industry that will help \nstrengthen our economy. Already our Nation's entrepreneurs are leading \nthe way to economically smart and environmentally sound business \npractices, and we need to ensure that the tools to become energy \nefficient are accessible to every\n\n[[Page S3261]]\n\nsmall business in the country. Our rapidly rising energy costs only \nserve to underscore the urgency with which we must address these \nenvironmental challenges.\n  I also continue to be concerned about the lack of small business \ninclusion in Federal contracts. In an effort to level the playing \nfield, Congress set forth specific procurement goals in law, including \ngoals for women, veteran, and minority owned businesses, but the Bush \nadministration has proven unwilling to work quickly to meet these \ngoals. The Women's Procurement Program is a troublesome example of a \nlarger trend. In 2000, this program was created to ensure the Federal \nGovernment sets aside at least 5 percent of all procurement \nopportunities for women-owned businesses. More than 7 years later, only \n3.4 percent of Federal contracts are reaching those businesses.\n  Janet Ceddia, president of a security and fencing company in Hudson, \nMassachusetts, is just the type of business owner who would benefit if \nthe Federal Government improved its efforts at reaching out to all \ntypes of small businesses.\n  A small, disadvantaged, 8(a) certified, woman-owned company, Security \nConstruction Services, Inc. in Hudson, Massachusetts, has grown \nenormously in recent years, doubling its workforce and expanding its \nservices as the company has received $15 million in government \ncontracts. Today, Janet's business has completed contracts for the Air \nForce, Army Reserve, Coast Guard, and Veterans Administration, among \nother agencies, and Janet was honored as the 2008 Region I Prime \nContractor of the Year for her success. As Janet has proven, when given \nthe chance, small businesses prove to be excellent partners in Federal \nprojects.\n  I would also like to highlight the work of Maria Gooch-Smith, who is \nbeing honored for her work as the Executive Director of the South \nEastern Economic Development, SEED, Corporation in Taunton, \nMassachusetts. Over the last eight years, SEED has made an average of \n150 loans each year, and has operated as the largest SBA 504 and Micro \nLender in Massachusetts. Last year alone, SEED granted or leveraged \nover $105 million, which directly contributed to the creation of 637 \nnew jobs, and, in doing so, demonstrated the vast capability of SBA 504 \nCertified Development Companies. It is imperative that these small \nbusiness loan programs receive the necessary resources for them to \nmaintain quality, effective programs and services to support small \nbusinesses and our local communities in a positive way.\n  I am proud of all of the hardworking Americans who face the \nchallenges of opening and running a small business, and I encourage us \nall to take this week of special recognition to reflect on the \npossibilities for further improving the operating climate for small \nbusiness owners and to reaffirm our resolve to fight for the necessary \nresources to assist small businesses. I applaud the dedication, \ninnovation, and achievements of America's entrepreneurs, and I pledge \nto continue to advocate on their behalf.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as we celebrate National Small Business \nWeek, which runs April 21 through April 25, 2008, I rise in support of \na Senate Resolution--which I introduced along with Chairman Kerry, and \nother members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship--that honors the entrepreneurial spirit of our \nNation's nearly 27 million small businesses and the tremendous \ncontributions they make to our economy.\n  Small businesses are the driving force behind our nation's economic \ngrowth and job creation. Representing 99 percent of all employers, \nsmall businesses create nearly \\3/5\\ of all net new jobs and generate \nmore than 50 percent of the Nation's nonfarm gross domestic product. \nThey are the foundation, the engine, the core of our economy. Clearly, \nthe greatest source of jobs in this country are the small businesses \nthat are constantly responding to new challenges with innovations and \ncreativity.\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have made it one of my top priorities to be an \nadvocate for small businesses, and to help raise the needs and concerns \nof our countries' job creators. With more than 600,000 small businesses \nhaving opened in 2006, this is clearly a sector that deserves our \naccolades, recognition, and support.\n  Indeed, hope embodies the spirit of the 26.8 million small business \nowners. They are willing to take risks that others don't, they \ntransform their ideas and dreams into realities, their hobbies become \ntheir professions, and their entrepreneurial spirit can be seen in the \nproducts and services that make up America. Frankly, this week as we \ncelebrate our Nation's entrepreneurs, we will undoubtedly fall short of \nfully recognizing what our country's small businesses truly add to our \neconomy.\n\n  Given the sluggish state of our economy, it is all the more \nimperative that we fully equip our small businesses, our true job \ngenerators, and provide them with the tools--not just to mitigate and \nstem this crisis--but to be a catalyst for helping to address and \nultimately solve it. We must take advantage of the opportunities to \nhelp our small businesses thrive. We in Congress should reduce their \ntax burdens, ensure they receive the business counseling they deserve, \nand that they have affordable and reliable health insurance options for \ntheir employees.\n  One of our most valuable assets for ensuring the success of small \nbusinesses is the Small Business Administration, SBA. The SBA is \npivotal in overseeing the delivery of financial and business \ndevelopment tools for millions of aspiring entrepreneurs and existing \nsmall businesses across the United States. With the SBA being the only \nFederal agency with the mandate to foster small business growth, we \nmust work to provide the agency with the resources needed to help our \nnation's entrepreneurs right this economy.\n  So as we celebrate our Nation's small businesses, we must be mindful \nof Congress's responsibility to ensure that each business has the \nopportunity to flourish. When accounting for inflation the SBA has seen \nits core lending and business development program budget cut by 28 \npercent since 2001, and this trend must simply be reversed. While the \nSBA touts its ``doing more with less,'' the agency's resources, \nprograms, and employees are stretched too thin, which in the end \nnegatively impacts our Nation's small business and the economy as a \nwhole. As we look ahead, rest assured, I will not hesitate to take \naction and ensure that this vital sector continues to have the valuable \nresources it deserves.\n  The SBA has been, and will continue to be, a critical partner to \nmillions of small enterprises as well as aspiring entrepreneurs as they \nembark on the path to prosperity and job creation. The least we can do \nis strengthen, not erode, the SBA's core loan and technical assistance \nprograms that have proven time and again to be the keystone in aiding \nthe efforts and dreams of America's entrepreneurs.\n  Today we celebrate our Nation's entrepreneurs and honor America's \nsmall businesses. I urge my colleagues to show their support for the \nsmall businesses in their states and support this resolution. We must \nremember that this country's future will be determined by today's small \nbusinesses, and the faster we can help them create more jobs, the \nquicker the economy will rebound, and the stronger its foundation will \nbe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3261-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3261-S3262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 525--RECOGNIZING THE PROGRESS MADE BY STATES PARTIES \nTO THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION ON THE OCCASION OF THE SECOND REVIEW \n                               CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Lugar) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 525\n\n       Whereas, on April 24, 1997, the Senate gave its advice and \n     consent to the ratification of the Convention on the \n     Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and \n     Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, with \n     Annexes, done at Paris January 13, 1993 (commonly known as \n     the ``Chemical Weapons Convention'' and the ``CWC'') (T. Doc. \n     103-21);\n       Whereas, the Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force \n     on April 29, 1997;\n       Whereas, since the Chemical Weapons Convention entered into \n     force, more than 27,000 metric tons of chemical weapons have \n     been destroyed, representing over 35 percent of the declared \n     chemical weapon stockpiles worldwide;\n       Whereas 11 chemical weapons destruction facilities are \n     currently in operation in 5 countries;\n\n[[Page S3262]]\n\n       Whereas none of the 65 chemical weapons production \n     facilities declared by 12 States Parties are producing \n     chemical weapons, and all but 4 of the facilities have been \n     either verifiably destroyed or converted for peaceful \n     purposes in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention;\n       Whereas, on July 11, 2007, Albania became the first State \n     Party to completely eliminate its entire stockpile of \n     chemical weapons, with assistance from the Nunn-Lugar \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction Program;\n       Whereas membership in the Organization for the Prohibition \n     of Chemical Weapons now stands at 183 states, encompassing 98 \n     percent of the world's population, up from 87 States Parties \n     when the Chemical Weapons Convention entered into force;\n       Whereas the First Special Session of the Conference of the \n     States Parties to Review the Operation of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention was opened on April 28, 2003, and 113 \n     States Parties participated in the First Review Conference; \n     and\n       Whereas the Second Review Conference of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention opened on April 7, 2008, in The Hague, \n     Netherlands: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its support for the purposes, operations, and \n     undertakings of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which have \n     served the interests of international peace and security and \n     the national security interests of the United States;\n       (2) notes the progress that has been made by States Parties \n     to the Chemical Weapons Convention toward the elimination of \n     stockpiles of deadly chemical weapons in possessor states, \n     and urges continued progress toward that goal;\n       (3) calls on all States Parties--\n       (A) to continue their compliance with their obligations \n     under the Chemical Weapons Convention to permit the \n     monitoring and verification of the inactivation, and later \n     destruction or conversion, of all chemical weapons production \n     facilities, as well as the destruction of chemical weapons \n     stockpiles;\n       (B) to submit and allow verification of the consistency of \n     industrial chemical declarations; and\n       (C) to allow the effective monitoring of the non-diversion \n     of chemicals for activities prohibited under the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention; and\n       (4) calls on all States Parties to adopt the necessary \n     laws, regulations, and enforcement practices to ban chemical \n     weapons activities, pursuant to Article VIII of the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention and United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1540 (2004), and to afford appropriate legal and \n     regulatory assistance to other countries so as to achieve \n     full implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 11 years ago this month, the Senate gave \nits advice and consent to U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, or CWC. Those of us who were here then remember all too \nwell how contentious and difficult a task that was.\n  Eleven years later, I have no doubt in my mind that the Senate did \nthe right thing. The CWC clearly serves the national security interests \nof the U.S. It continues to enhance international peace and security.\n  Since the CWC entered into force, 183 States have signed on to the \ntreaty's commitment to forgo poison gas forever, and have subjected \nthemselves to the treaty's verification procedures. States Parties to \nthe CWC have destroyed over 27,000 tons of chemical weapons--over a \nthird of the world's declared stockpiles--and 11 destruction facilities \naround the world are working to destroy even more. Sixty-five chemical \nweapons production facilities that, without a Chemical Weapons \nConvention, could have churned out still more poison gas are no longer \ncarrying out that horrible work, and all but 4 of those former weapons \nproduction facilities have been verifiably destroyed or converted to \npeaceful purposes. Most importantly, there has been no use of chemical \nweapons by any country in the last 11 years, and no international \nsupport for the use of such weapons by terrorist groups.\n  Under the able leadership of its Director-General, Ambassador Rogelio \nPfirter, the Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons runs a \ntight ship. It works with all States Parties to improve national \ndeclarations, to mount effective inspections, and to secure the \nadoption of effective national laws, regulations and procedures that \ncriminalize and guard against the production or stockpiling of chemical \nweapons.\n  The States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention are gathering \nover the next 2 weeks in The Netherlands for the Convention's Second \nReview Conference. Senator Lugar and I have introduced this resolution \nduring the Review Conference in order to reaffirm the Senate's \ncommitment to the goals of the CWC. We are proud of the progress that \nhas been made so far, and we call upon all States Parties to continue \nto meet their commitments under the CWC and to do all they can to \nfurther the noble aims of the Convention.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3262-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 526--DESIGNATING APRIL 20 THROUGH 26, 2008, AS \n ``NATIONAL COMMUNITY HEALTH AIDE, COMMUNITY HEALTH PRACTITIONER, AND \n                       DENTAL HEALTH AIDE WEEK''\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 522\n\n       Whereas on November 29, 1947, the United Nations General \n     Assembly voted to partition the British Mandate of Palestine \n     and create a Jewish state;\n       Whereas on May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed \n     the establishment of the sovereign and independent State of \n     Israel, and the United States Government established full \n     diplomatic relations with Israel;\n       Whereas the desire of the Jewish people to establish an \n     independent modern State of Israel is an outgrowth of the \n     existence of the historic kingdom of Israel established in \n     the Land of Israel 3,000 years ago, with the city of \n     Jerusalem as its capital;\n       Whereas for over 2,000 years, there has been continuous \n     Jewish presence and residence in the land comprising the \n     modern State of Israel;\n       Whereas the establishment of the modern State of Israel as \n     a homeland for the Jewish people followed the slaughter of \n     more than 6,000,000 European Jews during the Holocaust;\n       Whereas since its establishment 60 years ago, the modern \n     State of Israel has rebuilt a nation, forged a new and \n     dynamic democratic society, and created a thriving economic, \n     political, cultural, and intellectual life despite the heavy \n     costs of war, terrorism, and unjustified diplomatic and \n     economic boycotts against the people of Israel;\n       Whereas the people of Israel have established a vibrant, \n     pluralistic, democratic political system, including freedom \n     of speech, association, and religion; a vigorously free \n     press; free, fair and open elections; the rule of law; a \n     fully independent judiciary; and other democratic principles \n     and practices;\n       Whereas Israel has developed some of the leading \n     universities in the world, and 8 Israeli citizens have been \n     awarded the Nobel Prize;\n       Whereas Israel has developed an advanced, entrepreneurial \n     economy, is among the world's leaders in the high-tech \n     industry, and is at the forefront of research and development \n     in the field of renewable energy sources;\n       Whereas Israel regularly sends humanitarian aid, search-\n     and-rescue teams, mobile hospitals, and other emergency \n     supplies, to help victims of disasters around the world, \n     including the 1994 Rwandan civil war, the 1998 bombing of the \n     United States Embassy in Kenya, the 1999 earthquakes in \n     Turkey, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2005 hurricanes \n     along the southern coast of the United States, and the 2007 \n     fires in Greece;\n       Whereas Israel has absorbed millions of Jews from countries \n     throughout the world and fully integrated them into Israeli \n     society;\n       Whereas Israel has bravely defended itself from repeated \n     terrorist and military attacks since its independence;\n       Whereas successive leaders of Israel have sought to achieve \n     peace with Israel's Arab neighbors;\n       Whereas Israel has established peaceful bilateral relations \n     with neighboring Egypt and Jordan and has made its desire to \n     establish peaceful relations with all Arab states abundantly \n     clear;\n       Whereas for 6 decades, the United States and Israel have \n     maintained a special relationship based on mutually shared \n     democratic values, common strategic interests, and moral \n     bonds of friendship and mutual respect;\n       Whereas the American people feel a strong affinity for the \n     Israeli people based on common values and shared cultural \n     heritage; and\n       Whereas the United States continues to regard Israel as a \n     strong and trusted ally and an important strategic partner: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historic significance of the 60th \n     anniversary of the reestablishment of the sovereign and \n     independent State of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish \n     people;\n       (2) reaffirms the bonds of friendship and cooperation which \n     have existed between the United States and Israel for the \n     past 60 years, and commits to strengthening those bonds;\n       (3) commends the people of Israel for their remarkable \n     achievements in building a new state and a pluralistic, \n     democratic society in the face of terrorism, as well as \n     hostility, ostracism, and belligerence from many of their \n     neighbors;\n       (4) reaffirms its support for Israel's right to defend \n     itself against threats to its security and existence;\n       (5) reaffirms its enduring support for Israel as Israel \n     pursues peace with its neighbors;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to S. Res. 528.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 528) designating April 25, 2008, as \n     ``Global Youth Service Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of a resolution \ndesignating April 25, 2008, as ``Global Youth Service Day.'' This \nresolution recognizes and commends the significant community service \nefforts that youth are making in communities across the country and \naround the world on April 25 and every day. This resolution also \nencourages the citizens of the United States to acknowledge and support \nthese volunteer efforts.\n  Over the weekend beginning this Friday, April 25, youth from across \nthe United States and around the world will carry out community service \nprojects in areas ranging from hunger to literacy to the environment. \nThrough this service, many will embark on a lifelong path of service \nand civic engagement in more than 100 countries around the world.\n  This event is not isolated to one weekend a year. Global Youth \nService Day is an annual public awareness and education campaign that \nhighlights the valuable contributions that young people make to their \ncommunities throughout the year.\n  Mr. President, the participation of youth in community service is not \njust a ``nice idea'' for a way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Youth who \nare engaged in volunteer service and service-learning activities do \nbetter in school than their classmates who do not volunteer. Youth who \nengage in volunteering and other positive activities are also more \nlikely to avoid risky behaviors, such as drug and alcohol use, crime, \nand promiscuity. Service within the community also contributes \npositively to young people's character development, civic \nparticipation, and better understanding of the needs of their \nneighbors.\n  A recent survey by Civic Enterprises found that 47 percent of high \nschool dropouts reported that boredom in school was a primary reason \nwhy they dropped out. High quality service-learning activities can, \nhowever, help young people make important connections between the \ncurriculum and the challenges they see in their communities.\n  It is important, therefore, that the United States Senate encourage \nyouth to engage in community service and to congratulate them for the \nservice they provide.\n  In an effort to recognize and support youth volunteers in my State, I \nam proud to acknowledge some of the activities that will occur this \nyear in Alaska in observance of National and Global Youth Service Day:\n  1. Anchorage's Promise, which works to mobilize all sectors of the \ncommunity to build the character and competence of Anchorage's children \nand youth, is again sponsoring the annual Kids' Day three-day events in \nAnchorage this year. Youth will provide significant service to their \npeers and to adults who attend Kids' Day activities: Students from King \nCareer Center will serve as volunteer safety patrols. Students from the \nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage will serve as greeters. Members of the \nWest High School Junior ROTC will provide security. The youth members \nof the American Co-Ed Pageants will serve as entertainment directors. \nStudents at Chugiak High School will help their younger peers with \nbicycle and seatbelt safety demonstrations. Youth volunteers at the \nImaginiarium will help with displays and lead groups of visitors \nthrough the hands-on experiments. Youth docents at the Anchorage Museum \nwill help youth visitors explore the museum. Youth will also organize a \nBook Give-Away and provide entertainment through song, dance, \ngymnastics, and karate.\n  In addition to the Kids' Day events, young people from every region \nof Alaska will serve their communities in the following ways:\n  2. Young members of the Kiwanis Key Club will, through the RYLA Youth \nLeadership program, perform various service projects from March through \nMay.\n  3. Alaska Youth for Environmental Action will sponsor A Week Without \nPlastics activities in Anchorage, Palmer, Fairbanks, Juneau, Homer, \nYakutat, and Sitka. Youth organizers will help educate their \ncommunities, through various outreach activities, on the effects of \nplastics on our environment.\n  4. Youth in the Anchorage School District will host a dance to raise \nfunds for economically disadvantaged students who do not qualify for a \nfree or reduced price school lunch; make daily checks for recyclable \nitems, and hold a fundraiser for lymphoma and leukemia research.\n  5. In partnership with the Anchorage Municipal Libraries, youth will \nhelp organize the city's summer reading program and materials.\n  6. In partnership with Covenant House and Congregation Beth Shalom, \nyoung people in Anchorage will involve their peers in transforming old \nT-shirts into reusable grocery bags.\n  7. 4-H and other youth volunteers, in partnership with the Alaska Zoo \nin Anchorage, will provide plastics education information and \nparticipate in the planting of trees for Earth Day.\n  8. In Ketchikan, the Boys and Girls Club will sponsor a city-wide \nclean-up involving many elementary, middle schools and high school \nstudents.\n  9. From January through May, young people whose parents are stationed \nat\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\nElmendorf Air Force Base have been involved in monthly service \nprojects.\n  10. Members of Camp Fire at Highland Tech will sponsor a student \ncontest between the advisory teams within the school to see who can \nbring in the most plastic to recycle. Each student who participates \nwill receive a reusable shopping bag from Fred Meyer. Students will \nalso hold a Safety Fair.\n  11. In Nome, Alaska, the student council will sponsor the annual food \ndrive, open the local food bank, and go house to house to gather food \nfor the needy in the community.\n  12. The Nome Junior ROTC will gather seeds for the school's \ngreenhouse and prepare plantings in the old gold dredges around town.\n  13. In Juneau, youth members of the Ethics and Leadership program \nwill make ceramic bowls that will be donated to the Glory Hole, \nJuneau's homeless shelter and soup kitchen.\n  14. From January through May, members of the Mayor's Youth Commission \nin Anchorage select a volunteer project that will impact the \nMunicipality for the One Good Deed program.\n  15. Youth members of the Cook Inlet Tribal Council in Anchorage reach \nout to the community at large through the Native Games Community \nOutreach project.\n  16. The Mediak Video, Radio, and Magazine Clubs of Anchorage will \nsponsor a Spring Quarter Movie Night, create Public Service \nAnnouncements for radio station KNBA, and complete the 8th edition of \nAlaska Aloud, the only magazine written by and for Alaska Native \nstudents in the Anchorage area.\n  I am so proud of all of these young people. I value their idealism, \nenergy, creativity, and unique perspectives as they volunteer to make \ntheir communities better and assist those in need.\n  Many similarly wonderful activities will be taking place all across \nthe Nation. I encourage all of my colleagues to visit the Youth Service \nAmerica Web site--www.ysa.org--to find out about the selfless and \ncreative youth who are contributing in their own States this year.\n  I thank my colleagues--Senators Akaka, Bayh, Boxer, Brown, Burr, \nCantwell, Cardin, Casey, Clinton, Cochran, Coleman, Collins, Craig, \nDodd, Dole, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Gregg, Inouye, Isakson, \nKennedy, Kerry, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman, Lincoln, \nMartinez, Menendez, Mikulski, Murray, Ben Nelson, Bill Nelson, Obama, \nSpecter, Stevens, and Tester--for standing with me as original co-\nsponsors of this worthwhile legislation, which will ensure that youth \nacross the country and the world know that all of their hard work is \ngreatly appreciated.\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 528\n\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Day is an annual public \n     awareness and education campaign that highlights the valuable \n     contributions that young people make to their communities;\n       Whereas the goals of Global Youth Service Day are to--(1) \n     mobilize the youth of the United States to identify and \n     address the needs of their communities through service and \n     service-learning; (2) support young people in embarking on a \n     lifelong path of service and civic engagement; and (3) \n     educate the public, the media, and policymakers about \n     contributions made by young people as community leaders \n     throughout the year;\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Day, a program of Youth \n     Service America, is the largest service event in the world \n     and in 2008 is being observed for the 20th consecutive year \n     in the United States and for the 9th year globally in more \n     than 100 countries;\n       Whereas young people in the United States and in many other \n     countries are volunteering more than in any other generation \n     in history;\n       Whereas children and youth not only represent the future of \n     the world, but also are leaders and assets today;\n       Whereas children and youth should be valued for the \n     idealism, energy, creativity, and unique perspectives that \n     they use when addressing critical global issues such as \n     poverty, hunger, illiteracy, education, gang activity, \n     natural disasters, climate change, and myriad others;\n       Whereas a fundamental and conclusive correlation exists \n     between youth service, lifelong adult volunteering, and \n     philanthropy;\n       Whereas service-learning is a teaching and learning \n     strategy that integrates meaningful community service with \n     mastery of academic curricula by helping young people make \n     important connections between what they are studying and the \n     challenges that they see in their communities;\n       Whereas several private foundations and corporations in the \n     United States support service-learning as a means for young \n     people to build character and develop the leadership and \n     career-preparedness skills that are necessary for the United \n     States to be competitive in the 21st century, including time \n     management, decision-making, teamwork, and problem solving;\n       Whereas a report by Civic Enterprises found that 47 percent \n     of high school dropouts reported boredom as a primary reason \n     for dropping out;\n       Whereas high quality, semester-long service-learning has \n     been found to increase students' academic engagement and \n     achievement, motivation to learn, school attendance, civic \n     participation, character development, and career aspirations;\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Day engages millions of young \n     people worldwide with the support of 75 lead agencies, 45 \n     international organizations, and 120 national partners;\n       Whereas a growing number of Global Youth Service Day \n     projects involve youth working collaboratively across \n     national and geographic boundaries, increasing intercultural \n     understanding and promoting the sense that they are global \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas both young people and their communities will \n     benefit greatly from expanded opportunities for youth to \n     engage in volunteer service and service-learning: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and commends the significant contributions \n     of the youth of the United States and encourages the \n     cultivation of a civic bond among young people dedicated to \n     serving their neighbors, their communities, and the Nation;\n       (2) designates April 25, 2008, as ``Global Youth Service \n     Day''; and\n       (3) calls on the citizens of the United States to--\n       (A) observe the day by encouraging youth to participate in \n     civic and community service projects and by joining them in \n     such projects;\n       (B) recognize the volunteer efforts of the young people of \n     the United States throughout the year; and\n       (C) support the volunteer efforts of young people and \n     engage them in meaningful learning and decision-making \n     opportunities today as an investment in the future of the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3269-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on October 6, 2007, the people of \nVirginia's First Congressional District lost one of its most respected \nand admired leaders, a dedicated Member of Congress and loyal friend, \nRepresentative Jo Ann Davis.\n  Today, as a small tribute to her, the Senate passed H.R. 5489, which \ndesignated the United States Post Office at 6892 Main Street in \nGloucester, VA, as the ``Congresswoman Jo Ann S. Davis Post Office.'' \nLast year, Senator Webb and I introduced a companion bill, S. 2725.\n  Following a successful real estate career, Mrs. Davis decided to run \nfor public office in 1997. After serving as a Delegate in the Virginia \nGeneral Assembly for 4 years, Jo Ann Davis became the first Republican \nwoman to serve Virginia in the U.S. Congress after winning her election \nin 2000.\n  From her first day in office, Congresswoman Davis was a relentless \nchampion for the needs of the First District. It was my privilege to \nwork with her on many matters, ranging from national defense to the \nenvironment. I always admired Representative Davis for her strong \nconvictions and the tenacity that she brought to bear in acting on \nthem. She fought a courageous struggle against cancer, and I will \ncertainly miss her insights and her friendship in our Virginia \nCongressional Delegation.\n  Given her commendable public service at the Federal and State levels, \nI was pleased to offer this small token of recognition and gratitude \nfor someone who had given so much to the Commonwealth and her country.\n  I join with my colleagues from the Commonwealth and from the entire \nU.S. Congress in expressing my deepest sympathies to her husband, her \ntwo sons, and her extended family. They continue to remain in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/22/senate-section/article/S3270-15", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3270-S3271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, APRIL 23, 2008\n\n  Mr. REID.
