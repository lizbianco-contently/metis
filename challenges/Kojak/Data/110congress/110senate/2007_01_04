So I \nvery much appreciate everyone's cooperation as we look forward to this \nnew Congress.\n\n       The future lies with those wise political leaders who \n     realize that the great public is interested more in \n     Government than in politics.\n\n  Franklin Roosevelt, 1940.\n  I have chosen this line to open this new session of the Senate \nbecause the wisdom it imparts is as relevant today as it was 67 years \nago.\n\n       The future lies with those wise political leaders who \n     realize that the great public is interested more in \n     Government than in politics.\n\n  The American people are expecting positive results from this 110th \nCongress, not more partisan rancor. We stand today at the cusp of a new \nCongress, ready to write a new chapter in our country's great future. \nIt is a time of hope and promise for our Nation. The elections are \nover, and the next Senate campaigns have yet to begin.\n  Today we are not candidates; we are U.S. Senators. We 100 are from \ndifferent States, we 100 represent different people, we 100 represent \ndifferent political parties, but we share the same mission: keeping our \ncountry safe and providing a Government that allows people to enjoy the \nfruits and prosperity and, of course, our economic freedom.\n  Last November, the voters sent us a message. They sent this message \nto Democrats and they sent this message to Republicans: The voters are \nupset with Congress and the partisan gridlock. The voters want a \nGovernment that focuses on their needs. The voters want change. \nTogether, Democrats and Republicans must deliver that change.\n  No longer can we waste time here in the Capitol while families in \nAmerica struggle to get ahead. No longer can we here in the Capitol \nafford to pass the problems of today to Congresses of tomorrow. Those \nproblems, for example, are from keeping families safe to raising the \nminimum wage to instituting new ethical reforms. We can and we must get \nto work.\n  As the new Congress begins, the challenges facing America are \ncomplex. They range from a contracted war in Iraq to a health care \ncrisis right here at home, from a middle class that is squeezed to an \nenergy policy that is warming our globe, from a higher education system \nthat has exploded in costs to jobs where benefits have all but \ndisappeared. We Senators can make a difference in each of these areas \nif we remember we are here to fight for our country, not with each \nother.\n  The majority, my party, holds a very slim margin--51 to 49. Some may \nlook at this as a composition for gridlock, a recipe for gridlock, but \nI see this as a unique opportunity. I guarantee everyone in this \nChamber that the American people are hoping it is a unique \nopportunity--an opportunity for Democrats, an opportunity for \nRepublicans--to debate our differences and seek common ground. We must \nturn the page on partisanship and usher in a new era of bipartisan \nprogress. How can we achieve progress? By doing things differently than \nthey have been done in recent years.\n  One, we must--I repeat again and again--work together.\n  Second, we are going to have to work here in Washington, in the \nSenate, longer hours. Factory workers, shopkeepers in America's malls, \nschoolteachers, police officers, miners, welders, and business men and \nwomen work at least 5 days a week. Shouldn't we here in Washington, \nwhere we do our business, in this laboratory we call the Senate, do the \nsame?\n  Three, we will achieve progress by working on an agenda that reflects \nnot the needs of Democrats, not the needs\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nof Republicans, but the needs of the people of this great country.\n  Today Democrats may be in charge of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, but we in the Senate are committed to bipartisanship. \nWe found that a one-party town simply doesn't work. We know from \nexperience that majorities come and they go. Majorities are very \nfragile, and majorities must work with minorities to make that lasting \nchange.\n  In this body, the U.S. Senate, nothing can be accomplished unless we \nreach across the aisle--not one way but both ways. It is because when \nour Founding Fathers created the Senate 219 years ago, they carved out \na special place for the minority. See, the Framers of this Constitution \nknew that majorities can always take care of themselves. Majorities \ndidn't need help as defined in the Constitution. But this Constitution \ntakes care of minorities because they can't always take care of \nthemselves. The Founding Fathers created an institution that protects \nthis minority, and we will respect our Constitution and those \nprotections.\n  I have talked with Senator Mitch McConnell, the senior Senator from \nthe great State of Kentucky. He is the minority leader. He is my \nfriend. In the months and years that go forward, we will become even \ncloser because he has learned, and I have learned, through adversity we \ngrow together. I am committed to working with him, and I know he is \ncommitted to working with me. We as Democrats are committed to working \nwith Republicans and Republicans are committed to working with us.\n\n  Does this mean there are going to be no bumps in the road? Of course \nthere will be bumps in the road. We are in the Senate. The Founding \nFathers wanted bumps in the road.\n  This morning, at 9 o'clock in the Old Senate Chamber, we held a rare \njoint caucus. It was an opportunity for us to look across the rows at \neach other and understand that the Senate is a place where we have to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion.\n  We in the majority, we Democrats, are committed to working with our \nPresident, President Bush. He has pledged to work with Democrats. He \nhas pledged to me personally that he would work to make progress.\n  We are not going to talk about what went on for the past 6-plus \nyears. What I have discussed with the President, as late as last night, \nis what we are going to do for the next 22 months together. There are \n22 months left in this Presidential term. The President, I know, wants \nto accomplish things. I want to accomplish things. He has to work with \nus and we have to work with him or jointly we do nothing to help our \ncountry.\n  As I have said, we are going to work longer hours, we are going to \nwork full weeks, we are going to have votes on Mondays and Fridays. \nNone of us are happy because all but 10 Senators here participated in \nthe last Congress, the so-called do-nothing Congress. We are not proud \nof that fact. We spent less time working than any Congress in modern \nhistory. Some days the sessions lasted a matter of minutes. In this \nCongress, legislative days will be real workdays.\n  The extra days will help our committees. The foundation of this \ninstitution, the Senate, is the committee system. It has worked from \nthe beginning of our great Republic, but it hasn't worked so well \nlately. But it now is going to have an opportunity to work better. Our \ncommittees will have the time they need to put their expertise to use.\n  The best legislation with the broadest possible support always comes \nfrom our committees. In the Senate, we have chairmen and ranking \nmembers with years of experience: Ted Kennedy and Mike Enzi on the HELP \nCommittee; Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley on the Finance Committee; Joe \nBiden and Dick Lugar on the Foreign Relations Committee; Carl Levin and \nJohn McCain on the Armed Services Committee; Patrick Leahy and Arlen \nSpecter on the Judiciary Committee. And on and on. These names speak of \ntheir broad experience and their ability to get things done for our \ncountry, but it must come through the committee process.\n  As all my Democrats know, when I assumed the job as Democratic \nleader, I told every ranking member that those committees had to \nfunction and I was going to let them function, and I have done that for \n2 years. Now there is going to be more time for them to produce \nlegislation. They are no longer ranking members, they are Chairs, but \nthey cannot succeed unless they work with their ranking members.\n  Our committees will have the time to do a number of tasks, but the \none item they need to do is conduct strong oversight. This is not a \nnegative term. Oversight is good. It is important to find out what \nFederal agencies are doing, to listen to what the people who work there \nhave to say. Congressional oversight is a responsibility that has been \nabdicated in recent years. Oversight is important for our country, not \nso we can point fingers or cast blame, but answer difficult questions \nand find lasting solutions to the enormous challenges we have. Everyone \nfocuses on Iraq--of course, that is a very difficult problem--but there \nare many other problems that face this great country. The war in Iraq \nwill cast a long shadow over the Senate's work this year. No issue in \nour country is more important than finding an end to that war. We will \nbe listening very closely to President Bush when he comes forward with \nhis plan next week. The President's new plan must ensure that Iraq \ntakes responsibility for its own future and remove our troops from this \ncivil war. Completing the mission in Iraq is the President's job and we \nwill do everything to assist the Commander in Chief to ensure his \nresponsibilities.\n\n  Finally, the Senate will achieve progress for our Nation by ensuring \nthe Senate calendar reflects America's needs. In the weeks ahead, I \nlook forward to receiving input from the minority. This afternoon, as \nis the tradition in the Senate, I will present an overview of the \nDemocrats' legislative agenda, bills S. 1 through S. 10. Following the \ntradition of the Senate, my friend, the distinguished minority leader, \nSenator McConnell, will offer bills S. 11 through S. 20 whenever he \nfeels it appropriate.\n  In the first 10 bills we will introduce this afternoon, and in our \nongoing oversight of the war in Iraq, we intend to address these \npriorities, basically three of them: one, providing real security; two, \nrestoring transparency, accountability, and responsibility in the \nUnited States Government; and three, helping working Americans get \nahead by boosting wages and cutting costs in health care, education, \nand energy.\n  We begin with S. 1, our plan to change the way Washington works. It \nwas late 2005 when scandals involving lobbyists and lawmakers shocked \nthe very core of this Nation. Despite the Senate's best attempts on a \nbipartisan basis, here we are 2 years later and still no reform of \nethics, lobbying, and earmarks. The American people deserve better. \nThat is why as our first order of business we will seek to give \nAmericans the open and accountable government they deserve. We will \nstart Monday with a bipartisan bill cosponsored by Reid and McConnell. \nI think that is a pretty good start. We will start with the ethics bill \nthat passed the Senate last year. Now, had that bill passed, which it \ndidn't, it would have been the most significant reform since Watergate \nin lobbying and ethics reform. It didn't pass. Some people minimized \nour starting point. I maximize our starting point. This bill included \nimportant provisions in many areas, but it was not allowed to proceed \nbecause of what took place on the other side of the Capitol. This year, \nwe will improve that legislation and make additional reforms.\n  This legislation will include reforms to slow the revolving door \nbetween Government jobs and lucrative employment with special \ninterests. It will eliminate gifts paid for by lobbyists and interests \nthat hire lobbyists. It will limit privately funded travel such as that \nof the notorious golf junkets to Scotland. It will increase disclosure \nrequirements so the public will be better informed about the activities \nof lobbyists. And it will increase penalties for those who seek to \nbreak the rules. I lay and spread across this Record how grateful I am \nthat the distinguished minority leader has agreed to cosponsor this \nlegislation. I think it sends the right message to America.\n  With these reforms, which I am confident will pass, we will help \nensure America has a government that is good and honest as the people \nit serves.\n  Mr. President, I send S. 1 to the desk and ask for its appropriate \nreferral.\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nThe bill is at the desk. I am told that the bill is at the desk and we \nchoose not to rule XIV it at this stage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, S. 2 is our plan to increase the wages of \nworking families by raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour. It has \nbeen 10 years since the minimum wage was last increased. In that time, \nthe cost of gas, to say the least, has increased. The cost of food has \nincreased. The cost of health care has increased. Even the salaries of \nMembers of Congress have increased. In fact, the salaries of Members of \nCongress in the last 10 years have increased 9 times, by more than \n$30,000. But through all of this, the minimum wage has stayed the same. \nIt is long past time America's workers received a raise as well.\n  Today, a mother or father can work full time for the minimum wage but \nstill live $5,000 below the poverty level. Adjusted for inflation, the \nminimum wage is at its lowest level since 1955. S. 2 will directly \nraise the pay of nearly 7 million Americans by more than $4,000 and by \nsetting a new salary floor that will indirectly boost the wages of 8 \nmillion more workers. That increase is enough to provide nearly 2 years \nof childcare, full tuition for a community college degree, over a \nyear's worth of heat and electricity or more than 9 months of rent.\n  During the minimum wage debate we will also likely consider giving \nsmall businesses some tax relief. In fact, as we speak, Senator \nMcConnell's staff and my staff are working, along with Senator Enzi, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Baucus, to see if we can \nhave a minimum wage bill that he and I will cosponsor and bring before \nthe Senate. We are working on that.\n  S. 2 is at the desk, and it will be reported at the appropriate time.\n  S. 3 is our plan to reduce drug costs for seniors. The flaws in the \nMedicare drug program are well documented, but many can be traced back \nto one simple fact: The law as written puts drug companies ahead of \nAmerica's aging. No matter whether we supported or opposed that law--\nthat is, the one that created Medicare drug benefits--we all want to \nimprove the program for older Americans and people with disabilities. \nIt is our obligation to do so. Now the Federal Government, with the \nmillions of seniors it represents through Medicare, is unable to \nnegotiate for lower drug prices. As a result, Medicare beneficiaries \nare hostages to insurance companies, drug companies, and managed care \nentities like HMOs. S. 3 is at the desk.\n  S. 4 is our plan to make America safer by fully implementing the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Following September 11, 2001, \nthe country turned to a respected, bipartisan group--the 9/11 \nCommission--to review the lessons of that terrible day and to recommend \nbetter ways to fight the war on terror. Two American patriots chaired \nthat independent bipartisan commission: Congressman Lee Hamilton of \nIndiana and former Governor Tom Kean of New Jersey. They did a \nremarkably good job in a period of 1 year. We realized we didn't need \nDemocratic solutions or Republican solutions to keep people safe; we \nneeded bipartisan American solutions to keep us safe. The Commission \ndid a wonderful job and made a number of recommendations. Some were \nimplemented, others weren't. I was the manager, along with my \ndistinguished colleague, the minority leader, of the bill that was \nbrought before the Senate.\n\n  One year ago, the Commission delivered a report card grading the \nGovernment's progress in implementing its solutions. Among the grades \ngiven by that commission were 12 Ds, 5 Fs, and two incompletes. I say, \ntry taking those grades home to your parents. These grades made clear \nwe still have not done enough to make America safe. We have work to do, \nand this legislation will step toward in fulfilling the recommendations \nof the 9/11 Commission. Specifically, it will reinvigorate the fight \nagainst Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida, and the ideologies of violent \nextremists. It will enhance the security of our transportation system \nand our ports. It will provide America's first responders with the \ntechnology they need to communicate with each other during a crisis, \nand it will make it a priority to secure loose nukes around the world.\n  Finishing the job of implementing \n9/11 Commission recommendations will not by itself win the war on \nterror or guarantee 100-percent complete security for the people of our \ncountry, but we hope with our legislation to improve on the worst of \nthose grades, those Ds and Fs and incompletes, so the American people \ncan have every confidence that Congress and the White House are taking \nevery step--every step possible--to keep America safe. S. 4 is at the \ndesk.\n  S. 5 is the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of this year, 2007. It \nis legislation we seek to pass so that American scientists will find \ncures--allow them to find cures for dread diseases that affect millions \nof our fellow countrymen. Today, there are people all across America \nsuffering from debilitating diseases that stem cell research would \ncure. For these Americans, stem cell research is an area of science \nthat offers hope, if only we in Washington would allow this hope to \nflourish. Last year, Congress passed legislation promoting stem cell \nresearch, only to see it vetoed by our President. This year, we will \nconsider the legislation again, and on behalf of millions of Americans \nlooking for cures, looking for relief, we urge our President to \nreconsider his veto. S. 5 is at the desk.\n  S. 6 is our plan to promote energy independence so we can enhance \nAmerica's security and begin to deal with the threat--the threat--of \nglobal warming. I, with five of my Senate colleagues, traveled last \nweek to the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Bolivia. We were \nin Ecuador and Peru. They told us, the most diverse Nation in the \nworld, the most ecologically diverse Nation in the world--Ecuador--that \nthe glaciers are melting Ecuador, rapidly. For too long our country's \nenergy policy has had only one concern: oil company profits--$34 \nbillion for Exxon and the other companies, international cartels, not \nfar behind. We have allowed Exxon's bottom line to take priority over \nfamilies struggling at the gas pump and the harmful effects of global \nwarming. So in an effort to begin to solve this energy crisis, our \nsixth bill takes an aggressive approach to reducing America's \ndependence on oil, especially foreign oil, and putting more advanced \ntechnologies in the hands of consumers. It will boost production of \nelectricity from solar, geothermal, and other renewable resources that \nare abundant in States such as Nevada, and it will grow our Nation's \nrenewable energy jobs and manufacturing base. Freeing ourselves from \noil is a tremendous challenge, but it is one we cannot afford to \nignore. Remember: Unstable regimes around the world use our petro \ndollars to pay for international terror, to fund it, and pursue their \ndespotic goals. So energy independence is not only energy independence, \nit is security. S. 6 is at the desk.\n  S. 7 is the College Opportunity Act, our plan to make college more \naffordable for middle-class families. In America today, a college \neducation is more important than ever. Unfortunately, it is also far \nmore expensive than ever. Today, too many families are being squeezed \ntrying to put their children through school. In the last 6 years, the \ncost of college has increased by 52 percent. Federal assistance has \ndeclined, especially in the form of Pell grants. Our legislation will \nreverse this trend by raising the maximum Pell grant award. It will \nalso assist families by lowering interest rates for student loans and \nexpanding tax breaks for college costs. S. 7 is at the desk.\n  S. 8 is Rebuilding America's Military Act. As we speak, there is not \na single nondeployed Army unit that is battle ready. The wars in \nAfghanistan and in Iraq, the war on terror, have been terribly \ndevastating to our military. These brave men and women have done the \nvery best any fighting force could do. But because of Iraq and \nAfghanistan, the U.S. militarily is strained to levels not seen since \nVietnam. While our troops remain the finest in the world, \ninfrastructure is crumbling around them. Nearly all of our combat \ndivisions have been deployed and two-thirds of our Army combat brigades \nare not ready for combat. GEN Peter Schoomaker, the Chief of Staff of \nthe Army, testified last month, ``At this pace . . . we will break the \nactive component'' of the U.S. Army.\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\n  We, also, have National Guard, Reserve and Active-Duty veterans \ncoming back in droves to America without sufficient help for their \nhealth care and certainly not their education.\n  If we want real security, we must rebuild the U.S. military and \nensure it remains the best fighting force in the world. S. 8 is at the \ndesk.\n  S. 9 will secure America by undertaking comprehensive immigration \nreform. I had friends and colleagues, staff, ask: Why are you bringing \nup this controversial subject on the first day of Congress? It has to \nbe brought up. Immigration is a problem that affects this Nation. Last \nyear, we passed a solid immigration bill in the Senate. There are parts \nof that bill I didn't like, but we passed a bill. Unfortunately, it \nfell victim to politics, again in the other body. Immigration reform is \ntoo vital to our security and our economy to fall by the wayside, so we \nmust deal with it again this year. Our immigration system is broken. \nDoes anyone dispute this? Our borders remain unsecured. Does anyone \ndispute that? Our laws remain underenforced. Does anyone dispute that? \nDoes anyone dispute the fact that we have 11 million people with bad \npapers who are here illegally? Does anyone dispute that? No. So our \nbill will take a comprehensive approach to repairing this broken \nsystem. With tough and smart reforms, it will secure our borders, crack \ndown on enforcement, and lay down a path to earned legalization for \nundocumented immigrants already living here. There is no amnesty. If \nthere were ever an example of the need for bipartisanship, it is on \nimmigration because it is going to be hard, but it is something that we \nhave to do. S. 9 is at the desk.\n  Finally, S. 10 will reinstate pay-as-you-go rules to the budget \nprocess. This does not sound very politically sexy, to talk about pay \nas you go. But as most know, the Senate used to operate under a rule \ncalled pay as you go. This simple proposition demanded that when we \nincreased spending or cut taxes we had to pay for it. It is a \ncommonsense principle families all across America practice when they \nbalance their checkbooks. Pay-go was in place in the Senate in the \n1990s, when our country experienced unprecedented levels of economic \ngrowth and vitality. Remember, it can be done. In the last years of the \nClinton administration, we paid down the national debt by almost a half \ntrillion dollars. Unfortunately, the rule disappeared in recent years \nand the results have been disastrous: $9 trillion in debt; the largest \ndeficits, of course, in our history; foreign debt that has more than \ndoubled, giving unprecedented control to countries such as Saudi Arabia \nand China. We are even borrowing money from Mexico. These countries \nshould not have the unprecedented control of our economic destiny. We \nare facing a fiscal nightmare that will not go away this Congress, and \nit will handicap our ability in all we need to do in so many different \nareas. With pay-go in place, we will begin to set America on the right \ntrack.\n  I have been in Congress going on 25 years. In my 25 years, I \nwitnessed many fine moments in our Senate's history. But I believe in \nmy State, in the Senate, and in the House, the days following 9/11 are \nwhat America is all about. It was a national tragedy, but it brought \nout the best in us, the best in Members of Congress, the best in the \nAmerican people. Democrats and Republicans from all over America put \naside our differences and worked with the administration to protect our \ncountry. That day showed the Government working as the Founders \nintended. This year we must work on the same bipartisan basis, the same \nfashion.\n  It should not take a national tragedy for us to work together. We \nshould be equally united by our ability to make a positive difference \nin the lives of the people who sent us here. Today is that beginning. \nThis year let us work side by side and succeed together.\n\n       The future lies with those wise political leaders who \n     realize the great public is interested more in government \n     than politics.\n\n  --Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1940.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S11-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).

Mr. President, we have heard my good friend, the \nmajority leader, describe the first 10 bills of the majority in the new \nCongress. I would say for the information of all of our colleagues, the \nprocedure in the Senate Republican conference is for the conference \nitself to designate our first 10 bills. We will be doing that at a \nmeeting to occur in the next few weeks. We have essentially reserved \nthe numbers S. 11 through S. 20 which will reflect our priorities for \nthis Congress.\n  Let me say at the outset, before giving my opening remarks, how much \nI value the friendship and relationship I have with the distinguished \nmajority leader. I believe we had an excellent session this morning in \nthe old Senate Chamber, and we look forward to getting off to a good \nstart.\n  Today is the 110th time in our Nation's history that we begin a new \nsession of Congress. This is a day to renew our purpose, to set a \nsturdy course for the important work ahead, and to ask ourselves: What \nwill future generations say of the 110th Congress? This is the first \nday of that Congress. What will they say of us on the last day?\n  The Senate has a unique role in our Government. It always has. It is \na place where the two great political parties must work together if a \ncommon goal is to be reached. It is the legislative embodiment of \nindividual and minority rights, a place where the careful design, \ncrafted by our Founding Fathers, pretty much operates today the way \nthey planned it 220 years ago.\n  We saw this 43 years ago with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when the \ntwo parties forged a difficult alliance to reach a great goal. \nSegregated buses and lunch counters are difficult to fathom now, but \ntheir end only came about through the kind of cooperative resolution \nthat has marked this body from the start.\n\n  At its best, the Senate is a workshop where difficult challenges, \nsuch as civil rights, are faced squarely--and addressed--with good will \nand careful, principled agreement. At a time such as our own, when so \nmany issues of consequence press upon us, it must be nothing less.\n  Yet the challenges ahead will not be met if we do nothing to overcome \nthe partisanship that has come to characterize this body over the past \nseveral years. A culture of partisanship over principle represents a \ngrave threat to the Senate's best tradition as a place of constructive \ncooperation. It undermines the spirit and the purpose of this \ninstitution, and we must do something to reverse its course.\n  The Senate can accomplish great things over the next 2 years, but \nthis opportunity will surely slip from our grasp if we do not commit \nourselves to a restoration of civility and common purpose. So as we \nopen this session, I stake my party to a pledge: When faced with an \nurgent issue, we will act; when faced with a problem, we will seek \nsolutions, not mere political advantage.\n  The Framers thought a lot about the kind of people who would sit \nbehind these desks on the floor and they set down some simple rules. \nSenators should be older than their House colleagues. They should serve \nlonger terms, and proportional representation ensures that all States \nhave an equal say, regardless of size. The Senate was also conceived to \nbe a place of civil debate and good will.\n  Mike Mansfield showed grace and humility in his efforts to expand \ncivil rights. Working with Republicans to offset resistance in his own \nparty, he guided passage of the great Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s \nand even let a Republican take the credit. In fact, today the name \nEverett Dirksen may actually be better known, but historians know \nbetter.\n  Mansfield's collegial spirit didn't just surface when it served his \npurposes. Historians tell us his first appointment each day was \nbreakfast with Senator George Aiken, a Republican from Vermont. The two \nmen met when one of Aiken's aides spotted Mansfield alone, pushing a \ntray down the cafeteria line in the Capitol. She asked the new Senator \nif he wanted to join her and her boss for lunch, and he did. The two \nmen remained close friends for 25 years. A small act of kindness set \nthe tone.\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\n  Cooperation among parties is not so distant a memory that some of us \ncan't recall Democrats and Republicans working together to pass \nPresident Reagan's tax cuts in the early 1980s. That common effort led \nto the greatest economic expansion of our history--the American \nmiracle, they called it.\n  We saw the spirit of cooperation again in the 1990s, when a \nRepublican-led Senate worked with the Democrats, including President \nClinton, to reform welfare. And we have seen it in recent years, though \nless frequently, on issues such as tort reform and the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  We used to say that Senators were friends after 5 o'clock. We need \nmore of that if we are going to restore this body to its high purpose. \nThe Senate is not a club nor a clique. It is a group of men and women \ncharged with the solemn duty to support and defend the Constitution \nagainst its enemies. George Mitchell once called the Senate a single \nbody made up of 100 independent contractors. Yet he earned the respect \nof his colleagues by his willingness to listen, to work together, to \ntake risks. He knew when to put self-interest aside. He knew the role \nof the Senate.\n  The risks we face today are grave, and facing them will require \ngreater unity and civility than we have been used to around here \nlately. But drawing on the examples of the past and conscious of this \nbody's historic role, we can again rise out of our party trenches and \nwork together for the good of all.\n  This morning the Democrats and Republicans got together in the old \nSenate Chamber, an ornate, rather small room compared to this one, that \nalways reminds me of the promise of this Nation in its early days. I \nwould like to see, in this small act of bipartisanship, a sign of \nrestoration to come.\n  The work of restoration should start with the things that are easiest \nto do because a victory in small things now will lead to big victories \nlater. The Senate has not approved a minimum wage increase in more than \na decade, but we are willing to work together toward that end. We \nbelieve that an increase needs to help both the workers who earn it and \nthe small businesses that pay it.\n  It just makes sense to pair the increased wage with tax and \nregulatory relief, so the small businesses that create most of the new \njobs in this country can remain competitive and employ even more \npeople. We can get this done.\n  The voters told us in November that they expect more from us. One \nconcrete thing we can do to restore their trust is common sense \nlobbying reform. The first bill I will sponsor as the Republican \nleader, in cooperation with the majority leader, is aimed at precisely \nthat. The voters want honest government. We can get this done too.\n  Two issues. Two issues we can move on carefully but quickly. Let's \nget them done.\n  After that, I challenge this body to be daring. The Senate has no \nclaim on greatness unless its power is put to great ends. Divided \ngovernment demands that we must work together. So let us do so not only \nfor ends that are easily within our grasp, but for those worthy things \nthat have just eluded us in the past.\n  Social Security is an issue on which Americans demand action--yet \nmany fear what action might mean.\n  Our job is not to play into those fears but to erase them. To show \nvoters that the greatest cause for fear is the system in its current, \nunsustainable form. Everyone in this Chamber knows the facts. So let's \nbe honest brokers--and strengthen Social Security before this Congress \nends.\n  Today, the 110th Congress begins. But before it ends, the first great \nwave of babyboomers will retire. Over the next two decades, more than \n77 million people will leave the workforce even as fewer new workers \njoin it. And by the time they all leave, there will be only two \nAmerican workers supporting each retiree.\n  This is clearly unsustainable. Unless we reform the system, we have a \nchoice: Either our children work longer and harder or our parents live \nwith less.\n  The Senate cannot sit idly by as this demographic reality takes \nshape. Rather, we must do the hard work we were elected to do. We must \nmake our money work harder for our parents and our children, and so we \nneed to reform Social Security now.\n  The Framers knew we would have to make tough decisions. That's why \nthey didn't want Senators to be elected by popular vote. The system \nthey devised had its own problems, so we changed it.\n  But the principle was sound: the right decision is not always the \neasiest one. We have an obligation to address the important issues of \nthe day, in a spirit of cooperation and courage, and with a goal of \naccomplishment for all Americans.\n  Immigration is one the most pressing issues of our day. We should be \ndaring about immigration reform--and act on it soon. The voters demand \nit. We have a duty to deliver.\n  Americans are generous, eager to welcome strangers and happy when \nthey prosper. Yet we know that the blessings of liberty depend on \nrespect for the law and a common national culture. We can ensure both \neven as we welcome those who come here looking for a better life.\n  Laws that are generous need not be lax. And a country that is not \nsecure at its borders is not secure in its laws. Border security and \nother law enforcement professionals must have the tools they need to \nkeep our borders--and our laws--strong.\n  America has not seen a domestic terrorist attack since we committed \nourselves to the global war on terror. That is not an accident, some \nquirk of fate. Rather, it is due to the hard work of spotting and \ndisrupting threats before they strike.\n  The indisputable success of these efforts is the greatest argument we \nhave to continue to support them--and to make sure those who secure the \nhomeland are fully equipped to continue the outstanding work they have \ndone.\n  One of the principles that has guided our efforts in the war on \nterror is that terrorism must be fought at a distance or it will be \nfought in our streets.\n  This policy has worked--and we must ensure that it continues to work \nby giving the men and women who carry out that mission every day all \nthe tools they need.\n  One of those tools is the terrorist surveillance program. If \nterrorists are calling the United States, we should know what they're \ntalking about. This program has saved lives. And we would endanger \nothers by ending it.\n  Al-Qaida is not a threat to Republicans; it's not a threat to \nDemocrats--it is a threat to America. And the Senate must work together \nas we prepare for the long struggle ahead.\n  We must use all the tools we have: diplomacy, intelligence, economic \nand military might. The men and women of the Armed Forces have \nsacrificed much in battle. Their families have made great quiet \nsacrifices at home. We will honor both by pledging that the American \nArmed Forces will remain the best equipped, best trained, and best \nprepared in the world.\n  And very soon, we will return to the issue of Iraq. It is my hope, \nand my challenge to this body, that the debate will be based on what's \nbest for the future of our Nation and for Iraq--not what's best for the \nRepublican party or the Democratic party.\n  The Senate must be bold in preparing Americans for the struggle \nahead. Our Nation's security depends on secure borders and a strong \nfighting force. It also depends on energy independence. So we must \ncontinue to work hard to decrease our reliance on foreign sources of \nenergy.\n  We laid a solid foundation during the last Congress, with passage of \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2005 and, just last month, with the enactment \nof the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. Both measures were passed \nwith bipartisan support, and both will decrease our dangerous \ndependence on foreign oil and gas.\n  There is more that we can do both to increase domestic supply and \ndecrease our demand for foreign energy. The United States has an \nabundance of coal and remains a leader in nuclear technology. We should \nfocus attention on using these natural resources safely, cleanly, and \nefficiently.\n  We cannot go back on the gains we made in the last Congress. And I \nwill work with my colleagues to continue this vital work.\n  If the restoration of our purpose does not lead those of us in the \nSenate to be daring, then our prosperity should.\n  Republicans presided over 4 years of economic growth; the biggest \nhousing\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\nboom since World War II; and an unemployment rate that has stayed at or \nbelow 5 percent for more than 15 months. The current rate of 4.5 \npercent is just remarkable.\n  The crash of 2000 yielded to gains that have sent the Dow Jones \nIndustrial average to an all-time high. We have created more than 7 \nmillion jobs since August 2003. These gains are no accident. They are \nthe result of the stimulative tax relief we passed. These policies \nclearly worked, and they should be kept in place.\n  Republicans used the strong economic climate to cut the deficit. We \ncut it in half even more quickly than anyone thought we would. And \nworking together, across the aisle, we must continue that trend and \nbalance the budget within 5 years.\n  Another focus of this Congress is the overwhelmingly popular and \neffective prescription drug relief for seniors. President Bush and the \nRepublican Congress gave seniors the Medicare prescription drug care \nbenefit they had waited on for decades. We cannot ``scrap'' this \nprogram, as some would like. And we will oppose any effort to do so.\n  A spirit of cooperation will lead to a heightened respect for \nfairness--and ensure that the same number of judicial nominees that \nwere confirmed in the final years of the last three administrations are \nconfirmed in the last 2 years of this one.\n  Americans want judges to uphold the original intent of the \nConstitution, not rewrite it. Judicial activism has divided the courts, \nthe Congress, and the Nation for too long. If our work of restoration \nand a new civility is to take hold, we must recommit ourselves to the \nideal of judicial restraint.\n  Like the three Presidents before him, President Bush will spend his \nlast 2 years in office with the opposition party in control of the \nSenate. Like them, he has a right to expect that his nominees will \nreceive an up-or-down vote.\n  The voters recently sent us a message. They told us to solve the \nproblems that face this Nation. They expect us to win the wars we wage. \nAnd they expect us to be men and women of principle.\n  The people of Kentucky gave me the great honor of my life when they \nfirst elected me to the Senate. And I have gone about my work here with \nthem foremost in my mind.\n  I have fought hard to advance and protect the values that matter most \nto the people of my State.\n  It is because of another election that I stand here today. I am \nhonored that my colleagues chose me to lead them at this important \nmoment in our history. I take my duty seriously.\n  I am filled today with a sense of purpose--for party, yes, but for \nthis institution and for our Nation first, for their renewal.\n  Elections are about ideas, and here are some I hold most dear.\n  I believe the state exists to serve individuals and families, not the \nother way around.\n  I believe everyone fortunate enough to call himself or herself an \nAmerican should be able to pursue their dreams freely.\n  I believe God has blessed this country richly, and that the proper \nresponse to the gift of freedom is to defend it.\n  And I believe that the first duty of Government is the defense and \nprotection of its citizens.\n  So I am eager to work with my colleagues to find bold solutions to \nbig problems. Yet on some things I will not yield.\n  I will never agree to proposals that weaken the security of our \ncitizens at home or the capabilities of our Armed Forces abroad.\n  I will never agree to a tax increase on working families or small \nbusinesses. Our economy is strong because of the hard work and \nenterprise of Americans. We will not undermine that spirit by taxing \nit.\n  I will never agree to retreat from our responsibility to confirm \nqualified judicial nominees.\n  Bipartisanship, cooperation and accomplishment; yes. Civility; yes. \nBut we will remain true to our principles.\n  Henry Clay was a great Kentuckian. He spent the last 2 years of his \nlife using the tools of the Senate to save his country. His devotion to \nthe cause of national unity was so great that one rival called it ``a \ncrowning grace'' to Clay's public life.\n  Clay shows us that divided government need not be divisive. Indeed, \nit often leads to historic agreements that unity governments have \nlittle incentive to achieve.\n  And so, working together, forgetting past grievances, forging new \nalliances, we can solve the difficult issues of the day. This is the \npurpose of the Senate and the privilege of its Members.\n  If our steps are guided by this simple principle, then this 110th \nCongress will have met its responsibility on behalf of all Americans, \nand strengthened this institution for the unseen challenges that will \nalways lie ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my honor to follow the speeches that \nhave been given by my new majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of \nNevada, and my new Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of \nKentucky. It is a great honor for me to stand this day in the Senate as \nthe assistant Democratic leader. I cannot express my gratitude to my \ncolleagues for entrusting me with this responsibility.\n  I come to this moment with a sense of amazement. Some 40 years ago, \nas a college student in this town, I first set foot in the old Senate \noffice building as an intern, never dreaming that 40 years later I \nwould be standing on the floor of the Senate in this capacity. It is \nindeed a great honor.\n\n  I do not know how many men and women have lived in the United States \nof America in our history--hundreds of millions, for sure. Today there \nare some 300 million who count America as their home. In the entire \nhistory of the United States of America, from its creation, as of \ntoday, as of this moment in our history, 1,895 men and women have had \nthis high honor of serving in the Senate. Today, we were joined by 10 \nmore.\n  Their life stories, like the stories of many of us, are the stories \nof America: stories of immigrant families, stories of struggle, stories \nof dreams that finally resulted in an election to this great body in \nthe Senate.\n  I imagine if you called on some of the experts in U.S. history--even \nthose who served for quite a few years in the Senate--and asked them \nhow many of the 1,895 Senators who have served here they could \nremember, they would be hard pressed to come up with a long list. As it \nhappens in most walks of life, a few people stand out in history. But \nmost are part of a parade, a parade that passes by many times \nanonymously.\n  In the desk drawers of each of our desks here there is a quaint \nlittle Senate custom. I was talking to Senator John Glenn of Ohio about \nit today. Senators who have served here, despite what they were told by \ntheir teachers in grade school, are encouraged to scratch their names \nin the bottom of the desk drawer. I happen to be sitting at the desk of \nformer Senator John Glenn of Ohio, and my former mentor and \ninspiration, Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois. I would imagine if you \nlook in these desk drawers, there will be many names you do not \nrecognize. The point I am trying to get to is this: Members of the \nSenate, men and women, come and go, but, thank God, this Nation \nendures. And it endures because of the sacrifice each makes for the \ncommon good of this Nation.\n  We have weathered so many storms--9/11 the most recent but, of \ncourse, the Civil War, which almost tore us apart--and time and again \nthroughout our history men and women in this body, in the Senate, have \ndecided the good of this Nation was more important than their \nindividual personal ambition.\n  We have another similar moment in history. It is interesting how \ncritical Americans are of their politicians; and\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\nthat is a healthy thing. We do not assume that those elected to public \noffice are part of any gifted class or any special group. We just \nassume they are people who are like us and fortunate enough to get \nelected. But over the years a lot of people have questioned us, whether \nthose of us who have devoted a good part of our lives to public service \ntruly have the public interest in mind.\n  The skepticism grew last year with the culture of corruption, the \nannouncements of indictments, prosecutions, resignations, not just \namong public officials but those who work in the Halls of the Capitol. \nAnd the skepticism and cynicism about public life grew as people heard \nmore and more of these stories. That is why it is so important we \nreflect on what Senator Reid said earlier about our agenda.\n  The first item on our agenda--and there could be many--is to address \nthis issue of ethics and honesty in Government. I have been a fortunate \nsoul in public life. Two people who brought me here--Paul Douglas and \nPaul Simon, both Senators--were literally paragons of public virtue.\n  Paul Douglas, as Senator from Illinois, used to have a tradition that \nexcept for food and drink he would not accept a gift worth more than \n$2.50. Now, it sounds like an interesting standard. It turned out to be \na complete headache to figure out what to do with a gift that was worth \n$3, or what to do with the belt that a man hand tooled with Senator \nDouglas's name on it and sent to him as a gift. But he was steadfast in \nhis belief that public service meant public sacrifice, not public \nenrichment.\n  Paul Simon, my other mentor in life, felt the same, followed in the \nDouglas tradition, and started me on a long road of disclosing in \ncomplete detail every year my income taxes and total net worth. There \nwere painful moments early in my married life when Loretta and I had \nvery little to claim as earthly possessions and filed a net worth which \nwas pretty embarrassing. Things are a little better now, and I have \ncontinued the tradition.\n  But when Senator Reid talks about changing the Senate rules, to start \nwith, as the first item of business, I think what he is trying to do on \nbehalf of Democrats and Republicans in this bipartisan bill is to \naddress this fundamental issue of restoring the confidence of the \npublic in the Senate. Before we roll up our sleeves and take on the \nissues that count for every family across America, let's take on the \nissue of restoring the integrity of the Senate. That is why this is a \nbill that is high on our list and the first we will consider.\n  The American people voted for change in this last election in many \nways. They certainly want us to move forward. Some of our advisers tell \nus that the term ``bipartisanship'' has too many syllables and is \nunintelligible to the average person. I am not sure. But people do \nunderstand the words ``cooperation'' and ``compromise.'' And I think \npeople across America said to us in the last election: We want you to \ncompromise. We want you to find solutions. We do not want you to play \nto a draw with nothing to show for it.\n\n  The first issue that concerns the people of Illinois to whom I speak \nis this war in Iraq. In the first week of October, I went to Iraq with \nSenator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. We visited Afghanistan and had three \ndifferent stops in Iraq, and we spent many hours meeting with our \nsoldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen. I spent extra time with those \nfrom Illinois just to say hello to them and thank them. I came back not \njust with some frustration over a war which I think was a colossal, \nstrategic mistake, but anger--anger that we continue to ask these brave \nyoung men and women to sacrifice their lives every single day.\n  I can recall when one of the generals took us aside and showed us one \nof these roadside bombs that kills and maims our troops, almost on a \ndaily basis. It looked like nothing more than a fruit cocktail can, \nwith both ends lopped off and a metal charge inside. They disguise it \nand camouflage it and put it on the side of the road. While \nunsuspecting American soldiers course down that road, they unleash the \nblast that kills or maims them. That is life for our soldiers in Iraq. \nThey do not confront an enemy so much as confronting these improvised \nexplosive devices.\n  Over the last few weeks, we have passed some tragic milestones. More \nAmericans have died in Iraq than died on 9/11. As of the first of this \nyear, the 3,000th American life was lost among our fighting men and \nwomen in Iraq. Over 22,000 have returned from Iraq with serious \nphysical and mental injuries.\n  The legacy of this war will continue. Next week, the President is to \npropose the next phase of the war, what he wants to do next. I have to \ntell you, as one of 23 Members of this Senate who voted against this \nwar, I continue to believe we made a serious mistake underestimating \nthe gravity of the challenge once we had deposed Saddam Hussein. It is \nclear now this administration was not prepared to wage this war, \ncertainly not prepared to move us to peace. What they have done is to \nmove our troops into harm's way, risked their lives, and leave us in a \nsituation, 4 years into this war--a war longer than World War II--where \nthere is still no end in sight.\n  In October, our leaders in Iraq told Senator Jack Reed and myself it \nis a matter of months. If we cannot get this under control in a matter \nof months, we have to be honest about it. I think honesty is important. \nThere is a lot of talk about surge. Let's move beyond the word \n``surge'' into the reality. We are talking about the lives of American \nsoldiers, whether we will send 20,000 or 30,000 more American soldiers \ninto that field of combat, whether that can possibly make a difference.\n  I hope to God the President reconsiders that. I am afraid in many \ninstances we are only sending targets and not troops. It is time for \nthe Iraqis to stand up and defend their own country. It is time for \nthem to accept the responsibility of governance and defense. We have \ngiven them so much, over 3,000 American lives and all of our treasure, \nso they can rebuild their country and have a chance. We deposed their \ndictator, put him to trial, saw his execution, gave them a chance for \nconstitutions and governments, gave them all these opportunities, and \nnow it is their turn. We cannot impose democracy on them. That appetite \nfor democracy has to spring from their souls, and they have to want it \nbadly enough to work out the political compromises to disband the \nmilitia, to show the kind of leadership which will give them a nation \nin fact rather than just in words. That will be one of the big issues \nwe debate here.\n  Some have criticized us this week for not talking about Iraq enough. \nI can understand it. When I hear the mothers of fallen soldiers say \nthat should be our first priority, I think they understand, as we do, \nthere is nothing more important that ever happened in their lives. This \nassurance I can give: Next week, when this Senate convenes, both the \nArmed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee will begin \nhearings on Iraq. The debate will really begin in earnest, as it \nshould, as the American people expect. And we will have a \nresponsibility to come up with the best answer for our Nation, for our \ntroops.\n  There are so many other issues we face. One near and dear to my heart \nis the cost of college education. This young boy from East Saint Louis, \nIL, could never have attended Georgetown University or law school were \nit not for Government loans. I borrowed the money, paid it back, and \nbelieve it changed my life forever. So many students across America \ntoday wonder if they will ever be able to borrow enough to go to \nschool. Some of them drop out because of debt. Some of them change \ntheir life plans because of paying off student debt.\n\n  Well, last year, we decided to make it more difficult. The President \nsigned a bill raising the interest rates on student loans, making it \nmore difficult for the kids of working families to go to school. One of \nour first priorities is to reduce the cost of college education \nexpenses so young people with great dreams and limited means have a \nchance to succeed. That is one of our priorities as Democrats, and one \nI totally support.\n  I also think we have to restore some basic economic justice in \nAmerica. How can you possibly explain that over 10 years we have not \nraised the Federal minimum wage? These people get up and go to work \nevery day, many of them raising children, struggling to\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\nsurvive, going to soup kitchens and pantries to supplement their \nincome.\n  Over the Christmas holidays--as many of us do--I visited some of \nthose places, and I met a lot of people who work 40 hours a week. They \ncome to the soup kitchens, they come to the pantries because that is \nthe one way to supplement their income. Well, we can do better. We need \nto increase the Federal minimum wage. And as Senator Reid said, it is \none of our highest priorities.\n  Senator McConnell said, a few moments ago, when it comes to the \nMedicare prescription Part D program, he will not stand by and allow us \nto scrap the program. I say: Hear, hear. We do not want to scrap the \nprogram. It is long overdue. Prescription drugs under Medicare keep our \nseniors healthy, independent, and strong. But, sadly, we know the \nreality that when that bill was passed, it was written by the \npharmaceutical industry. It took competition out of the program so they \ncould charge higher prices. It created a maze of opportunities, but a \nmaze of choices for many seniors who were bewildered by what to do. It \ncreated a doughnut hole, a period of time where seniors who were the \nsickest had no coverage whatsoever.\n  So I would say to my colleague on the other side of the aisle, we are \nnot going to scrap it. We are going to do our best to improve it. And \nwe can improve it, bring in some competition so we have reasonable cost \ndrugs, so we have more coverage for seniors across America.\n  There is an old saying that there is no education in the second kick \nof a mule. No matter what side of the aisle we are on, there is a \nlesson for all of us. The American people have given us today a rare \nopportunity in our history. They have given us an order, too, to chart \na better course for this Nation. They have asked us to listen. And if, \nat the end of the day, we play to a draw on these major issues--if we \ndo not achieve results, if we do not show a good-faith effort toward \ncompromise and cooperation--they will be just as harsh in their \njudgment 2 years from now as they were last November. And we deserve \nit.\n  As we begin anew this Congress, we need to resolve together, on a \nbipartisan basis, to find that path to a better and stronger America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S15-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15-S17]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IMPORTANT PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise as well to speak about our \npriorities that Senator Reid has introduced. First, I compliment him \nfor his vision and drive toward shaping these priorities, and his \nleadership that will ensure the Senate makes the concerns of the \naverage American family our top priority.\n  I thank my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, who, as always, \nis able to articulate in a very smart way, but also a way the average \nperson can understand, how important these priorities are to us.\n  I also, in advance, thank my colleague Senator Murray for being here, \nand who again, in her usual wise and thoughtful way, will help us let \nthe American people know what our priorities are.\n  Now, I wore a blue suit today, naturally, because we are all excited \nover the election in November. But in our excitement, we have to \nremember that we are here because of the people who sent us here, and \nto realize their desire for change, to make their lives better. We know \na bipartisan approach is the best and perhaps the only way we will get \nthis done.\n  If all our exultation and happiness today--and, believe me, I stood \nthere with pride watching the new Members in particular be sworn in, \nknowing how fine they are, what a diverse group of people they are--the \nthing they share in common is coming from the bosom of the people of \ntheir State. Each one, each of the new representatives, each of the new \nSenators represents the people of their State.\n  They come to us with a message, and I don't think the message is \nleft, right, or center, as some of the pundits have said. The message \nis to keep your eyes focused on the average family. All too often we in \nWashington get lost in the world of Washington. Too often politics here \nseems to be a minuet, shadow boxing, sometimes real boxing, where each \nparty and each individual is seeking advantage over the other, and the \nfocus on getting something done--something done for the American \npeople--gets lost.\n  If there was one message that this election had, I think that is it. \nThe American people were pleading with us, crying out to us with a \nstrong but plaintive voice: Help us. The world is changing, and we see \nthat world change in every way. Technology has dramatically affected \neverything we do, whether it is terrorism, where technology has enabled \nsmall groups of bad people to hurt us; whether it is jobs in education, \nwhere we now have a one-world labor market, and our workers, our kids \nin the third grade are going to be competing not simply against the \nkids in the third grade across the hallway but the kids in the third \ngrade in China, India, and Brazil; whether it is the technology that \nhas allowed us to live longer.\n  I read somewhere that a little girl born today, if she lives in the \nearly months and up to a year old, could well live to be 100. And not \nvery unusually, that would almost be the average. That is incredible. \nWhat that means is new problems for Social Security and Medicare. It \nalso means that our whole lifestyle changes as people get married \nlater, have children later, and retire and have many years of leisure \nin life. So technology is changing everything.\n  The old messages--whether they be, in my judgment, the old Democratic \nnew deal message or the old Reagan Republican message--just don't work \nanymore. Voters, in November, didn't tell us to adopt a certain \nideology or philosophy or even party. Their message to Washington was \nto stop fighting with each other and finally get something done for \naverage Americans who are in more need of help now as the world changes \nquickly and dramatically.\n  The average American wants us to get to work on issues that matter to \nthem on a daily basis: making them more secure, lifesaving medical \nresearch, fair wages, comprehensive immigration reform, energy \nindependence, and affordable education and prescription drugs. They \nwant us to go to work for them again. That is what we are going to do.\n  The 10 bills we have introduced are all aimed right at the heart of \nthe average American in the sense of saying to the average American: We \ndo know what you need, what you have asked us to do, and we are going \nto do our best to help you.\n  Make no mistake; overall, families are doing quite well, but they are \nbeginning to hurt in certain ways: high gas prices, skyrocketing \ntuition, prescription drugs. These are all things the average person \nworries about that they probably didn't worry about 10 years ago. These \nfirst 10 bills that we are going to introduce represent the Democratic \npriorities for the Senate and the country. These bills take aim at \nmaking education and prescription drugs more affordable. They address \nour goals for energy independence, better homeland security, innovative \nmedical research, a modernized military, and comprehensive immigration \nreform--priorities that have been neglected for far too long.\n  I first want to express my enthusiastic support for our bill to \naddress college affordability, S. 7, which my colleagues will also \naddress. We know we must make it easier for families to send their kids \nto college. As tuition costs rise, it gets harder and harder for them \nto do it. As college becomes more of a necessity, it also becomes less \naffordable. That is the dilemma we face. We are facing a critical time \nwith this challenge coming, when a college education is vital not only \nto one's individual future but to our Nation's prosperity and \nindependence.\n  We are competing now in a global market connected by technology, and \nwe need a well-educated workforce. That is why I introduced upon \narriving in the Senate a bill to permit a college tuition tax \ndeduction. I have worked to support it ever since. We must ensure that \nthis deduction does not expire, as it nearly did in December, by making \nit permanent. And we must do more. Just getting by is not enough when \nit comes to sending our kids to college. We must address other aspects \nof college costs, including Pell grants, loans, and lowering interest \npayments on loans. I know my colleague, Senator\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\nKennedy, has big plans for addressing these issues. Just as I will work \nhard on the Finance Committee on the tuition issue, he, in the HELP \nCommittee, will be leading many of my colleagues on those issues there.\n  What I have been asked to spend a few minutes to talk about is S. 4, \na bill to implement the recommendations of the national commission on \nterrorist acts, the 9/11 Commission. It has now been over 5 years since \nthe tragedy and devastation of September 11. On that day, our Nation \nchanged irrevocably with the knowledge that terrorist forces, motivated \nby hatred, have the determination and ability to threaten America on \nour own soil. My own city of New York knows this devastation and \ntragedy well. On that day, and in the days following, we lost thousands \nof our friends and family members, including hundreds of brave \nfirefighters and police officers who died trying to save others. We owe \nit to all those who lost their lives on that day to take up and \nimplement the commission's recommendations.\n  On that day, it was clear that much needed to be done to improve the \nsecurity of our homeland. The President and Congress responded in part \nby establishing the 9/11 Commission. This bipartisan commission did its \nwork thoroughly and well, devising 41 core recommendations to prevent, \ndefend against, and respond to the threat of future terrorist attacks. \nEach one of the recommendations was a vital part of the Commission's \ncharge to Congress and the President. Yet Americans have not just been \ngravely disappointed but also endangered by the failure to implement \nall of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. It is high time for \nthis failure to be rectified.\n  S. 4 expresses the sense of Congress that we must immediately work \ntoward passage of legislation that will, after far too long, implement \nthe solutions carefully crafted at our request. As the committee puts \ntogether a final detailed bill, S. 4 will serve as an important symbol \nof our priority for securing our Nation by implementing the \nrecommendations. We have made some improvements since 9/11, but we \nstill have so far to go.\n  America simply cannot wait any longer to fully protect our homeland. \nWhether it is improving communications between first responders, \nensuring that law enforcement shares information about threats, or \nsecuring our transportation systems, which I know my colleague from \nWashington has worked on, we have a whole lot to do. We cannot wait \nlonger for decisive action to stop weapons of mass destruction from \nfalling into the hands of terrorists entering our country or being \nbuilt by those who would destroy us. We cannot wait any longer to \nbetter combat the violent extremism that is growing around the globe.\n\n  This is only the beginning of the work that remains to be done. We \nhave heard so much talk about homeland security in the years and days \nsince 9/11, but in all this time we have seen far too little action. In \nthe 110th Congress, at last that shameful state of affairs must and \nwill come to an end.\n  In conclusion, the voters in November gave us great honor but \nhumbling responsibility. We must now rise to meet that responsibility \nby returning the focus of our work to the basic needs of American \nfamilies. Today is the first and important step toward meeting that \nresponsibility.\n  So as we start this new Congress, I look forward to working with our \nRepublican colleagues and the President to deliver these priorities for \nAmerican families. Those families deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am honored to be here with my \nDemocratic colleague today. I listened to the Senator from New York \ntalk about our top 10 priorities. Senator Reid, our new majority \nleader, and Senator Durbin before me talked about how we now in this \nnew majority are going to focus on the real issues affecting American \nfamilies. I congratulate Senators Reid, the new majority leader, and \nMcConnell, the Republican leader, for setting the right tone today by \nbringing us together this morning and reminding us all that we are here \ntogether to work on a very important agenda for the American people. We \nwill have our disagreements, our partisan battles, but at the end of \nthe day we have to move legislation forward because if there was any \nmessage to me out of the November election that brought us to the \nmajority now, it was that people want us to get past the partisan \nrancor on the floor of the Senate. They want us to get past the \nbickering. They expect debates, they like that, but at the end of the \nday they want us to move forward.\n  Across this country today, American families are struggling to send \ntheir kids to college, struggling to get health care, struggling with \ntheir pensions, struggling with their salaries, and they expect us, the \n100 leaders of the Senate, to be here together to solve those issues in \na way that moves them forward and gives promise and hope to the next \ngeneration.\n  Mr. President, that is what the top 10 priorities are that our new \nmajority leader set out for us today. They are bills that focus on \nbringing back hope and opportunity for the thousands of American \nfamilies that are hoping today that we have heard them and that we will \nrespond and work hard to make sure their lives are better.\n  I am pleased that we are beginning next week with ethics reform. I \nthink it is important to start with a strong message that we understand \nwe have a responsibility to uphold the honor of this Senate, not just \nfor today but for many years to come. I am very excited that within a \nfew weeks we will be talking about the minimum wage for the families \nout there who are struggling so hard to make sure they do the right \nthing for their kids and to send them a message that we understand and \nwe are going to do a little bit to help them.\n  Senator Schumer talked about the 9/11 Commission and implementing \ntheir report--something we should have done long ago. The security of \nthis Nation, people's fear about where we are, is a message that we all \nneed to understand. I am pleased that is part of the top 10 priorities \nof this new Congress. In dealing with the Medicare prescription drug \nplan, I have met with many seniors in my home State and they are \nconfused and frustrated. They are angry as they fall into the doughnut \nhole and realize that the promise we have given them of prescription \ndrugs is not meeting that expectation, and we have a responsibility to \ndo better. I hope that we can.\n  I heard Senator McConnell a short while ago say he didn't want us to \ntear apart the Medicare prescription drug plan. Nobody does. We want to \nmake it work. I hope we can work together in cooperation and make that \nhappen. Stem cell research: The Senator from Iowa will be speaking in a \nfew minutes. He has been a leader on that issue. It is about promise \nand hope for so many American families. I hope we can move it quickly \nthrough the Senate, through the House, and to the President's desk. If \nwe have to, I hope we have the votes to override. Far too many families \nstruggle today, and we should at least send them the promise of the \nfuture as generations before did for us. Energy independence is \ncritical in my State and across the Nation. It is something I hear \nabout everywhere I go.\n  Strengthening our military: Certainly, that is important today, as we \nknow we face terrorism across the globe, and we have exhausted our \nforces in Iraq. We have to make sure that we work together in a \nbipartisan manner to strengthen our military not just for today but for \nthose who come behind us.\n  Included in that for me is taking care of those who have served us, \nour veterans, keeping the promise we made to them when they served us \noverseas, that we will be there when they come home. We cannot tolerate \nthe long lines our men and women are in, the fact that they are coming \nhome and cannot get a job; that the unemployment rate for 18- to 24-\nyear-olds who served in Iraq and Afghanistan is three times the \nnational average. We have a lot of work to do there. I am pleased our \nleader has put out immigration. This is an issue the Senate has worked \nthrough. It is a tough one, but it is one that, if we work together, we \ncan move forward.\n\n  Many other issues are coming before us, but one I want to mention, in \nmy last few minutes, is the issue of education. That is the backbone of \nour country, it always has been: making\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\nsure young people today can grow up and know that if they choose, they \ncan go to college and it is affordable.\n  I am especially delighted that S. 7, one of the top 10 priorities, \naddresses the issue of college affordability. It is very disheartening \nto me to walk into a middle school today and have seventh and eighth \ngraders say to me: Why should I get good grades; I can't afford to go \nto college. That is not the message we should be sending. We should be \nsending the message to them that if they work hard and get good grades, \nthey will go to college.\n  We have to address that issue in the Senate. We all know the jobs of \nthe future depend on our young people today and whether they get the \neducation they need, and the money should not be a barrier.\n  I know this issue. Money was not a barrier for me when I was growing \nup. My father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when I was in high \nschool. There are seven kids in our family. We all thought the door had \nbeen shut to us and the ability to go to college. But not so because \nleaders in the Senate stood up before I ever knew about them and said \nwe need to have Pell grants and student loans and we need to make \ncollege affordable.\n  So all seven kids in my family--despite the fact my dad could no \nlonger work and was confined to a wheelchair, that my mom had to go on \nwelfare, she had to go back to school herself and raise seven kids--we \nwere able to go to college on Pell grants and student loans. All seven \nof us graduated and went on and one of us became a Senator.\n  We should not be shutting that door of hope to any young American \ntoday. No matter what happens to them personally, no matter what their \ncircumstances, no matter what State, city or community they grow up in, \nwe want them to know the United States of America and leaders in their \ncountry know it is important for them to get an education.\n  So as we move forward in this session of Congress, we are going to \nfocus on college affordability and making sure that the backbone of our \ncountry is strong once again.\n  We have much work ahead of us. We do need to work together. Mr. \nPresident, 51 to 49 in the Senate is very close, but we know that the \nissues in this country are extremely important and the families in this \ncountry are counting on us.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to achieve an \nagenda that sends that promise of hope once again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Washington \nfor a very eloquent and very profound statement. The message the \nSenator from Washington put forward on the Senate floor is one that all \nAmericans ought to hear. It is a message of hope and promise.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership in so many \nareas but especially in the area about which she spoke so eloquently--\nthe area of education. I had not known that about her family. It brings \nhome once again that in the America we love, anything should be \npossible for any child. No child should be deprived of the hopes and \ndreams of having an education and succeeding in life simply because \nthey were born poor or born on the wrong side of the tracks, so to \nspeak, or maybe the wrong color--whatever. Every child ought to have \nthat opportunity.\n  I thank the Senator for so eloquently putting it forward on the \nSenate floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S17-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17-S18]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to pick up a little bit from \nSenator Murray's remarks and talk about S. 5, the stem cell bill, that \nwas also introduced today by the majority leader, Senator Reid.\n  Stem cell research, when it is stripped of all of the phony arguments \nand rhetoric, is basically about hope. It is hope for people with Lou \nGehrig's disease. It is hope for people with spinal cord injuries, hope \nfor kids suffering from juvenile diabetes, hope for people with \nParkinson's disease.\n  In this Congress, we are going to bring those hopes one giant step \ncloser to reality. At long last, hopefully, we will lift the \nPresident's restrictions on stem cell research and finally give our \nNation's best scientists the tools they need to produce treatments and \ncures.\n  The bill we have introduced today, S. 5, the Stem Cell Research \nEnhancement Act of 2007, is the exact same bill that passed both Houses \nlast year with strong bipartisan support. The House passed the bill 238 \nto 194. The Senate passed it 63 to 37.\n  Regrettably, the President chose to exercise his first and only veto \nof his administration in vetoing this bill. And with his veto, the \nPresident ignored the will of the American people, he ignored scores of \nNobel laureates, he ignored top scientists at the National Institutes \nof Health, and with one stroke of his pen, he dashed the hopes of \nmillions of Americans suffering from diseases that could one day be \ncured or treated through stem cell research.\n  But now we are back, it is a new Congress, and the voices of hope are \nstronger than ever. In November, the American people elected many new \nMembers of Congress who support stem cell research and replaced many \nformer Members of Congress who opposed this research. As a result, we \nwill pass this bill again this year, and the margins of victory will be \neven wider.\n\n  Let me spend a moment reviewing what S. 5 would accomplish. More than \n5 years ago, the President announced in a speech that federally funded \nscientists could conduct research only on embryonic stem cell lines \nthat were derived prior to 9 p.m. on August 9, 2001. The President gave \nhis speech that evening, August 9, 2001. He said all of those stem cell \nlines derived before 9 p.m., that was OK, but if they were derived \nafter 9 p.m., they could not be funded with Federal funds. I never \nunderstood that. Why was it 9 p.m.? Why wasn't it 9:15 p.m. or maybe \n8:45, 9:13? Why was it 9 p.m.? At the beginning, one has to question \nthe logic of why 9 p.m. was the time barrier.\n  When the President announced his policy, he said that 78 stem cell \nlines were eligible for research. We now know that is not so. Only 21 \nare eligible, not nearly enough to reflect the genetic diversity of \nthis Nation.\n  What is more, every one of those lines, all 21 of those lines are \ncontaminated with mouse cells. They were grown on mouse cells, so they \nare all contaminated. So none of them will ever be used for any kind of \nhuman treatment.\n  Meanwhile, hundreds of new stem cell lines have been derived since \nthe President's arbitrary deadline. Many of these lines are \nuncontaminated, they are healthy, but they are totally off limits to \nfederally funded scientists.\n  That is really a shame because if we are serious about realizing the \npromise of stem cell research, our scientists need access to the best \nstem cell lines possible. We need a stem cell policy that offers true \nand meaningful hope. That is what S. 5 would provide.\n  Under this bill, federally funded researchers could study any stem \ncell line, regardless of the date it was derived, as long as certain \nstrong ethical guidelines are met. I point out, again, as I have in the \npast and I will continue to point out, that the ethical guidelines in \nS. 5 are stronger than the ethical guidelines under the existing \npolicy.\n  What are those guidelines?\n  One, no money can be exchanged. No one can ever be paid for donating \nembryos.\n  Second, these embryos can only be used for stem cell research and for \nnothing else.\n  And third, the donors have to give informed consent for them to be \nused.\n  The final point is most important. The only way a stem cell line \ncould be eligible for this federally funded research is if it were \nderived from an embryo that was otherwise going to be discarded. Let \nme, again, say what that means.\n  There are more than 400,000 embryos frozen in in vitro fertilization \nclinics all over the country--over 400,000. Right now, the only thing \nthat can happen to those is that they be discarded. They are thrown \naway every day. Every day embryos are discarded in in vitro \nfertilization clinics all over America. The donors have no other \nchoice.\n  Take friends of mine, a young couple. They couldn't have children. \nThey finally went to an IVF clinic. That\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\ndidn't work. They went to another one. Now she is pregnant, and they \nare going to have twins. They may have one or two more children--I \ndon't know--but there are going to be some of those embryos left over. \nRight now my friend's only choice is to have them discarded. That is \nher only choice. But as she said to me: I would love, after I have my \nchildren and my family, if there are embryos left over, I would love to \nbe able to donate them for stem cell research to help cure disease and \nto help people who are sick.\n  Right now she cannot do that. Neither she nor her husband can do \nthat. Our bill would allow them to have that option. No one is forced \nto do anything, but it would allow them to have that option.\n  I also, wish to point out again one of the misconceptions. These are \nembryos. They are blastocysts. They have about 100 cells. I always do \nthis: I put a dot on a piece of paper, hold it up and say: Can anybody \nsee that? That is what we are talking about. It is about the size of a \nperiod at the end of a sentence. There is a lot of misinformation about \nwhat we are talking about.\n  As I said before, Congress is going to pass this bill, that is \ncertain. Sadly, some are already predicting the President will veto it \nfor a second time. I hope they are wrong. I hope the President will \nrespect the will of the people and sign the stem cell research bill. \nBut if he does veto it, we will persist. We will use every legislative \nmeans at our disposal to make sure S. 5 is enacted into law, and it \nwill happen during this Congress.\n  My nephew Kelly is one of the millions of Americans whose hopes \ndepend on stem cell research. Kelly was in the Navy. He had a terrible \naccident on an aircraft carrier, and he has been basically a paraplegic \nnow for 28 years. But he has kept his hopes alive that our scientists \nwill be able to find a cure. Stem cell research offers the best hope \nfor people suffering from spinal cord injuries.\n\n  Now is the time to give them the hope, to lift the ban on stem cell \nresearch. As I said, we will do that in this Congress. It will be one \nof the first bills we pass. I hope the President will sign it and we \ncan move on. But if not, for Kelly and for so many millions of \nAmericans, we hope the long wait is almost over. I predict that hope \nwill prevail in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S18-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18-S19]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CESAR CHAVEZ\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President I will speak briefly. One of the things I am \ngoing to do today is join the distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator \nSalazar--in fact, I should note that this is the first time I have seen \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer in the chair. He looks as though he \nwas born to preside here, and he does it well. I am going to join him \nin introducing a bill to include Cesar Chavez among the names of the \ngreat civil rights leaders we honored in the title of last year's \nVoting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.\n  When we were considering this legislation in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Salazar made a compelling argument why that name, an \nAmerican hero's name, should be added to the bill: because he devoted \nand sacrificed his life to empower the most vulnerable in America, as \ndid Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King.\n  Cesar Chavez's name should be added to the law as an important \nrecognition of the broad landscape of political inclusion made possible \nby the Voting Rights Act. This bill would not alter the act's vital \nremedies to address continuing discrimination in voting, but rather it \nis overdue recognition of the importance of the Voting Rights Act to \nHispanic-Americans.\n  I offered Senator Salazar's amendment in the Judiciary Committee. The \nmoral weight of what he wanted to do was so compelling that in a \ncommittee often fractured, it passed unanimously. It was included. It \nwas not included in the final bill because as we were nearing the \nending time, we did not want to have to have the bill go back and forth \nto the other body again because we wanted to get it on the President's \ndesk in time. I committed to the distinguished Senator from Colorado \nthat I would join him again this year, and I say with virtual certainty \nthat the Senate Judiciary Committee will move very rapidly with that \nissue this year. I have the commitment of the new chairman backing that \nup, as does he have mine. And so I urge the Senate to quickly take up \nand pass this measure as we convene the new Congress and commit \nourselves once again to ensuring that the great promises of the 14th \nand 15th Amendments are kept for all Americans.\n\n\n                    Comprehensive Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. President, as this new Congress begins, we have a tremendous \nopportunity before us to enact fair, comprehensive immigration reform. \nIt is time for bipartisan action. So I join with Senators from both \nsides of the aisle to call for comprehensive immigration reform, and I \nwill work to enact it. We have to put aside the mean-spiritedness and \nshortsighted policies driven by fear and recognize the dignity of those \nwhose work contributes to reinvigorating America. Consistent with our \nheritage as a nation of immigrants, we need to bring people out of the \nshadows. My maternal grandparents were immigrants to this country. My \nwife's parents came as immigrants to this country. We are a nation of \nimmigrants. And those of us who are here now should not think that \nsomehow we got here differently, and that we should close the doors to \nthe rest. That is not the American way.\n  Through comprehensive immigration reform, we can increase the \nopportunities for American businesses to obtain the workers they need \nwhile ensuring that priority is given to willing workers already in \nthis country, from dairy farms in Vermont to multinational \ncorporations. We have been told of the plight of the American farmers \nfrom New York to California. We have seen the pictures of the piles of \nrotting fruit that have gone unharvested. We hear American technology \ncompanies lamenting lost opportunities and the loss of skilled \ninnovators to other countries. Dairy farmers are yearning for more \navailable legal workers in my own State of Vermont. But worse yet, \nothers have watched families in their employ be torn apart through \npiecemeal, inconsistent, sometimes heavyhanded enforcement efforts. I \nhave met some of those families. I have talked to people who were \nfifth, sixth, seventh generation Vermonters who say how unfair it is to \nsee these good families torn apart by seemingly arbitrary immigration \nenforcement efforts. No American farmer, no business, should be put in \nthe position of having to choose between obeying the law or losing \ntheir livelihood.\n  Where American workers can fill available jobs, of course they should \nbe given priority. But where these jobs are available but unclaimed by \nAmerican citizens, it makes no sense to deny willing foreign workers \nthe opportunity to work. We can strike a balance if we work together.\n  We must streamline and reform our visa system for low-skilled workers \nso we can help reduce the crippling backlogs that affect American \nbusinesses. And we must increase the number of low-skilled work visas \nissued each year to keep up with the needs of our economy. We should \nenact stronger, consistent employer verification procedures. We should \nimpose penalties for those employers who flout the law and exploit \nthose who have no voice. We can do this by working together and \nenacting comprehensive reform.\n  Through comprehensive and smart reforms we can increase our security. \nLet us work to focus enforcement efforts and protect our citizens from \nthose who seek to do us harm. Let us put an end to the enforcement \nconditions that end in too many needless deaths in the deserts of the \nSouthwest, families--spouses and children--who die needlessly trying to \nseek the promise of America. We also have to take a smart approach in \ndealing with the millions of people already here, one that does not \ndivide families and make instant criminals out of millions of people \nbut rather honors our Nation's best traditions. When we enact reforms \nto bring the millions of undocumented people of this country out of the \nshadows, greater accountability will follow. When we provide incentives \nfor undocumented people to enter a path to citizenship, we will \nencourage them to live up to our traditions of citizenship and civic \nresponsibility. When we endow those who seek to better their lives and\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\nthe lives of their families with the tools to do so legally, we help \ninstill in them a sense of belonging, of patriotism, of opportunity. \nThose who decry this aspect of immigration reform must carefully \nconsider the alternative path. By driving more people underground, we \nfoster a culture of lawlessness and mistrust.\n  We can't wall ourselves off from the world. A 700-mile fence on a \n2,000-mile border is not the answer. Last fall, the Republican Congress \nrushed through a bill to build 700 miles of fencing and did so against \nthe advice of the Department of Homeland Security. That fence bill was \nneither fair nor comprehensive. I share the disappointment of tens of \nmillions of Americans who had hoped President Bush would have exercised \nhis constitutional authority to veto that costly, cobbled-together and \nmean-spirited law. Instead, the President seemed to have abandoned his \nprinciples in signing the Secure Fence Act: legislation that will cost \nbetween $2 billion and $9 billion and fail to perform as advertised to \nseal our southern border. Scarring our southwestern landscape with a \nsymbol of fear, pandering, and intolerance offends the great heritage \nof our Nation by sending the wrong message to our neighbors and to the \nworld about American values. It was a pricey bumper sticker law passed \nto curry favor in certain quarters before the elections. Instead, by \nfocusing on technology, innovation, and personnel rather than partisan \npolitics and divisive walls, we can do a better job of securing our \nborder.\n\n  The President has said many times that in order for the United States \nto achieve real security, we must have comprehensive immigration reform \nwhich must include a realistic solution to bring out of the shadows the \nmillions of undocumented immigrants in this country and at the same \ntime meet the pressing needs of employers who are looking for willing \nworkers. In numerous statements, including a speech in Mission, TX, in \nAugust 2006, he recognized that without all components of comprehensive \nreform working together, immigration reform will not work.\n  So I will continue working to enact legislation to secure our borders \nand strengthen our economy and bring about a realistic solution for the \nmillions of people who want to work and live legally in our country. I \nwill continue to support fair and comprehensive immigration reform that \nwill respect the dignity of those who seek to join mainstream American \nsociety and better their lives in the United States. Let's hope that \ncommon sense and bipartisanship will prevail and that the promises of \nAmerica, those promises of America that encouraged my grandparents to \ncome to this country and my wife's parents to come to this country, are \nstill there. Let us not enact laws that are beneath the dignity of a \ngreat and noble and welcoming Nation. Let us pass legislation that \nreflects what is the best of America and reflects the America that is a \ndiverse country made up of people of diverse backgrounds. We will be \nstronger and better for it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Vermont leaves the \nfloor, let me commend him for his remarks and the passion he brings to \nthis subject which is based on his own personal experience but which \nreflects the experience, I believe, of the vast majority of Americans. \nI just want to tell him how much we all look forward to his leadership \non this and so many other issues.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, might I thank the distinguished senior \nSenator from Michigan. He and I have been dear friends for years and \nyears. I thank him for those words. I am also happy to see the gavel of \nthe Armed Services Committee go into his hands.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my dear friend from Vermont. I join him also in \ntelling the Senate just how pleased we are to see the Presiding Officer \nsitting where he is. We have worked together on many issues. We have \ntraveled together. His commitment to such critical issues as \nimmigration, environment, energy, and a number of other issues has made \na real difference. He is a very quick study and a quick learner, as \nnoted when we traveled together to Iraq and other countries. So he \nindeed fits the chair which he is sitting, and it is a pleasure to look \nat him as I address the Senate for a few minutes this afternoon.\n\n\n               REBUILDING AMERICA'S MILITARY ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. President, I join our majority leader, Senator Reid, in \nintroducing S. 8, the Rebuilding America's Military Act of 2007. Every \nMember of the Senate, every Democrat, every Republican, strongly \nsupports our men and women in uniform and is committed to providing \nthem with the training, equipment, and support they need and deserve. I \ncommend Senator Harry Reid for recognizing that much needs to be done \nin this regard and that we need to commit ourselves to doing what needs \nto be done.\n  As the situation in Iraq has grown steadily worse over the last 3 \nyears, our military commitments in that country have placed an \nincreasing strain on our Armed Forces. For example, delays in ordering \nbody armor and other protective equipment have left some of our troops \nvulnerable in combat. Failures to fully fund special replacement and \nrepair of equipment that has been damaged and destroyed in the course \nof ongoing operations endangers our troops. The decision to send our \nbest and most ready equipment to Iraq has left the military's \nnondeployed ground forces with a declining and dangerously low level of \nreadiness to meet their wartime missions. For example, at least two-\nthirds of the Army units in the United States are rated as not ready to \ndeploy. That is a totally unacceptable situation relative to the \nreadiness of our forces. The repeated deployments and a sustained high \noperational tempo have placed increasing strains on members of the \nArmed Forces and their families.\n  It is my hope that we will change course in Iraq for many reasons, \nbut one of them surely is that such a change will help address many of \nthe problems that I have identified here in these few minutes. Placing \nthe responsibility for the future of Iraq in the hands of the Iraqis \nand beginning a phased withdrawal of our troops from that country in \nthe next 4 to 6 months would be an important step toward turning \nresponsibility for the future of Iraq over to the Iraqis, but also a \ncritically needed step toward rebuilding our own military. We must act \nto ensure that our troops have the training, equipment, and support \nthey need to remain the strongest and best military force in the world.\n  Senator Reid's S. 8, Senate bill 8, the Rebuilding America's Military \nAct of 2007, commits us to taking such action. I am confident that we \ncan do so on a bipartisan basis, and I look forward to proceeding in \nthat manner as the weeks and months unfold.\n  I again thank the Chair. I again commend him for the way in which he \nhas proceeded as a Senator in so many ways and for his friendship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. CRAIG pertaining to the introduction of S.J. Res. \n1 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask each side, the Democratic and \nRepublican sides, be given an additional 10 minutes to speak in this \nperiod. I will take the first 5 minutes of that, and then my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Boxer, will take the second 5 minutes of the \nDemocratic time remaining for us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S19-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19-S21]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NATIONAL ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT SECURITY ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 6, which is \nthe National Energy and Environment Security Act of 2007. This is a \nmessage bill that Senator Reid introduced earlier today. It lays out a \nnumber of important goals that will guide our thinking and action on \nenergy-related matters, including the issue of global warming, in the \n110th Congress.\n  Let me talk briefly about five key goals that are mentioned in the \nbill. These goals will be subject to much more detailed discussion in \nfuture weeks and to action both in the Energy Committee and, for some \nissues, in the Environment Committee as well.\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\n  The first goal of the bill is to reduce our dependence on foreign and \nun-\nsustainable energy sources. Any national energy strategy to reduce that \ndependence will have to maintain our domestic production of oil and gas \nas well as undertake three basic initiatives. The first of those \ninitiatives is to greatly increase the efficiency of the cars and \ntrucks that we put on the road in this country. There are a lot of \nideas on how to do this. They include several proposals for increased \nCAFE standards as well as so-called ``feebate'' standards that send \nsignals to the market to encourage the production and sale of high \nefficiency vehicles. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to try to move these proposals forward.\n  Another way to reduce our dependence is to further develop \nalternative fuels, particularly biofuels. In that regard we need to \nfocus on broadening the base of biological feedstocks that are used to \nmake fuels such as ethanol. This is an issue we will be focusing on in \nthe Energy Committee.\n  A third way is to look at the other new technologies to power our \ncars and our trucks. There is much promise in hybrid vehicles with \nlarger batteries that can be charged overnight, so-called plug-in \nhybrids. This sort of technology can help reduce demand for gasoline \nfor short trips and deserves further attention.\n  The second goal in the bill is to reduce our exposure to the risks of \nglobal warming. While there are several Senate committees with great \ninterest in this issue, obviously the Environment Committee has a \nprimary role and the primary jurisdiction. But over 95 percent of the \nU.S. carbon dioxide emissions and nearly 85 percent of all U.S. \ngreenhouse gas emissions come from energy production, distribution, and \nuse. We want to work with other committees to find the best way to deal \nwith this important issue and to balance environmental imperatives with \nthe need for reliable and affordable energy into the future.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S20, January 4, 2007, the following appears: Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read Environment \nCommittee.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The third goal in the bill is to diversify and expand our use of \nsecure, efficient, and environmentally friendly energy supplies and \ntechnologies. Efficiency is a key element in our energy policy. It \ndeserves more attention in this Congress than we have been able to give \nit before. There are outstanding opportunities to reduce the demands of \nour future energy system by being more efficient and effective in the \nways we distribute and use energy.\n  As one example, most incandescent light bulbs are only 5 percent \nefficient, so they waste 95 percent of the energy that goes into them. \nFluorescent lighting is only 20 percent efficient. There is no \nfundamental scientific reason why lighting has to waste so much energy. \nNew technologies are on the horizon that could reach close to 100 \npercent efficiency. Even if we were to make all lighting in the United \nStates just 50 percent efficient, we would eliminate the need for the \nequivalent of 70 1000-megawatt nuclear power plants. Examples like this \npresent a compelling case for pushing energy efficiency, and I expect \nthat we will have a strong focus on these opportunities in this \nCongress.\n  A fourth goal of the bill is to reduce the burdens on consumers of \nrising energy prices. We need to make sure that programs such as the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program are fully funded and targeted \nat low-\nincome and working families.\n  The fifth goal in the bill is to eliminate unnecessary tax giveaways \nand prevent energy price gouging and manipulation. We need to take a \nbroad look at the incentives we have in place for energy production on \nboth the tax side and the royalty side, to ensure that we have the most \neffective mix of incentives going forward. We are all agreed that those \nare issues that need attention.\n  The United States has one of the most favorable set of fiscal \npolicies for production of oil and gas in the world today. Some of \nthose fiscal incentives may be redundant at the price levels we are \ncurrently seeing. There are big problems in the royalty system being \nmanaged by the Department of the Interior, with some companies getting \nroyalty treatment that Congress never intended them to receive. We will \nbe looking at these issues closely in this new Congress. We will be \nexamining how to rebalance the system, both from the perspective of \nhaving fair and effective royalty and tax policies for oil and gas and \nfrom the perspective of having effective tax and other incentives to \npromote other forms of energy, such as production of electricity from \nwind solar, geothermal, and renewable sources.\n  All of this is a tall order for Congress. I predict instead of seeing \njust one big energy bill, we will be addressing these issues through \nmultiple bills that move through the Senate as issues and proposals for \naddressing these issues become ripe for action. In the Senate we will \nnot make much progress on energy or environment unless we can develop a \nstrong bipartisan approach on the issues. The Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources has a strong tradition of bipartisan accomplishment \nthat I plan on continuing in this new Congress. I look forward to \nworking with my colleague, Senator Pete Domenici, and all members of \nthe committee as we forge an effective path forward to promote our \nenergy and energy-related environmental security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is wonderful to see you sitting there \nand to tell you, as I know you will be very pleased with this news, \nthat S. 6, which has been introduced by Leader Reid, is called the \nNational Energy and Environmental Security Act of 2007. That means \nSenator Reid is sending a signal to all of us here, both sides of the \naisle, that we are going to put the environmental issue back front and \ncenter and we are going to put the energy issue front and center and we \nare going to do everything we can do to become energy independent and \nto preserve this planet for future generations.\n  This is a very emotional day for me in a very good way because I am \nassuming the Chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which \nis a dream come true for me. Since I started my career, the environment \nhas always been one of my signature issues. In California it is a \nbipartisan signature issue. We all work together, Republicans and \nDemocrats and Independents, because we understand that the health of \nour planet and the health of our families is very important. America \nhas always taken the lead. Somehow, recently, we have lost our way.\n  Oftentimes when I speak about the environment, people are stunned to \nsee that, indeed, Republican Presidents have taken the lead on the \nenvironment. Dwight Eisenhower set aside the area that is now part of \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and said we should not destroy this \nbeautiful part of the world. Richard Nixon created the Environmental \nProtection Agency, and then you look at Jimmy Carter who I believe \ncreated Superfund. Presidents of both parties worked with Congress to \nwrite the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act--it has been, I \nthink, a backpedaling of environmental laws and regulations that has \nundermined the bipartisan issue of the environment.\n  I have three goals for this committee. No. 1 is to protect this \nplanet. I think that is our moral obligation. I view it as a spiritual \nobligation. No. 2 is to protect the health of our families, the health \nof our children. I view that as a moral obligation and a spiritual \nobligation. My third goal for the committee is to bring back \nbipartisanship. We have had, in this great committee, great leaders \nfrom both parties. Already I have begun reaching out to Republican \nfriends. Of course we know there will be disagreements. But I can tell \nyou, and I want to reassure the American people, that we are working \ntogether. Today I had an open house at the committee room and in walked \nmy Democratic colleagues and my Republican colleagues. My former \nchairman, James Inhofe, was the first Senator to come by and we had a \nseries of Senators come by--Senator Isakson, Senator Obama, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Alexander, Senator Vitter, and Senator Warner. It \nwas a wonderful experience for me to sit there and see that in fact we \nare getting off on the right foot.\n  I cannot tell you how good I feel about S. 6 because it lays down a \nmarker and it says we have to do something about energy efficiency and \nwe have to do something about global warming. If\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\nwe do not act on global warming, our children and our grandchildren \nwill wonder why we walked away from them. How could we have walked away \nfrom them? We do not want to walk away from them. I don't know any \nMember of this Senate who would knowingly walk away from their future \nfamily. Scientists are telling us we need to take action soon in order \nto avoid dangerous global warming. If we fail to act, we could reach \nthe tipping point with irreversible consequences.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, today I believe we \nhave no choice but to act to slow global warming. We should look at our \nactions as an insurance policy. Yes, scientists will disagree. Some \nwill say horrific things will happen. Some will say bad things will \nhappen. I don't know of any respected scientist who thinks nothing will \nhappen. But for bad things or horrific things, we need an insurance \npolicy. We need to be conservative. We need to do the most we can do so \nwe protect those future generations so when they look back at us, they \nwill say: They stepped up and did the right thing.\n  It is hard to persuade people to act when the consequences of \ninaction lie down the road. But we are smart enough, we are wise enough \nto do something about global warming.\n  Here is the good news. Whatever we do about global warming, to reduce \ngreenhouse gases, has a beneficial effect on our society. That is why \nit is something I think we can wrap our arms around. When we do \nsomething for energy efficiency, to cut back on the carbon dioxide, \nwhat does it mean? It means we save money in our pockets, if we drive \nfuel-efficient automobiles, alternative fuel vehicles, hybrid vehicles, \ncellulosic fuel vehicles. It helps us keep money in our pockets. It \nsays we don't have to rely on foreign countries. So that makes eminent \ngood sense. It means we will be developing technologies that we can \nexport to the rest of the world.\n  Today, as the incoming Chair of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I am embarrassed to say to the people of the United States \nthat of the 56 emitters of greenhouse gases in the order of what they \nhave done to help solve the problem, we are 53 out of 56. Only a few \ncountries have done less than we have done and those countries are \nChina, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia. I am embarrassed to stand here and \nsay that to the American people, but I must speak the truth to the \nAmerican people. We are the No. 1 emitter of greenhouse gases and we \nare 53rd out of 56 countries in doing something about it.\n  All this is going to change. I think it is going to change because \nthe people want us to change. The people want us to lead.\n  I look around and see, for example, Wal-Mart--Wal-Mart, with whom I \nhave disagreed on so many labor issues I can't even start to tell you \nthe story about that, but here is what they are doing. They want to \nsell millions and millions of energy-efficient lightbulbs. These \nlightbulbs will save so much energy, these lightbulbs will save the \nconsumer so much money, and I am very pleased to see that business is \nstepping up to the plate.\n  I am also pleased to see the State of California passing landmark \nlegislation to fight global warming--my State--and doing it on such a \nbipartisan basis. This is very exciting for me.\n\n  We have a great bill that will be introduced by the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Sanders. That will be the same bill written by former \nSenator Jeffords, a great leader on the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, before retirement. I have to try to fill his shoes. This \ngreat bill is modeled after the California bill and will tackle this \nissue in a way which will be good for the environment, good for the \nhealth of our families, good for foreign policy, and good for the \nexport of new technologies, meaning more jobs here. We can do this. We \ncan reduce costs for consumers, for businesses.\n  Energy efficiency is the name of the game. It is the easiest way to \nget more energy.\n  Everyone who knows me knows I want to pass the greatest bill in the \nhistory of mankind to fight global warming. Everyone knows I want to do \nthat. Everyone knows I want us to go as far as we can go. I am an \nidealist when it comes to this, but I am also a pragmatist. So we will \nwork our colleagues in the Senate, both sides of the aisle, \nRepublicans, Independents, and Democrats. We will open the committee to \nall the Senators. We will listen to their ideas. We will listen to \ntheir views. We will take the best of those ideas, we will sit down, \nand we will work hard and get a bill. That day will come in the near \nfuture. At that time, the faith the people have placed in Congress, \nonce again, that faith will be restored. Some of it was lost because in \nmany ways we took our eye off of what we had to do.\n  When people ask me, What is it like in the Congress, what do you like \nto do in the Congress, I say, Let's face it, the easiest thing is to do \nnothing. When you do something, somebody gets nervous about it, but \nwhen we have an issue such as global warming, which is a national \nsecurity threat--and the Pentagon has told us it is a national security \nthreat because if waters rise and there are refugees all over the \nworld, the instability that will follow will be absolutely enormous; it \nwill create a trend. There are predictions that if we have bad global \nwarming, we will have weather extremes with droughts and floods and all \nthe problems we have been getting a little look at through the lens of \nthe last couple of years.\n  Fate has thrown us together, I say to my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle. You never know when you will be born or whom you will come \nto know. I have gotten to know the Senator presiding. I am fortunate to \nhave friends on both sides of the aisle. I am fortunate to have the \nState that has as its core value protecting God's green Earth and this \nplanet. I am going to bring all that enthusiasm to the committee. I am \ngoing to be patient. We are going to listen. We are going to write a \nbill and bring it here.\n  I say to Majority Leader Reid, it means so much to me to have as one \nof the top bills a bill that uses the word ``environment'' in the \ntitle. I cannot state how long I have been waiting for that. We have it \nin S. 6. It is called the National Energy and Environment Security Act \nof 2007. It is an apt name because when we take care of the \nenvironment, we are taking care of our own security and the health of \nour families.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today we start the 110th Congress of the \nUnited States. We embark on a 2-year journey to submit, consider, \ndebate, improve, and eventually pass legislation on behalf of the \ngreater good of our constituents and the American people. Accordingly, \nI have here today a package of legislative proposals which I believe \nwill benefit Colorado and the country. This package is the first \nchapter of what I hope becomes a legislative agenda for Colorado and \nthe Nation. These 15 bills address matters from healthcare to housing, \nland usage to veterans, and Homeland Security to drug trafficking \nprevention.\n  These bills are:\n  The Methamphetamine Trafficking Enforcement Act of 2007;\n  the Medicare Cost Contract Extension and Refinement Act of 2007;\n  the Mark-to-Market Extension Act of 2007;\n  the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium Expansion Act of 2007;\n  the National Trails System Willing Seller Act of 2007;\n  the Pikes Peak Regional Veteran's Cemetery Act of 2007;\n  the Pinon Canyon Expansion Citizen's Input Act of 2007;\n  the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act;\n  the Increase Computer Efficiency Study Act of 2007;\n  the Mesa Verde National Park Boundary Expansion Act of 2007;\n  the Baca National Wildlife Refuge Purpose Act;\n  the Cache la Poudre River National Heritage Area Technical Amendments \nAct of 2007;\n  the Satellite and Cable Access Act of 2007;\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\n  the Granada Relocation Center National Historic Site Act of 2007;\n  and a Ronald Reagan U.S. Capitol Artistic Tribute Resolution.\n  Mr. President, this agenda of 15 bills represents many hours of work \nwith Colorado citizens, officials, interested parties, and \nstakeholders. It is a set of fairly controversy-free proposals that \nwill solve problems and offer solutions.\n  I intend to return to this floor with a second round of legislative \nproposals, proposals that I am now working on with colleagues, State \nofficials, and Colorado stakeholders. Other measures I plan to address \nthis session include Good Samaritan mine cleanups, bark beetle \neradication legislation, Rocky Mt. National Park Wilderness, National \nID theft/Social Security number protection, renewable energy tax \ncredits, reverse mortgages, the need for public health veterinarians, \noil shale royalties, and manufactured housing reform.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on getting these bills \nthrough the legislative process and being able to tell Coloradans that \nwe in Washington are engaged on their behalf.\n  (The remarks of Mr. ALLARD pertaining to the submission of S.

Mr. President, first let me congratulate the Presiding \nOfficer for having assumed that position today for the first time. This \nSenator has a long-time admiration for the Senator from Illinois, for \nthe great work he has done, and for his contributions to this body.\n  Let me also say that I come here today to congratulate both our \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, for his leadership, and Senator \nMcConnell for his leadership as the minority leader, and for them \nhaving brought the Members of this body together to start a new \nbeginning, which is based on a sense that we as America will do better \nby working together, and that the politics of division of the past are \npolitics that we will be able to transcend and move forward with a \npositive and strong agenda that will make our country and the world a \nstronger and safer place.\n  I also congratulate Senator Reid and the leadership for the 10 bills \nintroduced here today. I believe those bills create a good framework \nfor issues that urgently need to be addressed by the Congress and by \nthis President. I am hopeful that in the days and weeks and months \nahead we will, in fact, be the kind of Senate and Congress that gets \nresults on these important initiatives.\n  I don't want to comment on all 10 pieces of legislation today, but I \nwill make reference to a couple of them. First, with respect to energy, \nI think all of us in this body recognize that it is time for us to \nembrace a true ethic of energy independence. For a long time, we have \ngiven rhetoric to the issue of energy and our overdependence on oil \nfrom the Middle East and other places. I think today Republicans and \nDemocrats, conservatives and progressives, have come together to say we \nknow what the answer is to this. It is not as difficult as other areas \nwe have to deal with, such as health care. The national renewable \nenergy lab in my home State will tell us all if we put our minds \ntogether, we can produce 30 to 40 percent of our energy from renewable \nenergy sources. We can use the new technologies that are out there to \nget to energy independence.\n  The only thing lacking, really, has been the will of the leadership \nof America to move forward to get us to that energy independence. In my \nview, it is important that we do so, first, because our national \nsecurity is dependent upon our being energy independent. We ought not \nto be in a position where the national sovereignty and security of this \nNation is held hostage to the whims of the Middle East and those who \nhappen to have oil wealth under their sands.\n  Secondly, it is important for the economic security of our country \nthat we move forward with energy independence. As we move forward, we \nwill find economic opportunity, including economic opportunity for \nrural America, to help us grow our way to energy independence.\n  Finally, we will be able to deal with the environmental security \nissues that are very much at stake in this energy debate.\n  I want to comment on the importance of education and the College \nAffordability Act, which has been presented today by Senator Reid. For \nmany of us who know the promise of America, we know that promise of \nAmerica has come about through the educational opportunities we \nreceive. For many of us in this Chamber, including Senator Murray, who \nspoke a few minutes ago--she talked about the promise of America \ndelivered through the educational opportunities which she had. Even \nthough she was one of seven children and had a father who had multiple \nsclerosis, she achieved the highest level of the American dream because \nthat educational opportunity was given to her. I and others have gone \nthrough similar circumstances. In my own case, in Colorado, my father \nand mother never had an opportunity to get a college degree. We were \npoor, raised in a place that didn't have electricity and a telephone. \nYet the promise of America and the promise of education was something \nthat was constantly talked about to us by our parents. I often remember \nmy father going around the table at our ranch and making sure all eight \nof his children were doing their homework because he knew that \neducation would allow them to seek horizons and get to places he had \nnot been able to reach. Over time, all eight of his children became \nfirst-generation college graduates.\n  Today, I stand here as a Senator from that family, born in that \nplace. Without education, I would not be here, and those in my family \nwould not have had the opportunities they have had. It has been the \nleaders in the Senate, including people such as former Senator \nClaiborne Pell from Rhode Island, who stood for the proposition that \nthat educational opportunity should be afforded to all Americans, no \nmatter what your background, no matter your economic condition; that \nyou should be allowed to have an educational opportunity in America, \nbecause there was a recognition that with educational opportunity, \nanything is possible for a child in America.\n  So that piece of legislation Senator Reid introduced today is \nsomething I hope we can embrace electively as a Senate moving forward \nin a comprehensive way.\n  Finally, let me make a quick remark on the issue of immigration \nreform. We spent a lot of time on immigration here in the Senate. A few \nmonths ago, we were successful in passing a bipartisan compromise to \nmove forward. I am hopeful that as we look at the months ahead, we will \nbe able to work with President Bush and our Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues to fashion a comprehensive immigration reform package that \nwill deliver an effective immigration law for our country.\n  In my view, that immigration reform package has to have three \nprinciples at its center. First, we have to secure our borders. I \nbelieve the legislation introduced today will, in fact, help us make \nsure our borders are secure. We as a sovereign Nation have to make sure \nwe are securing our borders.\n  Secondly, we need to enforce our laws within our country. For far too \nlong we have looked the other way and the laws of immigration in our \ncountry simply have not been enforced. The measure we passed last year \nput together the pieces to allow us to enforce our immigration laws.\n  Finally, from both a human and a moral and economic perspective, we \nneed to find ways of bringing the 12\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\nmillion people who now live in the shadows of America out into the \nsunlight of America. Those people are here working today, as they have \nbeen for many years. Their reality has in fact been recognized but \nsomehow ignored. We need to find a way to make sure that we bring those \npeople from the shadows into the sunlight, and the only way we will be \nable to do that is with a comprehensive immigration reform package that \nwe pushed forward last year and, hopefully, we will have another \nopportunity to push forward in the manner of the bill introduced today \nby Senator Reid.\n  I very much look forward to working with my colleagues, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, in this body as we address the major issues \nfacing our Nation and our world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a couple of concerns here. One is a \ndriving concern. After having served on the House Armed Services \nCommittee before and for the last 12 years on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I am deeply distressed that we did not get our MilCon \nAppropriations bill passed. I don't think a lot of people realize how \nsignificant it is that we get it passed for this fiscal year, 2007.\n  The partisan issues that some people are trying to tie up on the \nfloor are nowhere near as important as this issue, and I am talking \nabout some of the other bills. It is true that we need to have the DC \nappropriations bill, but it is not life-threatening and certainly not \ngoing to result in the loss of lives of our fighting troops. Labor-HHS \nis important but not as important as this bill. Commerce-State-\nJustice--a lot of those items can be put into a CR. I would have no \nproblem with a continuing resolution. But as far as this bill is \nconcerned, if we don't do it now, there are a lot of items in \nconjunction with our BRAC process that are not going to happen and have \nto happen and are life-threatening to our troops.\n  I compliment Senator Hutchison, who was chairman of the Subcommittee \non Military Construction. She tried so hard in the last 2 days of the \nlast session to get this bill through. Quite frankly, it wasn't really \na problem in the Senate as much as it was in the other body. We tried \nvery hard. We talked with a number of people and were unable to get \nthat bill done.\n  Over the past few years, the military has sought to reshape itself \nout of a Cold War footing into a modern, more modular force. It has \ntried to reconstitute its equipment, while at the same time fighting a \nwar in Iraq and Afghanistan. It has been forced to come to Congress for \nsupplementals to meet just the bare minimum requirements of fighting \nthe war and rebuilding the military as is so necessary.\n  So we have stretched them every way we can. We have cut into almost \nevery program, essential initiatives such as the Future Combat System. \nThat is a recognition, after the 1990s, when we let our modernization \nslide and a lot of our military needs, to bring us up so that when we \nsend our kids into battle, we send them with the very best of \nequipment. If we look at some of our ground equipment, such as our \nartillery pieces, it is World War II technology. It is the old Paladin \nwhere they actually have to swab the breech after every shot.\n  The Future Combat System came up, and there was a recognition that we \nshould have an army, a ground force that is faster, more agile, more \ntransportable, more modern than it is today. Every week that goes by \nthat we don't get this done, it is causing the Future Combat System--\nthere are about 19 elements of it--to move to the right and delay this \nfrom taking place.\n  The fiscal year 2007 Military Construction appropriations bill was \nnot passed into law. The continuing resolution, as currently enacted, \ndoes not allow the Department of Defense to proceed with over $17 \nbillion in new construction and BRAC projects authorized by Congress in \nthe 2007 authorization bill.\n  Let me mention what will happen if we don't do this. There are so \nmany things having to do with the BRAC process. I opposed the last BRAC \nround. We went ahead and had it, and I think that is probably the last \nwe will have for a long period of time. It has a deadline of 2011. If \nwe don't get this bill passed--by the way, I have introduced S. 113. We \nhave a number of cosponsors. Most of the Republican members of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee are on it.\n  The 1st Armored Division will have to stay in Germany if we don't get \nthis passed. If that happens, we are not going to be able to have the \ntwo modular combat brigade teams we so critically need on the front \nlines. We are talking about the war that is taking place right now and \nwhy we need to get this MILCON appropriations bill passed.\n  The Army National Guard and Reserve lack $1.1 billion to construct \nand replace aviation support facilities. They cannot function without \nthese facilities. The postponement of construction of 250 new homes at \nthe naval base in Guam and the Marine Corps logistics base in Barstow, \nCA, are just some of the housing needs that will not be able to be \ncontinued. Of course, they will cost more money the longer we put them \noff.\n  We opened up some serious shortfalls in our UHF--that is, ultra high \nfrequency--satellite communications capabilities. Two of the $6.5 \nmillion mobile user objective systems ground control tracking stations \nwere slated for Hawaii and Sigonella, Italy. Without the stations, the \nalready-funded satellites--we have the satellites ready to go--cannot \nlaunch until we get this bill passed.\n  We went through months of agonizing discomfort in deciding what are \nwe going to do with the F-22, C-17, C-5, C-9, and C-40 in terms of the \nnew locations. That has all been determined. It has been outlined in \nBRAC, but we can't do it until we have the hangars to take care of \nthem, to get them into the new areas.\n  What we are talking about are items that directly affect the \nwarfighting effort. The Predator, for example, has the tactical air \ncontrol program that should be supporting the Army brigade combat \nteams.\n  I think we all know our ground forces have to have support, either \nclose air support or artillery support on the ground. We can't do the \nclose air support if we don't have the appropriations bill passed.\n\n  The Predator mission--a lot of people are not aware of this; they \nthink of it as being intelligence-gathering agencies and a \ncommunications system targeting and retargeting on the ground. While \nthat is very important and it has to be done, a lot of people don't \nrealize the Predator also has the capability of firing a rocket. So we \nneed to have that program. We cannot have it unless we get this bill \npassed.\n  The military is going to lose a lot if we don't get this bill passed. \nWhen we look at the military construction that is going on in the \ncontinental United States and we see the community support--in my State \nof Oklahoma, we have five major military installations. They are \nlocated near major cities. Vance Air Force Base is at Enid, OK. Then we \nhave Altus, Lawton, McAlester, Oklahoma City, and Midwest City. We have \nalways done well in our BRAC process because we have greater community \nsupport than most other installations. But when you have a community \nthat has made a commitment toward MILCON predicated on the assumption \nthat we are going to pass our Military Construction appropriations bill \nand then we don't do it, they could very well renege on their \ncommitment for housing, hospitalization, and childcare. It is far more \nsignificant than most people realize. If we don't pass the needed \nfunding, the results will be very serious.\n  I have in front of me a letter signed by Army Secretary Harvey and \nGeneral Schoomaker:\n\n       The potential negative effects on operational readiness \n     cannot be overemphasized; the Army's ability to prosecute the \n     Global War on Terrorism and to prepare for future conflicts \n     would be severely hampered.\n\n  Another letter from Navy Secretary Donald Winter and Marine Corps \nCommandant GEN James T. Conway and ADM Michael G. Mullen:\n\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\n\n       The lack of construction money ``is precluding our ability \n     to provide modern, government owned or privatized quality \n     housing to our Sailors, Marines and their families at a time \n     when the Global War on Terror is placing enormous stress on \n     our military and our military families.''\n\n  I am going to be looking for every opportunity to get this bill up \nfor consideration. Again, I am concerned about all appropriations \nbills, and a continuing resolution, as far as I am concerned, at least \nis going to take care of those needs. But the one thing it cannot do is \ntake care of the military construction needs we will have to address.\n  That bill is S. 113. I look forward to it coming up for \nconsideration. We already have, as I mentioned, most members of the \nArmed Services Committee cosponsoring this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S24-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S24-S25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              POLAR BEARS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I do not see anyone else in the Chamber \nright now. I wish to speak on a totally different subject.\n  Up until I guess today, turnover day, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nI have chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee for 4 years. \nI have enjoyed that very much. I will be turning that over now to \nSenator Barbara Boxer. We will still be working very closely together.\n  One thing that happened a few days ago that I think is worth getting \non the record and talking about a little bit, because this is something \nwhich is going to come up in our discussions in that committee, is, as \nyou probably noticed, Mr. President, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nrecently took some action to begin formal consideration of whether to \nlist the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Over the next year, they are going to be working on this \nissue, making a determination as to whether the listing should take \nplace. So right now we are starting that 1-year period.\n  The question the Service has to answer is this: Is there clear \nscientific evidence that the current worldwide polar bear population is \nin trouble and facing possible extinction in the foreseeable future? As \nthe Service reviews the issue over the next year, I am confident they \nwill conclude, as I have, that listing the polar bear is unwarranted at \nthis time.\n  In the proposal, the Fish and Wildlife Service acknowledges that for \n7 of the 19 worldwide polar bear populations--this is very significant. \nThere are 19 populations worldwide for the polar bear. For seven of \nthose populations, the Service has no population trend data of any \nkind. For more than a third of the known populations out there, we \ndon't have any information. The other data suggests that for an \nadditional five polar bear populations, the number of bears is not \ndeclining but is stable. Two more of the bear populations showed a \nreduced number in the past due to overhunting, but these two \npopulations are now increasing because of new hunting restrictions.\n  Other sources of data mentioned in a recent Wall Street Journal \npiece--just this past Tuesday--suggest that ``there are more polar \nbears in the world now than there were 40 years ago.'' I have to say \nthere are quite a few more, almost twice the number from 40 years ago.\n  The Service estimates that the polar bear population is 20,000 to \n25,000 bears, whereas in the fifties and sixties, the estimates were as \nlow as 5,000 to 10,000 bears, and most of that was due to sport hunting \nat that time, and most of that has been banned.\n  A 2002 U.S. Geological Survey study of wildlife in the Arctic Refuge \nCoastal Plain noted that the polar bear populations ``may now be near \nhistoric highs.''\n  So if the number of polar bears does not appear to be in decline, \nthen why are we considering listing the species as threatened? Because \nthe Endangered Species Act is broken. It needs to be fixed. We tried to \nfix it for the past 4 years. We have been unable to reach a consensus.\n  The ESA allows the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the entire range \nof polar bears as threatened and thereby extend a wide array of \nregulatory restrictions to them and their habitat despite the dearth of \ndata and a lack of scientific evidence that polar bears are, indeed, in \ntrouble.\n  The law also allows for the Fish and Wildlife Service to justify its \nproposal on a sample from a single population in western Hudson Bay in \nCanada where the populations have decreased by 259 polar bears in the \nlast 17 years. Stop and think about this. This is the western Hudson \nBay in Canada, 1 of 19 sites. This is the one which is the most severe.\n  The population has decreased by 259 polar bears in the last 17 years; \nhowever, the figures that the International Union of Conservation of \nNature and Natural Resources says that 234 bears have been killed in \nthe last 5 years alone. If you figure that 234 have been killed in the \nlast 5 years, the total in the last 17 years is 259, you have to assume \nthat more than the 259 were actually shot. Ironically, Canada now is \nliberalizing a lot of their hunting in that area, and it is going to \nallow more hunting. This is something they need to address.\n  At this point, I would like to say that while I support hunting as a \ngeneral matter, we need to fully understand its impact on the polar \nbear population before we blame global warming for changes in bear \npopulation. I already said we can document pretty well--scientifically \nit is documented--that the number of bears has actually increased \nexcept in areas where hunting is more prevalent.\n  I think there are a lot of people who want to somehow insert global \nwarming as a crisis in everything and use polar bears for that reason, \nand we are not going to let that take place.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service asserts that the reason for the decline \nin the western Hudson Bay population is climate change-induced ice \nmelting. To make that assertion, they rely on hypothetical climate \nchange computer models showing massive loss of ice and irreparable \ndamages in the polar bear's habitat. The Service then extrapolates that \nreasoning to the other 18 populations of polar bears. There are 19 \npopulations, 1 of them is in trouble, but they use that as the model, \nand they take that and apply that same extrapolation to the other 18 \npopulations of polar bears, making the assumption all bears in these \npopulations will eventually decline and go extinct.\n  Again, this conclusion is not based on field data but hypothetical \nmodeling, and that is considered perfectly acceptable scientific \nevidence under the Endangered Species Act.\n  That is why it should be changed. I don't believe our Federal \nconservation policy should be dictated by hypothetical computer \nprojections because the stakes of listing a decision under ESA could be \nextremely high. The listing of the polar bear is no exception. The ESA \nis the most effective Federal tool to usurp local land use control and \nundermine private property rights. As landowners and businesses have \nknown for decades, when you want to stop a development project or just \nabout any other activity, find a species on that land to protect and \nthings will slow down and many times they stop. It could be the bearing \nbeetle, the Arkansas shiner, and now it could be the polar bear. This \nis because section 7 of the ESA requires that any project that involves \nthe Federal Government in any way must meet the approval of the Fish \nand Wildlife Service before the project can move forward. The Federal \nGovernment's involvement in the project can take the form of a Federal \ngrant, an environmental permit, a grazing allotment, a pesticide \nregistration or land development permit or a number of other documents. \nThe law requires that Fish and Wildlife intervene and determine if the \nproject may affect an endangered or threatened species.\n  So in the case of the polar bear listing, oil and gas exploration in \nAlaska, which accounts for 85 percent of the State's revenue and 25 \npercent of the Nation's domestic oil production, is immediately called \ninto question. Likewise, the State's shipping, highway construction or \nfishing activities will also be subject to Federal scrutiny under \nsection 7.\n  Furthermore, because the Fish and Wildlife Service has linked the \nicefloe habitat concerns of polar bears to global climate change, all \nkinds of projects around the country could be challenged. Some would \nsay this isn't possible or that I am exaggerating. But if\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\nyou take the ESA to its logical conclusion, which is certain to be done \nby environmental special interest groups, any activity that allegedly \naffects climate change or greenhouse gas emissions, they have to be \nevaluated and approved by Fish and Wildlife for its effect on the \nicefloes on which polar bears depend. Thus, this proposal could be the \nultimate assault on local land use decisionmaking and suppression of \nprivate property rights to date.\n  So it is important that we take the next year to gather information, \nto make sure it is logical science, and that our decisions are science \nbased. Again, the Wall Street Journal of this past Wednesday--not \nTuesday--has an article where they go through and document very well, \nvery succinctly, that we are not having a problem in losing this \npopulation. In fact, it is actually growing. So I ask unanimous consent \nto include the Wall Street Journal editorial in its entirety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 3, 2007]\n\n Polar Bear Politics--Using an ``Endangered'' Species To Change Energy \n                                Policy.\n\n       Unless you've been hibernating for the winter, you have no \n     doubt heard the many alarms about global warming. Now even \n     the Bush Administration is getting into the act, at least \n     judging from last week's decision by Interior Secretary Dirk \n     Kempthorne to recommend that the majestic polar bear be \n     listed as ``threatened'' under the Endangered Species Act. \n     The closer you inspect this decision, however, the more it \n     looks like the triumph of politics over science.\n       ``We are concerned,'' said Mr. Kempthorne, that ``the polar \n     bears' habitat may literally be melting'' due to warmer \n     Arctic temperatures. However, when we called Interior \n     spokesman Hugh Vickery for some elaboration, he was a lot \n     less categorical, even a tad defensive. The ``endangered'' \n     designation is based less on the actual number of bears in \n     Alaska than on ``projections into the future,'' Mr. Vickery \n     said, adding that these ``projection models'' are ``tricky \n     business.''\n       Apparently so, because there are in fact more polar bears \n     in the world now than there were 40 years ago, as the nearby \n     chart shows. The main threat to polar bears in recent decades \n     has been from hunting, with estimates as low as 5,000 to \n     10,000 bears in the 1950s and 1960s. But thanks to \n     conservation efforts, and some cross-border cooperation among \n     the U.S., Canada and Russia, the best estimate today is that \n     the polar bear population is 20,000 to 25,000.\n       It also turns out that most of the alarm over the polar \n     bear's future stems from a single, peer-reviewed study, which \n     found that the bear population had declined by some 250, or \n     25 percent, in Western Hudson Bay in the last decade. But the \n     polar bear's range is far more extensive than Hudson Bay. A \n     2002 U.S. Geological Survey of wildlife in the Arctic Refuge \n     Coastal Plain concluded that the ice bear populations ``may \n     now be near historic highs.'' One of the leading experts on \n     the polar bear, Mitchell Taylor, the manager of wildlife \n     resources for the Nunavut territory in Canada, has found that \n     the Canadian polar bear population has actually creased by 25 \n     percent--to 15,000 from 12,000 over the past decade.\n       Mr. Taylor tells us that in many parts of Canada, ``polar \n     bears are very abundant and productive. In some areas, they \n     are overly abundant. I understand that people not living in \n     the North generally have difficulty grasping the concept of \n     too many polar bears, but those who live here have a pretty \n     good grasp of what that is like.'' Those cuddly white bears \n     are the Earth's largest land carnivores.\n       There is no doubt that higher temperatures threaten polar \n     bear habitat by melting sea ice. Mr. Kempthorne also says he \n     had little choice because the threshold for triggering a \n     study under the Endangered Species Act is low. The Bush \n     Administration was sued by the usual environmental suspects \n     to make this decision, which means that Interior will now \n     conduct a year-long review before any formal listing decision \n     is made.\n       Nonetheless, the bears seem to have survived despite many \n     other severe warming and cooling periods over the last few \n     thousands of years. Polar bears are also protected from \n     poaching and environmental damage by the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act, so there is little extra advantage to the \n     bears themselves from an ``endangered'' classification.\n       All of which suggests that the real story here is a human \n     one, namely about the politics of global warming. Once a \n     plant or animal is listed under the Endangered Species Act, \n     the government must also come up with an elaborate plan to \n     protect its habitat. If the polar bear is endangered by \n     warmer temperatures, then the environmentalist demand will be \n     that the government do something to address that climate \n     change. Faster than you can say Al Gore, this would lead to \n     lawsuits and cries in Congress demanding federal mandates to \n     reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n       Think we're exaggerating? No sooner had Mr. Kempthorne \n     announced his study than Kassie Siegel of something called \n     the Center for Biological Diversity told the New York Times \n     that ``even this Administration'' would not be able to \n     ``write this proposal without acknowledging that the primary \n     threat to polar bears is global warming and without \n     acknowledging the science of global warming.'' Her outfit was \n     one of those who had sued the feds in the first place over \n     the polar bears, notwithstanding its location in the frozen \n     tundra of Arizona. But no matter. For want of a few hundred \n     polar bears, the entire U.S. economy could be vulnerable to \n     judicial dictation.\n       With that much at stake, Mr. Kempthorne could have shown a \n     stiffer backbone in resisting this political pressure. At the \n     very least he now has an obligation to ensure that Interior's \n     year-long study be based on real science and the actual polar \n     bear population, rather than rely on computer projections. \n     Any government decision to limit greenhouse gases deserves to \n     be debated in the open, where the public can understand the \n     consequences, not legislated by the back door via the \n     Endangered Species Act.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, on this very first day of the first \nsession of the 110th Congress, I am proud to introduce, with Majority \nLeader Reid, the Restoring Fiscal Discipline Act of 2007. By including \nthis act in our top 10 legislative priorities, Democrats are sending a \nmessage. We are saying to the Nation that it is time to restore fiscal \ndiscipline in Washington.\n  Unfortunately, we are inheriting a fiscal mess. It is a fiscal mess \nof historic proportion. The head of the Government Accountability \nOffice, General Walker, has told us:\n\n       The U.S. Government is on an imprudent and unsustainable \n     fiscal path.\n\n  General Walker is right. General Walker is the head of the Government \nAccountability Office. He is the person responsible for reporting to \nCongress on our fiscal condition, and he is warning us of the serious \ncourse correction that is required. As General Walker has said, and as \nI agree, the fact is that our budget outlook is far worse than what has \nbeen claimed. The increase in debt in 2006 is far greater than the \nreported deficit.\n  It is very interesting how the media reports these things to the \nAmerican people. They say to the American people that the deficit last \nyear was $248 billion. That is true. What they do not tell the American \npeople, what is not said, is the debt last year increased by $546 \nbillion--almost $300 billion more than the stated deficit. This is an \nutterly unsustainable course. To add almost $550 billion of debt in 1 \nyear after having done about that amount each of the last 5 years has \nput us on a course that is utterly unsustainable. It fundamentally \nthreatens America's economic security.\n  Read the reports. Yesterday and today in the national newspapers you \nsaw stories about the declining value of the dollar. The dollar has \nbeen in a deep slide for 3 months. There are reports of countries, one \nafter another, announcing that they intend to diversify their \ninvestments out of dollar-denominated securities. There is a message \nhere to all of us--a warning, a warning of America's preeminent \nposition in the financial world being threatened. It is being \nthreatened by a mountain of debt.\n  I have tried to put into visual terms how dramatically the change in \ndebt has been in just the last few years. When this President came to \noffice, after his last full year, the debt stood at $5.8 trillion. We \ndo not hold him responsible for his first year because obviously he was \noperating under the budget of the previous administration. But look \nwhat has happened since. The debt has skyrocketed to $8.5 trillion. If \nthe President's course is pursued, over\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\nthe next 5 years the debt will rise inexorably to $11.6 trillion, and \nall of this at the worst possible time, before the baby boom generation \nretires. This is a time we should be paying down debt, not exploding \ndebt. There is no sober or objective observer who does not recognize \nthe fundamental threat to our economic security caused by these budget \npolicies. We must change course.\n  The result of this rising debt is that increasingly we are borrowing \nthe funds to float this boat from abroad. In 2005, our country borrowed \n65 percent of all the money that was borrowed in the world by \ncountries. Let me repeat that. In 2005, our Nation borrowed 65 percent \nof all the money that was borrowed by countries in the world. The \nsecond biggest borrower was Spain. They borrowed one-tenth as much.\n  As we look back, this is a historic time with great challenges. The \nquestion before this body and the Congress of the United States and \nthis President will be whether we are honest with the American people \nabout the extent of our financial problems. This is a moment of \ntesting. Will we be honest? Will we be truthful? Will we make the tough \nchoices that are required?\n  In the last 5 years, foreign holdings of our debt have doubled. In \nother words, it took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 trillion of \nU.S. debt held abroad. That amount has more than doubled in just the \nlast 5 years. This is a course that cannot be sustained. It must be \nchanged.\n  I come to the floor today to offer an important measure, a measure to \nrestore fiscal discipline, by reimposing the pay-go rule that was so \neffective in the 1990s at helping us get back on track after the record \ndeficits of the 1980s.\n  We know that pay-go works. It was instrumental in our turning \ndeficits into surpluses in the 1990s. The pay-go rule says simply this: \nIf you want more tax cuts you have to pay for them. If you want new \nmandatory spending you have to pay for it. If you do not pay for it, \nyou have to muster a supermajority vote on the floor of the Senate for \nmore tax cuts or new mandatory spending to go forward.\n  That is a good rule, but it will not solve the problem. No one should \noverpromise. No one should overstate. It is going to take serious, \nconsistent discipline on spending, on revenue, and on entitlement \nreform for us to truly make progress.\n  In the joint caucus this morning, the leadership called on all of us \nto set aside partisanship to make genuine progress. This is going to be \nan area in which we have that opportunity. We have a window of \nopportunity, before we get into the next election cycle, to face up to \nthese fiscal challenges. One part of a successful strategy is to \nreimpose the pay-go discipline. It is not the only thing, but it is a \nbeginning.\n  In addition to reestablishing the pay-go rule, the legislation I am \noffering today prohibits the use of the fast-track reconciliation \nprocess for any legislation that would add to the deficit. \nReconciliation is a big word; it is a fancy word. It confuses people, \nbut it is a special process in the Senate to go around the standard \nrules of this body to pass legislation. It circumscribes Senators' \nrights. It restricts their ability to offer amendments. It sets a \nstrict time limit on debate. The only reason those procedures were ever \nadopted in this body--the only reason--was to reduce budget deficits. \nUnfortunately, over the last 6 years those special procedures have been \nused to increase deficits, not to reduce deficits. That stood the whole \nrationale for reconciliation on its head.\n  It is time for us to go back to the reconciliation process that was \nintended and only use those extraordinary procedures for reducing \ndeficits, not for increasing them.\n  (Mrs. MURRAY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. I note the very distinguished Member of the Senate, the \nSenator from the State of Washington and a member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, who understands full well the subject we are discussing \ntoday and the critical need for our Nation to return to a more sound \nfiscal course.\n  I offer this measure today to restore fiscal discipline. I ask my \ncolleagues to bring their ideas to the Senate floor. You have my \ncommitment as the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to \ndo my level best to bring our country back. Our country needs us now. \nOur country needs us to be truthful and honest and to work together.\n  I felt, in the Senate Chamber this morning, a new spirit, a new sense \nof possibility--perhaps the chance that we can come together in a way \nthat would make us all proud.\n  I very much hope we seize that opportunity. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to achieve that result.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on the first day of the 110th Congress, \nit is an appropriate occasion to reintroduce legislation which was \nintroduced in the 109th Congress which was not enacted. I have a number \nof legislative proposals to introduce today and to discuss.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 185, \nS. 186, and S. 187 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S26-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I strongly support legislation introduced \nearlier today which would permit Federal funding to be used for \nembryonic stem cell research. That is a subject which has been at the \ntop of my agenda since November of 1998 when stem cells were first \nexposed. Within 10 days, in December 1998, the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education held the \nfirst hearing to explore the potential of embryonic stem cell research. \nIn the intervening years the subcommittee has held some 19 hearings \nexploring this issue in some great detail.\n  The Specter-Harkin bill was passed last year, vetoed by the \nPresident, and the bill is back before the Congress this year where it \nmay be possible to override a Presidential veto. That depends upon how \nmuch public support there is--really, how much public clamor there is--\nfor this legislation to be enacted.\n  Embryonic stem cells have the potential to replace diseased cells. \nThey are a veritable fountain of youth. They have enormous potential in \nParkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease, and almost all of the \nknown maladies. I don't know of any malady where they are not a \npotential for a cure because the cells in a person's body become \ndiseased, and if the embryonic stem cell can replace the diseased cell, \nthere is a potential for a cure.\n  There is opposition to this legislation on the ground that it would \ndestroy life. That is factually not correct because there are some \n400,000 embryos created for in vitro fertilization which are going to \nbe destroyed. When the issue was raised about destroying a life, the \nsubcommittee took the lead and appropriated $2 million to facilitate \nadoptions. There have only been about 100 adoptions in the past several \nyears, so there is no doubt that using some of these embryonic stem \ncells will not destroy life because they will not be used to create \nlife. If there were any chance they would create life, I would not \nconsider utilizing them for medical research.\n  When the alternative is to throw them away or to use them, it seems \nto me a clear choice to utilize them to save lives and fight disease. \nThat is the thrust of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S26-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S26-S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, moving now to the issue of signing \nstatements: I had introduced legislation in the 109th Congress to \nprovide standing to the Congress to go to court when the President \nissues signing statements which, in effect, cherry-picked the \nprovisions in the legislation he liked and disregarded the provisions \nin the legislation he disliked.\n  That kind of a proceeding, in my view, is unconstitutional because \nthe\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\nConstitution says that we present a bill to the President; he either \nsigns it or vetoes it. His veto is subject to override on a two-thirds \nvote. But, the President cannot pick and choose among the provisions of \nthe act.\n  When we passed the PATRIOT Act, there were some provisions very \ncarefully negotiated as to congressional oversight. No objection had \nbeen raised by the Department of Justice in our discussions as we \nnegotiated about the bill. And then, when the President signed the \nbill, the President specifically said that he would not pay attention \nto those provisions if he felt that his Executive power would be \nimpinged upon. If he disagreed with the provisions, he should have told \nus before we legislated.\n  Similarly, in the McCain Anti-Torture legislation, which passed the \nSenate 90 to 9, a compromise was struck between the White House and \nSenator McCain. And here again, the President's signing statement seems \nto undermine the compromise that was struck.\n  I am not going to reintroduce the legislation now because we are \ndiscussing some modifications with some of my Senate colleagues, and I \nam going to defer for a brief period of time to see if we can get \nadditional cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S27-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S27-S28]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, finally, a brief comment on judicial \nnominations. During the course of the 109th Congress, the Senate \nconfirmed two Supreme Court Justices, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \nAlito, 16 Court of Appeals judges, 35 District Court judges, and 1 \nCourt of International Trade judge. At the close of the 109th Congress, \nthere were 13 District Court nominees on the Executive Calendar, but \nwere held up on a technicality.\n  I am pleased to say that Senator Leahy advised me earlier today he is \ngoing to put those 13 nominees on the first executive session of the \nJudiciary Committee next week, so they will be confirmed. There was no \nobjection raised to them in the last Congress, except they were tied up \non a concern raised by one Senator about a nominee for the Western \nDistrict of Michigan.\n  In the last Congress, we were also able to confirm a number of \njudges--circuit judges, who have been held up for a long period of \ntime: Priscilla Owen, pending since 2001; Janice Rogers Brown, pending \nsince 2003; William Pryor, pending since 2003; Brett Kavanaugh, pending \nsince 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my full statement be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of these extemporaneous remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I seek recognition today, to \n     discuss one of this body's most important responsibilities; \n     namely, our responsibility to provide advice and consent on \n     the President's judicial nominations.\n       At the outset, I would like to take a few moments to remind \n     my colleagues of the Judiciary Committee's success during the \n     last Congress in moving the President's judicial nominees \n     through the confirmation process in a timely manner.\n       During the last Congress, the Senate confirmed 54 Article \n     III judges, including the Chief Justice of the United States, \n     an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, 16 Court of \n     Appeals judges, 35 District Court judges, and one Court of \n     International Trade judge. The Senate could have, and I \n     believe should have, confirmed 13 more District Court \n     nominees before the conclusion of the last Congress. All of \n     these qualified men and women were favorably reported by the \n     Judiciary Committee without a single dissenting vote. Many of \n     them are nominated to vacancies that have been deemed \n     judicial emergencies. I hope we can promptly move to confirm \n     all of these men and women in the new Congress. Failure to do \n     so will continue to delay justice in courts from Pennsylvania \n     to California. I have asked my friend and new Judiciary \n     Committee Chairman Senator Leahy to place these nominees on \n     our Committee's very first executive business meeting. I am \n     happy to report that he has agreed to do so.\n       I remind my colleagues that at the beginning of the last \n     Congress judicial confirmations, particularly to the Circuit \n     Courts, were at a virtual standstill with many nominees \n     subject to filibusters. Much of the debate in this chamber \n     during the first months of the 109th Congress involved \n     whether or not to invoke the so-called ``Constitutional \n     Option,'' whereby the rules of the Senate would be altered to \n     allow for a vote on Circuit Court nominees. Thankfully, the \n     Senate managed to avert a major showdown over this debate and \n     instead confirmed highly qualified nominees to the Courts of \n     Appeals, several of whom had been pending for many years. \n     These included Priscilla Owen (pending since 2001); Janice \n     Rogers Brown (pending since 2003); Bill Pryor (pending since \n     2003); and Brett Kavanaugh (pending since 2003).\n       So in the last Congress we managed to move to a vote on \n     many long languishing nominees. We also moved expeditiously \n     on new.nominations. It was my practice as Chairman to \n     schedule a prompt hearing on every judicial nomination as \n     soon as all necessary materials were received and the nominee \n     was prepared to move forward. Once given a hearing, every \n     nominee was placed promptly on the Committee's agenda for \n     consideration. I believe our practice, while avoiding \n     unnecessary delay, also ensured that each nomination was \n     thoroughly vetted so that the Senate had the information it \n     needed to come to a vote.\n       In short, the Judiciary Committee and the Senate, by \n     following regular order, carried out our Constitutional \n     responsibilities. As a result, the federal court vacancy rate \n     fell to as low as 4.8% during my tenure as Chairman. This is \n     among the lowest vacancy rates in the last 20 years. \n     Unfortunately, in part because of our failure to confirm the \n     13 district court nominees late in the last Congress, the \n     vacancy rates have increased during the fall and winter.\n       I cite this recent history and these statistics as examples \n     of what can be done in this body when we work hard and put \n     fairness ahead of partisanship. I committed myself to this \n     principle as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I am \n     hopeful we can continue to work in this vein during the 110th \n     Congress under the Chairmanship of Senator Leahy. Working \n     together, I believe we can avoid some of the acrimony that \n     has poisoned the nominations process in recent years.\n       In fact, I want to give Senator Leahy a good bit of credit. \n     He worked cooperatively with us to ensure that nominees were \n     moved during the 109th Congress. There were times when our \n     friends across the aisle could stymie our efforts to process \n     nominees, but Senator Leahy worked with me to enable the \n     Senate to carry out its constitutional responsibilities.\n       That is why I am troubled by recent suggestions that it is \n     appropriate to dramatically slow the confirmation process \n     during the last two years of a president's term. Our \n     Constitutional duties remain, despite the fact that we are \n     now beginning a Presidential election cycle. Past Congresses \n     have been very productive on judicial nominations during \n     Presidential elections cycles and we should be as well.\n       The record shows that the Senate has confirmed numerous \n     nominees during the last two years of every modern \n     president's term in office. For example, in the last two \n     years of the Carter Administration, the Senate confirmed 44 \n     Circuit Court nominees and 154 District Court nominees.\n       During the last two years of the Reagan Administration, the \n     Senate confirmed 17 Circuit Court nominees and 66 District \n     Court nominees.\n       During the last two years of the George H.W. Bush \n     Administration, the Senate confirmed 20 Circuit Court \n     nominees and 100 District Court nominees.\n       During the last two years of the Clinton Administration, \n     the Senate confirmed 15 Circuit Court nominees and 57 \n     District Court nominees.\n       In many of these cases the Senate was controlled, sometimes \n     by a substantial margin, by a different party than that which \n     controlled the White House. I see no reason why this Senate \n     should not be at least as productive as the Republican \n     controlled Senate which confirmed 15 Circuit Court nominees \n     during President Clinton's final two years in office.\n       I would also like to address what has been called the \n     ``Thurmond Rule.'' Some have suggested that this so-called \n     rule holds that the Senate should dramatically curtail \n     confirmations after the spring of a presidential election \n     year. Review of the historical record suggests that this rule \n     is more myth than reality.\n       It does not appear that Senator Thurmond, for whom the \n     purported rule is named, ever publicly asserted that \n     nominations should be delayed due to an impending \n     presidential election. The only comment that could be so \n     construed was made after the Committee approved ten nominees \n     at a September 17, 1980 markup. He stated, ``[L]et me make \n     the point [that] the Minority has tried to be more than fair \n     in considering all of the nominees that have appeared before \n     this Committee. I would remind [the Committee] it is just \n     about six weeks before the election, and I want to say that \n     for a year and a half before the last election, there was no \n     action taken on judges when we had a Republican President.'' \n     However, because Senator Thurmond used this as a point of \n     contrast, the natural implication seems to be that he \n     considered blocking nominations in the lead up to an election \n     unfair.\n       The fact of the matter is that the Senate has regularly \n     confirmed judges in presidential election years. In the \n     election year of 1980, when it is asserted Senator Thurmond \n     inaugurated the so-called rule, the Senate confirmed ten \n     Circuit Court nominees and 53 District Court nominees. \n     Several of the Circuit Court nominations were high profile\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\n     nominees with well-known credentials. Many of these nominees \n     were confirmed relatively late in the year.\n       Between June 1 and September 1, 1980, the Senate confirmed \n     four Circuit Court nominees and 15 District Court nominees, \n     including then-ACLU General Counsel Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who \n     was confirmed June 18, 1980.\n       After September 1, 1980, the Senate confirmed two more \n     Circuit Court nominees and eleven District Court nominees. \n     The first Circuit Court nominee, Stephen Reinhardt of the \n     Ninth Circuit, who is now thought to be one of nation's most \n     liberal jurists, was confirmed on September 11, 1980.\n       More remarkable is the second Circuit Court nominee, that \n     of Stephen Breyer to the First Circuit. Justice Breyer was \n     then Senator Kennedy's Chief Counsel. He was nominated by \n     President Carter on November 13, 1980, after Carter had lost \n     the election to Ronald Reagan. The Senate, which was also \n     about to switch party control, held a swift confirmation \n     hearing and voted to confirm Breyer on December 9, 1980.\n       The presidential election year of 1980 was not an \n     aberration, the pattern continued in subsequent election \n     years. In 1988, President Reagan's last year in office, the \n     Senate confirmed seven Circuit Court nominees and 33 District \n     Court nominees. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush's last \n     year in office, the Senate confirmed eleven Circuit Court \n     nominees and 53 District Court nominees. In 2000, President \n     Clinton's last year in office, the Senate confirmed eight \n     Circuit Court nominees and 31 District Court nominees.\n       Furthermore, many of these presidential election year \n     confirmations occurred late in the year. Since 1980, 110 \n     judges were confirmed after July 1st of a presidential \n     election year, 17 of those were confirmed to Circuit Courts. \n     In the same period, 63 judges were confirmed after September \n     1st of presidential elections years, twelve of those to \n     Circuit Courts. In short, there does not appear to be any \n     historical basis for the so-called ``Thurmond Rule.'' The \n     Senate has confirmed numerous nominees during presidential \n     election years, and I expect that with Senator Leahy and I \n     working together, we will do so again next year.\n       In fact, I think it's time to move beyond some of the more \n     acrimonious judicial battles of the past. I think the country \n     is served best when the Senate fulfills its constitutional \n     duty and votes on the President's nominees.\n       I have called on the White House to consult with Senator \n     Leahy and Leader Reid during the nomination process. I have \n     also worked to ensure that judicial nominees are afforded \n     prompt consideration and fair treatment by the Judiciary \n     Committee. I plan to continue to do that as the Ranking \n     Member and am confident that under Senator Leahy's \n     leadership, our Committee will fairly and expeditiously \n     consider judicial nominees.\n       Aside from the responsibility the Senate has to vote up or \n     down on the President's nominees, we cannot forget that these \n     people, who have agreed to undertake important government \n     service, have family considerations and professional lives \n     that are often adversely impacted when their careers are out \n     on hold because of a pending nomination. We should never \n     forget that these nominees, whether a Member decides \n     ultimately to support them or not, are deserving of our \n     thanks for their willingness to undergo this process and to \n     offer their services to the American people. They deserve \n     fair treatment by this body.\n       I trust that during the 110th Congress the Senate will work \n     productively to ensure that nominees are treated fairly and \n     that judicial vacancies are filled as soon as possible. I \n     look forward to working with the White House and with \n     Chairman Leahy to that end.\n       I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Madam President, this has been a good day. It is a day on \nwhich many of us were sworn in and a day that the Senate began again to \nfunction in this new 110th Congress. It began with a rather historic \nmeeting called by the new majority leader, Harry Reid, in the Old \nSenate Chamber, a place which I explained to my family is so imbued \nwith the history of the United States and the history of the Senate \nthat one cannot but help feel a sense of responsibility, a special \nsense of duty when functioning as a Senator in that Old Senate Chamber. \nFrequently there are people there who remind us of some of the history \nto call on us to try to rise to the same level to which many of the \ngreat Senators in the history of this country rose in the most \ndifficult and challenging times of our country.\n  I believe it was Senator Kennedy who reminded us that exactly on this \nday, at the very beginning of the Civil War, the Senators from the \nSouth left the Senate Chamber for the last time. They did not meet with \nthe Senate thereafter because of the beginning of the Civil War, and \nthat is when the Senate moved from the Old Senate Chamber to the \nChamber we are now in--here.\n  There is a great deal of a sense of mission and of history and of \nresponsibility when we meet in a place such as that. The purpose for \nthe meeting was to begin this new Congress thinking about something \nthat we have tended to forget in recent months and even, I would say, \nyears, and that is the degree to which Senators had in the past worked \ntogether to get the people's business done.\n  Unlike under the rules of the House of Representatives in which the \nmajority pretty much rules and the minority has very little power, in \nthe Senate the minority and the majority must work together to get \nanything done because of the rules. With a 51-49 division right now, it \nis obvious that this body is almost equally divided and that under our \nrules we are going to have to work very well together to get anything \ndone.\n  In the past there has been--and I would say leading up to the last \nelection--a special amount of politicking and of negativity, the sort \nof ``gotcha'' kind of politics that is designed to score political \npoints; a cynicism, a lack of comity. I think we always see that a \nlittle bit before an election but I felt it much more oppressively in \nthe runup to this last election.\n  Someone has pointed out that perhaps with a divided Government now, \nin the sense that Democrats control the Congress and the Republican \nParty controls the executive branch, actually there may be much less \nincentive for either side to engage in that kind of politics and, to \nthe contrary, much more incentive for both sides to try to work with \neach other to get things done. The reputation of Democratic Senators \nand Representatives will depend to some extent on how much they can \naccomplish. They will have to have Republican help to accomplish \nthings. The last 2 years of the Bush Presidency will depend a great \ndeal on how much he, working with the Congress, can get done in these 2 \nyears. He can't do anything on his own. He has to sign bills that we \npass. So he has to work with us, meaning that Republicans working with \nhim also have to reach across the aisle and work with our colleagues in \nthe Democratic Party.\n  I thought some things the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said \ntoday were especially appropriate in this regard. I want to close our \nday today, reiterating some of the thoughts he expressed with which I \nam in total agreement. He said this:\n\n       The Senate can accomplish great things over the next 2 \n     years, but this opportunity will surely slip from our grasp \n     if we do not commit ourselves to a restoration of civility \n     and common purpose.\n\n  New Democratic colleague Bernie Sanders from Vermont, with whom I \nserved in the House--we got reacquainted today--said, Are you enjoying \nit over here? I hesitated. And he laughed. We had a discussion about \nthe fact that it can be very enjoyable when you work together to try to \nget something done. You have to work with\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\neach other across the aisle if you are going to get something done. It \nis not enjoyable when there is a lack of comity, where harsh language \nis used, when you see things done purely for political purposes. Then \nit is not fun. I think we would all rather look forward coming to work \nin the morning. And it certainly is better when we go home and report \nto our constituents that we were able to get something done.\n  I am sure the distinguished majority leader would agree with this \ncomment that Mitch McConnell made this morning. He said:\n\n       . . . as we open this session, I stake my party to a \n     pledge: when faced with an urgent issue, we will act; when \n     faced with a problem, we will seek solution, not mere \n     political advantage.\n\n  I think that is the credo all of us pretty well agreed to at the end \nof that very special meeting we had this morning: that we need positive \nsolutions to real problems. We need to act in a spirit of comity. All \nof us need to stop the finger pointing, the negativity, the taking \nadvantage for political purposes, and the setting up of each other in a \nway we would fail rather than finding a way that we can both succeed.\n  In fact, one of our colleagues made a comment almost exactly to that \neffect: We need to both succeed in what we do. Since we now have \ndivided Government, there is an incentive for us to work with each \nother to do that.\n  There were, of course, some of our colleagues who reminded us that \nrealistically this would not be easy, that there would be a great \ntendency to slip back into old habits and to fight politically, and we \nknow that to be true. But there are some things--at least one of our \ncolleagues made this point very strongly--on which we have to act in a \nunited way and that starts with our national security, meeting this \nthreat of terrorism. The distinguished Republican leader made that \npoint. Among the things he suggested we would have to work on, he said:\n\n       America has not seen a domestic terrorist attack since we \n     committed ourselves to the global war on terror. That's not \n     an accident, some quirk of fate. Rather, it is due to the \n     hard work of spotting and disrupting threats before they \n     strike.\n\n  Much of that capability was granted by the Senate and the House and \nthe President in reorganizing our intelligence agencies, reorganizing \nsome of the laws under which our intelligence agencies and law \nenforcement work. So we have helped to keep the American people more \nsecure. We should continue that hard work.\n  He concluded on this point:\n\n       Al-qaida is not a threat to Republicans, it is not a threat \n     to Democrats, it is a threat to America. And the Senate must \n     work together as we prepare for the long struggle ahead.\n\n  There were many other issues that have been discussed, things we can \nwork together on, things we are going to have to work together on. I \nclose with one example that, to us in this body, we know this for a \nfact. That is the confirmation of judges. When you have a President of \none party nominating judges and the majority in the Senate is of the \nother party, obviously something has to give. You have to work \ntogether. It was the hope of the Republican leader, I am sure, speaking \non behalf of the President of the United States as well, that we would \nfind ways to work together, Democrats and Republicans in this body, to \ngive a fair chance to the President's nominees. He is, after all, \nelected President. He has the authority under the Constitution to \nnominate judges. Our responsibility is to check them out, to hold the \nhearings, and to question their qualifications but if in fact they are \nqualified, to give them a chance to be put on the bench with an up-or-\ndown vote. I hope we could do that for the vast majority of the judges \nthe President has nominated and for the other executive branch \nnominations of the President as well.\n  These are good examples of areas in which, without cooperation, the \nGovernment for the people does not function well. So, as we end this \nday I ask us to reflect on some of the words of our leaders, Harry Reid \nand Mitch McConnell, today and our colleagues in that historic meeting \nthis morning when we talked a good game about recommitting ourselves to \nbipartisan solutions to problems, to work on behalf of the American \npeople with more comity in this body, in a way which will make us feel \nmuch better amongst ourselves and make our constituents much happier \nthan they are when they see us fighting and bickering all the time. It \nis fitting to end this day on that note.\n\n  I commend the majority leader, Harry Reid. I commend the Republican \nleader, Mitch McConnell, for serving as examples for all Members in the \nleadership they exhibited in starting the Senate off this way.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader now. We can conclude this day \non that high note, giving some hope to the American people that we are \ncommitted to working on their behalf for a better future, a better \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S29-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S29]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                Lance Corporal Clinton Jon (C.J.)

My thoughts and prayers go out to his \nwife Jackie, his mother Susan, his father Kerby, and all his family and \nfriends. I am sure I speak for all Iowans when I say that I am proud to \ncall C.J. one of us. By all accounts, he was a fine marine who felt \ncalled to, and liked, military service. Family members say that he \njoined the Marines during wartime because he just felt he had to serve. \nWhere would our country be without patriotic young Americans like C.J. \nwho feel a call to serve their country? All Americans owe a debt of \ngratitude to this brave Marine. As his father said, ``He was a hero.'' \nLance Corporal Miller's tremendous service and sacrifice should never \nbe forgotten.\n\n\n                        Sergeant James P. Musack\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to SGT James P. \nMusack of Riverside, IA, who tragically died as a result of a noncombat \nrelated incident while serving his country in Iraq. I am sure that all \nIowans shared the same sense of sadness I felt when learning of the \ndeath of this young Iowa native. According to family and friends, he \nhad found his calling in the military and all Americans owe him our \ndeepest thanks for his service. Everyone joining the military knows the \nrisks involved, but all Americans are indebted to brave patriots like \nJames Musack who voluntarily assume those risks in order to defend our \nfreedom and way of life. My prayers go out to his mother Yvette, his \nfather Jim, and all his family and friends.\n\n\n                   Lieutenant Colonel Paul J. Finken\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to LTC Paul J. \nFinken who has given his life for his country while serving in Iraq. He \nwas 40 years old. Paul Finken was raised in Earling, IA, and I know all \nIowans share my pride as we also mourn his loss. As a career Army \nofficer, Lieutenant Colonel Finken had dedicated his life to the \nservice of his country and we can never thank him enough for his \nservice and his final sacrifice on behalf of our freedom.\n  In remembering Paul Finken, his family said, ``Paul was a devoted \nhusband, loving father and respected leader. He loved being a soldier \nand respected the soldiers he worked with. He always set the example \nand would never ask his soldiers to do anything he wouldn't do himself. \nHe will be greatly missed by his family and by all who knew him.'' My \nthoughts and prayers are with his wife Jackie and his three daughters, \nEmilie, Caroline, and Julia, for their loss.

Mr. President, I come today to discuss the situation in \nColorado and surrounding States that has captured national attention. \nOver the last few weeks Colorado and its neighbors have experienced two \nrecord-setting blizzards. In some parts of Colorado these storms \ndropped almost 5 feet of snow and have created a nightmare situation \nfor many in rural America. Thousands of head of cattle and other \nlivestock are currently stranded without food or water. Only recently \nhave some of these animals begun to see relief with supply drops via \nhelicopter.\n  The aftermath of these devastating blizzards continues to paralyze \nmany\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\ncounties in Colorado and the West. Thousands of local men and women \nhave banded together and are working to provide relief to their \nneighbors and to the tens of thousands of livestock facing starvation. \nDozens of communities have experienced severe economic damage and loss \nas a result of these blizzards. These storms have created a dire \nsituation.\n  In the tradition of the West local individuals have pulled together \nand have spent much of their holiday season trying to dig each other \nout and reach stranded livestock. Locals are doing all that they can, \nand I am grateful for the assistance that the National Guard has \nprovided. Unfortunately more needs to be done. I am introducing \nlegislation today that will help provide Federal resources to the \nbackbone of America; our producers. The legislation that I introduce \ntoday will reauthorize the Livestock Compensation Program and direct \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to allocate funds to it from the Commodity \nCredit Corporation to help eligible producers that have suffered a loss \nfrom these blizzards.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will act swiftly on this important \nlegislation that will get vital help to America's farmers and ranchers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S30-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S30]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY J.

Mr. Zagami has been a true public servant, \nhaving served over 40 years in Federal service and earned the \ndistinction as the longest serving general counsel in the history of \nthe GPO.\n  Mr. Zagami started his government service as a Senate page in the \n1960s. He continued his service to Congress while working his way \nthrough college and law school. He received his bachelor of science \ndegree from the University of Maryland School of Business and Public \nAdministration, and his juris doctor from the George Mason University \nSchool of Law.\n  After working 25 years in the Congress, he left to become the general \ncounsel of the Government Printing Office in 1990. The GPO, among other \nthings, is responsible for producing the Congressional Record. During \nhis time at the GPO, he was instrumental in transforming it into the \nmodern digital information processing organization that it is today.\n  Throughout his career, both in the Congress and at the GPO, Mr. \nZagami was known for his dedication and commitment to public service \nand received numerous awards and recognitions for his achievements. As \na tribute to his outstanding performance, the GPO named him General \nCounsel Emeritus--the first time such a title has been bestowed upon an \nindividual in the GPO's 145-year history.\n  As he ends a distinguished career, I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank Tony Zagami for his many years of public service \nto our Nation and wish him and his family the very best in all future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S30-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S30]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       IN MEMORY OF BRYAN TUVERA\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Officer Tuvera was a member of the \nSan Francisco Police Department who died in the line of duty on \nDecember 23, 2006. He was 28 years old.\n  Officer Tuvera was a 4\\1/2\\-year veteran of the San Francisco Police \nDepartment. He served with distinction and received numerous \ncommendations during his tenure. He was shot and killed during the \npursuit of an escaped convict. He died on the tenth anniversary of his \nbeloved father's death, who had worked as a police dispatcher with the \nSan Francisco Police Department.\n  Before joining the San Francisco Police Department on July 1, 2002, \nOfficer Tuvera received his degree in criminal justice from San \nFrancisco State University. He is a 1996 graduate of South San \nFrancisco High School.\n  Officer Tuvera was married to his wife Salina Tuvera 2 months ago. \nThey had been preparing for their first Christmas together.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask \nmy colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of an \nextraordinary Californian, Elizabeth Terwilliger.\n  To the Marin County community, Elizabeth Terwilliger was a renowned \nnaturalist and educator, beloved by schoolchildren and adults, who \nleaves an amazing environmental legacy. She died on November 27, 2006 \nat the age of 97. She is survived by her daughter Lynn, her son John, \nand several grandchildren.\n  Elizabeth Cooper was born in Hawaii in 1909. She moved to the \nmainland to pursue a master's degree in nutrition from Columbia \nUniversity in New York and then attended Stanford nursing school. While \nat Stanford, she met her husband, Dr. Calvin Terwilliger. After World \nWar II, the couple settled in Mill Valley, California where they raised \ntwo children.\n  Elizabeth took her children on nature walks throughout Marin County. \nSoon, she was leading nature walks for local Girl Scout and Boy Scout \ntroops. Her unique hands-on style and storytelling ability became known \nthroughout the community and soon she began leading field trips for \narea schools and environmental organizations. Leading such trips 5 days \na week became her life's work.\n  For the 50 years that followed, every child growing up in Marin \nCounty knew Mrs. Terwilliger. She was a famous and beloved educator who \ntraveled across the county in her familiar van filled with life-like \nanimal models to teach school children about nature. Upon sight of her \ncharacteristic floppy straw hat, children would come running and follow \nher through the woods with excitement and adoration. They would soak up \nher stories and bring them home to teach their parents.\n  Those who knew Mrs. Terwilliger well recount her mesmerizing \npersonality, her passion for nature and wildlife, and her openhearted \nway with children and adults alike.\n  In 1984, President Ronald Reagan honored Mrs. Terwilliger as an \noutstanding volunteer. While accepting the award at the White House, \nshe shared one of her famous stories about ``Mr. Vulture,'' and had \nPresident Reagan holding his arms over his head in the ``V'' position, \nrepresenting a vulture in flight.\n  In addition to leading nature education programs, Mrs. Terwilliger \nwas an advocate for environmental conservation and open space. She \ncampaigned for a monarch butterfly preserve, bicycle paths, wetlands \nand open space preservation. She received numerous awards and has two \npreserves named after her: Terwilliger Marsh in Mill Valley and \nTerwilliger Butterfly Grove at Muir Beach.\n  She inspired Joan Linn Bekins to create the Elizabeth Terwilliger \nNature Education Foundation, which later became known as WildCare. \nUsing educational programs developed by Mrs. Terwilliger, the center \nprovides nature programs for over 40,000 Bay Area schoolchildren each \nyear. The center also treats thousands of wildlife each year, \nrehabilitating them and returning them to their natural environment.\n  Mrs. Terwilliger often said, ``while you're learning, you're \nliving.'' Her life's passion was to teach people how to embrace and \nlove nature. She was a local treasure and a wonderful, inspiring woman.\n  I knew Mrs. Terwilliger and respected and admired her greatly. She \nwill be deeply missed.\n  For those of us who were fortunate to know her, we take comfort in \nknowing that schoolchildren will continue to learn from Mrs. \nTerwilliger's unique\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\neducational style at WildCare. Her vision, her passion and her spirit \nwill remain in the countless lives she touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S31-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S31]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BETH McWHIRT\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, Today on the first day of the 110th \nCongress, I wish to recognize the accomplishment of the Boise State \nUniversity Broncos football team this past Monday, January 1, 2007.\n  College sports have a way of putting schools, and cities, on the map. \nFor instance, George Mason University was virtually unknown until their \nbasketball team catapulted into the national spotlight through March \nMadness last year. However, no sport is more adept at this than the \nall-American sport of football.\n  On New Year's Day, Boise State University battled Oklahoma in the \nFiesta Bowl. One announcer commented that, until today, many of the \nOklahoma football players didn't even know where Boise is. Well, Mr. \nPresident, they do now.\n  In what is being described as one of the most thrilling games in the \nhistory of college bowl games, the Broncos defeated Oklahoma 43 to 42. \nI can't begin to describe to you the enthusiasm of the Bronco fans \nbefore, during, and especially after the game. It was contagious. And \nthat is coming from a proud Idaho Vandal.\n  Idaho is a small State. We haven't had nationally known sports teams. \nIt wasn't too long ago that Boise State was only known in football \ncircles for its blue football field. On the first day of 2007, that all \nchanged.\n  I am proud of what our Broncos did proving to the Nation that Idaho \nknows how to play football.\n  With this new notoriety, of course, comes an opportunity for us to \ntell the country that Idaho's State-run universities have a lot to \noffer besides great football. Between Boise State, the University of \nIdaho, and Idaho State University, Idaho offers tremendous education \nwith a quality of life that can't be beat.\n  Boise, Idaho is now on the map of millions of college football fans \nthanks to our Broncos. To them I say congratulations and thank \nyou.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S31-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S31]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING 2007 BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY BRONCOS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, if a football victory on New Year's \nDay is a harbinger of things to come, 2007 looks to be a thrilling year \nmarked by success and celebration. Most of my colleagues here know that \nBoise State University won the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl on New Year's Day. \nThis bowl victory completes an undefeated football season, 13 to 0, \nthanks to the hard work, dedication, and love of the game by the Boise \nState football players, fans, coach Chris Petersen, his staff, the \nathletic department, and the university administration. They all worked \nvery hard to reach this remarkable achievement, and they have not only \nmy congratulations, but the congratulations, of Idahoans and Americans \neverywhere.\n  Idaho is home to just over a million people and has some surprising \nsecrets, not the least of which has been the five-time defending \nWestern Athletic Conference Champion Boise State Broncos football team. \nIt is a source of tremendous pride to see the team make national \nheadlines, once again, for Idaho in this incredibly positive manner. \nThe victory that barely eluded them in last year's MPC Computers Bowl \ncame riding home and riding home hard. The Fiesta Bowl game against \ntraditional football powerhouse the University of Oklahoma was college \nfootball at its best, and the BSU players and coaches came through with \nsome stunning plays. While Boise dominated the first three-quarters of \nthe game, the Sooners came roaring back. The last 2 minutes of the game \nwere as good as college football gets. When the game went into \novertime, the Sooners didn't waste a play they immediately scored a \ntouchdown to temporarily take the lead. With the game on the line, the \nBoise State players came through and scored a touchdown along with a \nthrilling two-point conversion to bring the final score to 43 to 42, \nBoise State. Earlier in 2006, Boise was named the eighth most inventive \ncity in the Nation. That creativity and innovation was certainly the \nSpirit of Idaho at its best on the field of play at crunch time and \nmade this dreamed Bronco victory a reality.\n  The BSU Broncos are committed to excellence both on and off the \nfield. The players take the energy they generate on the field and \nspread it throughout the community and State. The extraordinary \nprogress and development of the BSU football program and the entire \nuniversity stand as a testament to what can be accomplished with \nleadership, commitment, determination, and, most importantly, teamwork.\n\n  As the Nation marvels at the ``hook and lateral'' and ``Statue of \nLiberty'' plays that sealed the victory, I congratulate Coach Petersen, \nPresident Bob Kustra, Athletic Director Gene Bleymaier, the entire \nteam, loyal students, alumni, and fans on their collective victory \nwhich all Idahoans enthusiastically share. I offer a friendly \ncondolence to my colleagues from Oklahoma, and I am confident that \ntheir fine program will continue its tradition of excellence. And I \noffer this statement as a friendly notice to my colleagues from States \nthat are home to traditional college football powerhouses: that thunder \nyou hear is from our charging Broncos. I look forward to another great \nseason this fall when the Broncos will run again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S31-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S31-S32]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MARVIN VAN HAAFTEN\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to offer my congratulations and gratitude to an \nextraordinary Iowan. Marvin Van Haaften is stepping down from his \ndistinguished position as director of the State of Iowa's Office of \nDrug Control Policy. He assumed this position after being named by \nGovernor Tom Vilsack in 2002 and has served the State with honor and \ndistinction since accepting the appointment.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to show Marvin Van Haaften the \nappreciation that the country, the State of Iowa, and myself personally \nhave for his extensive commitment as a public servant. With more than \n32 years of law enforcement experience, Marvin has taught extensively \nin the field of rural law enforcement, particularly death investigation \nand domestic violence crimes. He has provided local and national \nleadership on the role of law enforcement in strategic victim safety \nand offender apprehension, and is presently on the board of directors \nof the National Center for Rural Law Enforcement. Marvin also served on \nmany local and State committees such as the Iowa Criminal and Juvenile \nJustice Planning Advisory Council, the board of the Mid-Iowa Narcotics \nEnforcement Task Force, the board of the 18-county South Central Iowa \nClandestine Laboratory Task Force, and was the third vice president on \nthe board of directors of the Iowa Association of Counties. Marvin was \nnamed Sheriff of the year in 1991 by the Iowa State Sheriffs' and \nDeputies' Association and served as its president in 1996. He is also a \ngraduate of the FBI National Academy and has attended the National \nSheriffs' Association's National Sheriffs' Institute and the FBI Law \nEnforcement Executive Development Institute.

Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat today I honor Justin Minkel, a second grade teacher at Harvey \nJones Elementary School in Springdale, AR, who was named a recipient of \nthe 2006 Milken Family Foundation National Educator Award.\n  Since the inception of the Milken Foundation National Educator Awards \nProgram in 1985, over 2200 outstanding men and women have been named \nMilken Educators. They are honored with both public recognition and \nfinancial reward for their exceptional educational talent and positive \nresults in the classroom.\n  Justin Minkel teaches in a classroom where English is the second \nlanguage for the majority of his students. His students have flourished \nunder his instruction, with nearly a third becoming fluent in English. \nHe uses hands-on experiences to show the relevance of math concepts, \nand makes subjects such as science, social studies and literature more \nmeaningful by associating them with real-world experiences. He has \nshared these strategies with other professionals throughout his \ndistrict and has also mentored student teachers from a local \nuniversity.\n  During the 2007-2008 school year, Mr. Minkel will serve as an ex-\nofficio member of the Arkansas State Board of Education. He will travel \nthe State providing professional and technical assistance to other \nteachers.\n  My home State of Arkansas is fortunate to have men and women of \nJustin Minkel's caliber who devote their lives to providing quality \neducation for our children. He exemplifies the commitment and energy \nthat will help to build a brighter future for the generations to come, \nand I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Justin Minkel on \nreceiving the 2006 Milken Family Foundation National Education Award. \nThis is a well deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S32-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S32]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to H.

FUNDING.\n\n       There are authorized such sums as necessary to carry out \n     this title.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncosponsoring S. 1, a bill to provide greater transparency in the \nlegislative process.\n  The recent elections sent a clear message to Congress that the \nAmerican people have lost confidence in their government. Without the \nsupport of the people, we cannot tackle the difficult issues that this \nCongress must face. This bill, then, is a critical part of restoring \nthe people's trust by reforming ethics and lobbying rules.\n  It is important to remember that the conduct of most Members and \ntheir staffs is beyond reproach. Likewise, it is important to recognize \nthat lobbying--whether done on behalf of the business community, an \nenvironmental organization, a children's advocacy group, or any other \ncause--can provide us with useful information and analysis that aids, \nbut does not dictate, the decision-making process. Unfortunately, in \nthe minds of many Americans, ``lobbying'' has come to be associated \nwith expensive paid vacations masquerading as fact-finding trips, \nspecial access to Members and staff that an ordinary citizen could \nnever hope to have, and undue influence that leads to decisions made in \nthe best interest of the lobbyist and his or her client instead of the \nAmerican people.\n  S. 1 which is nearly identical to a bill that was the product of \nbipartisan efforts by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs and the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration and that was passed by this Senate just last year--\nincludes a number of important provisions that will help to restore the \npublic image of the United States Congress.\n  S. 1 bans gifts from lobbyists. This is clear, brightline rule that \ndiminishes the appearance of impropriety that gifts can create.\n  S. 1 requires greater disclosure of the sponsors of and the purposes \nfor earmarks included in a bill so that the people can know where tax \ndollars are being spent and why.\n  S. 1 eliminates floor privileges for former Members who are seeking \nto lobby other members. They will enjoy no more access to Senators and \nCongressmen than any other citizen.\n  S. 1 will eliminate the practice of anonymous holds in the Senate so \nthat we can bring debate into the open and not simply kill a bill with \na secret hold.\n  S. 1 will require enhanced disclosure of the activities of groups \nlobbying Congress so that the public can easily find out which \ninterests are trying to influence the decisions we make.\n  S. 1 will slow the revolving door between the Hill and the private \nsector by limiting the ability of departing Members and staff to lobby \ntheir former colleagues.\n  While I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill, I also believe \nstrongly that it would be improved by the addition of an independent \nOffice of Public Integrity within the Legislative Branch. This Office \nwould be able to conduct nonpartisan investigations of possible ethics \nviolations. These investigations would help to promote public \nconfidence in the enforcement of any laws that we pass to enhance \ncongressional ethics. During debate on this bill last year, an \namendment that Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, and I offered to \ncreate this Office was defeated. However, I hope my colleagues have \ntaken the lessons of the recent elections to heart and that the idea of \nan Office of Public Integrity will be approved this year. To that end, \nI am also cosponsoring Senator McCain's lobbying reform package, which \nhe has introduced today and which contains a number of the provisions \nof S. 1 as well as creating an independent Office of Public Integrity.\n  I once again commend my colleagues on recognizing the importance of \nthis issue by making it our first priority in the 110th Congress. I \nurge the Senate to work quickly to get this legislation finished so \nthat we can move on from the task of governing ourselves and get down \nto the business of governing our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Biden, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Webb, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reed, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Harkin.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Healthy People 2010 sets forth a reduction of \n     unintended pregnancies as an important health objective for \n     the Nation to achieve over the first decade of the new \n     century, a goal first articulated in the 1979 Surgeon \n     General's Report, Healthy People, and reiterated in Healthy \n     People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention \n     Objectives.\n       (2) Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (referred to in this section as the ``CDC'') included family \n     planning in its published list of the Ten Great Public Health \n     Achievements in the 20th Century, the United States still has \n     one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies among \n     industrialized nations.\n       (3) Each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, nearly half of all \n     pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and nearly \n     half of unintended pregnancies end in abortion.\n       (4) In 2004, 34,400,000 women, half of all women of \n     reproductive age, were in need of contraceptive services and \n     supplies to help prevent unintended pregnancy, and nearly \n     half of those were in need of public support for such care.\n       (5) The United States has the highest rate of infection \n     with sexually transmitted diseases of any industrialized \n     country. In 2005, there were approximately 19,000,000 new \n     cases of sexually transmitted diseases, almost half of them \n     occurring in young people ages 15 to 24. According to the \n     CDC, these sexually transmitted diseases impose a tremendous \n     economic burden with direct medical costs as high as \n     $14,100,000,000 per year.\n       (6) Increasing access to family planning services will \n     improve women's health and reduce the rates of unintended \n     pregnancy, abortion, and infection with sexually transmitted \n     diseases. Contraceptive use saves public health dollars. For \n     every dollar spent to increase funding for family planning \n     programs under title X of the Public Health Service Act, \n     $3.80 is saved.\n       (7) Contraception is basic health care that improves the \n     health of women and children by enabling women to plan and \n     space births.\n       (8) Women experiencing unintended pregnancy are at greater \n     risk for physical abuse and women having closely spaced \n     births are at greater risk of maternal death.\n       (9) A child born from an unintended pregnancy is at greater \n     risk than a child born from an intended pregnancy of low \n     birth weight, dying in the first year of life, being abused, \n     and not receiving sufficient resources for healthy \n     development.\n       (10) The ability to control fertility allows couples to \n     achieve economic stability by facilitating greater \n     educational achievement and participation in the workforce.\n       (11) Without contraception, a sexually active woman has an \n     85 percent chance of becoming pregnant within a year.\n       (12) The percentage of sexually active women ages 15 \n     through 44 who were not using contraception increased from \n     5.4 percent to 7.4 percent in 2002, an increase of 37 \n     percent, according to the CDC. This represents an apparent \n     increase of 1,430,000 women and could raise the rate of \n     unintended pregnancy.\n       (13) Many poor and low-income women cannot afford to \n     purchase contraceptive services and supplies on their own. In \n     2003, 20.5 percent of all women ages 15 through 44 were \n     uninsured.\n       (14) Public health programs, such as the Medicaid program \n     and family planning programs under title X of the Public \n     Health Service Act, provide high-quality family planning \n     services and other preventive health care to underinsured or \n     uninsured individuals who may otherwise lack access to health \n     care.\n       (15) The Medicaid program is the single largest source of \n     public funding for family planning services and HIV/AIDS care \n     in the\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\n     United States. Half of all public dollars spent on \n     contraceptive services and supplies in the United States are \n     provided through the Medicaid program and more than 6,000,000 \n     low-income women of reproductive age rely on such program for \n     their basic health care needs.\n       (16) Each year, family planning services provided under \n     title X of the Public Health Service Act enable people in the \n     United States to prevent approximately 1,000,000 unintended \n     pregnancies, and one in three women of reproductive age who \n     obtains testing or treatment for sexually transmitted \n     diseases does so at a clinic receiving funds under such \n     title. In 2005, such clinics provided 2.5 million Pap smears, \n     over 5.3 million sexually transmitted disease tests, and over \n     6.2 million HIV tests.\n       (17) The combination of an increasing number of uninsured \n     individuals, stagnant funding for family planning, health \n     care inflation, new and expensive contraceptive technologies, \n     increasing costs of contraceptives, and improved but \n     expensive screening and treatment for cervical cancer and \n     sexually transmitted diseases, has diminished the ability of \n     clinics receiving funds under title X of the Public Health \n     Service Act to adequately serve all individuals in need of \n     services of such clinics. Taking inflation into account, \n     funding for the family planning programs under such title \n     declined by 59 percent between 1980 and 2005.\n       (18) While the Medicaid program remains the largest source \n     of subsidized family planning services, States are facing \n     significant budgetary pressures to cut their Medicaid \n     programs, putting many women at risk of losing coverage for \n     family planning services.\n       (19) In addition, eligibility under the Medicaid program in \n     many States is severely restricted, which leaves family \n     planning services financially out of reach for many poor \n     women. Many States have demonstrated tremendous success with \n     Medicaid family planning waivers that allow States to expand \n     access to Medicaid family planning services. However, the \n     administrative burden of applying for a waiver poses a \n     significant barrier to States that would like to expand their \n     coverage of family planning programs through Medicaid.\n       (20) As of December of 2006, 24 States offered expanded \n     family planning benefits as a result of Medicaid family \n     planning waivers. The cost-effectiveness of these waivers was \n     affirmed by a recent evaluation funded by the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services. This evaluation of six waivers \n     found that all family planning programs under such waivers \n     resulted in significant savings to both the Federal and State \n     governments. Moreover, the researchers found measurable \n     reductions in unintended pregnancy.\n       (21) Although employer-sponsored health plans have improved \n     coverage of contraceptive services and supplies, largely in \n     response to State contraceptive coverage laws, there is still \n     significant room for improvement. The ongoing lack of \n     coverage in health insurance plans, particularly in self-\n     insured and individual plans, continues to place effective \n     forms of contraception beyond the financial reach of many \n     women.\n       (22) Including contraceptive coverage in private health \n     care plans saves employers money. Not covering contraceptives \n     in employee health plans costs employers 15 to 17 percent \n     more than providing such coverage.\n       (23) Approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration, \n     emergency contraception is a safe and effective way to \n     prevent unintended pregnancy after unprotected sex. New \n     research confirms that easier access to emergency \n     contraceptives does not increase sexual risk-taking or \n     sexually transmitted diseases.\n       (24) The available evidence shows that many women do not \n     know about emergency contraception, do not know where to get \n     it, or are unable to access it. Overcoming these obstacles \n     could help ensure that more women use emergency contraception \n     consistently and correctly.\n       (25) A November 2006 study of declining pregnancy rates \n     among teens concluded that the reduction in teen pregnancy \n     between 1995 and 2002 is primarily the result of increased \n     use of contraceptives. As such, it is critically important \n     that teens receive accurate, unbiased information about \n     contraception.\n       (26) The American Medical Association, the American Nurses \n     Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \n     College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \n     Public Health Association, and the Society for Adolescent \n     Medicine, support responsible sexuality education that \n     includes information about both abstinence and contraception.\n       (27) Teens who receive comprehensive sexuality education \n     that includes discussion of contraception as well as \n     abstinence are more likely than those who receive abstinence-\n     only messages to delay sex, to have fewer partners, and to \n     use contraceptives when they do become sexually active.\n       (28) Government-funded abstinence-only-until-marriage \n     programs are precluded from discussing contraception except \n     to talk about failure rates. An October 2006 report by the \n     Government Accountability Office found that the Department of \n     Health and Human Services does not review the materials of \n     recipients of grants administered by such department for \n     scientific accuracy and requires grantees to review their own \n     materials for scientific accuracy. The GAO also reported on \n     the Department's total lack of appropriate and customary \n     measurements to determine if funded programs are effective. \n     In addition, a separate letter from the Government \n     Accountability Office found that the Department of Health and \n     Human Services is in violation of Federal law by failing to \n     enforce a requirement under the Public Health Service Act \n     that Federally-funded grantees working to address the \n     prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including \n     abstinence-only-until-marriage programs, must provide \n     medically accurate information about the effectiveness of \n     condoms.\n       (29) Recent scientific reports by the Institute of \n     Medicine, the American Medical Association, and the Office on \n     National AIDS Policy stress the need for sexuality education \n     that includes messages about abstinence and provides young \n     people with information about contraception for the \n     prevention of teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually \n     transmitted diseases.\n       (30) A 2006 statement from the American Public Health \n     Association (``APHA'') ``recognizes the importance of \n     abstinence education, but only as part of a comprehensive \n     sexuality education program . . . APHA calls for repealing \n     current federal funding for abstinence-only programs and \n     replacing it with funding for a new Federal program to \n     promote comprehensive sexuality education, combining \n     information about abstinence with age-appropriate sexuality \n     education.''\n       (31) Comprehensive sexuality education programs respect the \n     diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community \n     and will complement and augment the sexuality education \n     children receive from their families.\n       (32) Nearly half of the 40,000 annual new cases of HIV \n     infections in the United States occur in youth ages 13 \n     through 24. African American and Latino youth have been \n     disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. \n     Although African American adolescents, ages 13 through 19, \n     represent only 15 percent of the adolescent population in the \n     United States, they accounted for 73 percent of new AIDS \n     cases reported among adolescents in 2004. Latino adolescents, \n     ages age 13 through 19, accounted for 14 percent of AIDS \n     cases among adolescents, compared to 16 percent of all \n     adolescents in the United States, in 2004. Teens in the \n     United States contract an estimated 9.1 million sexually \n     transmitted infections each year. By age 24, at least one in \n     four sexually active people between the ages of 15 and 24 \n     will have contracted a sexually transmitted disease.\n       (33) Approximately 50 young people a day, an average of two \n     young people every hour of every day, are infected with HIV \n     in the United States.\n\n             TITLE I--TITLE X OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a \nprogram of educational assistance for members of the Armed Forces who \nserve in the Armed Forces after September 11, 2001, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of a bill \nthat I am introducing, entitled the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational \nAssistance Act of 2007. This bill is designed to expand the educational \nbenefits that our Nation offers to the brave men and women who have \nserved us so honorably since the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001.\n  As a veteran who hails from a family with a long history of military \nservice, I am proud to offer this bill as my first piece of legislation \nin the United States Senate.\n  Most of us know that our country has a tradition--since World War \nII--of offering educational assistance to returning veterans. In the \n1940s, the first G.I. bill helped transform notions of equality in \nAmerican society. The G.I. bill program was designed to help veterans \nreadjust to civilian life, avoid high levels of unemployment, and give \nveterans the opportunity to receive the education and training that \nthey missed while bravely serving in the military.\n  To achieve these goals, the post-World War II G.I. bill paid for \nveterans' tuition, books, fees, and other training costs, and also gave \na monthly stipend. After World War II, 7.8 million veterans used the \nbenefits given under the original G.I. bill in some form, out of a \nwartime veteran population of 15 million.\n  Over the last several decades, Congress subsequently passed several \nother G.I. bills, which also gave educational benefits to veterans. \nHowever, benefits awarded under those subsequent bills have not been as \ngenerous as our Nation's original G.I. bill.\n  Currently, veterans' educational benefits are administered under the \nMontgomery G.I. bill. This program periodically adjusts veterans' \neducational benefits, but the program is designed primarily for \npeacetime--not wartime--service.\n  Yet, now our Nation is fighting a worldwide war against terrorism. \nSince 9/11, we have witnessed a sharp increase in the demands placed \nupon our military. Many of our military members are serving two or \nthree tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. In light of these immense \nhardships, it is now time to implement a more robust educational \nassistance program for our heroic veterans who have sacrificed so much \nfor our great Nation.\n  The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 does just \nthat. This bill is designed to give our returning troops educational \nbenefits identical to the benefits provided to veterans after World War \nII.\n  The new benefits package under the bill I am introducing today will \ninclude the costs of tuition, room and board, and a monthly stipend of \n$1,000. By contrast, existing law under the Montgomery G.I. bill \nprovides educational support of up to $1,000 per month for four years, \ntotaling $9,000 for each academic year. This benefit simply is \ninsufficient after 9/11.\n  For example, costs of tuition, room, and board for an in-state \nstudent at George Mason University, located in\n\n[[Page S57]]\n\nFairfax, Virginia, add up to approximately $14,000 per year. In \naddition, existing law requires participating service members to pay \n$1,200 during their first year of service in order to even qualify for \nthe benefit.\n  Let me briefly summarize some of the reforms that are contained in \nthe bill I am introducing today.\n  First, these increased educational benefits will be available to \nthose members of the military who have served on active duty since \nSeptember 11, 2001. In general, to qualify, veterans must have served \nat least two years of active duty, with at least some period of active \nduty time served beginning on or after September 11, 2001.\n  Next, the bill provides for educational benefits to be paid for a \nduration of time that is linked to time served in the military. \nGenerally, veterans will not receive assistance for more than a total \nof 36 months, which equals four academic years.\n  Third, as I mentioned a moment ago, my bill would allow veterans \npursuing an approved program of education to receive payments covering \nthe established charges of their program, room and board, and a monthly \nstipend of $1,000. Moreover, the bill would allow additional payments \nfor tutorial assistance, as well as licensure and certification tests.\n  Fourth, veterans would have up to 15 years to use their educational \nassistance entitlement. But veterans would be barred from receiving \nconcurrent assistance from this program and another similar program, \nsuch as the Montgomery G.I. bill program.\n  Finally, under this bill, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs would \nadminister the program, promulgate rules to carry out the new law, and \npay for the program from funds made available to the Department of \nVeterans Affairs for the payment of readjustment benefits.\n  Again, I note that the benefits I have outlined today essentially \nmirror the benefits allowed under the G.I. bill enacted after World War \nII. That bill helped spark economic growth and expansion for a whole \ngeneration of Americans. The bill I introduce today likely will have \nsimilar beneficial effects. As the post-World War II experience so \nclearly indicated, better educated veterans have higher income levels, \nwhich in the long run will increase tax revenues.\n  Moreover, a strong G.I. bill will have a positive effect on military \nrecruitment, broadening the socio-economic makeup of the military and \nreducing the direct costs of recruitment.\n  Perhaps more importantly, better-educated veterans have a more \npositive readjustment experience. This experience lowers the costs of \ntreating post-traumatic stress disorder and other readjustment-related \ndifficulties.\n  The United States has never erred when it has made sustained new \ninvestments in higher education and job training. Enacting the Post-9/\n11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 is not only the right \nthing to do for our men and women in uniform, but it also is a strong \ntonic for an economy plagued by growing disparities in wealth, stagnant \nwages, and the outsourcing of American jobs.\n  Mr. President I am a proud veteran who is honored to serve this great \nNation. As long as I represent Virginians in the United States Senate, \nI will make it a priority to help protect our brave men and women in \nuniform.\n  I am honored that the Senate Majority Leader has agreed to join with \nme to be a defender and advocate of our veterans. The Majority Leader \nhas included the concepts of the bill I introduce today in his \nleadership bill designed to rebuild the United States military. \nAdditionally, I plan to work closely with Veterans' Affairs Committee \nChairman Akaka--and all of my Senate colleagues--to statutorily update \nG.I. benefits.\n  Together we can provide the deserving veterans of the 9/11 with the \nsame program of benefits that our fathers and grandfathers received \nafter World War II.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill I introduce today--the Post-9/11 \nVeterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007--be printed in the Record \nalong with this statement.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 22\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Post-9/11 Veterans \n     Educational Assistance Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked the United \n     States, and the brave members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States were called to the defense of the Nation.\n       (2) Service on active duty in the Armed Forces has been \n     especially arduous for the members of the Armed Forces since \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (3) The United States has a proud history of offering \n     educational assistance to millions of veterans, as \n     demonstrated by the many ``G.I. Bills'' enacted since World \n     War II. Educational assistance for veterans helps reduce the \n     costs of war, assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life \n     after wartime service, and boost the United States economy, \n     and has a positive effect on recruitment for the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (4) The current educational assistance program for veterans \n     is outmoded and designed for peacetime service in the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (5) The people of the United States greatly value military \n     service and recognize the difficult challenges involved in \n     readjusting to civilian life after wartime service in the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (6) It is in the national interest for the United States to \n     provide veterans who served on active duty in the Armed \n     Forces after September 11, 2001, with enhanced educational \n     assistance benefits that are worthy of such service and are \n     commensurate with the educational assistance benefits \n     provided by a grateful Nation to veterans of World War II.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote renewable fuel and energy security of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, over the past several years, our national \nenergy security has deteriorated rapidly. Petroleum and natural gas \nprices have gone up and appear to be staying up. Almost daily, we hear \nprojections of increases in electricity prices around the country. The \nenvironmental impacts of energy use, especially from autos and power \nplants, are still a major health concern. The evidence of climate \nchange is absolutely clear and very ominous, especially in the \ndisappearance of glaciers, the break up of polar ice sheets and the \nincreasing intensity of storms. We know that combustion of fossil fuels \nis the primary contributor of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases \nemissions that drive this global warming. Despite these negative \nconsequences, our dependence on petroleum is rising steadily, and we \nare importing over 60 percent of that petroleum from foreign sources, \nmany of whom are politically unstable or unfriendly to the United \nStates. In short, we need to initiate a major transition of our energy \nsector, to one that is far more efficient, is much less reliant on \nfossil fuels and imported oil, and is utilizing vastly more \ndomestically produced renewable energy.\n  We have seen waxing and waning concerns about our national energy \neconomy now for over 30 years. Many of us have believed all along that \nwe should be doing more to promote energy efficiency and to accelerate \nthe development and use of clean, domestic renewable energy, but during \nmost of that time, cheap energy supplies have lulled us into relatively \nminimal actions. Over the past three years, however, there has been an \nincreasingly acute awareness of the dire nature of our overall energy \nsituation. It is now clear that our energy situation is a serious \nthreat not only to our economy but to our national security. We can no \nlonger postpone action.\n  Today I am joined by my esteemed colleagues, Senator Lugar of \nIndiana, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, Senator Biden of Delaware, and \nSenator\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\nObama of Illinois, in introducing the Biofuels Security Act of 2007. \nThis bill directly addresses one of the most critical pieces of a sound \nnational energy transition policy. It charts a clear path forward for \nsignificantly increasing our national use of renewable fuels over the \nnext 24 years, reaching a total of 30 billion gallons per year by 2020, \nand 60 billion gallons per year by 2030. That latter figure represents \nabout one-third of our nation's current annual fuel use for highway \ntransportation. The production of the two most common forms of \nbiofuels, ethanol and biodiesel, is expanding rapidly. We have reason \nto believe that this provision will provide strong impetus to \nincreasing biofuels' production and use because it is an extension of \nthe renewable fuels standard that I promoted in the Energy Policy Act \nof 2005. That standard mandates using a total of 7.5 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuels by 2012, and already we are on a path to exceed that \nrequirement by 2008. Thus, we can be very optimistic about the success \nof setting these longer term and more aggressive targets.\n  This bill also will ensure that the vehicles to use these renewable \nfuels are readily available by requiring auto manufacturers over time \nto produce and sell increasing numbers of dual-fuel vehicles--that is, \nvehicles that can be fueled by gasoline or gasoline/ethanol blends. \nBecause the turnover of vehicles on the highway takes many years, our \nbill requires the fraction of dual-fuel vehicles to increase from 10 \npercent in 2008 up to 100 percent in 2017 and beyond. In order to \nassure availability of alternative fuels, our bill requires \ninstallation of increasing numbers of E-85 pumps by major oil companies \nat fueling stations that they own or license under their brand. These \npumps will dispense E-85, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent \ngasoline, which is a very popular renewable fuel because of its high \nethanol content. The bill will require 50 percent of such owned and \nlicensed stations to have pumps dispensing E-85 fuel by 2017. In \naddition, the bill includes a clause to ensure geographic distribution \nof such E-85 marketing stations.\n  Today I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in taking action to \nboost the transition to a cleaner, more resilient, and more secure \nenergy economy. I request support for this bill and its rapid \nenactment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 23\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to require a \nhealth advisory and monitoring of drinking water for perchlorate; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill that would require \nthat tap water be tested for perchlorate, and would ensure the public's \nright to know about perchlorate in their drinking water. I am pleased \nthat the senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and the senior \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, have joined as original \ncosponsors of this measure.\n  This toxin is a clear and present danger to California's and much of \nAmerica's health, and EPA needs to get moving and protect our drinking \nwater now. But until a perchlorate tap water standard is set, something \nmust be done.\n  Therefore, my perchlorate monitoring and right to know bill will \nrequire that: EPA first swiftly set a health advisory for perchlorate \nthat protects pregnant women, infants and children; second, that EPA \norder monitoring of drinking water for perchlorate until an enforceable \nstandard is set; and, third, that the public be told about perchlorate \nand its health effects, if it is detected in their drinking water \nsupply.\n  Drinking water sources for more than 20 million Americans are \ncontaminated with perchlorate. The Government Accountability Office \n(GAO) says that perchlorate contamination has been found in water and \nsoil at almost 400 sites in the U.S., with levels ranging from 4 parts \nper billion to millions of parts per billion. Perchlorate has polluted \n35 States and the District of Columbia, and is known to have \ncontaminated 153 public water systems in 26 States.\n  As we know, perchlorate can harm human health, especially that of \npregnant women and children. Therefore, all citizens whose tap water \nsystem contains perchlorate have a right to know about that \ncontamination, and about its potential health consequences. Only if \ntheir water is tested, and only if all systems are obligated to \ndisclose the contamination and its health effects, will we be assured \nthat the public is given the information that they deserve to protect \nthemselves and their families.\n  EPA's original 1999 rule for monitoring of tap water for unregulated \ncontaminants ordered testing for perchlorate. Just last year, on August \n22, 2005, EPA proposed to extend the requirement that perchlorate be \nmonitored in drinking water. However, on December 20, 2006, the \nAdministrator reversed himself and signed a final rule removing \nperchlorate from the list of contaminants for which monitoring is \nrequired under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation. I was \nshocked by this action.\n  As a result of this new rule, Americans will not be assured of up-to-\ndate information on whether their tap water is contaminated with this \ntoxin. Until EPA sets a tap water standard for perchlorate, at the very \nleast we should know if it's in our drinking water.\n  My bill will ensure that EPA acts swiftly to require water systems to \ntest for and to inform the public about this threat to our health and \nwelfare. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\n                                 S. 24\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Perchlorate Monitoring and \n     Right-to-Know Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) perchlorate--\n       (A) is a chemical used as the primary ingredient of solid \n     rocket propellant;\n       (B) is also used in fireworks, road flares, and other \n     applications.\n       (2) waste from the manufacture and improper disposal of \n     chemicals containing perchlorate is increasingly being \n     discovered in soil and water;\n       (3) according to the Government Accountability Office, \n     perchlorate contamination has been detected in water and soil \n     at almost 400 sites in the United States, with concentration \n     levels ranging from 4 parts per billion to millions of parts \n     per billion;\n       (4) the Government Accountability Office has determined \n     that the Environmental Protection Agency does not centrally \n     track or monitor perchlorate detections or the status of \n     perchlorate cleanup, so a greater number of contaminated \n     sites may already exist;\n       (5) according to the Government Accountability Office, \n     limited Environmental Protection Agency data show that \n     perchlorate has been found in 35 States and the District of \n     Columbia and is known to have contaminated 153 public water \n     systems in 26 States;\n       (6) those data are likely underestimates of total drinking \n     water exposure, as illustrated by the finding of the \n     California Department of Health Services that perchlorate \n     contamination sites have affected approximately 276 drinking \n     water sources and 77 drinking water systems in the State of \n     California alone;\n       (7) Food and Drug Administration scientists and other \n     scientific researchers have detected perchlorate in the \n     United States food supply, including in lettuce, milk, \n     cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, wheat, and spinach, \n     and in human breast milk;\n       (8)(A) perchlorate can harm human health, especially in \n     pregnant women and children, by interfering with uptake of \n     iodide by the thyroid gland, which is necessary to produce \n     important hormones that help control human health and \n     development;\n       (B) in adults, the thyroid helps to regulate metabolism;\n       (C) in children, the thyroid helps to ensure proper mental \n     and physical development; and\n       (D) impairment of thyroid function in expectant mothers or \n     infants may result in effects including delayed development \n     and decreased learning capability;\n       (9)(A) in October 2006, researchers from the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention published the largest, most \n     comprehensive study to date on the effects of low levels of \n     perchlorate exposure in women, finding that--\n       (i) significant changes existed in thyroid hormones in \n     women with low iodine levels who were exposed to perchlorate; \n     and\n       (ii) even low-level perchlorate exposure may affect the \n     production of hormones by the thyroid in iodine-deficient \n     women; and\n       (B) in the United States, about 36 percent of women have \n     iodine levels equivalent to or below the levels of the women \n     in the study described in subparagraph (A);\n       (10) the Environmental Protection Agency has not \n     established a health advisory or national primary drinking \n     water regulation for perchlorate, but instead established a \n     ``Drinking Water Equivalent Level'' of 24.5 parts per billion \n     for perchlorate, which--\n       (A) does not take into consideration all routes of exposure \n     to perchlorate;\n       (B) has been criticized by experts as failing to \n     sufficiently consider the body weight, unique exposure, and \n     vulnerabilities of certain pregnant women and fetuses, \n     infants, and children; and\n       (C) is based primarily on a small study and does not take \n     into account new, larger studies of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention or other data indicating potential \n     effects at lower perchlorate levels than previously found;\n       (11) on August 22, 2005 (70 Fed.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nestablish requirements for certain petitions submitted to the Food and \nDrug Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today on the first day of this new \nCongress to introduce the Citizen Petition Fairness and Accuracy Act of \n2007. This legislation will help speed the introduction of cost-saving \ngeneric drugs by preventing abuses of the Food and Drug Administration \ncitizen petition process.\n  Consumers continue to suffer all across our country from the high--\nand ever rising--cost of prescription drugs. A recent independent study \nfound that prescription drug spending has more than quadrupled since \n1990, and now accounts for 11 percent of all health care spending. At \nthe same time, the pharmaceutical industry is one of the most \nprofitable industries in the world, returning more than 15 percent on \ntheir investments.\n  One key method to bring prescription drug prices down is to promote \nthe introduction of generic alternatives to expensive brand name drugs. \nConsumers realize substantial savings once generic drugs enter the \nmarket. Generic drugs cost on average 63 percent less than their brand-\nname equivalents. One study estimates that every 1 percent increase in \nthe use of generic drugs could save $4 billion in health care costs.\n  This is why I have been so active in pursuing legislation designed to \ncombat practices which impede the introduction of generic drugs. The \nlegislation I introduce today, which I first introduced last year with \nSenator Leahy in last Congress, targets one particularly pernicious \npractice by brand name drug companies to impede or block the marketing \nof generic drugs--abuse of the FDA citizen petition process.\n  FDA rules permit any person to file a so-called ``citizen petition'' \nto raise concerns about the safety or efficacy of a generic drug that a \nmanufacturer is seeking FDA approval to bring to market. While this \ncitizen petition process was put in place for a laudable purpose, \nunfortunately in recent years it has been abused by frivolous petitions \nsubmitted by brand name drug manufacturers (or individuals acting at \ntheir behest) whose only purpose is to delay the introduction of \ngeneric competition. The FDA has a policy of not\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\ngranting any new generic manufacturer's drug application until after it \nhas considered and evaluated any citizen petitions regarding that drug. \nThe process of resolving a citizen petition (even if ultimately found \nto be groundless) can delay the approval by months or years. Indeed, \nbrand name drug manufacturers often wait to file citizen petitions \nuntil just before the FDA is about to grant the application to market \nthe new generic drug solely for the purpose of delaying the \nintroduction of the generic competitor for the maximum amount of time \npossible. This gaming of the system should not be tolerated.\n  In recent years, FDA officials have expressed serious concerns about \nthe abuse of the citizen petition process. In 2005, FDA Chief Counsel \nSheldon Bradshaw noted that ``[t]he citizen petition process is in some \ncases being abused. Sometimes, stakeholders try to use this mechanism \nto unnecessarily delay approval of a competitor's products.'' He added \nthat he found it ``particularly troublesome'' that he had ``seen \nseveral examples of citizen petitions that appear designed not to raise \ntimely concerns with respect to the legality or scientific soundness of \napproving a drug application, but rather to delay approval by \ncompelling the agency to take the time to consider the arguments raised \nin the petition, regardless of their merits, and regardless of whether \nthe petitioner could have made those very arguments months and months \nbefore.''\n  And a simple look at the statistics gives credence to these concerns. \nOf the 21 citizen petitions for which the FDA has reached a decision \nsince 2003, 20--or 95 percent of them--have been found to be without \nmerit. Of these, ten were identified as ``eleventh hour petitions'', \ndefined as those filed less than 6 months prior to the estimated entry \ndate of the generic drug. None of these ten ``eleventh hour petitions'' \nwere found to have merit, but each caused unnecessary delays in the \nmarketing of the generic drug by months or over a year, causing \nconsumers to spend millions and millions of dollars for their \nprescription drugs than they would have spent without these abusive \nfilings.\n  Despite the expense these frivolous citizen petitions cause consumers \nand the FDA, under current law the government has absolutely no ability \nto sanction or penalize those who abuse the citizen petition process, \nor who file citizen petitions simply to keep competition off the \nmarket. Our legislation will correct this obvious shortcoming and give \nthe Department of Health and Human Services--the FDA's parent agency \nthe power to sanction those who abuse the process.\n  Our bill will, for the first time, require all those who file citizen \npetitions to affirm certain basic facts about the truthfulness and good \nfaith of the petition, similar to what is required of every litigant \nwho makes a filing in court. The party filing the citizen petition will \nbe required to affirm that the petition is well grounded in fact and \nwarranted by law; is not submitted for an improper purpose, such as to \nharass or cause unnecessary delay in approval of competing drugs; and \ndoes not contain any materially false, misleading or fraudulent \nstatement. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \nis empowered to investigate a citizen petition to determine if it has \nviolated any of these principles, was submitted for an improper \npurpose, or contained false or misleading statements. Further, the \nSecretary is authorized to penalize anyone found to have submitted an \nabusive citizen petition. Possible sanctions include a fine up to one \nmillion dollars, a suspension or permanent revocation of the right of \nthe violator to file future citizens' petition, and a dismissal of the \npetition at issue. HHS is also authorized to refer the matter to the \nFederal Trade Commission so that the FTC can undertake its own \ninvestigation as to the competitive consequences of the frivolous \npetition and take any action it finds appropriate. Finally, the bill \ndirects the HHS that all citizen petitions be adjudicated within six \nmonths of filing, which will put an end to excessive delays in bringing \nneeded generic drugs to market because of the filings of these \npetitions.\n  While our bill will not have any effect on any person filing a truly \nmeritorious citizen petition, this legislation will serve as a strong \ndeterrent to attempts by brand name drug manufacturers or any other \nparty that seeks to abuse the citizen petition process to thwart \ncompetition. It will thereby remove one significant obstacle exploiting \nby brand name drug companies to prevent or delay the introduction of \ngeneric drugs. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 25\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the implementation of the San Joaquin River \nRestoration Settlement; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will bring to a close 18 years of litigation between the Natural \nResources Defense Council, the Friant Water Users Authority and the \nU.S. Department of the Interior. It is identical to the bill that we \nintroduced in the waning days of the 109th Congress.\n  This historic bill will enact a settlement that restores California's \nsecond longest river, the San Joaquin, while maintaining a stable water \nsupply for the farmers who have made the Valley the richest \nagricultural area in the world.\n  Without this consensus resolution to a long-running western water \nbattle the parties will continue the fight, resulting in a court \nimposed settlement. To my knowledge, every farmer and every \nenvironmentalist who has considered the possibility of continued \nlitigation believes that an outcome imposed by a judge is likely to be \nworse for everyone on all counts: more costly, riskier for the farmers, \nand less beneficial for the environment.\n  The Settlement provides a framework that the affected interests can \naccept. As a result, this legislation has the strong support of the \nBush Administration, the Schwarzenegger Administration, the \nenvironmental and fishing communities and numerous California farmers \nand water districts, including all 22 Friant water districts that have \nbeen part of the litigation.\n  In announcing the signing of this San Joaquin River settlement in \nSeptember, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior praised it as a \n``monumental agreement.'' And when the Federal Court then approved the \nSettlement in late October, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne \nfurther praised Settlement for launching ``one of the largest \nenvironmental restoration projects in California's history.'' The \nSecretary further observed that, ``This Settlement closes a long \nchapter of conflict and uncertainty in California's San Joaquin Valley \n. . . and open[s] a new chapter of environmental restoration and water \nsupply certainty for the farmers and their communities.''\n  I share the Secretary's strong support for this balanced and historic \nagreement, and it is my honor to join with Senator Boxer and a \nbipartisan group of California House Members in introducing legislation \nto approve and authorize this Settlement.\n  The legislation indicates how the settlement forged by the parties is \ngoing to be implemented. It involves the Departments of the Interior \nand Commerce, and essentially gives the Secretary of the Interior the \nadditional authority to: take the actions to restore the San Joaquin \nRiver; reintroduce the California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook \nSalmon; minimize water supply impacts on Friant water districts; and \navoid reductions in water supply for third-party water contractors.\n  One of the major benefits of this settlement is the restoration of a \nlong-lost salmon fishery. The return of one of California's most \nimportant salmon runs will create significant benefits for local \ncommunities in the San Joaquin Valley, helping to restore a beleaguered \nfishing industry while improving recreation and quality of life.\n  The legislation provides for improvements to the San Joaquin river \nchannel to allow salmon restoration to begin in 2014. Beginning in that \nyear, the river would see an annual flow regime mandated by the \nSettlement, with pulses of additional water in the spring and greater \nflows available in wetter years. There is flexibility to add or \nsubtract up to 10 percent from the annual flows, as the best science \ndictates.\n  A visitor to the revitalized river channel in a decade will find an \nentirely different place providing recreation for residents of small \ntowns like Mendota, and a refuge for residents of larger cities like \nFresno.\n  The legislation I am introducing today includes provisions to benefit \nthe farmers of the San Joaquin Valley as well as the salmon. In wet \nyears, Friant contractors can purchase surplus flows at $10 per acre-\nfoot for use in dry years, far less than the approximately $35 per \nacre-foot that they would otherwise pay for this water.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to recirculate new \nrestoration flows from the Delta via the California aqueduct and the \nCross-Valley Canal to provide additional supply for Friant.\n  Today's legislation also includes substantial protections for other \nwater districts in California who were not party to the original \nsettlement negotiations. These other water contractors will be able to \navoid all but the smallest water impacts as a result of the settlement, \nexcept on a voluntary basis.\n  In addition, the restoration of flows for over 150 miles below Friant \nDam, and reconnecting the upper River to the critical San Joaquin-\nSacramento Delta, will be a welcome change for the more than 22 million \nCalifornians who rely on that crucial source for their drinking water.\n  Finally, restoring the San Joaquin as a living salmon river may \nultimately help struggling fishing communities on California's North \nCoast--and even into Southern Oregon. The restoration of the San \nJoaquin and the government's commitment to reintroduce and rebuild \nhistoric salmon populations provide a rare bright spot for these \ncommunities.\n  In addition to congratulating the parties for making a settlement \nthat will enable the long-sought restoration of the San Joaquin River, \nI am mindful of and remain committed to progress in implementing and \nfunding the December 19, 2000, Trinity River restoration record of \ndecision and the Hoopa Valley Tribe's co-management of the decision's \nimportant goal of restoring the fishery resources that the United \nStates holds in trust for the Tribe.\n  Support of this agreement is almost as far reaching as its benefits. \nThis historic agreement would not have been possible without the \nparticipation of a remarkably broad group of agencies, stakeholders and \nlegislators, reaching far beyond the settling parties. The Department \nof the Interior, the State of California, the Friant Water Users \nAuthority, the Natural Resources Defense Council on behalf of 13 other \nenvironmental organizations and countless other stakeholders came \ntogether and spent countless hours with legislators in Washington to \nensure that we found a solution that the large majority of those \naffected could support.\n  In November of last year, California voters showed their support by \napproving Propositions 84 and 1E that will help pay for the Settlement \nby committing at least $100 million and likely $200 million or more \ntoward the restoration costs. Indeed, this Legislation includes a \ndiverse mix of approximately $200 million in direct Water User \npayments, new State payments, $240 million in dedicated Friant Central \nValley Project capital repayments, and future Federal appropriations \nlimited to $250 million. This mix of funding sources is intended to \nensure that the river restoration program will be sustainable over time \nand truly a joint effort of Federal, state and local agencies.\n  I would like to emphasize that the Federal funding in the bill is for \nimplementation of both the Restoration Goal to reestablish a salmon \nfishery in the river, and the Water Management Goal to avoid or \nminimize water supply losses supplied by Friant Water Districts. It is \ncritical to recognize that these efforts are of equal importance.\n  At the end of the day, I believe that this agreement is something \nthat we can all feel very proud of, and I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to move quickly to approve this legislation and provide the \nAdministration the authorization it needs to fully carry out its\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\nlegal obligations and the extensive restoration opportunities under the \nsettlement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 27\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       (ii) addresses the following matters:\n\n       (I) The basis for the Secretary's determination, whether \n     set out in environmental review documents or otherwise, as to \n     whether the expansion of Reach 4B would be the preferable \n     means to achieve the Restoration Goal as provided in the \n     Settlement, including how different factors were assessed \n     such as comparative biological and habitat benefits, \n     comparative costs, relative availability of State cost-\n     sharing funds, and the comparative benefits and impacts on \n     water temperature, water supply, private property, and local \n     and downstream flood control.\n       (II) The Secretary's final cost estimate for expanding \n     Reach 4B capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second, or any \n     alternative route selected, as well as the alternative cost \n     estimates provided by the State, by the Restoration \n     Administrator, and by the other parties to the Settlement.\n\n[[Page S69]]\n\n       (III) The Secretary's plan for funding the costs of \n     expanding Reach 4B or any alternative route selected, whether \n     by existing Federal funds provided under this Act, by non-\n     Federal funds, by future Federal appropriations, or some \n     combination of such sources.\n\n       (B) Determination required.--The Secretary shall, to the \n     extent feasible, make the determination in subparagraph (A) \n     prior to undertaking any substantial construction work to \n     increase capacity in Reach 4B.\n       (3) Costs.--If the Secretary's estimated Federal cost for \n     expanding Reach 4B in paragraph (2), in light of the \n     Secretary's funding plan set out in paragraph (2), would \n     exceed the remaining Federal funding authorized by this Act \n     (including all funds reallocated, all funds dedicated, and \n     all new funds authorized by this Act and separate from all \n     commitments of State and other non-Federal funds and in-kind \n     commitments), then before the Secretary commences actual \n     construction work in Reach 4B (other than planning, design, \n     feasibility, or other preliminary measures) to expand \n     capacity to 4500 cubic feet per second to implement this \n     Settlement, Congress must have increased the applicable \n     authorization ceiling provided by this Act in an amount at \n     least sufficient to cover the higher estimated Federal costs.\n\n     SEC. 10. CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY SPRING RUN CHINOOK SALMON.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the implementation of the \n     Settlement to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation \n     regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     reintroduction of the California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon is a unique and unprecedented circumstance \n     that requires clear expressions of Congressional intent \n     regarding how the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) are utilized to achieve the \n     goals of restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     successful reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring \n     Run Chinook salmon.\n       (b) Reintroduction in the San Joaquin River.--California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon shall be \n     reintroduced in the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam \n     pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1539(j)) and the Settlement, provided that \n     the Secretary of Commerce finds that a permit for the \n     reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon may be issued pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) \n     of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1539(a)(1)(A)).\n       (c) Final Rule.--\n       (1) Definition of third party.--For the purpose of this \n     subsection, the term ``third party'' means persons or \n     entities diverting or receiving water pursuant to applicable \n     State and Federal law and shall include Central Valley \n     Project contractors outside of the Friant Division of the \n     Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.\n       (2) Issuance.--The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a \n     final rule pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(d)) governing the incidental take \n     of reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook \n     salmon prior to the reintroduction.\n       (3) Required components.--The rule issued under paragraph \n     (2) shall provide that the reintroduction will not impose \n     more than de minimus: water supply reductions, additional \n     storage releases, or bypass flows on unwilling third parties \n     due to such reintroduction.\n       (4) Applicable law.--Nothing in this section--\n       (A) diminishes the statutory or regulatory protections \n     provided in the Endangered Species Act for any species listed \n     pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1533) other than the reintroduced population of \n     California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon, \n     including protections pursuant to existing biological \n     opinions or new biological opinions issued by the Secretary \n     or Secretary of Commerce; or\n       (B) precludes the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce from \n     imposing protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) for other species listed pursuant to \n     section 4 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) because those \n     protections provide incidental benefits to such reintroduced \n     California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2024, the \n     Secretary of Commerce shall report to Congress on the \n     progress made on the reintroduction set forth in this section \n     and the Secretary's plans for future implementation of this \n     section.\n       (2) Inclusions.--The report under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) an assessment of the major challenges, if any, to \n     successful reintroduction;\n       (B) an evaluation of the effect, if any, of the \n     reintroduction on the existing population of California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon existing on the \n     Sacramento River or its tributaries;

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire the use of generic drugs under the Medicare part D prescription \ndrug program when available unless the brand name drug is determined to \nbe medically necessary; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Generics First \nAct. This legislation requires the use of available generic drugs under \nthe Medicare Part D prescription drug program, unless the brand name \ndrug is determined to be medically necessary by a physician.\n  Everywhere I go in Wisconsin, I see how prescription drug costs are a \ndrain on seniors, families, and businesses that are struggling to pay \ntheir health care bills. They want help now and we can respond by \nexpanding access to generic drugs. Generics, which on average cost 63 \npercent less than their brand-name counterparts, are a big part of the \nsolution to health care costs that are spiraling out of control.\n  The private and public sectors, as well as individuals, are seeking \nrelief from high drug costs, and Senate Special Committee on Aging has \nheard some remarkable success stories from some who have turned to \ngeneric drugs. Last year, General Motors testified that, in 2005, they \nspent $1.9 billion dollars on prescription drugs, 40 percent of their \ntotal health care spending. Their program to use generics first, when a \ngeneric drug is available, saves GM nearly $400 million a year.\n  Last year, millions of seniors exceeded the initial $2,250 Medicare \ndrug benefit and fell into the ``donut hole,'' where they had to pay \nthe full price of their drugs. Using less expensive, but equally \neffective, generic drugs will keep seniors out of the ``donut hole'' \nlonger and help them survive the gap in coverage.\n  Generic drugs approved by the FDA must meet the same rigorous \nstandards for safety and effectiveness as brand-name drugs. In addition \nto being safe and effective, the generic must have the same active \ningredient or ingredients, be the same strength, and have the same \nlabeling for the approved uses as the brand drug. Generics perform the \nsame as their respective brand name product.\n  Modeled after similar provisions in many state-administered Medicaid \nprograms, this measure would reduce the high costs of the new \nprescription drug program and keep seniors from reaching the current \ngap in coverage or ``donut hole'' by guiding beneficiaries toward cost-\nsaving generic drug alternatives.\n  We know generic drugs have the potential to save seniors thousands of \ndollars, and curb health spending for the Federal Government, \nemployers, and families. And every year, more blockbuster drugs are \ncoming off patent, setting up the potential for billions of dollars in \nsavings. This legislation is one piece of a larger agenda I'm pushing \nto remove the obstacles that prevent generics from getting to market, \nand making sure that every senior, every family, every business, and \nevery government program knows the value of generics and uses them to \nbring costs down. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\n                                 S. 28\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to clarify the tax treatment of certain payments made \nto homeowners by the Louisiana Recovery Authority and the Mississippi \nDevelopment Authority; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, at the end of the 109th Congress, I \nlearned that the Internal Revenue Service had a tax surprise for \ncitizens in my state of Louisiana and in Mississippi who are trying to \nrebuild after Katrina. This tax surprise will set back our recovery and \ndiscourage our citizens from coming home.\n  Let me explain to my colleagues what I am talking about. Both \nLouisiana and Mississippi have established programs to help families \nrebuild their homes and their lives after Katrina and Rita. Congress \nappropriated the money for these initiatives--more than $10 billion in \nall, and we are very grateful for the assistance. The Louisiana program \nis called the ``Road Home'' and it is administered by the Louisiana \nRecovery Authority (LRA). The program is now starting to get going. \nHomeowners are eligible to receive grants from the Road Home of up to \n$150,000 to help them rebuild or repair their homes. Rental properties \nare also eligible. Grants can also be used to buy out homes. The \nLouisianians who were displaced by the storms want to go home and the \nRoad Home program will get them there.\n  But the IRS has dug a big pothole in the middle of the Road Home by \nmaking some of these payments taxable. The way this tax surprise works \nis by requiring that any hurricane victim who claimed a casualty loss \ndeduction for damage to their home on their tax return for 2005 will \nhave to reduce that loss by the amount of any payment from the LRA. So \nif they had their taxes reduced in one year and received a Road Home \ngrant the next year, they have to essentially eliminate any benefit of \nthe earlier casualty loss deduction. Their taxes will go up.\n  Now I realize that under normal circumstances, when a person's home \nburns down, the roof caves in, or they are a victim of theft, they can \ntake a casualty loss deduction, provided it meets certain requirements. \nThe loss must exceed ten percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross \nincome, with a per loss floor of $100. In some circumstances, taxpayers \nare permitted to include a current-year casualty loss on an amended \nprior year return.\n  Immediately after Katrina, we enacted the Katrina Emergency Tax \nRelief Act (KETRA) that suspended the ten percent floor for casualty \nlosses incurred in the Hurricane Katrina disaster area, including those \nclaimed on amended returns. The purpose of the change in KETRA was \nsimple: we wanted to put money in the hands of Katrina victims as \nquickly as possible. We essentially encouraged taxpayers to take this \ncasualty loss, even by amending a past return. The IRS would then \nprovide them with a refund.\n  This was a very helpful proposal in the days immediately following \nKatrina, Mr. President. Hurricane victims needed that money. If you had \nlost your home, that money could help you pay for a place to live. Many \nhurricane victims lost their jobs and needed this money to see them \nthrough until they started working again. They used the money to begin \nthe rebuilding of their lives.\n  Congress encouraged people to take the new deduction by changing the \nlaw. Now the IRS wants to take it back.\n\n  I fully understand the policy behind what the IRS is doing. Casualty \nloss deductions are normally reduced by the amount of any insurance or \nother recovery they make on the loss. In fact, at the time the taxpayer \nmakes the deduction he or she is supposed to reduce the amount of the \nloss by any insurance recovery they reasonably expect to receive. If \nyou receive a larger payment than you expected at a future time, you \nmust claim it on your income tax return when you receive it.\n  The problem is that this policy will encourage people to leave \nLouisiana. If you took the casualty loss on your return, and you \nreceive a $150,000 Road Home payment to rebuild your house, you will \nhave a tax consequence. But if you took the casualty loss and sold your \nhouse to the LRA for the $150,000 payment, it is treated like a home \nsale and there is no tax. This policy creates a disincentive to \nrecovery. The Road Home will become the Road Out.\n  Congress has done a tremendous job passing legislation to encourage \ninvestment and the rebuilding of the Gulf Coast. At the end of the last \nsession we passed a tax extenders bill that contained a two-year \nextension of the bonus depreciation for investment in the most \nseriously damaged areas in the GO Zone. That investment is supposed to \nattract businesses and people to Louisiana and the Gulf. The IRS's \nactions will only keep people away. We should not put road blocks in \nthe way of the Road Home.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to eliminate this road block to \nour recovery and to clarify that Road Home payments are not to be \ntaxed. The hurricanes in 2005 were remarkable events causing \nunprecedented damage. As Congress has done in the past, we must \ncontinue to respond in unprecedented and innovative ways. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 41. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives to improve America's research competitiveness, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, back in 1962, Marshall McLuhan wrote, \n``The new electronic interdependence recreates the world in the image \nof a global village.'' Certainly, 40 years later, that concept is truer \nthan ever. As we prepare for the future in this global village, we need \nto affirm America's leadership role in the world.\n  The United States accounts for one-third of the world's spending on \nscientific research and development, ranking first among all countries. \nWhile this is impressive, relative to GDP, though, the United States \nfalls to sixth place. And the trends show that maintaining American \nleadership in the future depends on increased commitment to research \nand science.\n  Asia has recognized this. Asia is plowing more funding into science \nand education. China, in particular, understands that technological \nadvancement means security, independence, and economic growth. Spending \non research and development has increased by 140 percent in China, \nKorea and Taiwan. In America, it has increased by only 34 percent.\n  Asia's commitment is already paying off. More than a hundred Fortune \n500 companies have opened research centers in India and China. I have \nvisited some of them. I was impressed with the level of skill of the \nworkers I met there.\n  China's commitment to research, at $60 billion in expenditures, is \ndramatic by any measure. Over the last few years, China has doubled the \nshare of its economy that it invests in research. China intends to \ndouble the amount\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\ncommitted to basic research in the next decade. Currently, only America \nbeats out China in numbers of researchers in the workforce.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce the Research Competitiveness Act of \n2007. This bill would improve our research competitiveness in four \nmajor areas. All four address incentives in our tax code. Government \nalso supports research through federal spending. But I am not \naddressing those areas today.\n  First, my bill improves and simplifies the credit for applied \nresearch in section 41 of the tax code. This credit has grown to be \noverly complex, both for taxpayers and the IRS. Beginning in 2008, my \nbill would create a simpler 20 percent credit for qualifying research \nexpenses that exceed 50 percent of the average expenses for the prior 3 \nyears.\n  And just as important: The bill makes the credit permanent. Because \nthe credit has been temporary, it has simply not been as effective as \nit could be. Since its creation in 1981, it has been extended 11 times. \nCongress even allowed it to lapse during one period.\n  The credit last expired in December of 2005. After much consternation \nand delay, Congress passed a two-year extension just last month, \nextending the credit for 2006 and 2007. These temporary extensions have \ntaken their toll on taxpayers. In 2005, the experts at the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation wrote: ``Perhaps the greatest criticism of the \nR credit among taxpayers regards its temporary nature.'' Joint Tax \nwent on to say, ``A credit of longer duration may more successfully \ninduce additional research than would a temporary credit, even if the \ntemporary credit is periodically renewed.''\n\n  Currently, there are three different ways to claim a tax credit for \nqualifying research expenses. First, the ``traditional'' credit relies \non incremental increases in expenses compared to a mid-1980s base \nperiod. Second, the ``alternative incremental'' credit measures the \nincrease in research over the average of the prior 4 years.\n  Both of these credits have base periods involving gross receipts. \nUnder the new tax bill enacted last month, a third formula was created, \nwhich does not rely on gross receipts and is available only for 2007. \nMy bill simplifies these credits by using this new credit only, known \nas the ``Alternative Simplified Credit,'' based on research spending \nwithout reference to gross receipts. The current formulas hurt \ncompanies that have fluctuating sales. And it hurts companies that take \non a new line of business not dependent on research.\n  This new, simpler formula in my bill would not start until 2008. That \nstart date would give companies plenty of time to adjust their \naccounting.\n  The main complaint about the existing credits is that they are very \ncomplex, particularly the reference to the 20-year-old base period. \nThis base period creates problems for the taxpayer in trying to \ncalculate the credit. And it creates problems for the IRS in trying to \nadminister and audit those claims.\n  The new credit focuses only on expenses, not gross receipts. And it \nis still an incremental credit, so that companies must continue to \nincrease research spending over time. Further, this bill adds a mandate \nfor a Treasury study to look at substantiation issues and ensure that \ncurrent recordkeeping requirements assist the IRS without unduly \nburdening the taxpayer.\n  A tax credit is a cost-effective way to promote R A report by the \nCongressional Research Service finds that without government support, \ninvestment in R would fall short of the socially optimal amount. Thus \nCRS endorses Government policies to boost private sector R\n  Also, American workers who are engaged in R activities benefit from \nsome of the most intellectually stimulating, high-paying, high-skilled \njobs in the economy.\n  My own State of Montana has excellent examples of this economic \nactivity. During the 1990s, about 400 establishments in Montana \nprovided high-technology services, at an average wage of about $35,000 \nper year. These jobs paid nearly 80 percent more than the average \nprivate sector wage, which was less than $20,000 a year during the same \nperiod. Many of these jobs would never have been created without the \nassistance of the R credit.\n  My research bill would also establish a uniform reimbursement rate \nfor all contract and consortia R It would provide that 80 percent of \nexpenses for research performed for the taxpayer by other parties count \nas qualifying research expenses under the regular credit.\n  Currently, when a taxpayer pays someone else to perform research for \nthe taxpayer, the taxpayer can claim one of three rates in order to \ndetermine how much the taxpayer can include for the research credit. \nThe lower amount is meant to assure overhead expenses that normally do \nnot qualify for the R credit are not counted. Different rates, \nhowever, create unnecessary complexity. Therefore, my bill creates a \nuniform rate of 80 percent.\n  The second major research area that this bill addresses is the need \nto enhance and simplify the credit for basic research. This credit \nbenefits universities and other entities committed to basic research. \nAnd it benefits the companies or individuals who donate to them. My \nbill provides that payments under the university basic research credit \nwould count as contractor expenses at the rate of 100 percent.\n  The current formula for calculating the university basic research \ncredit--defined as research ``for the advancement of science with no \nspecific commercial objective''--is even more complex than the regular \ntraditional R credit. Because of this complexity, this credit costs \nless than one-half of 1 percent of the cost of the regular R credit. \nIt is completely underutilized. It needs to be simplified to encourage \nbusinesses to give more for basic research.\n  American universities have been powerful engines of scientific \ndiscovery. To maintain our premier global position in basic research, \nAmerica relies on sustained high levels of basic research funding and \nthe ability to recruit the most talented students in the world. The \ngestation of scientific discovery is long. At least at first, we cannot \nknow the commercial applications of a discovery. But America leads the \nworld in biotechnology today because of support for basic research in \nchemistry and physics in the 1960s. Maintaining a commitment to \nscientific inquiry, therefore, must be part of our vision for sustained \ncompetitiveness.\n  Translating university discoveries into commercial products also \ntakes innovation, capital, and risk. The Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies asked what kind of government intervention can \nmaintain technological leadership. One source of technological \ninnovation that provides America with comparative advantage is the \ncombination of university research programs, entrepreneurs, and risk \ncapital from venture capitalists, corporations, or governments. \nResearch clusters around Silicon Valley and North Carolina's Research \nTriangle exemplify this sort of combination.\n  The National Academies reached a similar conclusion in a 2002 review \nof the National Nanotechnology Initiatives. In a report, they wrote: \n``To enhance the transition from basic to applied research, the \ncommittee recommends that industrial partnerships be stimulated and \nnurtured to help accelerate the commercialization of national \nnanotechnology developments.''\n  To further that goal, the third major area this bill addresses is \nfostering the creation of research parks. This part of the bill would \nbenefit state and local governments and universities that want to \ncreate research centers for businesses incubating scientific \ndiscoveries with promise for commercial development.\n  Stanford created the nation's first high-tech research park in 1951, \nin response to the demand for industrial land near the university and \nan emerging electronics industry tied closely to the School of \nEngineering. The Stanford Research Park traces its origins to a \nbusiness started with $538 in a Palo Alto garage by two men named Bill \nHewlett and Dave Packard. The Park is now home to 140 companies in \nelectronics, software, biotechnology, and other high tech fields.\n  Similarly, the North Carolina Research Triangle was founded in 1959 \nby university, government, and business leaders with money from private \ncontributions. It now has 112 research and development organizations, \n37,600 employees, and capital investment of more than $2.7 billion. \nMore recently,\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\nVirginia has fostered a research park now housing 53 private-sector \ncompanies, nonprofits, VCU research institutes, and state laboratories. \nThe Virginia park employs more than 1,300 people.\n  The creation of these parks would seem to be an obvious choice. But \nit takes a significant commitment from a range of sources to bring them \ninto being. To foster the creation and expansion of these successful \nparks, my bill will encourage their creation through the use of tax-\nexempt bond financing. Allowing tax-exempt bond authority would bring \ndown the cost to establish such parks.\n  Foreign countries are emulating this successful formula. They are \nestablishing high-tech clusters through government and university \npartnerships with private industry.\n  Back in 2000, a partnership was formed to foster TechRanch to assist \nMontana State University and other Montana-based research institutions \nin their efforts to commercialize research. But TechRanch is \ndesperately in need of some new high-tech facilities. It could surely \nbenefit from a provision such as this. I encourage my Colleagues to \nvisit research parks in their states to see how my bill could be \nhelpful in fostering more successful ventures.\n  A related item is a small fix to help universities that use tax-\nexempt bonds to build research facilities primarily for federal \nresearch in the basic or fundamental research area. Some of these \nfacilities housing federal research--mostly NIH and NSF funded \nprojects--are in danger of losing their tax-exempt bond status. Counsel \nhave notified some state officials that they may be running afoul of a \nprohibition on ``private use'' in the tax code, because one private \nparty has a superior claim to others in the use of inventions that \nresult from research.\n  The complication comes from a 1980 law. In 1980, Congress enacted the \nPatent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, also known as the Bayh-Dole \nAct. The Bayh-Dole Act requires the Federal Government to retain a non-\nexclusive, royalty-free right on any discovery. In order to foster more \nbasic research through Federal-state-university partnerships, we need \nto clarify that this provision of the Bayh-Dole act does not cause \nthese bonds to lose their taxexempt status. And my bill directs the \nTreasury Department to do so. I understand that the Treasury Department \nis aware of this significant concern. Whether or not Congress enacts my \nlegislation, I hope that the Treasury Department will clarify the \nsituation soon.\n  The fourth major area that my bill addresses is innovation at the \nsmall business level. Last year, representatives of a number of small \nnanotechnology companies came to visit me. They told me that their \ngreatest problem was surviving what they called the ``valley of \ndeath.'' That's what they called the first few years of business, when \nan entrepreneur has a promising technology but little money to test or \ndevelop it. Many businesses simply do not survive the ``valley of \ndeath.'' I believe that Congress should find a way to assist these \nbusinesses with promising technology.\n  Nanotechnology, for instance, shows much promise. According to a \nrecent report, over the next decade, nanotechnology will affect most \nmanufactured goods. As stated in Senate testimony by one National \nScience Foundation official last year, ``Nanotechnology is truly our \nnext great frontier in science and engineering.'' It took me a while to \nunderstand just what nanotechnology is. But it is basically the control \nof things at very, very small dimensions. By understanding and \ncontrolling at that dimension, people can find new and unique \napplications. These applications range from common consumer products--\nsuch as making our sunblocks better--to improving disease-fighting \nmedicines--to designing more fuel-efficient cars.\n  So, to help these small businesses convert their promising science \ninto successful businesses, my bill would establish tax credits for \ninvestments in qualifying small technology innovation companies. These \nstruggling start-up ventures often cannot utilize existing incentives \nin the tax code--like the R tax credit--because they have no tax \nliability and may have little income for the first few years. They need \naccess to cheap capital to get through those first few research-\nintensive years.\n  The credit in my bill would be similar to the existing and successful \nNew Markets Tax Credit. The New Markets Credit has provided billions of \ndollars of investment to low-income communities across the country. In \nmy bill, entities with some expertise and knowledge of research would \nreceive an allocation from Treasury to analyze and select qualifying \nresearch investments. These investment entities would then target small \nbusiness with promising technologies that focus the majority of their \nexpenditures on activity qualifying as research expenses under the R \ncredit.\n  In sum, my bill would boost both applied and basic research. It would \nboost research by businesses big and small. And it would foster \nresearch by for-profit and non-profits alike.\n  McLuhan's quote about the global village was taken by many at the \ntime as a wake-up call to a changing world. Since then, many more \nleaders in this village have emerged. Let us work to see that the next \nbig technological advance is discovered here in America. Only through \ncontinued commitment to research can We ensure that it is.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 42.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nhealth care practitioners in rural areas with training in preventive \nhealth care, including both physical and mental care, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nPreventive Health Care Training Act, a bill that responds to the dire \nneed of our rural communities for quality health care and disease \nprevention programs. Almost one fourth of Americans live in rural areas \nand frequently lack access to adequate physical and mental health care. \nAs many as 21 million of the 34 million people living in underserved \nrural areas are without access to a primary care provider. Even in \nareas where providers do exist, there are numerous limits to access, \nsuch as geography, distance, lack of transportation, and lack of \nknowledge about available resources. Due to the diversity of rural \npopulations, language and cultural obstacles are often a factor in the \naccess to medical care.\n  Compound these problems with limited financial resources, and the \nresult is that many Americans living in rural communities go without \nvital health care, especially preventive care. Children fail to receive \nimmunizations and routine checkups. Preventable illnesses and injuries \noccur needlessly, and lead to expensive hospitalizations. Early \nsymptoms of emotional problems and substance abuse go undetected, and \noften develop into full-blown disorders.\n  An Institute of Medicine (IOM) report entitled, ``Reducing Risks for \nMental Disorders: Frontiers for Preventive Intervention Research,'' \nhighlights the benefits of preventive care for all health problems. The \ntraining of health care providers in prevention is crucial in order to \nmeet the demand for care in underserved areas. Currently, rural\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\nhealth care providers lack preventive care training opportunities.\n  Interdisciplinary preventive training of rural health care providers \nmust be encouraged. Through such training, rural health care providers \ncan build a strong educational foundation from the behavioral, \nbiological, and psychological sciences. Interdisciplinary team \nprevention training will also facilitate operations at sites with both \nhealth and mental health clinics by facilitating routine consultation \nbetween groups. Emphasizing the mental health disciplines and their \nservices as part of the health care team will contribute to the overall \nhealth of rural communities.\n  The Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act would implement the \nrisk-reduction model described in the IOM study. This model is based on \nthe identification of risk factors and targets specific interventions \nfor those risk factors. The human suffering caused by poor health is \nimmeasurable, and places a huge financial burden on communities, \nfamilies, and individuals. By implementing preventive measures to \nreduce this suffering, the potential psychological and financial \nsavings are enormous.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 53\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of services provided by nursing school clinics \nunder State medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Nursing School \nClinics Act. This measure builds on our concerted efforts to provide \naccess to quality health care for all Americans by offering grants and \nincentives for nursing schools to establish primary care clinics in \nunderserved areas where additional medical services are most needed. In \naddition, this measure provides the opportunity for nursing schools to \nenhance the scope of student training and education by providing \nfirsthand clinical experience in primary care facilities.\n  Primary care clinics administered by nursing schools are university \nor nonprofit primary care centers developed mainly in collaboration \nwith university schools of nursing and the communities they serve. \nThese centers are staffed by faculty and staff who are nurse \npractitioners and public health nurses. Students supplement patient \ncare while receiving preceptorships provided by college of nursing \nfaculty and primary care physicians, often associated with academic \ninstitutions, who serve as collaborators with nurse practitioners. To \ndate, the comprehensive models of care provided by nursing clinics have \nyielded excellent results, including significantly fewer emergency room \nvisits, fewer hospital inpatient days, and less use of specialists, as \ncompared to conventional primary health care.\n  This bill reinforces the principle of combining health care delivery \nin underserved areas with the education of advanced practice nurses. To \naccomplish these objectives, Title XIX of the Social Security Act would \nbe amended to designate that the services provided in these nursing \nschool clinics are reimbursable under Medicaid. The combination of \ngrants and the provision of Medicaid reimbursement furnishes the \nfinancial incentives for clinic operators to establish the clinics.\n  In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-effective \nand quality health care to all Americans, we must consider a wide range \nof proposals, both large and small. Most importantly, we must approach \nthe issue of health care with creativity and determination, ensuring \nthat all reasonable avenues are pursued. Nurses have always been an \nintegral part of health care delivery. The Nursing School Clinics Act \nrecognizes the central role nurses can perform as care givers to the \nmedically underserved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 54\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe individual alternative minimum tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there is a monster in the tax code. Like \nFrankenstein, the Alternative Minimum Tax brings back to life higher \ntaxes. Higher taxes that families had been told not to worry about are \nbrought back because of the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. It is a \nmonster that really cannot be improved. It cannot be made to\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nwork right. It is time to draw the curtain on this monster.\n  That is why I am pleased to join with my friend Chuck Grassley, and \nour fellow Committee colleagues, Senators Schumer, Kyl, and Crapo to \nintroduce legislation today that will repeal the individual AMT. Our \nbill simply says that beginning January 1, 2007, individuals will owe \nzero dollars under the AMT. Further, our bill provides that individuals \nwith AMT credits can continue to use those credits up to 90 percent of \ntheir regular tax liability.\n  If we don't act, in 2007, the family-unfriendly AMT will hit middle-\nincome families earning $61,000 with three children. What was once \nmeant to ensure that a handful of millionaires did not eliminate all \ntaxes through excessive deductions is now meaning millions of working \nfamilies, including thousands in my home State of Montana, are subject \nto a higher stealth tax. It is truly bizarre that we've designed a tax \nthat deems more children ``excessive deductions'' and punishes duly \npaying your State taxes. Already, 5,000 Montana families pay a higher \ntax because of the AMT. But this number could multiply many times over \nif we don't act soon.\n  Not only is the AMT unfair and poorly targeted, it is an awful mess \nto figure out. The National Taxpayer Advocate has singled out this item \nas causing the most complexity for individual taxpayers.\n  Of course, repeal does not come without cost and that cost is \nsignificant even if we assume the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts aren't \nextended. We are committed to working together to identify reasonable \noffsets. Certainly, I don't think we want a tax system unfairly placing \na higher tax burden on millions of middle-income families with \nchildren. But it doesn't serve those families either if our budget \ndeficit is significantly worse.\n  Like Frankenstein's monster, the AMT brings a most unpleasant \nreaction from those whom it encounters. It is time we end this drama \nand repeal the AMT.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 56. A bill to provide relief to the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada \nfor settlement of certain claims against the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, almost twelve years ago, I stood before \nyou to introduce a bill ``to provide an opportunity for the Pottawatomi \nNation in Canada to have the merits of their claims against the United \nStates determined by the United States Court of Federal Claims.''\n  That bill was introduced as Senate Resolution 223, which referred the \nPottawatomi's claim to the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims and required the Chief Judge to report back to the Senate and \nprovide sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable \nthe Congress to determine whether the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is legal or equitable in nature, and the amount of damages, \nif any, which may be legally or equitably due from the United States.\n  Seven years ago, the Chief Judge of the Court of Federal Claims \nreported back that the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has a legitimate \nand credible legal claim. Thereafter, by settlement stipulation, the \nUnited States has taken the position that it would be ``fair, just and \nequitable'' to settle the claims of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada \nfor the sum of $1,830,000. This settlement amount was reached by the \nparties after seven years of extensive, fact-intensive litigation. \nIndependently, the court concluded that the settlement amount is ``not \na gratuity'' and that the ``settlement was predicated on a credible \nlegal claim.'' Pottawatomi Nation in Canada, et al. v. United States, \nCong. Ref. 94-1037X at 28 (Ct. Fed. Cl., September 15, 2000) (Report of \nHearing Officer).\n  The bill I introduce today is to authorize the appropriation of those \nfunds that the United States has concluded would be ``fair, just and \nequitable'' to satisfy this legal claim. If enacted, this bill will \nfinally achieve a measure of justice for a tribal nation that has for \nfar too long been denied.\n  For the information of our colleagues, this is the historical \nbackground that informs the underlying legal claim of the Canadian \nPottawatomi.\n  The members of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada are one of the \ndescendant groups--successors-in-interest--of the historical \nPottawatomi Nation and their claim originates in the latter part of the \n18th century. The historical Pottawatomi Nation was aboriginal to the \nUnited States. They occupied and possessed a vast expanse in what is \nnow the States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, llinois, and Wisconsin. From \n1795 to 1833, the United States annexed most of the traditional land of \nthe Pottawatomi Nation through a series of treaties of cession--many of \nthese cessions were made under extreme duress and the threat of \nmilitary action. In exchange, the Pottawatomis were repeatedly made \npromises that the remainder of their lands would be secure and, in \naddition, that the United States would pay certain annuities to the \nPottawatomi.\n  In 1829, the United States formally adopted a Federal the policy of \nremoval--an effort to remove all Indian tribes from their traditional \nlands east of the Mississippi River to the west. As part of that \neffort, the government increasingly pressured the Pottawatomis to cede \nthe remainder of their traditional lands--some five million acres in \nand around the city of Chicago and remove themselves west. For years, \nthe Pottawatomis steadfastly refused to cede the remainder of their \ntribal territory. Then in 1833, the United States, pressed by settlers \nseeking more land, sent a Treaty Commission to the Pottawatomi with \norders to extract a cession of the remaining lands. The Treaty \nCommissioners spent 2 weeks using extraordinarily coercive tactics--\nincluding threats of war--in an attempt to get the Pottawatomis to \nagree to cede their territory. Finally, those Pottawatomis who were \npresent relented and on September 26, 1933, they ceded their remaining \ntribal estate through what would be known as the Treaty of Chicago. \nSeventy-seven members of the Pottawatomi Nation signed the Treaty of \nChicago. Members of the ``Wisconsin Band'' were not present and did not \nassent to the cession.\n  In exchange for their land, the Treaty of Chicago provided that the \nUnited States would give to the Pottawatomis 5 million acres of \ncomparable land in what is now Missouri. The Pottawatomi were familiar \nwith the Missouri land, aware that it was similar to their homeland. \nBut the Senate refused to ratify that negotiated agreement and \nunilaterally switched the land to five million acres in Iowa. The \nTreaty Commissioners were sent back to acquire Pottawatomi assent to \nthe Iowa land. All but seven of the original 77 signatories refused to \naccept the change even with promises that if they were dissatisfied \n``justice would be done.''\n  Treaty of Chicago, as amended, Article 4. Nevertheless, the Treaty of \nChicago was ratified as amended by the Senate in 1834. Subsequently, \nthe Pottawatomis sent a delegation to evaluate the land in Iowa. The \ndelegation reported back that the land was ``not fit for snakes to live \non.''\n  While some Pottawatomis removed westward, many of the Pottawatomis--\nparticularly the Wisconsin Band, whose leaders never agreed to the \nTreaty--refused to do so. By 1836, the United States began to \nforcefully remove Pottawatomis who remained in the east--with \ndevastating consequences. As is true with many other American Indian \ntribes, the forced removal westward came at great human cost. Many of \nthe Pottawatomi were forcefully removed by mercenaries who were paid on \na per capita basis government contract. Over one-half of the Indians \nremoved by these means died en route. Those who reached Iowa were \nalmost immediately removed further to inhospitable parts of Kansas \nagainst their will and without their consent.\n  Knowing of these conditions, many of the Pottawatomis including most \nof those in the Wisconsin Band vigorously resisted forced removal. To \navoid Federal troops and mercenaries, much of the Wisconsin Band \nultimately found it necessary to flee to Canada. They were often \npursued to the border by government troops, government-paid mercenaries \nor both. Official files of the Canadian and United States governments \ndisclose that many Pottawatomis were forced to leave their homes \nwithout their horses or any of their possessions other than the clothes \non their backs.\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\n  By the late 1830s, the government refused payment of annuities to any \nPottawatomi groups that had not removed west. In the 1860s, members of \nthe Wisconsin Band--those still in their traditional territory and \nthose forced to flee to Canada--petitioned Congress for the payment of \ntheir treaty annuities promised under the Treaty of Chicago and all \nother cession treaties. By the Act of June 25, 1864 (13 Stat. 172) the \nCongress declared that the Wisconsin Band did not forfeit their \nannuities by not removing and directed that the share of the \nPottawatomi Indians who had refused to relocate to the west should be \nretained for their use in the United States Treasury. (H.R. Rep. No. \n470, 64th Cong., p. 5, as quoted on page 3 of memo dated October 7, \n1949.) Nevertheless, much of the money was never paid to the Wisconsin \nBand.\n  In 1903, the Wisconsin Band--most of whom now resided in three areas, \nthe States of Michigan and Wisconsin and the Province of Ontario--\npetitioned the Senate once again to pay them their fair portion of \nannuities as required by the law and treaties. (Sen. Doc. No. 185, 57th \nCong., 2d Sess.) By the Act of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. 380), the \nCongress directed the Secretary of the Interior to investigate claims \nmade by the Wisconsin Band and establish a roll of the Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomis that still remained in the East. In addition, the Congress \nordered the Secretary to determine ``the[] [Wisconsin Bands] \nproportionate shares of the annuities, trust funds, and other moneys \npaid to or expended for the tribe to which they belong in which the \nclaimant Indians have not shared, [and] the amount of such monies \nretained in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the \nclamant Indians as directed the provision of the Act of June 25, \n1864.''\n  In order to carry out the 1906 Act, the Secretary of Interior \ndirected Dr. W.M. Wooster to conduct an enumeration of Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomi in both the United States and Canada. Dr. Wooster \ndocumented 2007 Wisconsin Pottawatomis: 457 in Wisconsin and Michigan \nand 1550 in Canada. He also concluded that the proportionate share of \nannuities for the Pottawatomis in Wisconsin and Michigan was $477,339 \nand that the proportionate share of annuities due the Pottawatomi \nNation in Canada was $1,517,226. The Congress thereafter enacted a \nseries of appropriation Acts from June 30, 1913 to May 29, 1928 to \nsatisfy most of money owed to those Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis \nresiding in the United States. However, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis \nwho resided in Canada were never paid their share of the tribal funds.\n  Since that time, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has diligently and \ncontinuously sought to enforce their treaty rights, although until this \ncongressional reference, they had never been provided their day in \ncourt. In 1910, the United States and Great Britain entered into an \nagreement for the purpose of dealing with claims between both \ncountries, including claims of Indian tribes within their respective \njurisdictions, by creating the Pecuniary Claims Tribunal. From 1910 to \n1938, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada diligently sought to have their \nclaim heard in this international forum. Overlooked for more pressing \ninternational matters of the period, including the intervention of \nWorld War I, the Pottawatomis then came to the U.S. Congress for \nredress of their claim.\n  In 1946, the Congress waived its sovereign immunity and established \nthe Indian Claims Commission for the purpose of granting tribes their \nlong-delayed day in court. The Indian Claims Commission Act (ICCA) \ngranted the Commission jurisdiction over claims such as the type \ninvolved here. In 1948, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis from both sides \nof the border--brought suit together in the Indian Claims Commission \nfor recovery of damages. Hannahville Indian Community v. U.S., No. 28 \n(Ind. Cl. Comm. Filed May 4, 1948). Unfortunately, the Indian Claims \nCommission dismissed Pottawatomi Nation in Canada's part of the claim \nruling that the Commission had no jurisdiction to consider claims of \nIndians living outside territorial limits of the United States. \nHannahville Indian Community v. U.S., 115 Ct. Cl. 823 (1950). The claim \nof the Wisconsin Band residing in the United States that was filed in \nthe Indian Claims Commission was finally decided in favor of the \nWisconsin Band by the U.S. Claims Court in 1983. Hannahville Indian \nCommunity v. United States, 4 Ct. Cl. 445 (1983). The Court of Claims \nconcluded that the Wisconsin Band was owed a member's proportionate \nshare of unpaid annuities from 1838 through 1907 due under various \ntreaties, including the Treaty of Chicago and entered judgment for the \nAmerican Wisconsin Band Pottawatomis for any monies not paid. Still the \nPottawatomi Nation in Canada was excluded because of the jurisdictional \nlimits of the ICCA.\n  Undaunted, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada came to the Senate and \nafter careful consideration, we finally gave them their long-awaited \nday in court through the congressional reference process. The court has \nnow reported back to us that their claim is meritorious and that the \npayment that this bill would make constitutes a ``fair, just and \nequitable'' resolution to this claim.\n  The Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has sought justice for over 150 \nyears. They have done all that we asked in order to establish their \nclaim. Now it is time for us to finally live up to the promise our \ngovernment made so many years ago. It will not correct all the wrongs \nof the past, but it is a demonstration that this government is willing \nto admit when it has left unfulfilled an obligation and that the United \nStates is willing to do what we can to see that justice--so long \ndelayed is not now denied.\n  Finally, I would just note that the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is supported through specific resolutions by the National \nCongress of American Indians, the oldest, largest and most-\nrepresentative tribal organization here in the United States, the \nAssembly of First Nations (which includes all recognized tribal \nentities in Canada), and each and every of the Pottawatomi tribal \ngroups that remain in the United States today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 56\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to deem certain \nservice in the organized military forces of the Government of the \nCommonwealth of the Philippines and the Philippine Scouts to have been \nactive service for purposes of benefits under programs administered by \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, many of you know of my continued support \nand advocacy on the importance of addressing the plight of Filipino \nWorld War II veterans. As an American, I believe the treatment of \nFilipino World War II veterans is bleak and shameful. The Philippines \nbecame a United States possession in 1898, when it was ceded by Spain, \nfollowing the Spanish-American War. In 1934, the Congress enacted the \nPhilippine Independence Act, Public Law 73-127, which provided a 10-\nyear\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\ntime frame for the independence of the Philippines. Between 1934 and \nfinal independence in 1946, the United States retained certain powers \nover the Philippines including the right to call military forces \norganized by the newly-formed Commonwealth government into the service \nof the United States Armed Forces.\n  The Commonwealth Army of the Philippines was called to serve with the \nUnited States Armed Forces in the Far East during World War II under \nPresident Roosevelt's July 26, 1941 military order. The Filipinos who \nserved were entitled to full veterans' benefits by reason of their \nactive service with our armed forces. Hundreds were wounded in battle \nand many hundreds more died in battle. Shortly after Japan's surrender, \nthe Congress enacted the Armed Forces Voluntary Recruitment Act of 1945 \nfor the purpose of sending Filipino troops to occupy enemy lands, and \nto oversee military installations at various overseas locations. These \ntroops were authorized to receive pay and allowances for services \nperformed throughout the Western Pacific. Although hostilities had \nceased, wartime service of these troops continued as a matter of law \nuntil the end of 1946.\n  Despite all of their sacrifices, on February 18, 1946, the Congress \npassed the Rescission Act of 1946, now codified as Section 107 of Title \n38 of the United States Code. The 1946 Act deemed that the service \nperformed by these Filipino veterans would not be recognized as \n``active service'' for the purpose of any U.S. law conferring ``rights, \nprivileges, or benefits.'' Accordingly, Section 107 denied Filipino \nveterans access to health care, particularly for non-service-connected \ndisabilities, and pension benefits. Section 107 also limited service-\nconnected disability and death compensation for Filipino veterans to 50 \npercent of what their American counterparts receive.\n  On May 27, 1946, the Congress enacted the Second Supplemental Surplus \nAppropriations Rescission Act, which duplicated the language that had \neliminated Filipino veterans' benefits under the First Rescission Act. \nThus, Filipino veterans who fought in the service of the United States \nduring World War II have been precluded from receiving most of the \nveterans' benefits that had been available to them before 1946, and \nthat are available to all other veterans of our armed forces regardless \nof race, national origin, or citizenship status.\n  The Filipino Veterans Equity Act, which I introduce today, would \nrestore the benefits due to these veterans by granting full recognition \nof service for the sacrifices they made during World War II. These \nbenefits include veterans health care, service-connected disability \ncompensation, non-service connected disability compensation, dependent \nindemnity compensation, death pension, and full burial benefits.\n  Throughout the years, I have sponsored several measures to rectify \nthe lack of appreciation America has shown to these gallant men and \nwomen who stood in harm's way with our American soldiers and fought the \ncommon enemy during World War II. It is time that we as a Nation \nrecognize our long-standing history and friendship with the \nPhilippines. Of the 120,000 that served in the Commonwealth Army during \nWorld War II, there are approximately 60,000 Filipino veterans \ncurrently residing in the United States and the Philippines. According \nto the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Filipino veteran population \nis expected to decrease to approximately 20,000 or roughly one-third of \nthe current population by 2010.\n  Heroes should never be forgotten or ignored; let us not turn our \nbacks on those who sacrificed so much. Let us instead work to replay \nall of these brave men for their sacrifices by providing them the \nveterans, benefits they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 57\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe reduction in the deductible portion of expenses for business meals \nand entertainment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to repeal \nthe current 50 percent tax deduction for business meals and \nentertainment expenses, and to restore the tax deduction to 80 percent \ngradually over a five-year period. Restoration of this deduction is \nessential to the livelihood of small and independent businesses as well \nas food service, travel, tourism, and entertainment industries \nthroughout the United States. These industries are being economically \nharmed as a result of the 50 percent tax deduction.\n  Small businesses rely heavily on the business meal to conduct \nbusiness, even more so than larger corporations. In releasing its study \nin May 2004, entitled he Impact of Tax Expenditure Policies on \nIncorporated Small Business, the Small Business Administration, SBA, \nOffice of Advocacy, found that small incorporated businesses benefit \nmore than their larger counterparts from the meal and entertainment tax \ndeduction. According to the study, small firms that take advantage of \nthe business-meal deduction reduce their effective tax rate by 0.75 \npercent on average, while larger firms only receive a 0.11 percent \nreduction in the effective tax rate. More importantly, the study \nstrongly suggests that full reinstatement of the business meal and \nentertainment deduction should be a major policy priority for small \nbusinesses.\n  Small companies often use restaurants as onference space to conduct \nmeetings or close deals. Meals are their best and sometimes only \nmarketing tool. Certainly, an increase in the meal and entertainment \ndeduction would have a significant impact on a small business bottom \nline. In addition, the effects on the overall economy would be \nsignificant.\n  Accompanying my statement is the National Restaurant Association \n(NRA), State-by-State chart reflecting the estimated economic impact of \nincreasing the business meal deductibility from 50 to 80 percent. The \nNRA estimates that an increase to 80 percent would increase business \nmeal sales by $8 billion and create a $26 billion increase to the \noverall economy.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the NRA State by State chart \nand the text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\n\n                   ESTIMATED IMPACT OF INCREASING BUSINESS MEAL DEDUCTIBILITY FROM 50% TO

Congress enacted \n     that rule to support the public service activities of tax-\n     exempt schools, universities, pension funds, and consortia of \n     such institutions. Our teaching hospitals require similar \n     support.\n       A New York Times article on June 21, 2002, described the \n     financial problems which nonprofit hospitals are facing to \n     modernize their facilities and meet the growing demand for \n     charitable medical care. The problems have grown more urgent \n     since that article appeared.\n       On November 22, 2006, the Wall Street Journal noted the \n     rising numbers of uninsured patients who fill hospital \n     emergency rooms without paying their bills. In 2005, 46.6 \n     million Americans had no health insurance. Compounding the \n     growing demand for charitable care, new safety and infection-\n     prevention standards require hospitals to undertake massive \n     improvements.\n       As a result, the article stated, for-profit hospitals are \n     moving from older areas to affiuent locations where residents \n     can afford to pay for treatment. These private hospitals, the \n     reporter pointed out, typically have no mandate for community \n     service. In contrast, nonprofit hospitals must fulfill a \n     community service requirement. They must stretch their \n     resources to provide increased charitable care, update their \n     facilities, and maintain skilled staffing. Both the Wall \n     Street Journal and the New York Times noted the resulting \n     closures of non-profit hospitals due to this financial \n     strain.\n       The problem is particularly severe for teaching hospitals. \n     As the Times article said, nonprofit hospitals provide nearly \n     all the postgraduate medical education in the United States. \n     Post-graduate medical instruction is by nature not \n     profitable. Instruction in the treatment of mental disorders \n     and trauma is especially costly.\n       Despite their financial problem the Nation's nonprofit \n     hospitals strive to deliver a very high level of service. A \n     study in the December 2006 issue of Archives of Internal \n     Medicine had surveyed hospitals' quality of care in four \n     areas of treatment.\n       It found that nonprofit hospitals consistently outperformed \n     for-profit hospitals. It also found that teaching hospitals \n     had a higher level of performance in treatment and diagnosis. \n     It said that investment in technology and staffing leads to \n     better care. And it recommended that alternative payments and \n     sources of payments be considered to finance these \n     improvements.\n       The success and financial constraints of non-profit \n     teaching hospitals is evident in the work of the Queen's \n     Health Systems in my State. This 146-year-old organization \n     maintains the largest, private, nonprofit hospital in Hawaii. \n     It serves as the primary clinical teaching facility for the \n     University of Hawaii's medical residency programs in \n     medicine, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, obstetrics-\n     gynecology, pathology, and psychiatry. It conducts \n     educational and training programs for nurses and allied \n     health personnel. It operates the only trauma unit as well as \n     the chief behavioral\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\n     health program in the State. It maintains clinics throughout \n     Hawaii, health programs for Native Hawaiians, and a small \n     hospital on a rural, economically depressed island. Its \n     medical reference library is the largest in the State. Not \n     the least, it annually provides millions of dollars in \n     uncompensated health services. To help pay for these \n     community benefits, the Queen's Health Systems, as other non-\n     profit teaching hospitals, relies significantly on income \n     from its endowment.\n       In the past, the Congress has allowed tax-exempt schools, \n     colleges, universities, and pension funds to invest their \n     endowment in real estate so as to better meet their financial \n     needs. Under the tax code these organizations can incur debt \n     for real estate investments without triggering the tax on \n     unrelated business activities.\n       If the Queen's Health Systems were part of a university, it \n     could borrow without incurring an unrelated business income \n     tax. Not being part of a university, however, a teaching \n     hospital and its support organization run into the tax code's \n     debt financing prohibition. Nonprofit teaching hospitals have \n     the same if not more pressing needs as universities, school, \n     and pension trusts. The same safe harbor rule should be \n     extended to teaching hospitals.\n       My bill would allow the support organizations for qualified \n     teaching hospitals to engage in limited borrowing to enhance \n     their endowment income. The proposal for teaching hospitals \n     is actually more restricted than current law for schools, \n     universities, and pension trusts. Under safeguards developed \n     by the Joint Committee on Taxation staff, a support \n     organization for a teaching hospital can not buy and develop \n     land on a commercial basis. The proposal is tied directly to \n     the organization endowment. The staff's revenue estimate show \n     that the provision with its general application will help a \n     number of teaching hospitals.\n       The U.S. Senate several times has acted favorably on this \n     proposal. The Senate adopted a similar provision in H.R. 1836 \n     the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001. The House \n     conferees on that bill, however, objected that the provision \n     was unrelated to the bill's focus on individual tax relief \n     and the conference deleted the provision from the final \n     legislation. Subsequently, the Finance Committee included the \n     provision in H.R. 7 the CARE Act of 2002 and in S. 476 the \n     CARE Act of 2003 which the Senate passed. In the last \n     Congress S. 6 the Marriage, Opportunity, Relief, and \n     Empowerment Act of 2005, which the Senate leadership \n     introduced, also included the proposal.\n       As the Senate Finance Committee's recent hearings show, \n     substantial health needs would go unmet if not for our \n     charitable hospitals. It is time for the Congress to assist \n     the Nation's teaching hospitals in their charitable, \n     educational service.\n       Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \n     bill be printed in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 59. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to advanced practice nurses and physician assistants \nunder the Medicaid Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Medicaid Advanced \nPractice Nurse and Physician Assistants Access Act of 2007.'' This \nlegislation would change Federal law to expand fee-for-service Medicaid \nto include direct payment for services provided by all nurse \npractitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and physician assistants. It \nwould ensure all nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and \nphysician assistants are recognized as primary care case managers, and \nrequire Medicaid panels to include advanced practice nurses on their \nmanaged care panels.\n  Advanced practice nurses are registered nurses who have attained \nadditional expertise in the clinical management of health conditions. \nTypically, an advanced practice nurse holds a master's degree with \ndidactic and clinical preparation beyond that of the registered nurse. \nThey are employed in clinics, hospitals, and private practices. While \nthere are many titles given to these advanced practice nurses, such as \npediatric nurse practitioners, family nurse practitioners, certified \nnurse midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and clinical \nnurse specialists, our current Medicaid law has not kept up with the \nmultiple specialties and titles of these advanced practitioners, nor \nhas it recognized the critical role physician assistants play in the \ndelivery of primary care.\n  I have been a long-time advocate of advanced practice nurses and \ntheir ability to extend health care services to our most rural and \nunderserved communities. They have improved access to health care in \nHawaii and throughout the United States by their willingness to \npractice in what some providers might see as undesirable locations--the \nextremely rural, frontier, or urban areas. This legislation ensures \nthey are recognized and reimbursed for providing the necessary health \ncare services patients need, and it gives those patients the choice of \nselecting advanced practice nurses and physician assistants as their \nprimary care providers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 59\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide a \nmeans for continued improvement in emergency medical services for \nchildren; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, along with my colleagues; Senators \nAkaka, Kennedy, Conrad and Dorgan, I introduce ``The Wakefield Act,'' \nalso known as the ``Emergency Medical Services for Children Act of \n2007.'' Since Senator Hatch and I worked toward authorization of EMSC \nin 1984, this program has become the impetus for improving children's \nemergency services Nationwide. From specialized training for emergency \ncare providers to ensuring ambulances and emergency departments have \nstate-of-the-art pediatric sized equipment, EMSC has served as the \nvehicle for improving survival of our smallest and most vulnerable \ncitizens when accidents or medical emergencies threatened their lives.\n  It remains no secret that children present unique anatomic, \nphysiologic, emotional and developmental challenges to our primarily \nadult-oriented emergency medical system. As has been said many times \nbefore, children are not little adults. Evaluation and treatment must \ntake into account their special needs, or we risk letting them fall \nthrough the gap between adult and pediatric care. The EMSC has bridged \nthat gap while fostering collaborative relationships among emergency \nmedical technicians, paramedics, nurses, emergency physicians, \nsurgeons, and pediatricians.\n  The Institute of Medicine's recently released study on Emergency Care \nfor\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\nChildren, indicated that our Nation is not as well prepared as once we \nthought. Only 6 percent of all emergency departments have the essential \npediatric supplies and equipment necessary to manage pediatric \nemergencies. Many of the providers of emergency care have received \nfragmented and little training in the skills necessary to resuscitate \nthis specialized population. Even our disaster preparedness plans have \nnot fully addressed the unique needs posed by children injured in such \nevents.\n  EMSC remains the only federal program dedicated to examining the best \nways to deliver various forms of care to children in emergency \nsettings. Re-authorization of EMSC will ensure that children's needs \nwill be given the due attention they deserve and that coordination and \nexpansion of services for victims of life-threatening illnesses and \ninjuries will be available throughout the United States.\n  I look forward to re-authorization of this important legislation and \nthe continued advances in our emergency healthcare delivery system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 60\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wakefield Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are 31,000,000 child and adolescent visits to the \n     nation's emergency departments every year, with children \n     under the age of 3 years accounting for most of these visits.\n       (2) Ninety percent of children requiring emergency care are \n     seen in general hospitals, not in free-standing children's \n     hospitals, with one-quarter to one-third of the patients \n     being children in the typical general hospital emergency \n     department.\n       (3) Severe asthma and respiratory distress are the most \n     common emergencies for pediatric patients, representing \n     nearly one-third of all hospitalizations among children under \n     the age of 15 years, while seizures, shock, and airway \n     obstruction are other common pediatric emergencies, followed \n     by cardiac arrest and severe trauma.\n       (4) Up to 20 percent of children needing emergency care \n     have underlying medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, \n     sickle-cell disease, low birthweight, and bronchopulmonary \n     dysplasia.\n       (5) Significant gaps remain in emergency medical care \n     delivered to children, with 43 percent of hospitals lacking \n     cervical collars (used to stabilize spinal injuries) for \n     infants, less than half (47 percent) of hospitals with no \n     pediatric intensive care unit having a written transfer \n     agreement with a hospital that does have such a unit, one-\n     third of States lacking a physician available on-call 24 \n     hours a day to provide medical direction to emergency medical \n     technicians or other non-physician emergency care providers, \n     and even those States with such availability lacking full \n     State coverage.\n       (6) Providers must be educated and trained to manage \n     children's unique physical and psychological needs in \n     emergency situations, and emergency systems must be equipped \n     with the resources needed to care for this especially \n     vulnerable population.\n       (7) The Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) \n     Program under section 1910 of the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 300w-9) is the only Federal program that focuses \n     specifically on improving the pediatric components of \n     emergency medical care.\n       (8) The EMSC Program promotes the nationwide exchange of \n     pediatric emergency medical care knowledge and collaboration \n     by those with an interest in such care and is depended upon \n     by Federal agencies and national organizations to ensure that \n     this exchange of knowledge and collaboration takes place.\n       (9) The EMSC Program also supports a multi-institutional \n     network for research in pediatric emergency medicine, thus \n     allowing providers to rely on evidence rather than anecdotal \n     experience when treating ill or injured children.\n       (10) States are better equipped to handle occurrences of \n     critical or traumatic injury due to advances fostered by the \n     EMSC program, with--\n       (A) forty-eight States identifying and requiring all EMSC-\n     recommended pediatric equipment on Advanced Life Support \n     ambulances;\n       (B) forty-four States employing pediatric protocols for \n     medical direction;\n       (C) forty-one States utilizing pediatric guidelines for \n     acute care facility identification, ensuring that children \n     get to the right hospital in a timely manner; and\n       (D) thirty-six of the forty-two States having statewide \n     computerized data collection systems now producing reports on \n     pediatric emergency medical services using statewide data.\n       (11) Systems of care must be continually maintained, \n     updated, and improved to ensure that research is translated \n     into practice, best practices are adopted, training is \n     current, and standards and protocols are appropriate.\n       (12) Now celebrating its twentieth anniversary, the EMSC \n     Program has proven effective over two decades in driving key \n     improvements in emergency medical services to children, and \n     should continue its mission to reduce child and youth \n     morbidity and mortality by supporting improvements in the \n     quality of all emergency medical and emergency surgical care \n     children receive.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to reduce child \n     and youth morbidity and mortality by supporting improvements \n     in the quality of all emergency medical care children \n     receive.\n\n     SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES FOR \n                   CHILDREN PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 1910 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300w-9) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``3-year period (with an \n     optional 4th year'' and inserting ``4-year period (with an \n     optional 5th year'';\n       (2) in subsection (d)--\n       (A) by striking ``and such sums'' and inserting ``such \n     sums''; and\n       (B) by inserting before the period the following: \n     ``$23,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, and such sums as may be \n     necessary for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2011'';\n       (3) by redesignating subsections (b) through (d) as \n     subsections (c) through (e), respectively; and\n       (4) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:\n       ``(b)(1) The purpose of the program established under this \n     section is to reduce child and youth morbidity and mortality \n     by supporting improvements in the quality of all emergency \n     medical care children receive, through the promotion of \n     projects focused on the expansion and improvement of such \n     services, including those in rural areas and those for \n     children with special healthcare needs.

A bill to amend chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, to \nauthorize the use of clinical social workers to conduct evaluations to \ndetermine work-related emotional and mental illnesses; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Clinical Social \nWorkers' Recognition Act to correct a continuing problem in the Federal \nEmployees Compensation Act. This bill will also provide clinical social \nworkers the recognition they deserve as independent providers of \nquality mental health care services.\n  Clinical social workers are authorized to independently diagnose and \ntreat mental illnesses through public and private health insurance \nplans across the Nation. However, Title V of the United States Code, \ndoes not permit the use of mental health evaluations conducted by \nclinical social workers for use as evidence in determining workers' \ncompensation claims brought by federal employees. The bill I am \nintroducing corrects this problem.\n  It is a sad irony that federal employees may select a clinical social \nworker through their health plans to provide mental health services, \nbut may not go to this same professional for workers' compensation \nevaluations. The failure to recognize the validity of evaluations \nprovided by clinical social workers unnecessarily limits federal \nemployees' selection of a provider to conduct the workers' compensation \nmental health evaluations. Lack of this recognition may well impose an \nundue burden on Federal employees where clinical social workers are the \nonly available providers of mental health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to treat certain hospital support organizations as \nqualified organizaitons for purposes of determining acquisition \nindebtedness; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the legislation I have introduced will \nextend to qualified teaching hospital support organizations the \nexisting debt-financed safe harbor rule. Congress enacted that rule to \nsupport the public service activities of tax-exempt schools, \nuniversities, pension funds, and consortia of such institutions. Our \nteaching hospitals require similar support.\n  A New York Times article on June 21, 2002, described the financial \nproblems which nonprofit hospitals are facing to modernize their \nfacilities and meet the growing demand for charitable medical care. The \nproblems have grown more urgent since that article appeared.\n  On November 22, 2006, the Wall Street Journal noted the rising \nnumbers of uninsured patients who fill hospital emergency rooms without \npaying their bills. In 2005, 46.6 million Americans had no health \ninsurance. Compounding the growing demand for charitable care, new \nsafety and infection-prevention standards require hospitals to \nundertake massive improvements.\n  As a result, the article stated, for-profit hospitals are moving from \nolder areas to affluent locations where residents can afford to pay for \ntreatment. These private hospitals, the reporter pointed out, typically \nhave no mandate for community service. In contrast, nonprofit hospitals \nmust fulfill a community service requirement. They must stretch their \nresources to provide increased charitable care, update their \nfacilities, and maintain skilled staffing. Both the Wall Street Journal \nand the New York Times noted the resulting closures of nonprofit \nhospitals due to this financial strain.\n  The problem is particularly severe for teaching hospitals. As the \nTimes article said, nonprofit hospitals provide nearly all the \npostgraduate medical education in the United States. Post-graduate \nmedical instruction is by nature not profitable. Instruction in the \ntreatment of mental disorders and trauma is especially costly.\n  Despite their financial problem the nation's nonprofit hospitals \nstrive to deliver a very high level of service. A study in the December \n2006 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine had surveyed hospitals' \nqualify of care in four areas of treatment. It found that nonprofit \nhospitals consistently outperformed for-profit hospitals. It also found \nthat teaching hospitals had a higher level of performance in treatment \nand diagnosis. It said that investment in technology and staffing leads \nto better care. And it recommended that alternative payments and \nsources of payments be considered to finance these improvements.\n  The success and financial constraints of nonprofit teaching hospitals \nis evident in the work of the Queen's Health Systems in my State. This \n146-year-old organization maintains the largest, private, nonprofit \nhospital in Hawaii. It serves as the primary clinical teaching facility \nfor the University of Hawaii's medical residency programs in medicine, \ngeneral surgery, orthopedic surgery, obstetrics-gynecology, pathology, \nand psychiatry. It conducts educational and training programs for \nnurses and allied health personnel. It operates the only trauma unit as \nwell as the chief behavioral health program in the State. It maintains \nclinics throughout Hawaii, health programs for Native Hawaiians, and a \nsmall hospital on a rural, economically depressed island. Its medical \nreference library is the largest in the State. Not the least, it \nannually provides millions of dollars in uncompensated health services. \nTo help pay for these community benefits, the Queen's Health Systems, \nas other nonprofit teaching hospitals, relies significantly on income \nfrom its endowment.\n  In the past, the Congress has allowed tax-exempt schools, colleges, \nuniversities, and pension funds to invest their endowment in real \nestate so as to better meet their financial needs. Under the tax code \nthese organizations can incur debt for real estate investments without \ntriggering the tax on unrelated business activities.\n  If the Queen's Health Systems were part of a university, it could \nborrow without incurring an unrelated business income tax. Not being \npart of a university, however, a teaching hospital and its support \norganization run into the tax code's debt financing prohibition. \nNonprofit teaching hospitals have the same if not more pressing needs \nas universities, school, and pension trusts. The same safe harbor rule \nshould be extended to teaching hospitals.\n  My bill would allow the support organizations for qualified teaching \nhospitals to engage in limited borrowing to enhance their endowment \nincome. The proposal for teaching hospitals is actually more restricted \nthan current law for schools, universities, and pension trusts. Under \nsafeguards developed by the Joint Committee on Taxation staff, a \nsupport organization for a teaching hospital can not buy and develop \nland on a commercial basis. The proposal is tied directly to the \norganization endowment. The staff's revenue estimate show that the \nprovision with its general application will help a number a teaching \nhospitals.\n  The U.S. Senate several times has acted favorably on this proposal. \nThe Senate adopted a similar provision in H.R. 1836 the Economic Growth \nand Tax Relief Act of 2001. The House conferees on that bill, however, \nobjected that the provision was unrelated to the bill's focus on \nindividual tax relief and the conference deleted the provision from the \nfinal legislation. Subsequently, the Finance Committee included the \nprovision in H.R. 7 the CARE Act of 2002 and in S. 476 the CARE Act of \n2003 which the Senate passed. In the last Congress S. 6 the Marriage, \nOpportunity, Relief, and Empowerment Act of 2005, which the Senate \nleadership introduced, also included the proposal.\n  As the Senate Finance Committee's recent hearings show, substantial \nhealth needs would go unmet if not for our charitable hospitals. It is \ntime for the Congress to assist the nation's teaching hospitals in \ntheir charitable, educational service.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 62\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to authorize \nthe autonomous functioning of clinical psychologists and clinical \nsocial workers within the Medicare comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facility program.\n  In my judgment, it is unfortunate that Medicare requires clinical \nsupervision of the services provided by certain health professionals \nand does not allow them to function to the full extent of their state \npractice licenses. Those who need the services of outpatient \nrehabilitation facilities should have access to a wide range of social \nand behavioral science expertise. Clinical psychologists and clinical \nsocial workers are recognized as independent providers of mental health \ncare services under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the \nTRICARE Military Health Program of the Uniformed Services, the Medicare \n(Part B) Program, and numerous private insurance plans. This \nlegislation will ensure that these qualified professionals achieve the \nsame recognition under the Medicare comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facility program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 63\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, on behalf of our Nation's clinical social \nworkers, I am introducing legislation to amend the Public Health \nService Act. This legislation would: 1. establish a new social work \ntraining program, 2. ensure that social work students are eligible for \nsupport under the Health Careers Opportunity Program, 3. provide social \nwork schools with eligibility for support under the Minority Centers of \nExcellence programs, 4. permit schools offering degrees in social work \nto obtain grants for training projects in geriatrics, and 5. ensure \nthat social work is recognized as a profession under the Public Health \nMaintenance Organization Act.\n  Despite the impressive range of services social workers provide to \npeople of this nation, few federal programs exist to provide \nopportunities for social work training in health and mental health \ncare.\n  Social workers have long provided quality mental health services to \nour citizens and continue to be at the forefront of establishing \ninnovative programs to serve our disadvantaged populations. I believe \nit is important to ensure that the special expertise social workers \npossess continues to be available to the citizens of this nation. This \nbill, by providing financial assistance to schools of social work and \nsocial work students, acknowledges the long history and critical \nimportance of the services provided by social work professionals.

A bill to modify the age-60 standard for certain pilots and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today, as an experienced pilot over \nage 60, along with my colleagues, Senator Stevens, Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Feingold, to once again introduce a bill that will help end \nage discrimination among commercial airline pilots. Our bill will \nabolish the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) arcane Age 60 Rule \na regulation that has unjustly forced the retirement of airline pilots \nthe day they turn 60 for more than 45 years.\n  Our bipartisan bill called the ``Freedom to Fly Act'' would replace \nthe dated FAA rule with a new international standard adopted this past \nNovember by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) which \nallows pilots to fly to 65 as long as the copilot is under 60.\n  Since the adoption of the ICAO standard in November of this year, \nforeign pilots have been flying and working in U.S. Airspace under this \nnew standard up to 65 years of age a privilege the FAA has not been \nwilling to grant to American pilots flying the same aircraft in the \nsame airspace.\n  This bill may seem familiar; I have introduced similar legislation in \nthe past two Congresses and I am dedicated to ensuring its passage this \nyear. And it has never been more urgent.\n  We cannot continue to allow our FAA to force the retirement of \nAmerica's most experienced commercial pilots at the ripe young age of \n60 while they say to their counterparts flying for foreign flags \n``Welcome to our airspace.''\n  Many of these great American pilots are veterans who have served our \ncountry and the flying public for decades. Many of them have suffered \nwage concessions and lost their pensions as the airline industry has \nfaced hard times and bankruptcies. But these American pilots are not \nasking for a handout.\n  They are just saying to the FAA; ``Give me the same right you granted \nour foreign counterparts with the stroke of a pen this November. Let us \ncontinue to fly, continue to work, continue to contribute to the tax \nrolls for an additional 5 years.'' We join them and echo their \nsentiments to FAA Administrator Blakey. As far as we are concerned, \nthat is the least we can do for America's pilots, who are considered \nthe best and the safest pilots in the world.\n  Most nations have abolished mandatory age 60 retirement rules. Many \ncountries, including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have no upper \nage limit at all and consider an age-based retirement rule \ndiscriminatory. Sadly though, the United States was one of only four \nmember countries of ICAO, along with Pakistan, Colombia, and France, to \ndissent to the ICAO decision to increase the retirement age to 65 last \nyear.\n  The Age 60 Rule has no basis in science or safety and never has. The \nAerospace Medical Association says that ``There is insufficient medical \nevidence to support restriction of pilot certification based upon age \nalone.'' Similarly, the American Association of Retired Persons, Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, the Seniors Coalition, and the \nNational Institute of Aging of NIH all agree that the Age 60 Rule is \nsimply age discrimination and should end. My colleagues and I agree.\n  When the rule was implemented in 1960 life expectancies were much \nlower at just over 69 and a half years. Today they are much higher at \nmore than 77 years. The FAA's own data shows that pilots over age 60 \nare as safe as, and in some cases safer than, their younger \ncounterparts. In the process of adopting the new international \nstandard, ICAO studied more than 3,000 over-60 pilots from 64 nations, \ntotaling at least 15,000 pilot-years of flying experience and found the \nrisk of medical incapacitation ``a risk so low that it can be safely \ndisregarded.''\n  Furthermore, a recent economic study shows that allowing pilots to \nfly to age 65 would save almost $1 billion per year in added Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and tax payments and delayed Pension Benefit \nGuarantee Corporation (PBGC) payments.\n  I am encouraged by the progress that has been made. In the 109th \nCongress, the Senate Commerce Committee reported the modified bill with \nthe ICAO standard favorably and the Senate Transportation, Treasury, \nthe Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Committee included a version of S. 65 in its bill. The \nFAA recently convened an Aviation Rulemaking Committee to study the \nissue of forced retirement. We have yet to see that report but it is \nour understanding the report was persuasive enough that the \nAdministrator is considering a change in the rule now.\n  We are encouraged by that, but we also know that legislation will be \nneeded to direct the FAA to pursue these changes in a timely manner and \nin a way that will protect companies and their unions from new lawsuits \nthat might arise as a result of the changes. Our bill accomplishes \nthat. Whether the FAA decides to change the rule on its own or not, \nCongress needs to do the right thing and pass S. 65 to fully ensure \nthat our own American pilots have the same rights and privileges to \nwork at least until age 65 that were accorded to foreign pilots over \nthe age of 60 this fall.\n  I urge the rest of my colleagues to support the Freedom to Fly Act \nand help us keep America's most experienced pilots in the air.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 66. A bill to require the Secretary of the Army to determine the \nvalidity of the claims of certain Filipinos that they performed \nmilitary service on behalf of the United States during World War II; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am reintroducing legislation today that \nwould direct the Secretary of the Army to determine whether certain \nnationals of the Philippine Islands performed military service on \nbehalf of the United States during World War II.\n  Our Filipino veterans fought side by side with Americans and \nsacrificed their lives on behalf of the United States. This legislation \nwould confirm the validity of their claims and further allow qualified \nindividuals the opportunity to apply for military and veterans benefits \nthat, I believe, they are entitled to. As this population becomes \nolder, it is important for our Nation to extend its firm commitment to \nthe Filipino veterans and their families who participated in making us \nthe great Nation that we are today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 66\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit former \nmembers of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability \nrated as total to travel on military aircraft in the same manner and to \nthe same extent as retired members of the Armed Forces are entitled to \ntravel on such aircraft; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill which is \nof great importance to a group of patriotic Americans. This legislation \nis designed to extend space-available travel privileges on military \naircraft to those who have been totally disabled in the service of our \ncountry.\n  Currently, retired members of the Armed Services are permitted to \ntravel on a space-available basis on non-scheduled military flights \nwithin the continental United States, and on scheduled overseas flights \noperated by the Military Airlift Command. My bill would provide the \nsame benefits for veterans with 100 percent service-connected \ndisabilities.\n  We owe these heroic men and women who have given so much to our \ncountry a debt of gratitude. Of course, we can never repay them for the \nsacrifices they have made on behalf of our Nation, but we can surely \ntry to make their lives more pleasant and fulfilling. One way in which \nwe can help is to extend military travel privileges to these \ndistinguished American veterans. I have received numerous letters from \nall over the country attesting to the importance attached to this issue \nby veterans. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues show their concern and \njoin me in saying ``thank you'' by supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 67\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TRAVEL ON MILITARY AIRCRAFT OF CERTAIN DISABLED \n                   FORMER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 53 of title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 1060b the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 1060c. Travel on military aircraft: certain disabled \n       former members of the armed forces\n\n       ``The Secretary of Defense shall permit any former member \n     of the armed forces who is entitled to compensation under the \n     laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for a \n     service-connected disability rated as total to travel, in the \n     same manner and to the same extent as retired members of the \n     armed forces, on unscheduled military flights within the \n     continental United States and on scheduled overseas flights \n     operated by the Air Mobility Command. The Secretary of \n     Defense shall permit such travel on a space-available \n     basis.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the \n     item relating to section 1060b the following new item:\n\n``1060c.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the Hollings \nManufacturing Extension Partnership Program, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kohl-Snowe \nlegislation which would fund the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, \nMEP, for fiscal year 2008-fiscal year 2012. I am a long-time supporter \nof the MEP program and believe manufacturing is crucial to the U.S. \neconomy. American manufacturers are a cornerstone of the American \neconomy and embody the best in American values. A healthy manufacturing \nsector is key to better jobs, rising productivity and higher standards \nof living in the United States. Every individual and industry depends \non manufactured goods. In addition, innovations and productivity gains \nin the manufacturing sector provide benefits far beyond the products \nthemselves.\n  Small- and medium-sized manufacturers face unprecedented challenges \nin today's global economy which threaten the existence of manufacturing \njobs in the United States. If it isn't China pirating our technologies \nand promising a low-wage workforce, it is soaring heath care and energy \ncosts that cut into profits. Manufacturers today are seeking ways to \nlevel the playing field so they can compete globally.\n  One way to level the playing field--and increase the competitiveness \nof manufacturers--is through the MEP program. MEP streamlines \noperations, integrates new technologies, shortens production times and \nlowers costs, leading to improved efficiency by offering resources to \nmanufacturers, including organized workshops and consulting projects. \nIn Wisconsin, three of our largest corporations--John Deere, Harley-\nDavidson, and Oshkosh Truck--are working with Wisconsin MEP centers to \ndevelop domestic supply chains. I am proud to say that these companies \nfound it more profitable to work with small- and medium-sized Wisconsin \nfirms than to look overseas for cheap labor.\n  You would be hard pressed to find another program that has produced \nthe results that MEP has. In Wisconsin alone in fiscal year 2006, WMEP \nreported 2,696 new or retained workers, sales of $163 million, cost \nsavings of $33 million, and plant and equipment investments of $37 \nmillion.\n  Manufacturing is an integral part of a web of inter-industry \nrelationships that create a stronger economy. Manufacturing sells goods \nto other sectors in the economy and, in turn, buys products and \nservices from them. Manufacturing spurs demand for everything from raw \nmaterials to intermediate components to software to financial, legal, \nhealth, accounting, transportation, and other services in the course of \ndoing business.\n  The future of manufacturing in the United States will be largely \ndetermined by how well small- and medium-sized companies cope with the \nchanges in today's global economy. To be successful, businesses need \nstate-of-the-art technologies to craft products more efficiently, a \nskilled workforce to meet the demands of modern manufacturers and a \ncommitment from the government to provide the resources to allow \ncompanies to remain competitive.\n  At a time when economic recovery and global competitiveness are \nnational priorities, I believe MEP continues to be a wise investment.\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 70. A bill to restore the traditional day of observance of \nMemorial Day, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in our effort to accommodate many \nAmericans by making Memorial Day the last Monday in May, we have lost \nsight of the significance of this day to our Nation. My bill would \nrestore Memorial Day to May 30 and authorize our flag to fly at half \nmast on that day. In addition, this legislation would authorize the \nPresident to issue a proclamation designating Memorial Day and Veterans \nDay as days for prayer and ceremonies. This legislation would help \nrestore the recognition our veterans deserve for the sacrifices they \nhave made on behalf of our nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 70\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \ncertain disabled former prisoners of war to use Department of Defense \ncommissary and exchange stores; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nenable those former prisoners of war who have been separated honorably \nfrom their respective services and who have been rated as having a 30 \npercent service-connected disability to have the use of both the \nmilitary commissary and post exchange privileges. While I realize it is \nimpossible to adequately compensate one who has endured long periods of \nincarceration at the hands of our Nation's enemies, I do feel this \ngesture is both meaningful and important to those concerned because it \nserves as a reminder that our Nation has not forgotten their \nsacrifices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 71\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide improved reimbursement for clinical social worker services \nunder the medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to correct discrepancies \nin the reimbursement of clinical social workers covered through \nMedicare, Part B. The three proposed changes contained in this \nlegislation clarify the current payment process for clinical social \nworkers and establish a reimbursement methodology for the profession \nthat is similar to other health care professionals reimbursed through \nthe Medicare program.\n  First, this legislation sets payment for clinical social worker \nservices according to a fee schedule established by the Secretary. \nSecond, it explicitly states that services and supplies furnished by a \nclinical social worker are a covered Medicare expense, just as these \nservices are covered for other mental health professionals in Medicare. \nThird, the bill allows clinical social workers to be reimbursed for \nservices provided to a client who is hospitalized.\n  Clinical social workers are valued members of our health care \nprovider network. They are legally regulated in every State of the \nNation and are recognized as independent providers of mental health \ncare throughout the health care system. It is time to correct the \ndisparate reimbursement treatment of this profession under Medicare.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 72\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for patient protection by establishing minimum nurse staffing \nratios at certain Medicare providers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Registered Nurse \nSafe Staffing Act. For over four decades I have been a committed \nsupporter of nurses and the delivery of safe patient care. While \nenforceable regulations will help to ensure patient safety, the \ncomplexity and variability of today's hospitals require that staffing \npatterns\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\nbe determined at the hospital and unit level, with the professional \ninput of registered nurses. More than a decade of research demonstrates \nthat nurse staff levels and the skill mix of nursing staff directly \naffect the clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients. Studies show \nthat when there are more registered nurses, there are lower mortality \nrates, shorter lengths of stay, reduced costs, and fewer complications.\n  A study published in the Journal of The American Medical Association \nfound that the risks of patient mortality rose by 7 percent for every \nadditional patient added to the average nurse's workload. In the midst \nof a nursing shortage and increasing financial pressures, hospitals \noften find it difficult to maintain adequate staffing. While nursing \nresearch indicates that adequate registered nurse staffing is vital to \nthe health and safety of patients, there is no standardized public \nreporting mechanism, nor enforcement of adequate staffing plans. The \nonly regulations addressing nursing staff exists vaguely in Medicare \nConditions of Participation which states: ``The nursing service must \nhave an adequate number of licensed registered nurses, licensed \npractice (vocational) nurse, and other personnel to provide nursing \ncare to all patients as needed''.\n  This bill will require Medicare Participating Hospitals to develop \nand maintain reliable and valid systems to determine sufficient \nregistered nurse staffing. Given the demands that the healthcare \nindustry faces today, it is our responsibility to ensure that patients \nhave access to adequate nursing care. However, we must ensure that the \ndecisions by which care is provided are made by the clinical experts, \nthe registered nurses caring for these patients. Support of this bill \nsupports our nation's nurses during a critical shortage, but more \nimportantly, works to ensure the safety of their patients.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 73\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Registered Nurse Safe \n     Staffing Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are hospitals throughout the United States that \n     have inadequate staffing of registered nurses to protect the \n     well-being and health of the patients.\n       (2) Studies show that the health of patients in hospitals \n     is directly proportionate to the number of registered nurses \n     working in the hospital.\n       (3) There is a critical shortage of registered nurses in \n     the United States.\n       (4) The effect of that shortage is revealed in unsafe \n     staffing levels in hospitals.\n       (5) Patient safety is adversely affected by these unsafe \n     staffing levels, creating a public health crisis.\n       (6) Registered nurses are being required to perform \n     professional services under conditions that do not support \n     quality health care or a healthful work environment for \n     registered nurses.\n       (7) As a payer for inpatient and outpatient hospital \n     services for individuals entitled to benefits under the \n     Medicare program established under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act, the Federal Government has a compelling \n     interest in promoting the safety of such individuals by \n     requiring any hospital participating in such program to \n     establish minimum safe staffing levels for registered nurses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reaffirm the authority of the Comptroller General to \naudit and evaluate the programs, activities, and financial transactions \nof the intelligence community, and for other purposes; to the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce ``The Intelligence \nCommunity Audit Act of 2007,'' with Senator Lautenberg. This \nlegislation reaffirms the authority of the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States and head of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to \naudit the financial transactions and evaluate the programs and \nactivities of the intelligence community (IC).\n  Our bill is identical to S. 3968, introduced in the last Congress by \nSenator Lautenberg and myself, and to H.R. 6252, introduced in the \nHouse by Representative Bennie Thompson.\n  The need for more effective oversight and accountability of our \nintelligence community has never been greater. In the war against \nterrorism, intelligence agencies are both the spear and the shield: the \nfirst line of our attack and of our defense. Failure can bear terrible \nconsequences.\n  Congress has two responsibilities: the first is to ensure that our \nintelligence community is performing its mission effectively, and the \nsecond is to ensure that in performing its mission, the intelligence \ncommunity is not violating the constitutional rights of individual \nAmericans.\n  Yet the ability of Congress to ensure that the intelligence community \nhas sufficient resources and capability of performing its mission has \nnever been more in question. The establishment of the Department of \nHomeland Security and the passage of the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004 created a new institutional landscape \nlittered by new intelligence agencies with ever increasing demands and \nresponsibilities. These new agencies became members of an already \npopulated club of organizations performing intelligence related \nfunctions.\n  The intelligence community today consists of 19 different agencies or \ncomponents: the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; \nCentral Intelligence Agency; Department of Defense; Defense \nIntelligence Agency; National Security Agency; Departments of the Army, \nNavy, Marine Corps, and Air Force; Department of State; Department of \nTreasury; Department of Energy; Department of Justice; Federal Bureau \nof Investigation; National Reconnaissance Office; National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency; Coast Guard; Department of Homeland Security, and \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  Congress too has increased its oversight responsibilities. Committees \nother than the intelligence committees of the House and Senate have \njurisdiction over such departments as Homeland Security, State, \nDefense, Justice, Energy, Treasury, and Commerce.\n  But all of these ``non-intelligence'' committees are restricted in \ntheir ability to conduct effective oversight of intelligence function \nof the agencies under their jurisdiction because, unfortunately, the \nintelligence community stonewalls the Government Accountability Office \n(GAO) when committees\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\nof jurisdiction request that GAO investigate problems. This is \nhappening despite the clear responsibility of Congress to ensure that \nthese agencies are operating effectively to protect America.\n  It is inconceivable that the GAO--the audit arm of the U.S. \nCongress--has been unable to conduct evaluations of the CIA for over 40 \nyears. If the GAO had been able to conduct basic auditing functions of \nthe CIA, perhaps some of the problems that were so clearly exposed \nfollowing the terrorist attacks in September 2001 would have been \nresolved. And yet, it is extraordinary that five years after 9-11, the \nsame problems persist.\n  Two recent incidents have made this situation disturbingly clear. At \na hearing entitled, ``Access Delayed: Fixing the Security Clearance \nProcess, Part II,'' before my Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, on \nNovember 9, 2005, GAO was asked about steps it would take to ensure \nthat the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Office of Management \nand Budget, and the intelligence community met the goals and objectives \noutlined in the OPM security clearance strategic plan. Fixing the \nsecurity clearance process, which is on GAO's high-risk list, is \nessential to our national security. But as GAO observed in a written \nresponse to a question raised by Senator Voinovich, ``while we have the \nauthority to do such work, we lack the cooperation we need to get our \njob done in that area.''\n  A similar case arose in response to a GAO investigation for the \nSenate Homeland Security Committee and the House Government Reform \nCommittee on how agencies are sharing terrorism-related and sensitive \nbut unclassified information. The report, entitled ``Information \nSharing, the Federal Government Needs to Establish Policies and \nProcesses for Sharing Terrorism-Related and Sensitive but Unclassified \nInformation'' (GAO-06-385), was released in March 2006.\n  At a time when Congress is criticized by members of the 9-11 \nCommission for failing to implement its recommendations, we should \nremember that improving terrorism information sharing among agencies \nwas one of the critical recommendations of the Commission. Moreover, \nthe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated \nthe sharing of terrorism information through the creation of an \nInformation Sharing Environment. Yet, when asked by GAO for comments on \nthe GAO report, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \nrefused, stating that ``the review of intelligence activities is beyond \nGAO's purview.''\n  A Congressional Research Service memorandum entitled, ``Overview of \n`Classified' and `Sensitive but Unclassified' Information,'' concludes, \n``it appears that pseudo-classification markings have, in some \ninstances, had the effect of deterring information sharing for homeland \nsecurity.''\n  Unfortunately I have more examples that predate the post 9-11 \nreforms. Indeed, in July 2001, in testimony, entitled ``Central \nIntelligence Agency, Observations on GAO Access to Information on CIA \nPrograms and Activities'' (GAO-01-975T) before the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform, the GAO noted, as a practical manner, ``our access \nis generally limited to obtaining information on threat assessments \nwhen the CIA does not perceives [sic] our audits as oversight of its \nactivities.''\n  The bill I introduce today does not detract from the authority of the \nintelligence committees. In fact, the language makes explicit that the \nComptroller General may conduct an audit or evaluation of intelligence \nsources and methods or covert actions only upon the request of the \nintelligence committees or at the request of the congressional majority \nor minority leaders. The measure also prescribes for the security of \nthe information collected by the Comptroller General.\n  As both House Rule 48 and Senate Resolution 400 establishing the \nintelligence oversight committees state, ``Nothing in this [charter] \nshall be construed as amending, limiting, or otherwise changing the \nauthority of any standing committee of the, House/Senate, to obtain \nfull and prompt access to the product of the intelligence activities of \nany department or agency of the Government relevant to a matter \notherwise within the jurisdiction of such committee.''\n  Despite this clear and unambiguous statement, the ability of non-\nintelligence committees to obtain information, no matter how vital to \nimproving the security of our nation, has been restricted by the \nvarious elements of the intelligence community.\n  My bill reaffirms the authority of the Comptroller General to conduct \naudits and evaluations--other than those relating to sources and \nmethods, or covert actions--relating to the management and \nadministration of elements of the intelligence community in areas such \nas strategic planning, financial management, information technology, \nhuman capital, knowledge management, information sharing, and change \nmanagement for other relevant committees of the Congress.\n  As I mentioned earlier in my statement, Congress also has the \nresponsibility of ensuring that unfettered intelligence collection does \nnot trample civil liberties. New technologies and new personal \ninformation data bases threaten our individual right to a secure \nprivate life, free from unlawful government invasion. We must ensure \nthat private information collected by the intelligence community is not \nmisused and is secure. Intelligence agencies have a legitimate mission \nto protect the country against potential threats. However, Congress' \nrole is to ensure that their mission remains legitimate.\n  Attached is a detailed description of the legislation that I ask \nunanimous consent be printed in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation I am \nintroducing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                            Report Language\n\n       Section 1 of the Act provides that the Act may be cited as \n     the ``Intelligence Community Audit Act of 2007''.\n       Section 2(a) of the Act adds a new Section (3523a) to title \n     31, United States Code, with respect to the Comptroller \n     General's authority to audit or evaluate activities of the \n     intelligence community. New Section 3523a(b)(1) reaffirms \n     that the Comptroller General possesses, under his existing \n     statutory authority, the authority to perform audits and \n     evaluations of financial transactions, programs, and \n     activities of elements of the intelligence community and to \n     obtain access to records for the purposes of such audits and \n     evaluations. Such work could be done at the request of the \n     congressional intelligence committees or any committee of \n     jurisdiction of the House of Representatives or Senate \n     (including the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs of the Senate), or at the Comptroller \n     General's initiative, pursuant to the existing authorities \n     referenced in new Section 3523a(b)(1). New Section \n     3523a(b)(2) further provides that these audits and \n     evaluations under the Comptroller General's existing \n     authority may include, but are not limited to, matters \n     relating to the management and administration of elements of \n     the intelligence community in areas such as strategic \n     planning, financial management, information technology, human \n     capital, knowledge management, information sharing, and \n     change management. These audits and evaluations would be \n     accompanied by the safeguards that the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO) has in place to protect \n     classified and other sensitive information, including \n     physical security arrangements, classification and \n     sensitivity reviews, and restricted distribution of certain \n     products.\n       This reaffirmation is designed to respond to Executive \n     Branch assertions that GAO does not have the authority to \n     review activities of the intelligence community. To the \n     contrary, GAO's current statutory audit and access \n     authorities permit it to evaluate a wide range of activities \n     in the intelligence community. To further ensure that GAO's \n     authorities are appropriately construed in the future, the \n     new Section 3523a(e), which is described below, makes clear \n     that nothing in this or any other provision of law shall be \n     construed as restricting or limiting the Comptroller \n     General's authority to audit and evaluate, or obtain access \n     to the records of, elements of the intelligence community \n     absent specific statutory language restricting or limiting \n     such audits, evaluations, or access to records.\n       New Section 3523a(c)(1) provides that Comptroller General \n     audits or evaluations of intelligence sources and methods, or \n     covert actions may be undertaken only upon the request of the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, or the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives, or the majority or the minority leader of \n     the Senate or the House of Representatives. This limitation \n     is intended to recognize the heightened sensitivity of audits \n     and evaluations relating to\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\n     intelligence sources and methods, or covert actions.\n       The new Section 3523a(c)(2)(A) provides that the results of \n     such audits or evaluations under Section 3523a(c) may be \n     disclosed only to the original requestor, the Director of \n     National Intelligence, and the head of the relevant element \n     of the intelligence community. Since the methods GAO uses to \n     communicate the results of its audits or evaluations vary, \n     this provision restricts the dissemination of GAO's findings \n     under Section 3523a(c), whether through testimony, oral \n     briefings, or written reports, to only the original \n     requestor, the Director of National Intelligence, and the \n     head of the relevant element of the intelligence community. \n     Similarly, under new Section 3523a(c)(2)(B), the Comptroller \n     General may only provide information obtained in the course \n     of such an audit or evaluation to the original requestor, the \n     Director of National Intelligence, and the head of the \n     relevant element of the intelligence community.\n       The new Section 3523a(c)(3)(A) provides that \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Comptroller \n     General may inspect records of any element of the \n     intelligence community relating to intelligence sources and \n     methods, or covert actions in order to perform audits and \n     evaluations pursuant to Section 3523a(c). The Comptroller \n     General's access extends to any records which belong to, or \n     are in the possession and control of, the element of the \n     intelligence community regardless of who was the original \n     owner of such information. Under new Section 3523a(c)(3)(B), \n     the Comptroller General may enforce the access rights \n     provided under this subsection pursuant to section 716 of \n     title 31. However, before the Comptroller General files a \n     report pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 716(b)(1), the Comptroller \n     General must consult with the original requestor concerning \n     the Comptroller General's intent to file a report.\n       The new Section 3523a(c)(4) reiterates the Comptroller \n     General's obligations to protect the confidentiality of \n     information and adds special safeguards to protect records \n     and information obtained from elements of the intelligence \n     community for audits and evaluations performed under Section \n     3523a(c). For example, pursuant to new Section \n     3523a(c)(4)(B), the Comptroller General is to maintain on \n     site, in facilities furnished by the element of the \n     intelligence community subject to audit or evaluation, all \n     workpapers and records obtained for the audit or evaluation. \n     Under new Section 3523a(c)(4)(C), the Comptroller General is \n     directed, after consulting with the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, to establish \n     procedures to protect from unauthorized disclosure all \n     classified and other sensitive information furnished to the \n     Comptroller General under Section 3523a(c). Under new Section \n     3523a(c)(4)(D), prior to initiating an audit or evaluation \n     under Section 3523a(c), the Comptroller General shall provide \n     the Director of National Intelligence and the head of the \n     relevant element of the intelligence community with the name \n     of each officer and employee of the Government Accountability \n     Office who has obtained appropriate security clearances.\n       The new Section 3523a(d) provides that elements of the \n     intelligence community shall cooperate fully with the \n     Comptroller General and provide timely responses to \n     Comptroller General requests for documentation and \n     information.\n       The new Section 3523a(e) makes clear that nothing in this \n     or any other provision of law shall be construed as \n     restricting or limiting the Comptroller General's authority \n     to audit and evaluate, or obtain access to the records of, \n     elements of the intelligence community absent specific \n     statutory language restricting or limiting such audits, \n     evaluations, or access to records.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                                    July 18, 2006.\n     From: Harold C. Relyea, Specialist in American National \n         Government, Government and Finance Division.\n     Subject: Overview of ``Classified'' and ``Sensitive but \n         Unclassified'' Information.\n       Prescribed in various ways, federal policies may require \n     the protection of, or a privileged status for, particular \n     kinds of information. This memorandom provides a brief \n     introduction to, and overview of, two categories of such \n     information policy. The first category is demarcated largely \n     in a single policy instrument--a presidential executive \n     order--with a clear focus and in considerable detail: the \n     classification of national security information in terms of \n     three degrees of harm the disclosure of such information \n     could cause to the nation, resulting in Confidential, Secret, \n     and Top Secret designations. The second category is, by \n     contrast with the first, much broader in terms of the kinds \n     of information it covers, to the point of even being nebulous \n     in some instances, and is expressed in various instruments, \n     the majority of which are non-statutory: the marking of \n     sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information for protective \n     management, although its public disclosure may be permissible \n     pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). These two \n     categories are reviewed in the discussion set out below.\n\n\n                    security classified information\n\n       Current security classification arrangements, prescribed by \n     an executive order of the President, trace their origins to a \n     March 1940 directive issued by President Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt as E.O. 8381. This development was probably \n     prompted somewhat by desires to clarify the authority of \n     civilian personnel in the national defense community to \n     classify information, to establish a broader basis for \n     protecting military information in view of growing global \n     hostilities, and to manage better a discretionary power \n     seemingly of increasing importance to the entire executive \n     branch. Prior to this 1940 order, information had been \n     designated officially secret by armed forces personnel \n     pursuant to Army and Navy general orders and regulations. The \n     first systematic procedures for the protection of national \n     defense information, devoid of special markings, were \n     established by War Department General Orders No. 3 of \n     February 1912. Records determined to be ``confidential'' were \n     to be kept under lock, ``accessible only to the officer to \n     whom intrusted.'' Serial numbers were issued for all such \n     ``confidential'' materials, with the numbers marked on the \n     documents, and lists of same kept at the offices from which \n     they emanated. With the enlargement of the armed forces after \n     the entry of the United States into World War I, the registry \n     system was abandoned and a tripartite system of \n     classification markings was inaugurated in November 1917 with \n     General Order No. 64 of the General Headquarters of the \n     American Expenditionary Force.\n       The entry of the United States into World War II prompted \n     some additional arrangements for the protection of \n     information pertaining to the nation's security. Personnel \n     cleared to work on the Manhattan Project for the production \n     of the atomic bomb, for instance, in committing themselves \n     not to disclose protected information improperly, were \n     ``required to read and sign either the Espionage Act or a \n     special secrecy agreement,'' establishing their awareness of \n     their secrecy obligations and a fiduciary trust which, if \n     breached, constituted a basis for their dismissal.\n       A few years after the conclusion of World War II, President \n     Harry S. Truman, in February 1950, issued E.O. 10104, which, \n     while superseding E.O. 8381, basically reiterated its text, \n     but added a fourth Top Secret classification designation to \n     existing Restricted, Confidential, and Secret markings, \n     making American information security categories consistent \n     with those of our allies. At the time of the promulgation of \n     this order, however, plans were underway for a complete \n     overhaul of the classification program, which would result in \n     a dramatic change in policy.\n       E.O. 10290, issued in September 1951, introduced three \n     sweeping innovations in security classification policy. \n     First, the order indicated the Chief Executive was relying \n     upon ``the authority vested in me by the Constitution and \n     statutes, and as President of the United States'' in issuing \n     the directive. This formula appeared to strengthen the \n     President's discretion to make official secrecy policy: it \n     intertwined his responsibility as Commander in Chief with the \n     constitutional obligation to ``take care that the laws be \n     faithfully executed.'' Second, information was now classified \n     in the interest of ``national security,'' a somewhat new, but \n     nebulous, concept, which, in the view of some, conveyed more \n     latitude for the creation of official secrets. It replaced \n     the heretofore relied upon ``national defense'' standard for \n     classification. Third, the order extended classified \n     authority to nonmilitary entitie throughout the executive \n     branch, to be exercised by, presumably, but not explicitly \n     limited to, those having some role in ``national \n     security'' policy.\n       The broad discretion to create official secrets granted by \n     E.O. 10290 engendered widespread criticism from the public \n     and the press. In response, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, \n     shortly after his election to office, instructed Attorney \n     General Herbert Brownell to review the order with a view to \n     revising or rescinding it. The subsequent recommendation was \n     for a new directive, which was issued in November 1953 as \n     E.O. 10501. It withdrew classification authority from 28 \n     entities, limited this discretion in 17 other units to the \n     agency head, returned to the ``national defense'' standard \n     for applying secrecy, eliminated the ``Restricted'' category, \n     which was the lowest level of protection, and explicitly \n     defined the remaining three classification areas to prevent \n     their indiscriminate use.\n       Thereafter, E.O. 10501, with slight amendment, prescribed \n     operative security classification policy and procedure for \n     the next two decades. Successor orders built on this reform. \n     These included E.O. 11652, issued by President Richard M. \n     Nixon in March 1972, followed by E.O. 12065, promulgated by \n     President Jimmy Carter in June 1978. For 30 years, these \n     classification directives narrowed the bases and discretion \n     for assigning official secrecy to executive branch documents \n     and materials. Then, in April 1982, this trend was reversed \n     with E.O. 12356, issued by President Ronald Reagan. This \n     order expanded the categories of classifiable information, \n     mandated that information falling within these categories be \n     classified, authorized the reclassification of previously \n     declassified documents, admonished classifiers to err on the \n     side classification, and eliminated automatic \n     declassification arrangements.\n       President William Clinton returned security classification \n     policy and procedure to the reform trend of the Eisenhower, \n     Nixon, and Carter Administrations with E.O. 12958 in April \n     1995. Adding impetus to the development and issuance of the \n     new order were\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\n     changing world conditions: the democratization of many \n     eastern European countries, the demise of the Soviet Union, \n     and the end of the Cold War. Accountability and cost \n     considerations were also significant influences. In 1985, the \n     temporary Department of Defense (DOD) Security Review \n     Commission, chaired by retired General Richard G. Stilwell, \n     declared that there were ``no verifiable figures as to the \n     amount of classified material produced in DOD and in defense \n     industry each year.'' Nonetheless, it concluded that ``too \n     much information appears to be classified and much at higher \n     levels than is warranted.'' In October 1993, the cost of the \n     security classification program became clearer when the \n     General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that it was ``able \n     to identify government-wide costs directly applicable to \n     national security information totaling over $350 million for \n     1992.'' After breaking this figure down--it included only $6 \n     million for declassification work--the report added that \n     ``the U.S. government also spends additional billions of \n     dollars annually to safeguard information, personnel, and \n     property.'' E.O. 12958 set limits for the duration of \n     classification, prohibited the reclassification of properly \n     declassified records, authorized government employees to \n     challenge the classification status of records, reestablished \n     the balancing test of E.O. 12065 weighing the need to protect \n     information vis-a-vis the public interest in its disclosure, \n     and created two review panels--one on classification and \n     declassification actions and one to advise on policy and \n     procedure.\n       Most recently, in March 2003, President George W. Bush \n     issued E.O. 13292, amending E.O. 12958. Among the changes \n     made by this order were adding infrastructure vulnerabilities \n     or capabilities, protection services relating to national \n     security, and weapons of mass destruction to the categories \n     of classifiable information; easing the reclassification of \n     declassified records; postponing the automatic \n     declassification of protected records 25 or more years old, \n     beginning in mid-April 2003 to the end of December 2006; \n     eliminating the requirement that agencies prepare plans for \n     declassifying records; and permitting the Director of Central \n     Intelligence to block declassification actions of the \n     Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel, unless \n     overruled by the President.\n       The security classification program has evolved during the \n     past 66 years. One may not agree with all of its rules and \n     requirements. but attention to detail in its policy and \n     procedure result in a significant management regime. The \n     operative executive order, as amended, defines its principal \n     terms. Those who are authorized to exercise original \n     classification authority are identified. Exclusive categories \n     of classifiable information are specified, as are the terms \n     of the duration of classification, as well as classification \n     prohibitions and limitations. Classified information is \n     required to be marked appropriately along with the identity \n     of the original classifier, the agency or office of origin, \n     and a date or event for declassification. Authorized holders \n     of classified information who believe that its protected \n     status is improper are ``encouraged and expected'' to \n     challenge that status through prescribed arrangements. \n     Mandatory declassification reviews are also authorized to \n     determine if protected records merit continued classification \n     at their present level, a lower level, or at all. \n     Unsuccessful classification challenges and mandatory \n     declassification reviews are subject to review by the \n     Intragency Security Classification Appeals Panel. General \n     restrictions on access to classified information are \n     prescribed, as are distribution controls for classified \n     information. The Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) \n     within the National Archives and Records Administration \n     (NARA) is mandated to provide central management and \n     oversight of the security classification program. If the \n     director of this entity finds that a violation of the order \n     or its implementing directives has occurred, it must be \n     reported to the head of the agency or to the appropriate \n     senior agency official so that corrective steps, if \n     appropriate, may be taken\n       While Congress, thus far, has elected not to create \n     statutorily mandated security classification policy and \n     procedures, the option to do so has been explored in the \n     past, and its legislative authority to do so has been \n     recognized by the Supreme Court. Congress, however, has \n     established protections for certain kinds of information--\n     such as Restricted Data in the Atomic Energy Acts of 1946 and \n     1954, and inte1ligence sources and methods in the National \n     Security Act of 1947--which have been realized through \n     security classification arrangements. It has acknowledged \n     properly applied security classification as a basis for \n     withholding records sought pursuant to the Freedom of \n     Information Act. Also, with a view to efficiency and economy, \n     as well as effective records management, committees of \n     Congress, on various occasions, have conducted oversight of \n     security classification policy and practice, and have been \n     assisted by GAO and CRS in this regard.\n\n\n                 Sensitive but Unclassified Information\n\n       The widespread existence and use of information control \n     markings other than those prescribed for the security \n     classification of information came to congressional attention \n     in March 1972 when a subcommittee of what is now the House \n     Committee on Government Reform launched the first oversight \n     hearings on the administration and operation of the Freedom \n     of Information Act (FOIA). Enacted in 1966, FOIA had become \n     operative in July 1967. In the early months of 1972, the \n     Nixon Administration was developing new security \n     classification policy and procedure, which wou1d be \n     prescribed in E.O. 11652, issued in early March. Preparatory \n     to this hearing, the panel had surveyed the departments and \n     agencies in August 1971, asking, among other questions, \n     ``What legend is used by your agency to identify records \n     which are not classifiable under Executive Order 10501 [the \n     operative order at the time] but which are not to be made \n     available outside the government?'' Of 58 information control \n     markings identified in response to this question, the most \n     common were For Official Use Only (11 agencies); Limited \n     Official Use (nine agencies); Official Use Only (eight \n     agencies); Restricted Data (five agencies); Administratively \n     Restricted (four agencies); Formerly Restricted Data (four \n     agencies); and Nodis, or no dissemination (four agencies). \n     Seven other markings were used by two agencies in each case. \n     A CRS review of the agency responses to the control markings \n     question prompted the following observation.\n       Often no authority is cited for the establishment or origin \n     of these labels; even when some reference is provided it is a \n     handbook, manual, administrative order, or a circular but not \n     statutory authority. Exceptions to this are the Atomic Energy \n     Commission, the Defense Department and the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency. These agencies cite the Atomic Atomic \n     Energy Act, N.A.T.O. related laws, and international \n     agreements as a basis for certain additional labels. The Arms \n     Control and Disarmament Agency acknowledged it honored and \n     adopted State and Defense Department labels.\n       Over three decades later, it appears that approximately the \n     same number of these information control markings are in use; \n     that the majority of them are administratively, not \n     statutorily, prescribed; and that many of them have an \n     inadequate management regime, particularly when compared with \n     the detailed arrangements which govern the management of \n     classified information. A recent press account illustrates \n     another problem. In late January 2005, GCN Update, the \n     online, electronic news service of Government Computer News, \n     reported that ``dozens of classified Homeland Security \n     Department documents'' had been accidently made available on \n     a public Internet site for several days due to an apparent \n     security glitch at the Department of Energy. Describing the \n     contents of the compromised materials and reactions to the \n     breach, the account stated the ``documents were marked `for \n     official use only,' the lowest secret-level classification.'' \n     The documents, of course, were not security classified, \n     because the marking cited is not authorized by E.O. 12958. \n     Interestingly, however, in view of the fact that this \n     misinterpretation appeared in a story to which three \n     reporters contributed, perhaps it reflects, to some extent, \n     the current confusion of these information control markings \n     with security classification designations.\n       Broadly considering the contemporary situation regarding \n     information control markings, a recent information security \n     report by the JASON Program Office of the MITRE Corporation \n     proffered the following assessment.\n       The status of sensitive information outside of the present \n     classification system is murkier than ever. . . . ``Sensitive \n     but unclassified'' data is increasingly defined by the eye of \n     the beholder. Lacking in definition, it is correspondingly \n     lacking in policies and procedures for protecting (or not \n     protecting) it, and regarding how and by whom it is generated \n     and used.\n       A contemporaneous Heritage Foundation report appeared to \n     agree with this appraisal, saying:\n       The process for classifying secret information in the \n     federal government is disciplined and explicit. The same \n     cannot be said for unclassified but security-related \n     information for which there is no usable definition, no \n     common understanding about how to control it, no agreement on \n     what significance it has for U.S. national security, and no \n     means for adjudicating concerns regarding appropriate levels \n     of protection.\n       Concerning the current Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) \n     marking, a 2004 report by the Federal Research Division of \n     the Library of Congress commented that guidelines for its \n     use are needed, and noted that ``a uniform legal \n     definition or set of procedures applicable to all Federal \n     government agencies does not now exist.'' Indeed, the \n     report indicates that SBU has been utilized in different \n     contexts with little precision as to its scope or meaning, \n     and, to add a bit of chaos to an already confusing \n     situation, is ``often referred to as Sensitive Homeland \n     Security Information.''\n       Assessments of the variety, management, and impact of \n     information control markings, other than those prescribed for \n     the classification of national security information, have \n     been conducted by CRS, GAO, and the National Security \n     Archive, a private sector research and resource center \n     located at The George Washington University. In March 2006, \n     GAO indicated that, in a recent survey, 26 federal agencies \n     reported using 56 different information control markings to \n     protect sensitive information other than classified national \n     security material. That same month, the National Security \n     Archive offered that, of 37 agencies surveyed, 24 used 28 \n     control markings based on internal policies, procedures, or \n     practices, and eight used 10 markings based on statutory \n     authority. These\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\n     numbers are important in terms of the variety of such \n     markings. GAO explained this dimension of the management \n     problem.\n       [T]here are at least 13 agencies that use the designation \n     For Official Use Only [FOUO], but there are at least five \n     different definitions of FOUO. At least seven agencies or \n     agency components use the term Law Enforcement Sensitive \n     (LES), including the U.S. Marshals Service, the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Commerce, and the \n     Office of Personnel Management (OPM). These agencies gave \n     differing definitions for the term. While DHS does not \n     formally define the designation, the Department of Commerce \n     defines it to include information pertaining to the \n     protection of senior government officials, and OPM defines it \n     as unclassified information used by law enforcement personnel \n     that requires protection against unauthorized disclosure to \n     protect the sources and methods of investigative activity, \n     evidence, and the integrity of pretrial investigative \n     reports.\n       Apart from the numbers, however, is another aspect of the \n     management problem, which GAO described in the following \n     terms.\n       There are no governmentwide policies or procedures that \n     describe the basis on which agencies should use most of these \n     sensitive but unclassified designations, explain what the \n     different designations mean across agencies, or ensure that \n     they will be used consistently from one agency to another. In \n     this absence, each agency determines what designations to \n     apply to the sensitive but unclassified information it \n     develops or shares.\n       These markings also have implications in another regard. \n     The importance of information sharing for combating terrorism \n     and realizing homeland security was emphasized by the \n     National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United \n     States. That the variously identified and marked forms of \n     sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information could be \n     problematic with regard to information sharing was recognized \n     by Congress when fashioning the Homeland Security Act of \n     2002. Section 892 of that statute specifically directed the \n     President to prescribe and implement procedures for the \n     sharing of information by relevant federal agencies, \n     including the accommodation of ``homeland security \n     information that is sensitive but unclassified.'' On July 29, \n     2003, the President assigned this responsibility largely to \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security. Nothing resulted. The \n     importance of information sharing was reinforced two years \n     later in the report of the Commission on the Intelligence \n     Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction. Congress again responded by mandating the \n     creation of an Information Sharing Environment (ISE) when \n     legislating the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \n     Act of 2004. Preparatory to implementing the ISE provisions, \n     the President issued a December 16, 2005, memorandum \n     recognizing the need for standardized procedures for SBU \n     information and directing department and agency officials to \n     take certain actions relative to that objective. In May 2006, \n     the newly appointed manager of the ISE agreed with a March \n     GAO assessment that, oftentimes, SBU information, designated \n     as such with some marking, was not being shared due to \n     concerns about the ability of recipients to adequately \n     protect it. In brief, it appears that pseudo-classification \n     markings have, in some instances, had the effect of deterring \n     information sharing for homeland security purposes.\n       Congressional overseers have probed executive use and \n     management of information control markings other than those \n     prescribed for the classification of national security \n     information, and the extent to which they result in ``pseudo-\n     classification'' or a form of overclassification. Relevant \n     remedial legislation proposed during the 109th Congress \n     includes two bills (H.R. 2331 and H.R. 5112) containing \n     sections which would require the Archivist of the United \n     States to prepare a detailed report regarding the number, \n     use, and management of these information control markings and \n     submit it to specified congressional committees, and to \n     promulgate regulations banning the use of these markings and \n     otherwise establish standards for information control \n     designations established by statute or an executive order \n     relating to the classification of national security \n     information. A section in the Department of Homeland Security \n     appropriations legislation (H.R. 5441), as approved by the \n     House, would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     revise DHS MD (Management Directive) 11056 to include (1) \n     provision that information that is three years old and not \n     incorporated in a current, active transportation security \n     directive or security plan shall be determined automatically \n     to be releasable unless, for each specific document, the \n     Secretary makes a written determination that identifies a \n     compelling reason why the information must remain Sensitive \n     Security Information (SS1); (2) common and extensive examples \n     of the individual categories of SSI cited in order to \n     minimize and standardize judgment in the application of SSI \n     marking; and (3) provision that, in all judicial proceedings \n     where the judge overseeing the proceedings has adjudicated \n     that a party needs to have access to SSI, the party shall be \n     deemed a covered person for purposes of access to the SSI at \n     issue in the case unless TSA or DHS demonstrates a compelling \n     reason why the specific individual presents a risk of harm to \n     the nation. A May 25, 2006, statement of administration \n     policy on the bill strongly opposed the section, saying it \n     ``would jeopardize an important program that protects \n     Sensitive Security Information (SSI) from public release by \n     deeming it automatically releaseable in three years, \n     potentially conflict with requirements of the Privacy and \n     Freedom of Information Acts, and negate statutory provisions \n     providing original jurisdiction for lawsuits challenging. the \n     designation of SSI materials in the U.S. Courts of Appeals.'' \n     The statement further indicated that the section would create \n     a burdensome review process'' for the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security and would result in different statutory requirements \n     being applied to SSI programs administered by the Departments \n     of Homeland Security and Transportation.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                              Washington, DC., September 14, 2006.\n     From: Alfred Cumming, Specialist in Intelligence and National \n         Security, Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division.\n     Subject: Congressional Oversight of Intelligence.\n       This memorandum examines the intelligence oversight \n     structure established by Congress in the 1970s, including the \n     creation of the congressional select intelligence committees \n     by the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate, \n     respectively. It also looks at the intelligence oversight \n     role that Congress reserved for congressional committees \n     other than the intelligence committees; examines certain \n     existing statutory procedures that govern how the executive \n     branch is to keep the congressional intelligence committees \n     informed of U.S. intelligence activities; and looks at the \n     circumstances under which the two intelligence committees are \n     expected to keep congressional standing committees, as well \n     as both chambers, informed of intelligence activities.\n       If can be of further assistance, please call at 707-7739.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       In the wake of congressional investigations into \n     Intelligence Community activities in the mid-1970s, the U.S. \n     Senate in 1976 created a select committee on intelligence to \n     conduct more effective oversight on a continuing basis. The \n     U.S. House of Representatives established its own \n     intelligence oversight committee the following year.\n       Until the two intelligence committees were created, other \n     congressional standing committees--principally the Senate and \n     House Armed Services and Appropriations committees--shared \n     responsibility for overseeing the intelligence community. \n     Although willing to cede primary jurisdiction over the \n     Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to the two new select \n     intelligence committees, these congressional standing \n     committees wanted to retain jurisdiction over the \n     intelligence activities of the other departments and agencies \n     they oversaw. According to one observer, the standing \n     committees asserted their jurisdictional prerogatives for two \n     reasons--to protect ``turf,'' but also to provide ``a hedge \n     against the possibility that the newly launched experiment in \n     oversight might go badly.''\n\n\n             intelligence committees; statutory obligations\n\n       Under current statute, the President is required to ensure \n     that the congressional intelligence committees are kept \n     ``fully and currently informed'' of U.S. intelligence \n     activities, including any ``significant anticipated \n     intelligence activity,'' and the President and the \n     intelligence committees are to establish any procedures as \n     may be necessary to carry out these provisions.\n       The statute, however, stipulates that the intelligence \n     committees in turn are responsible for alerting the \n     respective chambers or congressional standing committees of \n     any intelligence activities requiring further attention. The \n     intelligence committees are to carry out this \n     responsibility in accordance with procedures established \n     by the House of Representatives and the Senate, in \n     consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, \n     in order to protect against unauthorized disclosure of \n     classified information, and all information relating to \n     sources and methods.\n       The statute stipulates that: ``each of the congressional \n     intelligence committees shall promptly call to the attention \n     of its respective House, or to any appropriate committee or \n     committees of its respective House, any matter relating to \n     intelligence activities requiring the attention of such House \n     or such committee or committees.\n       This provision was included in statute after being \n     specifically requested in a letter from then Senate Foreign \n     Relations Chairman Frank Church and Ranking Minority Member \n     Jacob Javits in an Apr. 30, 1980 letter to then-intelligence \n     committee Chairman Birch Bayh and Vice Chairman Barry \n     Goldwater.\n\n\n          Intelligence Committee Obligations Under Resolution\n\n       In an apparent effort to address various concerns relating \n     to committee jurisdiction, the House of Representatives and \n     the Senate, in the resolutions establishing each of the \n     intelligence committees, included language preserving \n     oversight roles for those standing committees with \n     jurisdiction over matters affected by intelligence \n     activities.\n       Specifically, each intelligence committee's resolution \n     states that: ``Nothing in this [Charter] shall be construed \n     as prohibiting or otherwise restricting the authority of any \n     other committee to study and review any intelligence activity \n     to the extent that such activity directly affects a matter \n     otherwise within the jurisdiction of such committee.''\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\n       Both resolutions also stipulate that:\n\n     Nothing in this [charter] shall be construed as amending, \n     limiting, or otherwise changing the authority of any standing \n     committee of the [House/Senate] to obtain full and prompt \n     access to the product of the intelligence activities of any \n     department or agency of the Government relevant to a matter \n     otherwise within the jurisdiction of such committee.\n\n       Finally, both charters direct that each intelligence \n     committee alert the appropriate standing committees, or the \n     respective chambers, of any matter requiring attention. The \n     charters state:\n       The select committee, for the purposes of accountability to \n     the [House/Senate] shall make regular and periodic reports to \n     the [House/Senate] on the nature and extent of the \n     intelligence activities of the various departments and \n     agencies of the United States. Such committee shall promptly \n     call to the attention of the [House/Senate] or to any other \n     appropriate committee or committees of the [House/Senate] any \n     matters requiring the attention of the [House/Senate] or such \n     other appropriate committee or committees.\n\n\n                         Cross-over Membership\n\n       Both resolutions also direct that the membership of each \n     intelligence committee include members who serve on the four \n     standing committees that historically have been involved in \n     intelligence oversight. The respective resolutions designate \n     the following committees as falling in this category: \n     Appropriations, Armed Services, Judiciary, and the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee and the House International \n     Relations Committee.\n       Although each resolution directs that such cross-over \n     members be designated, neither specifies whether cross-over \n     members are to play any additional role beyond serving on the \n     intelligence committees. For example, neither resolution \n     outlines whether cross-over members are to inform colleagues \n     on standing committees they represent. Rather, each \n     resolution directs only that the ``intelligence committee'' \n     shall promptly call such matters to the attention of standing \n     committees and the respective chambers if the committees \n     determine that they require further attention by those \n     entities.\n\n\n                          Summary Conclusions\n\n       Although the President is statutorily obligated to keep the \n     congressional intelligence committees fully and currently \n     informed of intelligence activities, the statute obligates \n     the intelligence committees to inform the respective \n     chambers, or standing committees, of such activities, if \n     either of the two committees determine that further oversight \n     attention is required.\n       Further, resolutions establishing the two intelligence \n     committees make clear that the intelligence committees share \n     intelligence oversight responsibilities with other standing \n     committees, to the extent that certain intelligence \n     activities affect matters that fall under the jurisdiction of \n     a committee other than the intelligence committees.\n       Finally, the resolutions establishing the intelligence \n     committees provide for the designation of ``cross-over'' \n     members representing certain standing committees that played \n     a role in intelligence oversight prior to the establishment \n     of the intelligence committees in the 1970s. The resolutions, \n     however, do not specify what role, if any, these ``cross-\n     over'' members play in keeping standing committees on which \n     they serve informed of certain intelligence activities. \n     Rather, each resolution states that the respective \n     intelligence committee shall make that determination.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 82\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide increased rail transportation security; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Snowe, Biden, and Lieberman in introducing the Rail Security \nAct of 2007. This legislation is nearly identical to the rail security \nmeasures approved by the Senate during both the 108th and 109th \nCongresses. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives has yet to act\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\non rail security legislation. I remain hopeful that rail security will \nbe made a top priority for the 110th Congress.\n  We have taken important steps and expended considerable resources to \nsecure the homeland since 9/11. I think all would agree that air travel \nis safer than it was five years ago. And, we have worked to address \nport security in a comprehensive manner. However, we need to do more to \nbetter secure other transportation modes, a fact well documented by the \n9/11 Commission. Unfortunately, only relatively modest resources have \nbeen dedicated to rail security in recent years. As a result, our \nNation's transit system, Amtrak, and the freight railroads remain \nvulnerable to terrorist attacks.\n  The Rail Security Act would authorize a total of almost $1.2 billion \ndollars for rail security. More than half of this funding would be \nauthorized to complete tunnel safety and security improvements at New \nYork's Penn Station, which is used by over 500,000 transit, commuter, \nand intercity passengers each workday. The legislation would also \nestablish a grant program to encourage security enhancements by the \nfreight railroads, Amtrak, shippers of hazardous materials, and local \ngovernments with responsibility for passenger stations. It would help \nto address identified security weaknesses in a manner that also seeks \nto protect the taxpayers' interests.\n  As we continue fight the War on Terror, we need to do all we can to \naddress our vulnerabilities. We have witnessed the tragic attacks on \nrail systems in other countries, including the cities of London, Mumbai \nand Madrid, and the devastating consequences of those attacks. It is \nessential that we move expeditiously to protect all the modes of \ntransportation from potential attack, and this legislation will help to \ndo just that.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Senate has consistently supported \nlegislation to promote rail security. Most recently, rail security \nprovisions were adopted last Fall as part of the port security \nlegislation. But again, the House failed to allow these important \nsecurity provisions to move ahead, and the provisions were stripped \nfrom the conference agreement. As a result, our rail network continues \nto remain vulnerable to terrorist attack. That is unacceptable in my \njudgement.\n  I urge the Senate to move quickly to again pass this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 84. A bill to establish a United States Boxing Commission to \nadminister the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Stevens and Dorgan in introducing the Professional Boxing \nAmendments Act of 2007. This legislation is virtually identical to a \nmeasure approved unanimously by the Senate in 2005. I remain committed \nto moving the Professional Boxing Amendments Act through the Senate and \nI trust that my colleagues will once again vote favorably on this \nimportant legislation. Simply put, this legislation would better \nprotect professional boxing from the fraud, corruption, and ineffective \nregulation that have plagued the sport for far too many years, and that \nhave devastated physically and financially many of our Nation's \nprofessional boxers.\n  For almost a decade, Congress has made efforts to improve the sport \nof professional boxing and for very good reason. With rare exception, \nprofessional boxers come from the lowest rung on our economic ladder. \nOften they are the least educated and most exploited athletes in our \nnation. The Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 and the Muhammad Ali \nBoxing Reform Act of 2000 established uniform health and safety \nstandards for professional boxers, as well as basic protections for \nboxers against the sometimes coercive, exploitative, and unethical \nbusiness practices of promoters, managers, and sanctioning \norganizations. But further action is needed.\n  The Professional Boxing Amendments Act would strengthen existing \nFederal boxing law by improving the basic health and safety standards \nfor professional boxers, establishing a centralized medical registry to \nbe used by local commissions to protect boxers, reducing the arbitrary \npractices of sanctioning organizations, and enhancing the uniformity \nand basic standards for professional boxing contracts. Most \nimportantly, this legislation would establish a Federal regulatory \nentity to oversee professional boxing and set basic uniform standards \nfor certain aspects of the sport.\n  Current law has improved to some extent the state of professional \nboxing. However, I remain concerned, as do many others, that the sport \nremains at risk. In 2003, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \nspent more than six months studying ten of the country's busiest State \nand tribal boxing commissions. Government auditors found that many \nState and tribal boxing commissions still do not comply with Federal \nboxing law, and that there is a troubling lack of enforcement by both \nFederal and State officials.\n  Ineffective and inconsistent oversight of professional boxing has \ncontributed to the continuing scandals, controversies, unethical \npractices, and unnecessary deaths in the sport. These problems have led \nmany in professional boxing to conclude that the only solution is an \neffective and accountable Federal boxing commission. The Professional \nBoxing Amendments Act would create such an entity.\n  Professional boxing remains the only major sport in the United States \nthat does not have a strong, centralized association, league, or other \nregulatory body to establish and enforce uniform rules and practices. \nBecause a powerful few benefit greatly from the current system of \npatchwork compliance and enforcement of Federal boxing law, a national \nself-regulating organization though preferable to Federal government \noversight is not a realistic option.\n  This bill would establish the United States Boxing Commission, USBC \nor Commission. The Commission would be responsible for protecting the \nhealth, safety, and general interests of professional boxers. The USBC \nwould also be responsible for ensuring uniformity, fairness, and \nintegrity in professional boxing. More specifically, the Commission \nwould administer Federal boxing law and coordinate with other Federal \nregulatory agencies to ensure that this law is enforced; oversee all \nprofessional boxing matches in the United States; and work with the \nboxing industry and local commissions to improve the safety, integrity, \nand professionalism of professional boxing in the United States.\n  The USBC would also license boxers, promoters, managers, and \nsanctioning organizations. The Commission would have the authority to \nrevoke such a license for violations of Federal boxing law, to stop \nunethical or illegal conduct, to protect the health and safety of a \nboxer, or if the revocation is otherwise in the public interest.\n  Mr. President, it is important to state clearly and plainly for the \nrecord that the purpose of the USBC is not to interfere with the daily \noperations of State and tribal boxing commissions. Instead, the \nCommission would work in consultation with local commissions, and it \nwould only exercise its authority when reasonable grounds exist for \nsuch intervention. In point of fact, the Professional Boxing Amendments \nAct states explicitly that it would not prohibit any boxing commission \nfrom exercising any of its powers, duties, or functions with respect to \nthe regulation or supervision of professional boxing to the extent not \ninconsistent with the provisions of Federal boxing law.\n  Let there be no doubt, however, of the very basic and pressing need \nin professional boxing for a Federal boxing commission. The \nestablishment of the USBC would address that need. The problems that \nplague the sport of professional boxing undermine the credibility of \nthe sport in the eyes of the public and--more importantly--compromise \nthe safety of boxers. The Professional Boxing Amendments Act provides \nan effective approach to curbing these problems. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Baucus. Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Reid, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 85. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act \nof 1968 to clarify that territories and Indian tribes are eligible to \nreceive\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\ngrants for confronting the use of methamphetamine; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Indian Tribes \nMethamphetamine Reduction Grants Act of 2007. This bill is identical to \nS. 4113, a bipartisan measure that was passed by unanimous consent in \nthe Senate on December 8, 2006, the last day of the 109th Congress. The \nlegislation would allow Indian tribes to be eligible for funding \nthrough the Department of Justice to eradicate the scourge of \nmethamphetamine use, sale and manufacture in Native American \ncommunities. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Dorgan, Baucus, \nGrassley, Reid, Feinstein, and Feingold in introducing this important \nlegislation.\n  The impacts of methamphetamine use on communities across the Nation \nare well known and cannot be overstated. Methamphetamine is the leading \ndrug-related law enforcement problem in the country. Unfortunately, the \nmeth crisis is affecting Indian Country most severely. Very serious \nconcerns have been raised by the U.S. Department of Justice, States, \nand other non-tribal law enforcement agencies over the rapidly growing \nlevels of methamphetamine production and trafficking on reservations \nwith large geographic areas or tribes adjacent to the U.S.-Mexico \nborder. But because of the sovereign status of the tribes, criminals \nare generally not subject to state jurisdiction in many cases. As a \nresult, local law enforcement often has no jurisdiction in Indian \ncountry, and tribal law enforcement agencies bear the brunt of most law \nenforcement functions.\n  The problem of meth in Indian country, which the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians identified last year as its top priority, is \nubiquitous, and has strained already overburdened law enforcement, \nhealth, social welfare, housing, and child protective and placement \nservices on Indian reservations. Last year a former tribal judge on the \nWind River Reservation in Wyoming pled guilty to conspiracy to \ndistribute methamphetamine and other drugs. The day before, the Navajo \nNation police arrested an 81 year old grandmother, her daughter, and \nher granddaughter, for selling meth. One tribe in Arizona had over 60 \nbabies born with meth in their systems. In 2005, the National Indian \nHousing Council expanded its training for dealing with meth in tribal \nhousing: the average cost of decontaminating a single residence that \nhas been used a meth lab is $10,000.\n  During the 109th Congress, as the Chairman of the Senate Indian \nAffairs Committee, I held hearings on this serious matter. Committee \nwitnesses testified that the methamphetamine epidemic in Indian country \nhas contributed to a rise in child abuse and neglect cases, among other \nsocial ills, and some tribes reported dramatic increases in suicide \nrates among young people linked to methamphetamine use. Following our \nhearings, I was pleased to work with Senators Dorgan, Sessions, \nBingaman and others in improving upon our legislation to assist Indian \nCountry in fighting this terrible drug crisis.\n  To avoid any potential misinterpretation of the intent of this \nlegislation, this bill includes language developed and agreed to during \nthe last Congress that is designed to clarify the intent of the bill. \nThis clarifying language, provided in section 2(a)(4) of the bill, is \nintended to make it clear that by authorizing the Department of \nJustice's Bureau of Justice Assistance to award grant funds to a state, \nterritory or Indian tribe to ``investigate, arrest and prosecute \nindividuals'' involved in illegal methamphetamine activities, the \nlegislation does not somehow authorize a grantee state, territory or \nIndian tribe to pursue law enforcement activities that it otherwise has \nno jurisdiction to pursue. And similarly, this provision also clarifies \nthat an award or denial of a grant by the Bureau of Justice Assistance \ndoes not somehow allow a state, territory or Indian tribe to pursue law \nenforcement activities that it otherwise lacks jurisdiction to pursue. \nFor example, a law enforcement agency in one state, territory or Indian \nreservation is not somehow enabled by this section, or by an award made \npursuant to this section, to prosecute a methamphetamine crime arising \nin some other jurisdiction unless that agency already has such \njurisdiction.\n  The legislation further clarifies that authority under the bill to \naward grants would have no effect beyond simply authorizing, awarding \nor denying a grant of funds to a state, territory or Indian tribe. So, \nfor example, if a state, territory or Indian tribe is awarded or denied \na grant of funds under this section, that award or denial has no \nrelevance to or effect on the eligibility of the state, territory or \nIndian tribe to participate in any other program or activity unrelated \nto the award or denial of grants as permitted under this legislation. \nThe award or denial of a grant under this subsection, in other words, \nis relevant only to the award or denial of the grant under this \nsubsection, and nothing else.\n  The measure I am introducing today takes but a small step on the long \njourney toward our fight against methamphetamine. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 86. A bill to designate segments of Fossil Creek, a tributary to \nthe Verde River in the State of Arizona, as wild and scenic rivers; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am please to be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Kyl, in reintroducing a bill to designate Fossil Creek as a \nWild and Scenic River. A companion measure is being introduced today by \nCongressman Renzi and other members of the Arizona congressional \ndelegation.\n  Fossil Creek is a thing of beauty. With its picturesque scenery, lush \nriparian ecosystem, unique geological features, and deep iridescent \nblue pools and waterfalls, this tributary to the Wild and Scenic Verde \nRiver and Lower Colorado River Watershed stretches 14 miles through \neast central Arizona. It is home to a wide variety of wildlife, some of \nwhich are threatened or endangered species. Over 100 bird species \ninhabit the Fossil Creek area and use it to migrate between the range \nlowlands and the Mogollon-Colorado Plateau highlands. Fossil Creek also \nsupports a variety of aquatic species and is one of the few perennial \nstreams in Arizona with multiple native fish.\n  Fossil Creek was named in the 1800's when early explorers described \nthe fossil-like appearance of creek-side rocks and vegetation coated \nwith calcium carbonate deposits from the creek's water. In the early \n1900's, pioneers recognized the potential for hydroelectric power \ngeneration in the creek's constant and abundant spring fed base-flow. \nThey claimed the channel's water rights and built a dam system and \ngenerating facilities known as the Childs-Irving hydro-project. Over \ntime, the project was acquired by Arizona Public Service (APS), one of \nthe state's largest eclectic utility providers serving more than a \nmillion Arizonans. Because Childs-Irving produced less then half of 1 \npercent of the total power generated by APS, the decision was made \nultimately to decommission the aging dam and restore Fossil Creek to \nits pre-settlement conditions.\n  APS has partnered with various environmental groups, federal land \nmanagers, and state, tribal and local governments to safely remove the \nChilds-Irving power generating facilities and restore the riparian \necosystem. In 2005, APS removed the dam system and returned full flows \nto Fossil Creek. Researchers predict Fossil Creek will soon become a \nfully regenerated Southwest native fishery providing a most-valuable \nopportunity to reintroduce at least six Threatened and Endangered \nnative fish species as well as rebuild the native populations presently \nliving in the creek.\n  There is a growing need to provide additional protection and adequate \nstaffing and management at Fossil Creek. Recreational visitation to the \nriverbed is expected to increase dramatically, and by the Forest \nService's own admission, they aren't able to manage current levels of \nvisitation or the pressures of increased use. While responsible \nrecreation and other activities at Fossil Creek are to be encouraged, \nwe must also ensure the long-term success of the ongoing restoration \nefforts. Designation under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act would help to \nensure the appropriate level of protection and resources are devoted to \nFossil Creek. Already, Fossil Creek has been found\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\neligible for Wild and Scenic designation by the Forest Service and the \nproposal has widespread support from surrounding communities. All of \nthe lands potentially affected by a designation are owned and managed \nby the Forest Service and will not affect private property owners.\n  Fossil Creek is a unique Arizona treasure, and would benefit greatly \nfrom the protection and recognition offered through Wild and Scenic \ndesignation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 95. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act \nto ensure that every uninsured child in America has health insurance \ncoverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the first bill I am introducing in \nthe 110th Congress is the Kids Come First Act, legislation that would \nensure every child in America has health care coverage. The Kids Come \nFirst Act was also the first bill I introduced in the 109th Congress \nand I feel just as strongly today as I did at the beginning of the last \nCongress that insuring all children must be a top agenda item. In the \ntwo years since I last introduced this bill, the problem of uninsured \nchildren in this nation has actually worsened.\n  The 110th Congress faces many challenges, from the war in Iraq to \nlobbying reform. But perhaps no issue bears more directly on the lives \nof more Americans than health care reform. Today 47 million Americans \nare uninsured, including 11 million under age 21. Health care has \nbecome a slow-motion Katrina that is ruining lives and bankrupting \nfamilies all over the country. We cannot stand by as the ranks of the \nuninsured rise and American families find themselves in peril.\n  A recent Census Bureau report revealed that for the first time in \nalmost a decade the number of uninsured children increased. In 2005 \nthere were 361,000 children under the age of 18 added to the uninsured \nrolls. And the number of Americans without health care continues to \nrise.\n  The Kids Come First Act calls for a Federal-State partnership to \nmandate health coverage to every child in America. The proposal makes \nthe states an offer they can't refuse. The federal government will pay \nfor the most expensive part: enrolling all low-income children in \nMedicaid, automatically. The states will pay to expand coverage to \nhigher income children. In the end, states across the country will save \nmore than $6 billion a year, and every child will have health care.\n  It is totally unacceptable that, in the greatest country in the \nworld, millions of children are not getting the health care they need. \nThe Kids Come First Act expands coverage for children up to age of 21. \nThrough expanding the programs that work, such as Medicaid and SCHIP, \nwe can cover all eleven million children uninsured children.\n  Insuring children improves their health and helps families cover the \nspiraling costs of insuring them. Covering all kids will reduce \navoidable hospitalizations by 22 percent and replace expensive critical \ncare with inexpensive preventative care. Also, when children get the \nmedical attention they need, they pay much better attention in the \nclassroom and studies show their performance improves.\n  To pay for the expansion of health insurance for children, the Kids \nCome First Act includes a provision that provides the Secretary of \nTreasury with the authority to raise the highest income tax rate of 35 \npercent to a rate not higher than 39.6 percent in order to offset the \ncosts. Prior to the enactment of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Act \nReconciliation Act of 2001, the top marginal rate was 39.6 percent. \nLess than one percent of taxpayers pay the top rate and for 2007, this \nrate only affects individual with income above $349,700.\n  The health care of our children is a priority that we must address \nand it can be done in a fiscally responsible manner. I will continue to \nwork to find ways to offset the cost of my proposal. The wealthiest of \nall Americans do not need a tax cut when 11 million children do not \neven have health insurance. President Bush has called for this rate cut \nto be made permanent, but I believe it would be a better use of our \nresources to invest in our future by improving health care for \nchildren.\n  Since I first introduced the Kids Come First Act in the 109th \nCongress, more than 500,000 people have shown their support for the \nbill by becoming Citizen Cosponsors and another 20,000 Americans called \ninto our ``Give Voices to Our Values'' hotline to share their personal \nstories. In addition, a coalition of 24 non-profit organizations \nrepresenting 20 million people from across the country have endorsed \nKids Come First, including the National Association of Children's \nHospitals, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of \nFamily Physicians, March of Dimes, the Small Business Service Bureau, \nAFL-CIO, SEIU, and AFSCME.\n  It is clear that providing health care coverage for our uninsured \nchildren is a priority for our nation's workers, businesses, and health \ncare community. They know, as I do, that further delay only results in \ngraver health problems for America's children. Their future, and ours, \ndepends on us doing better. I urge my colleagues to support and help \nenacting the Kids Come First Act of 2007 during this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Kids Come First Act of \n2007 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 95\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Need for universal coverage.--\n       (A) Currently, there are 9,000,000 children under the age \n     of 19 that are uninsured. One out of every 8 children are \n     uninsured while 1 in 5 Hispanic children and 1 in 7 African \n     American children are uninsured. Three-quarters, \n     approximately 6,800,000, of these children are eligible but \n     not enrolled in the Medicaid program or the State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Long-range studies found \n     that 1 in 3 children went without health insurance for all or \n     part of 2002 and 2003.\n       (B) Low-income children are 3 times as likely as children \n     in higher income families to be uninsured. It is estimated \n     that 65 percent of uninsured children have at least 1 parent \n     working full time over the course of the year.\n       (C) It is estimated that 50 percent of all legal immigrant \n     children in families with income that is less than 200 \n     percent of the Federal poverty line are uninsured. In States \n     without programs to cover immigrant children, 57 percent of \n     noncitizen children are uninsured.\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\n       (D) Children in the Southern and Western parts of the \n     United States were nearly 1.7 times more likely to be \n     uninsured than children in the Northeast. In the Northeast, \n     9.4 percent of children are uninsured while in the Midwest, \n     8.3 percent are uninsured. The South's rate of uninsured \n     children is 14.3 percent while the West has an uninsured rate \n     of 13 percent.\n       (E) Children's health care needs are neglected in the \n     United States. One out of every 5 children has problems \n     accessing needed care and one-quarter of young children in \n     the United States are not fully up to date on their basic \n     immunizations. One-third of children with chronic asthma do \n     not get a prescription for the necessary medications to \n     manage the disease and 1 out of every 4 children do not \n     receive annual dental exams.\n       (F) Children without health insurance are twice as likely \n     as insured children to not receive any medical care in a \n     given year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, nearly \\1/2\\ of all uninsured children have not \n     had a well-child visit in the past year. One in 6 uninsured \n     children had a delayed or unmet medical need in the past \n     year. Minority children are less likely to receive proven \n     treatments such as prescription medications to treat chronic \n     disease.\n       (G) There are 7,600,000 young adults between the ages of 19 \n     and 20. In the United States, approximately 28 percent, or \n     2,100,000 individuals, of this group are uninsured.\n       (H) Chronic illness and disability among children are on \n     the rise. Children most at risk for chronic illness and \n     disability are children who are most likely to be poor and \n     uninsured.\n       (2) Role of the medicaid and state children's health \n     insurance programs.--\n       (A) The Medicaid program and SCHIP serve as a crucial \n     health safety net for 30,000,000 children. During the recent \n     economic downturn and the highest number of uninsured \n     individuals ever recorded in the United States, the Medicaid \n     program and SCHIP offset losses in employer-sponsored \n     coverage. While the number of children living in low-income \n     families increased between 2000 and 2005, the number of \n     uninsured children fell due to the Medicaid program and \n     SCHIP.\n       (B) 28,000,000 children are enrolled today in the Medicaid \n     program, accounting for \\1/2\\ of all enrollees and only 18 \n     percent of total program costs.\n       (C) The Medicaid program and SCHIP do more than just fill \n     in the gaps. Gains in public coverage have reduced the \n     percentage of low-income uninsured children by \\1/3\\ from \n     1997 to 2005. In addition, a study found that publicly-\n     insured children are more likely to obtain medical care, \n     preventive care, and dental care than similar low-income \n     privately-insured children.\n       (D) Publicly funded programs such as the Medicaid program \n     and SCHIP actually improve children's health. Children who \n     are currently insured by public programs are in better health \n     than they were a year ago. Expansion of coverage for children \n     and pregnant women under the Medicaid program and SCHIP \n     reduces rates of avoidable hospitalizations by 22 percent and \n     has been proven to reduce childhood deaths, infant mortality \n     rates, and the incidence of low birth weight.\n       (E) Studies have found that children enrolled in public \n     insurance programs experienced a 68-percent improvement in \n     measures of school performance.\n       (F) Despite the success of expansions in general under the \n     Medicaid program and SCHIP, due to current budget \n     constraints, many States have stopped doing aggressive \n     outreach and have raised premiums and cost-sharing \n     requirements on families under these programs. In addition, 8 \n     States stopped enrollment in SCHIP for a period of time \n     between April 2003 and July 2004. As a result, SCHIP \n     enrollment fell by 200,000 children for the first time in the \n     program's history.\n       (G) It is estimated that nearly 50 percent of children \n     covered through SCHIP do not remain in the program due to \n     reenrollment barriers. A recent study found that between 10 \n     and 40 percent of these children are ``lost'' in the system. \n     Difficult renewal policies and reenrollment barriers make \n     seamless coverage in SCHIP unattainable. Studies indicate \n     that as many as 67 percent of children who were eligible but \n     not enrolled for SCHIP had applied for coverage but were \n     denied due to procedural issues.\n       (H) While the Medicaid program and SCHIP expansions to date \n     have done much to offset what otherwise would have been a \n     significant loss of coverage among children because of \n     declining access to employer coverage, the shortcomings of \n     previous expansions, such as the failure to enroll all \n     eligible children and caps on enrollment in SCHIP because of \n     under-funding, also are clear.\n\n    TITLE I--EXPANDED COVERAGE OF CHILDREN UNDER MEDICAID AND SCHIP\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure a \nfairer and simpler method of taxing controlled foreign corporations of \nUnited States shareholders, to treat certain foreign corporations \nmanaged and controlled in the United States as domestic corporations, \nto codify the economic substance doctrine, and to eliminate the top \ncorporate income tax rate, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Export \nProducts Not Jobs Act.'' Our tax code is extremely complicated. In \n1994, the IRS estimated that a family that itemized their deductions \nand had some interest and capital gains would spend 11\\1/2\\ hours \npreparing their Federal income tax return. A decade later in 2004, this \nestimate increased to 19 hours and 45 minutes. It is time for Congress \nto pass bipartisan tax legislation in the style of the Tax Reform Act \nof 1986, which greatly simplified the tax code. And our tax reform \nshould be based upon the following three principles: fairness, \nsimplicity, and opportunity for economic growth.\n  Citizens and businesses struggle to comply with rules governing \ntaxation of business income, capital gains, income phase-outs, \nextenders, the myriad savings vehicles, recordkeeping for itemized \ndeductions, the alternative minimum tax (AMT), the earned income tax \ncredit (EITC), and taxation of foreign business income. I believe that \nour international tax system needs to be simplified and reformed to \nencourage businesses to remain in the United States. And today, I am \nintroducing legislation that I hope will be fully considered as we \ncontinue our discussions on tax reform.\n  Presently, the complexities of our international tax system actually \nencourage U.S. corporations to invest overseas. Current tax laws allow \ncompanies to defer paying U.S. taxes on income earned by their foreign \nsubsidiaries, which provides a substantial tax break for companies that \nmove investment and jobs overseas. Today, under U.S. tax law, a company \nthat is trying to decide where to locate production or services--either \nin the United States or in a foreign low-tax haven--is actually given a \nsubstantial tax incentive not only to move jobs overseas, but to \nreinvest profits permanently, as opposed to bringing the profits back \nto re-invest in the United States.\n  Recent press articles have revealed examples of companies taking \nadvantage of this perverse incentive in our tax code. For instance, \nsome companies have taken advantage of this initiative by opening \nsubsidiaries to serve markets throughout Europe. Much of the profit \nearned by these subsidiaries will stay in the European countries and \nthe companies therefore avoid paying U.S. taxes. Other companies have \nannounced the expansion of jobs in India. This reflects a continued \npattern among some U.S. multinational companies of shifting software \ndevelopment and call centers to India, and this trend is starting to \nexpand include the shifting critical functions like design and research \nand development to India as well. Some companies are even outsourcing \nthe preparation of U.S. tax returns.\n  The Export Products Not Jobs Act would put an to end to these \npractices by eliminating tax breaks that encourage companies to move \njobs overseas and by using the savings to create jobs in the United \nStates by repealing the top corporate rate. This legislation ends tax \nbreaks that encourage companies to move jobs by: 1. eliminating the \nability of companies to defer, paying U.S. taxes on foreign income; 2. \nclosing abusive corporate tax loopholes; and 3. repealing the top \ncorporate rate. It removes the incentive to shift jobs overseas by \neliminating deferral so that companies pay taxes on their international \nincome as they earn it, rather than being allowed to defer taxes.\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\n  Last Congress, the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Revenue held a \nhearing on international tax laws. Stephen Shay, a former Reagan \nTreasury official, testified that our tax rules ``provide incentives to \nlocate business activity outside the United States.'' Furthermore, he \nsuggested that taxation of U.S. shareholders under an expansion of \nSubpart F would be a ``substantial improvement'' over our current \nsystem. The Export Products Not Jobs Act does just that.\n\n  Our current tax system punishes U.S. companies that choose to create \nand maintain jobs in the United States. These companies pay higher \ntaxes and suffer a competitive disadvantage with a company that chooses \nto move jobs to a foreign tax haven. There is no reason why our tax \ncode should provide an incentive that encourages investment and job \ncreation overseas. Under my legislation, companies would be taxed the \nsame whether they invest abroad or at home; they will be taxed on their \nforeign subsidiary profits just like they are taxed on their domestic \nprofits.\n  This legislation reflects the most sweeping simplification of \ninternational taxes in over 40 years. Our economy has changed in the \nlast 40 years and our tax laws need to be updated to keep pace. Our \ncurrent global economy was not even envisioned when existing law was \nwritten.\n  My Export Products Not Jobs Act will in no way hinder our global \ncompetitiveness. Companies will be able to continue to defer income \nthey earn when they locate production in a foreign country that serves \nthat foreign country's markets. For example, if a U.S. company wants to \nopen a hotel in Bermuda or a car factory in India to sell cars, foreign \nincome can still be deferred. But if a company wants to open a call \ncenter in India to answer calls from outside India or relocate abroad \nto sell cars back to the United States or Canada, the company must pay \ntaxes just like call centers and auto manufacturers located in the \nUnited States.\n  Currently, American companies allocate their revenue not in search of \nthe highest return, but in search of lower taxes. Eliminating deferral \nwill improve the efficiency of the economy by making taxes neutral so \nthat they do not encourage companies to overinvest abroad solely for \ntax reasons.\n  The Congressional Research Service stated in a 2003 report that, \n``[a]ccording to traditional economic theory, deferral thus reduces \neconomic welfare by encouraging firms to undertake overseas investments \nthat are less productive--before taxes are considered--than alternative \ninvestments in the United States.'' Additionally, a 2000 Department of \nTreasury study on deferral stated, ``[a]mong all of the options \nconsidered, ending deferral would also be likely to have the most \npositive long-term effect on economic efficiency and welfare because it \nwould do the most to eliminate tax considerations from decisions \nregarding the location of investment.''\n  The ``Export Products Not Jobs Act'' would modify the rules for \ndetermining residency for publicly-traded companies by basing a \ncorporation's residence on the location of its primary place of \nmanagement and control. This will prevent companies from locating in \ntax havens, but basically maintaining their operations in the United \nStates. This provision should not hinder foreign investment in the \nUnited States. Existing companies that are incorporated in foreign \ncountries with a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States will \nnot be affected by this provision.\n  Massachusetts is an example of a state that benefits from foreign \ninvestment. Two foreign companies have recently expanded investment in \nMassachusetts. Our tax system should not discourage foreign investment, \nbut it should not encourage companies to locate in tax havens.\n  The revenue raised from the repeal of deferral and closing corporate \nloopholes would be used to repeal the top corporate tax rate of 35 \npercent. The tax differential between U.S. corporate rates and foreign \ncorporate rates has grown over the last two decades and the repeal of \nthe top corporate rate is a start in narrowing this gap.\n  The Export Products Not Jobs Act would promote equity among U.S. \ntaxpayers by ensuring that corporations could not eliminate or \nsubstantially reduce taxation of foreign income by separately \nincorporating their foreign operations. This legislation will eliminate \nthe tax incentives to encourage U.S. companies to invest abroad and \nreward those companies that have chosen to invest in the United States. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in this effort, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that summary of the Export Products Not Jobs Act, as well as \nthe text of the legislation, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                      Export Products Not Jobs Act\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       The Export Products Not Jobs Act makes sweeping changes to \n     the current international tax laws by: (1) ending tax breaks \n     that encourage companies to move jobs overseas by eliminating \n     the ability of companies to defer paying U.S. taxes on \n     foreign income; (2) simplifying current-law Subpart F rules; \n     (3) closing abusive corporate tax loopholes; and (4) \n     repealing the top corporate tax rate.\n       Current tax laws allow companies to defer paying U.S. taxes \n     on income earned by their foreign subsidiaries, providing a \n     substantial tax break for companies to move investment and \n     jobs overseas. Except as provided under the Subpart F rules, \n     American companies generally do not have to pay taxes on \n     their active foreign income until they repatriate it to the \n     United States.\n       The Export Products Not Jobs Act eliminates deferral so \n     companies will be taxed on their foreign subsidiary profits \n     in the same way they are taxed on their domestic profits. \n     This new system will apply to profits in future years. In \n     order to ensure that American companies can compete in \n     international markets, income companies earn when they locate \n     production in a foreign country that serves that foreign \n     country's home markets can still be deferred.\n       The Subpart F rules which govern the taxation of foreign \n     subsidiaries controlled by American companies have become \n     increasingly complicated over time, adding to the overall \n     complexity of the tax code and making it easier for companies \n     to exploit loopholes to escape paying taxes. Under this bill, \n     the complexity created by the current Subpart F rules will be \n     eliminated and a simpler, more transparent system will be put \n     into place.\n       In a tax system without deferral, U.S.-based multinational \n     corporations might be tempted to locate their top-tiered \n     entity overseas to avoid taxation on the income of a foreign \n     subsidiary. This legislation would strengthen the corporate \n     residency test by preventing companies from incorporating in \n     a foreign jurisdiction to avoid U.S. taxation on a worldwide \n     basis. The current law test that is based solely on where the \n     company is incorporated is artificial, and allows foreign \n     corporations that are economically similar to American \n     companies to avoid being taxed like American companies. \n     Determining residency based on the location of a company's \n     primary place of management and control will provide a more \n     meaningful standard.\n       In order to prevent abusive tax transactions, the \n     legislation includes a provision that would codify the \n     judicially-developed economic substance test, which disallows \n     transactions where the profit potential is insubstantial \n     compared to the tax benefits. This proposal is identical to \n     the economic substance provisions that have been passed \n     repeatedly by the Senate.\n       The revenue saved from ending deferral, strengthening the \n     corporate residency test, and shutting down abusive tax \n     shelters will be used to lower the maximum corporate tax rate \n     from 35 percent to 34 percent. The tax differential between \n     U.S. corporations and foreign corporate rates has grown over \n     the last two decades. This proposal, in combination with the \n     deduction for domestic manufacturing activity when fully \n     phased-in in 2009, will result in a corporate tax rate of 31 \n     percent for domestic manufacturing activity. The ``Export \n     Products Not Jobs Act'' moves in the right direction towards \n     narrowing this gap.\n\n\n                         SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS\n\n     I. Reform and Simplification of Subpart F Income\n     Subpart F Income Defined\n       Present law\n       Generally within the U.S., 10-percent shareholders of a \n     controlled foreign corporation (CFC) are taxed on the pro \n     rata shares of certain income referred to as Subpart F \n     income. A CFC generally is defined as any foreign corporation \n     in which U.S. persons (directly, indirectly, or \n     constructively) own more than 50 percent of the corporation's \n     stock (measured by vote or value), taking into account only \n     those U.S. persons that own at least 10 percent of the stock \n     (measured by vote only). Typically, Subpart F income is \n     passive income or income that is readily movable from one \n     taxing jurisdiction to another. Subpart F income is defined \n     in code section 952 as foreign base company income, insurance \n     income, and certain income relating to international boycotts \n     and other violations of public policy.\n       Export Products Not Jobs Act\n       This legislation strikes code section 952 and replaces it \n     with a new definition of Subpart F income. Generally, Subpart \n     F income is defined as all gross income of the controlled \n     foreign corporation with exceptions\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\n     for certain types of income. Subpart F income of a CFC for \n     any taxable year is limited to the earnings and profits of \n     the CFC for that taxable year. Subpart F will continue to \n     include income related to international boycotts.\n     Exceptions to Subpart F Income\n       Present law\n       Subpart F income is defined in the code rather narrowly and \n     the definition lists the income that it includes. Subpart F \n     income is currently taxed, and other income of a U.S. \n     person's CFC that conducts foreign operations generally is \n     subject to U.S. tax only when it is repatriated to the United \n     States.\n       Temporary Active Financing Exception\n       Under current law, there are temporary exceptions from the \n     Subpart F provisions for certain active financing income, \n     which is income derived in the active conduct of a banking, \n     financing, or similar business, or in the conduct of an \n     insurance business. This temporary exception expires at the \n     end of 2008. To be eligible for this exception, \n     substantially all transactions must be conducted directly \n     by the CFC or a qualified business unit of a CFC in its \n     home country.\n       Export Products Not Jobs Act\n       Under the legislation, Subpart F income is generally all \n     income of a CFC except for active home country income of the \n     CFC. Active home country income constitutes qualified \n     property income or qualified service income and is derived \n     from the active and regular conduct of one or more trades or \n     businesses within the home country. The home country is \n     defined as the country in which the CFC is created or \n     organized.\n       Qualified property income is defined as income derived in \n     connection with: (1) the manufacture, production, growth, or \n     extraction of any personal property within the home country \n     of the CFC; or (2) the resale in the home country of the CFC \n     of personal property manufactured, produced, grown, or \n     extracted within the home country of such corporation for the \n     resale of such property by the CFC in the home country. The \n     property has to be sold for use or consumption within the \n     home country in either case.\n       Qualified services income is defined as income derived in \n     connection with the providing of services in transactions \n     with customers who, at the time the services are provided, \n     are located in the home country. Services are required: (1) \n     to be used in the home country; or (2) to be used in the \n     active conduct of trade or business by the recipient where \n     substantially all of the activities in connection with the \n     trade or business are conducted by the recipient in the home \n     country.\n       Under the ``Export Products Not Jobs Act,'' the current-law \n     temporary active financing exception is repealed. The \n     legislation includes a de minimis exception providing that if \n     the Subpart F income of a CFC is less than the lesser of five \n     percent of gross income, or $1 million, the Subpart F income \n     of the CFC is zero for that taxable year.\n       For purposes of calculating the Subpart F income of a CFC, \n     properly allocated deductions are allowed.\n       A CFC can elect to be treated as a domestic corporation. \n     The election will apply to the taxable year for which it is \n     made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the \n     consent of the Secretary. If a CFC chooses to make an \n     election to be treated as a domestic corporation, pre-2008 \n     earnings and profits are not included in gross income.\n     Captive Insurance Income\n       Present Law\n       Under current law, special rules apply to captive insurance \n     companies that have related person insurance income which is \n     defined as any insurance income attributable to a policy of \n     insurance or reinsurance with respect to which the person \n     (directly or indirectly) insured is a U.S. shareholder in the \n     foreign corporation or a related person to such a \n     shareholder. These companies are formed to insure the risks \n     of the owners. Under current law, a lower ownership threshold \n     applies to determine whether a captive insurance company \n     is treated as a CFC subject to the current-law income \n     inclusion rules of Subpart F. Under this lower ownership \n     threshold, a captive insurance company is treated as a CFC \n     if 25 percent or more of the stock is owned by U.S. \n     persons.\n       The special rules for captive insurance companies were \n     added in 1986 because Congress was concerned that the \n     ownership of these companies was often dispersed widely and \n     that these companies were not covered by the otherwise \n     applicable ownership threshold for a CFC.\n       Export Products Not Jobs Act\n       The bill retains, in simplified form, the present-law \n     concept of related person insurance income, and also retains \n     the lower ownership threshold for captive insurance companies \n     that are treated as CFCs. Captive insurance income that meets \n     the requirements of the active home exception, like other \n     active home country services income, however, can be \n     deferred.\n     Effective Date\n       The above described provisions apply to taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2007.\n     II. Corporate Residency Definition\n       Present Law\n       The place of incorporation or organization determines \n     whether a corporation is treated as foreign or domestic for \n     purposes of U.S. tax law. A corporation is treated as \n     domestic if it is incorporated or organized under the laws of \n     the United States or of any State.\n       Export Products Not Jobs Act\n       The bill amends the rules for determining corporate \n     residency for publicly-traded companies incorporated or \n     organized in a foreign country, by basing such corporation's \n     residence on the location of its primary place of management \n     and control. A company incorporated or organized in the \n     United States is still considered a domestic corporation in \n     any event. Primary place of management and control is defined \n     as the place where the executive officers and senior \n     management of the corporation exercise day-to-day \n     responsibility for the strategic, financial, and operational \n     decision-making for the company (including direct and \n     indirect subsidiaries).\n     Effective Date\n       The proposal would be effective for taxable years beginning \n     on or after two years after the date of enactment. A \n     corporation that is in existence on the date of enactment and \n     is incorporated in a country in which the United States has a \n     comprehensive tax treaty is not affected by this provision.\n     III. Shutdown of Abusive Tax Shelters\n\n     Clarification of Economic Substance Doctrine\n       Present Law\n       Under current law, there are specific rules regarding the \n     computation of taxable income. In addition to these statutory \n     provisions, courts have developed several doctrines that can \n     be applied to deny the tax benefits of motivated \n     transactions, even though the transaction meets the \n     requirements of a specific tax provision. Generally, courts \n     have denied tax benefits if the transaction lacks economic \n     substance independent of tax considerations.\n       Export Products Not Jobs Act\n       Clarifies that a transaction has economic substance only if \n     the taxpayer establishes that: (1) the transaction changes in \n     a meaningful way (aside from Federal income tax consequences) \n     the taxpayer's economic position; and (2) the taxpayer has a \n     substantial non-tax purpose for entering into such a \n     transaction and the transaction is a reasonable means of \n     accomplishing such purpose. This proposal applies to \n     transactions entered into after the date of enactment.\n     Penalty for Understatements Attributable to Transactions \n         Lacking Economic Substance\n       Present Law\n       Under current law, there are various penalties for \n     understatements. There is a 20 percent accuracy-related \n     penalty imposed on any understatement attributable to any \n     adequately disclosed listed transaction or certain reportable \n     transactions (``reportable transaction understatement''). The \n     penalty is increased to 30 percent if such a transaction is \n     not adequately disclosed in accordance with regulations.\n       Export Products Not Jobs Act\n       The bill imposes a 40 percent penalty on any understatement \n     attributable to any transaction that lacks economic substance \n     (``noneconomic substance underpayment''). The rate is reduced \n     to 20 percent if the taxpayer discloses the transaction in \n     accordance with regulations.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to replace \nthe Hope and Lifetime Learning credits with a partially refundable \ncollege opportunity credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the College \nOpportunity Tax Credit Act of 2007. This legislation creates a new tax \ncredit that will put the cost of higher education in reach for American \nfamilies.\n  An October 2006 College Board report found that this year tuition and \nother costs at public and private universities rose faster than \ninflation. And, according to the report, tuition and fees at public \nuniversities rose more in the past five years than at any other time in \nthe past 30 years, increasing by 35 percent to $5,836 this academic \nyear. Over the same time period, tuition and fees at private \nuniversities increased 22 percent to $22,218.\n  Unfortunately, neither student aid funds nor family incomes are \nkeeping pace with increasing tuition and fees. In my travels around the \ncountry, I frequently hear from parents concerned they will not be able \nto pay for their children's college. These parents know that earning a \ncollege education will result in greater earnings for their children \nand they desperately want to ensure their kids have the greatest \nopportunities possible.\n  In 1997, we implemented two new tax credits to make college \naffordable--the HOPE Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit. These tax \ncredits were important and have put college in reach for families, but \nI believe we can do more. In December, the Senate Finance Committee \nheld a hearing on tax incentives for higher education in which we \nlearned that the existing tax credits are not reaching enough students, \nparticularly lower-income students who are most severely impacted by \nrising tuitions.\n  The HOPE and Lifetime Learning credits are not refundable, and \ntherefore a family of four must have an income over $30,000 in order to \nreceive the maximum credit. Almost half of families with college \nstudents fail to receive the full credit because their income is too \nlow. In order to receive the full benefit of the Lifetime Learning \ncredit, a student has to spend $10,000 a year on tuition and fees. This \nis nearly double the average annual public four-year college tuition \nand four times the average annual tuition of a community college. Over \n80 percent of college students attend schools with tuition and fees \nunder $10,000.\n  In 2004, I proposed a refundable tax credit to help pay for the cost \nof four years of college. Currently the HOPE Credit applies only to the \nfirst two years of college. The College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of \n2007 (COTC) helps students and parents afford all four years of \ncollege. It also builds on the proposal I made in 2004 by incorporating \nsome of the suggestions made by experts, including those at this\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nweek's Finance Committee hearing. My legislation creates a new credit \nthat replaces the existing HOPE credit and Lifetime Learning credit and \nultimately makes these benefits more generous.\n  The COTC has two components. The first provides a refundable tax \ncredit for a student enrolled in a degree program at least on a half-\ntime basis. It would provide a 100 percent tax credit for the first \n$1,000 of eligible expenses and a 50 percent tax credit to the next \n$3,000 of expenses. The maximum credit would be $2,500 each year per \nstudent. The second provides a nonrefundable tax credit for part-time \nstudents, graduate students, and other students that do not qualify for \nthe refundable tax credit. It provides a 40 percent credit for the \nfirst $1,000 of eligible expenses and a 20 percent credit for the next \n$3,000 of expenses.\n  Both of these credits can be used for expenses associated with \ntuition and fees. The same income limits that apply to the HOPE credit \nand the Lifetime Learning credit apply to the COTC; the COTC will be \nphased out ratably for taxpayers with income between $45,000 and \n$55,000 ($90,000 and $110,000 for married taxpayers). These amounts are \nindexed for inflation, as are the eligible amounts of expenses.\n  The College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 2007 simplifies the \nexisting credits that make higher education more affordable and will \nenable more students to be eligible for tax relief. I understand that \nmany of my colleagues are interested in making college more affordable. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to make a refundable tax \ncredit for college education a reality this Congress. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 97\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

                                \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 98. A bill to foster the development of minority-owned small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this statement \nbe printed in the record. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMinority\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\nEntrepreneurship Development Act of 2007. At the beginning of a new \nCongress it is important to set priorities for the nation because every \nnew Congress brings with it the hope for a brighter future. One of the \nways that this new Senate will lead is by creating opportunities for \nmore Americans to pursue the American dream. As incoming Chair of the \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I hope to help in that \neffort by fostering the development of entrepreneurship in minority \ncommunities. It's vital that current and future entrepreneurs from \nminority communities are given the opportunity to build their own piece \nof the American dream. I believe that this legislation the Minority \nEntrepreneurship Development Act of 2007 will help in that effort.\n  I want to take a moment and tell you why it's so important to expand \nthe numbers of entrepreneurs in the minority community. As a member of \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have \nreceived firsthand testimony and countless reports documenting the \npositive economic impact that occurs when we foster entrepreneurship in \nunder-served communities. There are signs of significant economic \nreturns when minority businesses are created and are able to grow in \nsize and capacity. Between 1987 and 1997, revenue from minority owned \nfirms rose by 22.5 percent, an increase equivalent to an annual growth \nrate of 10 percent. Employment opportunities within minority owned \nfirms increased by 23 percent during that same period. There is a clear \ncorrelation between the growth of minority owned firms and the economic \nviability of the minority community.\n  Although these economic numbers tell a significant part of the story \nthey don't tell the whole story of what these firms mean to the \nminority communities they serve and represent. Many of these business \nleaders are first generation immigrants; many are first generation \nbusiness owners and many represent, for those in their communities, \nwhat hard work, determination and patience can do.\n  We must encourage those kinds of values in our minority communities \nand, quite frankly, in our nation as a whole. For generations, millions \nhave come to our shores in search of a better life. Millions of others \nwere brought here by force and for years were not given a voice in how \ntheir lives would turn out. But, how ever we got here, we all have \nbecome branches of this great tree we call America. This tree is still \nnourished by roots planted by our forefathers more than 200 years ago. \nThose men and women planted the roots of hard work, innovation, faith \nand risk taking.\n  When you think about it, those words are the perfect description of \nan entrepreneur. It is the spirit of entrepreneurship that has made our \nnation great. And that is why it is absolutely imperative that we \ncontinue to support and develop that spirit in our minority \ncommunities. To that end, this legislation provides several tools to \nhelp minority entrepreneurs as they develop and grow their businesses.\n  First, this legislation will create an Office of Minority Small \nBusiness Development at the Small Business Administration. One of its \nprimary functions will be to increase the number of small business \nloans that minority businesses receive. Latinos, African-Americans, \nAsian-Americans and women have been receiving far fewer small business \nloans than they reasonably should.\n  To ensure that this trend is reversed and minorities begin to get a \ngreater share of loan dollars, venture capital investments, counseling, \nand contracting opportunities, this bill will give the new office the \nauthority to monitor the outcomes for SBA's Capital Access, \nEntrepreneurial Development, and Government Contracting programs. It \nalso requires the head of the Office to work with SBA's partners, trade \nassociations and business groups to identify more effective ways to \nmarket to minority business owners, and to work with the head of SBA's \nField Operations to ensure that district offices have staff and \nresources to market to minorities.\n  Second, this legislation will create the Minority Entrepreneurship \nand Innovation Pilot Program. This program will offer a competitive \ngrant to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, \nand Hispanic-Serving Institutions to create an entrepreneurship \ncurriculum at these institutions and to open Small Business Development \nCenters on those campus' to serve local businesses.\n  The goal of this program is to target students in highly skilled \nfields such as engineering, manufacturing, science and technology, and \nguide them towards entrepreneurship as a career option. Traditionally, \nminority-owned businesses are disproportionately represented in the \nservice sectors. Promoting entrepreneurial education to undergraduate \nstudents will help expand business ownership beyond the service sectors \nto higher yielding technical and financial sectors.\n  Third, this legislation will create the Minority Access to \nInformation Distance Learning Pilot Program. This program will offer \ncompetitive grants to well established national minority non-profit and \nbusiness organizations to create distance learning programs for small \nbusiness owners who are interested in doing business with the federal \ngovernment.\n  The goal of this program is to provide low cost training to the many \nsmall business owners who cannot afford to pay a consultant thousands \nof dollars for advice or training on how to prepare themselves to \ncontract with the Federal Government. There are thousands of small \nbusinesses in this country that are excellent and efficient. They are \nprimed to provide the goods and services that this nation needs to stay \ncompetitive. This program will help prepare them to do just that.\n  Finally, this legislation will extend the Socially and Economically \nDisadvantaged Business Program which expired in 2003. This program \nprovides a price evaluation adjustment for socially and economically \ndisadvantaged businesses as a way of increasing their competitiveness \nwhen bidding against larger firms. This is one more tool to increase \nopportunities for our minority small business owners.\n  I have outlined several ways that we can create a more positive \nenvironment for our minority small business community. These are \nreasonable steps that we ought to take without delay. Moreover, these \nare important steps that will help bolster a movement that is already \nunderway. According to U.S. Census data, Hispanics are opening \nbusinesses 3 times faster than the national average. Also, business \ndevelopment and entrepreneurship have played a significant role in the \nexpansion of the black middle class in this country for over a century. \nThese business owners are embodying the entrepreneurial spirit that our \nforefathers carried with them as they established this nation.\n  With this legislation and in my role as incoming Chair of the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I hope to play a part \nin helping to extend that spirit to the next generation of \nentrepreneurs. Not only is this vital for our minority communities, but \nit is vital for America. I urge my colleagues to join with me in \nsupport of the Minority Entrepreneurship Development Act of 2007.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 098\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Minority Entrepreneurship \n     Development Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to provide a \nrefundable credit for small business employee health insurance \nexpenses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Small Business \nHealth Care Tax Credit Act which would provide small businesses with a \nrefundable tax credit to help with the cost of providing employees with \nhealth insurance. Recent studies show that certain groups of \nindividuals are less likely to have employer-provided health insurance. \nThe 2006 Kaiser Family Foundation Employer Health Benefits Survey shows \nthat since 2000 the number of firms offering health benefits has \ndeclined from 69 percent to 61 percent in 2006. This decline in \ncoverage is more prevalent in small businesses. Only 48 percent of the \nfirms with less than 10 employees offer health insurance whereas, 90 \npercent of the firms with 50 or more employees offer health benefits. \nApproximately 32 million Americans work for firms with fewer than 50 \nemployees.\n  The April 2006 Commonwealth Fund Biennial Health Insurance Survey \nconcluded that 41 percent of working-age Americans with incomes between \n$20,000 and $40,000 were uninsured for at least part of the past year. \nThis reflects a dramatic increase in this income range, up from 28 \npercent in 2001. The survey found that of the 48 million American \nadults who were uninsured in the past year, 67 percent were in families \nwhere at least one person worked full time.\n  My legislation provides a refundable tax credit to small businesses \ndesigned to help provide coverage to those who are currently uninsured. \nSmall businesses with less than 50 employees would be eligible to \nreceive a tax credit to help with the cost of health care premiums for \nemployees making more than $5,000 and less than $50,000 a year. To be \neligible for the credit, the employer has to pay at least 50 percent of \nthe health care insurance premium. The credit for businesses with fewer \nthan 10 employees will be capped at 50 percent of the cost of the \npremium, and the credit amount decreases for larger businesses.\n  Last year, Leonard Burman, Codirector of the Tax Policy Center, \ntestified before the Senate Finance Committee and suggested a \nrefundable tax credit as an incremental option to help defray higher \nadministrative costs faced by small employers in purchasing health \ncare. This credit will help small businesses afford health care \npremiums. It is a refundable credit, so that it will help new \nbusinesses that do not yet have taxable income be able to offer health \ncare and provide struggling businesses with assistance so that they can \noffer health care.\n  This tax credit will cut the cost of health insurance by up to 50 \npercent for small business owners. It will enable small businesses to \nprovide health insurance for their low- and moderate-income employees. \nUntil we can agree on a comprehensive proposal that will help reduce \nthe cost of health care premiums for small businesses, this legislation \nprovides an appropriate option for increasing health insurance coverage \nfor small businesses and their employees.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 99\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Health Care \n     Tax Credit Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to encourage the health of children in schools by \npromoting better nutrition and increased physical activity, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Healthy \nStudents Act, a bill that addresses the rising epidemic of childhood \nobesity.\n  Over the past 30 years, obesity rates have doubled for teenagers and \ntripled for children ages 6 to 11. Today, more than 30 percent of \nchildren in America are overweight and more than 15 percent are obese. \nAs a result, more children are suffering from traditionally adult \ndiseases--including type 2 diabetes, hypertension and high \ncholesterol--and putting their health in great danger.\n  While the reasons for the growing number of obese children problems \nare complex, the underlying problem is simple. Children are becoming \nobese because they are eating too much unhealthy food and getting too \nlittle exercise.\n  Vending machines are in too many of our schools. Children today eat \nfive times as much fast food as they did 30 years ago. And the number \nof students who eat green vegetables ``nearly every day or more'' has \ndropped to only 30 percent.\n  Children are getting too little exercise. Nearly 23 percent of \nchildren ages 9-13 do not engage in any free-time physical activity \nduring the school day, and nearly 60 percent do not participate in any \nkind of organized sports or physical activity program outside of \nschool.\n  Also, the lack of qualified health professionals (school nurses)--\ncompounded with the access to them--is taking an adverse toll on \nchildren's health in our public schools. With just one licensed nurse \nfor every 1,155 students, too many children don't have access to a \ncaring health care professional who can diagnose illness, administer \nmedicine, handle emergencies, or treat injuries.\n  We should ensure that during the school day, children have access to \nbetter nutrition and health care, more physical activity, and the \nskills necessary for a lifetime of good health. And that's what the \nHealthy Students Act will do.\n  First, the bill creates a commission of children's health experts to \nreview existing school nutrition guidelines and develop new, healthier \nstandards that provide more fresh fruits and vegetables and eliminate \nfood of minimal nutritional value.\n  Second, the bill creates a grant program for school nutrition pilot \nprograms that promote alternative healthful food promotion in its \ncurriculum and lunch program.\n  I have seen firsthand what can be accomplished with such innovative \nprograms. For example in Berkeley, California, the ``Edible \nSchoolyard'' program is changing the way kids eat and learn about \nnutrition. Schools in the Edible Schoolyard program maintain an organic \ngarden and integrate the garden into both the curriculum and\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\nlunch program. This hands-on approach educates students on healthy \neating--from planting, to harvesting, to their plates. By teaching kids \nabout the connection between what they eat and where it comes from, we \ncan help them develop good nutrition habits that will last a lifetime.\n  Third, the bill creates a ``Healthy Hour'' pilot program that \nprovides funding for an additional hour to the school day either \nbefore, after or during school--set aside specifically for physical \nactivity. As more and more schools have cut recess and physical \neducation classes, the bill provides funding for programs that extend \nphysical activity time and highlight the importance of exercise for \nchildren in schools across the country.\n  Fourth, to make sure that children have the equipment they need, the \nbill provides tax incentives to individuals and businesses to donate \nexercise and gymnasium equipment to schools and organizations serving \nstudents.\n  And fifth, to address the shortage of qualified health care \nprofessionals in schools, the bill creates a tuition loan forgiveness \nprogram for those who earn a degree in nursing and make a minimum 3-\nyear commitment to work in a public elementary or secondary school. We \nare saying to prospective nurses: If you make an investment in helping \nkids, then we will make an investment in you.\n  Childhood obesity is a growing epidemic that we must address now. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Healthy Students Act to ensure that \nall children have the health they need to achieve their dreams.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 102. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand expand relief from the alternative minimum tax and to repeal the \nextension of the lower rates for capital gains and dividends for 2009 \nand 2010; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \naddresses the individual alternative minimum tax (AMT) for 2007. Last \nCongress, a choice was made to extend lower capital gains and dividends \nrates that do not expire until the end of 2008 rather than address the \nAMT for 2007. My preference was to address the AMT for 2007 and I \nbelieve we still must take action to prevent taxpayers never intended \nto pay the AMT from being penalized this year.\n  I opposed the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 \nbecause it contained the wrong priorities for America leaving behind \nworking families and substantially adding to the deficit. This law \nextended the lower rates on capital gains and dividends for 2009 and \n2010, but only addressed the individual AMT for 2006.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, those earning $200,000 \nor more will receive 84 percent of the benefit of the capital gains tax \ncut and 63 percent of the benefit of the dividends tax cuts. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, 42.8 percent of taxpayers with \nincome between $50,000 and $100,000 will be impacted by the AMT if the \nAMT is not fixed for 2007 a number that increases to 66 percent by \n2010. The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation of Act of 2005 \nextends a tax cut that does not expire to the end of 2008 with a price \ntag of $50 billion, but fails to protect the hard working families that \nwill be impacted by the AMT. These families were never intended to be \nimpacted by the AMT, a tax originally designed to prevent a small \nnumber of high-income taxpayers from avoiding taxation.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that will address the AMT for \n2007 and repeal the lower tax rates on capital dividends for 2009 and \n2010. To calculate the AMT, individuals add back certain ``preference \nitems'' to their regular tax liability. These include personal \nexemptions, the standard deduction, and the itemized deduction for \nstate and local taxes. From this amount, taxpayers subtract the AMT \nexemption amount, commonly referred to as the ``patch'' which reverted \nto lower levels at the end of 2005. The Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005 increased and extended the patch for 2006. \nThe patch was increased in order to hold the same number of taxpayers \nharmless from the AMT in 2006 as in 2005.\n  The problem with the AMT is that while the regular tax system is \nindexed for inflation, the AMT exemption amounts and tax brackets \nremain constant. This has the perverse consequence of punishing \ntaxpayers for the mere fact their incomes rose due to inflation.\n  In 2001 Congress opted to provide more tax cuts to those with incomes \nof over $1 million rather than fix a looming tax problem for the middle \nclass. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 \ndid include a small adjustment to the AMT, but it was not enough. And \nwe knew then that the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT would \ncontinue to rise steadily because the combination of tax cuts and a \nminor adjustment to the AMT would cause the AMT to explode. We are \nrapidly approaching this explosion and without immediate action \nAmerica's middle class will be harmed.\n  My legislation extends and expands the AMT exemption amount for 2007 \nto prevent additional taxpayers from being impacted by the AMT. Without \nincreasing and extending the AMT exemption for 2007, an additional 19.5 \nmillion taxpayers will be impacted by the AMT in 2007. Large families, \nwith incomes as low as $49,438, will be hurt by the AMT. My legislation \nwill allow nonrefundable personal credits such as the higher education \ntax credits and the dependent care credit against the AMT for 2007. \nThis legislation is offset by repealing the lower rates on capital \ngains and dividends.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that the \nextension of the capital gains and dividends benefits is necessary to \nprovide investor certainty. But I believe that the certainty of working \nfamilies worried about paying the AMT should come first.\n  About a third of long-term capital gains are reported by taxpayers \nwho are impacted by the AMT and due to the interaction of the AMT, they \ndo not fully benefit from the lower rates. Simply put, taxpayers forced \nto carry the AMT burden will not benefit from the lower capital gains \nand dividends rate.\n  The AMT is a looming problem that is impacting hard-working families \nand for each year that we fail to address the AMT, it gets worse and \nmore expensive. At a minimum we must address the AMT for 2007. My \nlegislation is not a long-term cure to the AMT crisis, but it will \nprovide certainty for 2007 to hard working families who will be \nimpacted by the AMT just because of where they live and the number of \nchildren they have, and it will addresses the AMT in a revenue neutral \nmanner for 2007 as well.\n  We all agree that the AMT should not be impacting families with \nincomes below $100,000. My bill fixes the AMT for 2007 in a timely and \nfiscally responsible manner and gives Congress time to work in a \nbipartisan manner to find a fiscally responsible permanent solution to \nthe AMT.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat major oil and gas companies will not be eligible for the effective \nrate reductions enacted in 2004 for domestic manufacturers; to \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Restore a \nRational Tax Rate on Petroleum Act of 2007. This legislation repeals \nthe manufacturing deduction for big oil and gas companies that was \nenacted by Congress in 2004. I introduced this legislation in the 109th \nCongress and Congressman McDermott introduced companion legislation in \nthe House.\n  The domestic manufacturing deduction was designed to replace export-\nrelated tax benefits that were successfully challenged by the European \nUnion. Producers of oil and gas did not benefit from this tax break. \nInitial legislation proposed to address the repeal of the export-\nrelated tax benefits and to replace them with a new domestic \nmanufacturing deduction. That legislation only provided the deduction \nto industries that benefited from the export-related tax benefits. \nHowever, the final product extended the deduction to include the oil \nand gas industry as well.\n  My bill repeals the manufacturing deduction for oil and gas companies \nbecause these industries suffered no detriment from the repeal of \nexport-related tax benefits. At a time when oil companies are reporting \nmind-boggling record profits, there is no reason to reward them with a \ntax deduction.\n  Like me, many Members of Congress support a windfall profits tax on \nbig oil and gas companies. Providing this deduction to oil and gas \ncompanies actually functions as a reverse windfall profits tax. This \ndeduction lowers the tax rates on the windfall profits that they are \ncurrently enjoying. And without Congressional action this benefit will \nincrease: upon enactment, the domestic manufacturing deduction was \nthree percent, but it increased to six percent in 2007 and it is \nscheduled to increase to nine percent in 2010.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. We owe it to the \nAmerican people to eliminate tax benefits to the oil industry at a time \nof record profits, record gas prices, and record deficits.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 103\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Restore a Rational Tax Rate \n     on Petroleum Production Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) like many other countries, the United States has long \n     provided export-related benefits under its tax law,\n       (2) producers and refiners of oil and natural gas were \n     specifically denied the benefits of those export-related tax \n     provisions,\n       (3) those export-related tax provisions were successfully \n     challenged by the European Union as being inconsistent with \n     our trade agreements,\n       (4) the Congress responded by repealing the export-related \n     benefits and enacting a substitute benefit that was an \n     effective rate reduction for United States manufacturers,\n       (5) producers and refiners of oil and natural gas were made \n     eligible for the rate reduction even though they suffered no \n     detriment from repeal of the export-related benefits, and\n       (6) the decision to provide the effective rate reduction to \n     producers and refiners of oil and natural gas has operated as \n     a reverse windfall profits tax, lowering the tax rate on the \n     windfall profits they are currently enjoying.\n\n     SEC. 3. DENIAL OF DEDUCTION FOR INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO \n                   DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF OIL, NATURAL GAS, OR \n                   PRIMARY PRODUCTS THEREOF.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (B) of section 199(c)(4) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exceptions) is \n     amended by striking ``or'' at the end of clause (ii), by \n     striking the period at the end of clause (iii) and inserting \n     ``, or'', and by inserting after clause (iii) the following \n     new clause:\n       ``(iv) in the case of any major integrated oil company (as \n     defined in section 167(h)(5)(B)), the production, refining, \n     processing, transportation, or distribution of oil, natural \n     gas, or any primary product thereof during any taxable year \n     described in section 167(h)(A).''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 199(c)(4) of such Code \n     is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A)(i)(III) by striking ``electricity, \n     natural gas,'' and inserting ``electricity'', and\n       (2) in subparagraph (B)(ii) by striking ``electricity, \n     natural gas,'' and inserting ``electricity''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 106. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe establishment of a National Center for Social Work Research; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \namend the Public Health Service Act for the establishment of a National \nCenter for Social Work Research. Social workers provide a multitude of \nhealth care delivery services throughout America to our children, \nfamilies, the elderly, and persons suffering from various forms of \nabuse and neglect. The purpose of this center is to support and \ndisseminate information about basic and clinical social work research, \nand training, with emphasis on service to underserved and rural \npopulations.\n  While the Federal Government provides funding for various social work \nresearch activities through the National Institutes of Health and other \nFederal agencies, there presently is no coordination or direction of \nthese critical activities and no overall assessment of needs and \nopportunities for empirical knowledge development. The establishment of \na Center for Social Work Research would result in improved behavioral \nand mental health care outcomes for our nation's children, families, \nthe elderly, and others.\n  In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-\neffective, research-based, quality health care to all Americans, we \nmust recognize the important contributions of social work researchers \nto health care delivery and the central role that the Center for Social \nWork can provide in facilitating their work.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Center for Social \n     Work Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) social workers focus on the improvement of individual \n     and family functioning and the creation of effective health \n     and mental health prevention and treatment interventions in \n     order for individuals to become more productive members of \n     society;\n       (2) social workers provide front line prevention and \n     treatment services in the areas of school violence, aging, \n     teen pregnancy, child abuse, domestic violence, juvenile \n     crime, and substance abuse, particularly in rural and \n     underserved communities; and\n       (3) social workers are in a unique position to provide \n     valuable research information on these complex social \n     concerns, taking into account a wide range of social, \n     medical, economic and community influences from an \n     interdisciplinary, family-centered and community-based \n     approach.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CENTER FOR SOCIAL WORK \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 401(a) of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 281(a)), as\n\n[[Page S112]]\n\n     amended by the National Institutes of Health Reform Act of \n     2006) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(26) The National Center for Social Work Research.''.\n       (b) Establishment.--Part E of title IV of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 287 et seq.) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n         ``Subpart 7--National Center for Social Work Research\n\n     ``SEC. 485J.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation today to \nmodify Title VII of the U.S. Public Health Service Act in order to \nprovide students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with the \nopportunity to participate in various health professions loan programs.\n  Providing students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with \neligibility for financial assistance in the form of loans, loan \nguarantees, and scholarships will facilitate a much-needed infusion of \nbehavioral science expertise into our community of public health \nproviders. There is a growing recognition of the valuable contribution \nbeing made by psychologists toward solving some of our Nation's most \ndistressing problems.\n  The participation of students from all backgrounds and clinical \ndisciplines is vital to the success of health care training. The Title \nVII programs play a significant role in providing financial support for \nthe recruitment of minorities, women, and individuals from economically \ndisadvantaged backgrounds. Minority therapists have an advantage in the \nprovision of critical services to minority populations because often \nthey can communicate with clients in their own language and cultural \nframework. Minority therapists are more likely to work in community \nsettings where ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged \nindividuals are most likely to seek care. It is critical that continued \nsupport be provided for the training of individuals who provide health \ncare services to underserved communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act to \nmake certain graduate programs in professional psychology eligible to \nparticipate in various health professions loan programs; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \namend Title VII of the Public Health Service Act to establish a \npsychology post-doctoral program. Psychologists have made a unique \ncontribution in reaching out to the Nation's medically underserved \npopulations. Expertise in behavioral science is useful in addressing \ngrave concerns such as violence, addiction, mental illness, adolescent \nand child behavioral disorders, and family disruption. Establishment of \na psychology post-doctoral program could be an effective way to find \nsolutions to these issues.\n  Similar programs supporting additional, specialized training in \ntraditionally underserved settings have been successful in retaining \nparticipants to serve the same populations. For example, mental health \nprofessionals who have participated in these specialized federally \nfunded programs have tended not only to meet their repayment \nobligations, but have continued to work in the public sector or with \nthe underserved.\n  While a doctorate in psychology provides broad-based knowledge and \nmastery in a wide variety of clinical skills, specialized post-doctoral \nfellowship programs help to develop particular diagnostic and treatment \nskills required to respond effectively to underserved populations. For \nexample, what appears to be poor academic motivation in a child \nrecently relocated from Southeast Asia might actually reflect a \ncultural value of reserve rather than a disinterest in academic \nlearning. Specialized assessment skills enable the clinician to \ninitiate effective treatment.\n  Domestic violence poses a significant public health problem and is \nnot just a problem for the criminal justice system. Violence against \nwomen results in thousands of hospitalizations a year. Rates of child \nand spouse abuse in rural areas are particularly high, as are the rates \nof alcohol abuse and depression in adolescents. A post-doctoral \nfellowship program in the psychology of the rural populations could be \nof special benefit in addressing these problems.\n  Given the demonstrated success and effectiveness of specialized \ntraining programs, it is incumbent upon us to encourage participation \nin post-doctoral fellowships that respond to the needs of the nation's \nunderserved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 108\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to recognize \nthe United States Military Cancer Institute as an establishment within \nthe Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, to require \nthe Institute to promote the health of members of the Armed Forces and \ntheir dependents by enhancing cancer research and treatment, to provide \nfor a study of the epidemiological causes of cancer among various \nethnic groups for cancer prevention and early detection efforts, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, Today I introduce the United States \nMilitary Cancer Institute Research Collaborative Act. This legislation, \ntwice passed by the Senate yet unsuccessful in the House, would \nformally establish the United States Military Cancer Institute, USMCI, \nand support the collaborative augmentation of research efforts in \ncancer epidemiology, prevention and control. Although the USMCI already \nexists as an informal collaborative effort, this bill will formally \nestablish the institution with a mission of providing for the \nmaintenance of health in the military by enhancing cancer research and \ntreatment, and studying the epidemiological causes of cancer among \nvarious ethnic groups. By formally establishing the USMCI, it will be \nin a better position to unite military research efforts with other \ncancer research centers.\n  Cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment are significant \nissues for the military population, thus the USMCI was organized to \ncoordinate the existing military cancer assets. The USMCI has a \ncomprehensive database of its beneficiary population of 9 million \npeople. The military's nationwide tumor registry, the Automated Central \nTumor Registry, has acquired more than 180,000 cases in the last 14 \nyears, and a serum repository of 30 million specimens from military \npersonnel collected sequentially since 1987. This population is \npredominantly Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic.\n  The USMCI currently resides in the Washington, D.C., area, and its \ncomponents are located at the National Naval Medical Center, the \nMalcolm Grow Medical Center, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, \nand the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute. There are more \nthan 70 research workers, both active duty and Department of Defense \ncivilian scientists, working in the USMCI.\n  The Director of the USMCI, Dr. John Potter, intends to expand \nresearch activities to military medical centers across the nation. \nSpecial emphasis will be placed on the study of genetic and \nenvironmental factors in carcinogenesis among the entire population, \nincluding Asian, Caucasian, African-American and Hispanic \nsubpopulations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide 100 percent reimbursement for medical assistance provided to a \nNative Hawaiian through a federally-qualified health center or a Native \nHawaiian health care system; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Native Hawaiian \nMedicaid Coverage Act of 2004. This legislation would authorize a \nFederal Medicaid Assistance Percent, FMAP, of 100 percent for the \npayment of health care costs of Native Hawaiians who receive health \ncare from Federally Qualified Health Centers or the Native Hawaiian \nHealth Care System.\n  This bill was originally a provision within the Medicare Prescription \nDrug Bill, which the Senate passed by an overwhelming majority of 76 to \n21, but was dropped from the final Medicare Prescription Drug \nConference Report.\n  This bill is modeled on the Native Alaskan Health Care Act, which \nprovides for a Federal Medicaid Assistance Percent, FMAP, of 100 \npercent for payment of health care costs for Native Alaskans by the \nIndian Health Service, an Indian tribe, or a tribal organization.\n  Community health centers serve as the ``safety net'' for uninsured \nand medically underserved Native Hawaiians and other United States \ncitizens, providing comprehensive primary and preventive health \nservices to the entire community. Outpatient services offered to the \nentire family include comprehensive primary care, preventive health \nmaintenance, and education outreach in the local community. Community \nhealth centers, with their multi-disciplinary approach, offer cost \neffective integration of health promotion and wellness with chronic \ndisease management and primary care focused on serving vulnerable \npopulations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native Hawaiian Medicaid \n     Coverage Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. 100 PERCENT FMAP FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO A \n                   NATIVE HAWAIIAN THROUGH A FEDERALLY-QUALIFIED \n                   HEALTH CENTER OR A NATIVE HAWAIIAN HEALTH CARE \n                   SYSTEM UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Medicaid.--The third sentence of section 1905(b) of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(b)) is amended by \n     inserting ``, and with respect to medical assistance provided \n     to a Native Hawaiian (as defined in section 12 of the Native \n     Hawaiian Health\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\n     Care Improvement Act) through a federally-qualified health \n     center or a Native Hawaiian health care system (as so \n     defined) whether directly, by referral, or under contract or \n     other arrangement between a federally-qualified health center \n     or a Native Hawaiian health care system and another health \n     care provider'' before the period.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     applies to medical assistance provided on or after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 117. A bill to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to \nimprove benefits and services for members of the Armed Forces, veterans \nof the Global War on Terrorism, and other veterans, to require reports \non the effects of the Global War on Terrorism, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nis significant both in the problems it seeks to address and the man it \nseeks to honor.\n  Since the day he arrived in Congress more than two decades ago, Lane \nEvans was a tireless advocate for the men and women with whom he \nserved. When Vietnam vets started falling ill from Agent Orange, he led \nthe effort to get them compensation. Lane was one of the first in \nCongress to speak out about the health problems facing Persian Gulf War \nveterans. He worked to help veterans suffering from Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder, and he also helped make sure thousands of homeless \nveterans in our country have a place to sleep. Lane Evans fought these \nbattles for more than 20 years, and even in the face of his own \ndebilitating disease, he kept fighting. Today, veterans across America \nhave Lane Evans to thank for reminding this country of its duty to take \ncare of those who have risked their lives to defend ours.\n  I am very proud today to introduce the Lane Evans Veterans Healthcare \nand Benefits Improvement Act of 2007. This bill honors a legislator who \nleft behind an enduring legacy of service to our veterans. The \nlegislation also is an important step towards caring for our men and \nwomen who are currently fighting for us.\n  I am being joined today by Senator Olympia Snowe, the lead cosponsor \nof this bill. Senator Snowe has long been an advocate for veterans in \nher state, and I have been honored to work with her in the past on \nveterans issues. We have fought to reduce the backlog of disability \nclaims at the Veterans Benefits Administration and to improve the \nmilitary's ability to identify and treat Traumatic Brain Injury. Our \nintroduction of the Lane Evans Bill is a continuation of these efforts.\n  Today, more than 1.5 million American troops have been deployed \noverseas as part of the Global War on Terror. These brave men and women \nwho protected us are beginning to return home. Six hundred thousand \npeople who served in Iraq and Afghanistan are now veterans, and more \nthan 185,000 have already received treatment at the VA. That number is \nincreasing every day. Many of these fighting men and women are coming \nhome with major injuries. As a country, we are only beginning to \nunderstand the true costs of the Global War on Terror.\n  The Government Accountability Office reported that VA has faced $3 \nbillion in budget shortfalls since 2005 because it underestimated the \ncosts of caring for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. The VA wasn't \ngetting the information it needed from the Pentagon and was relying on \noutdated data and incorrect forecasting models. We cannot let these \nkind of bureaucratic blunders get in the way of the care and support we \nowe our servicemembers.\n  To avoid these costly shortfalls in the future, we have to do a \nbetter job keeping track of veterans. That's why the first thing the \nLane Evans Act does is to establish a system to track Global War on \nTerror veterans. The VA established a similar data system following the \nPersian Gulf War. That effort has been invaluable in budget planning as \nwell as in monitoring emerging health trends and diseases linked to the \nGulf War. The Gulf War Veterans Information System also has been \nimportant to medical research and improved care for veterans. The \nsooner we begin keeping accurate track of our fighting men and women in \nIraq, Afghanistan and beyond, the better and more efficiently we will \nbe able to care for them.\n  The Lane Evans Act also tackles Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. \nMental health patients account for about one-third of the new veterans \nseeking care at the VA. The VA's National Center for PTSD reports that \n``the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are the most sustained combat \noperations since the Vietnam War, and initial signs imply that these \nongoing wars are likely to produce a new generation of veterans with \nchronic mental health problems.''\n  This bill addresses PTSD in two ways. First, it extends the window \nduring which new veterans can automatically get care for mental health \nfrom two years to five years. Right now, any servicemember discharged \nfrom the military has up to two years to walk into a VA facility and \nget care, no questions asked. After that, vets have to prove that they \nare disabled because of a service-connected injury, or they have to \nprove their income is below threshold levels. Unfortunately, it can \ntake years for symptoms of PTSD to manifest. The time it takes to prove \nservice-connection for mental health illness is valuable time lost \nduring which veterans are not receiving critically needed treatment. \nThe Lane Evans Act allows veterans to walk into a VA facility any time \nfive years after discharge and get assessed for mental health care. \nThis both extends the window and shortens the wait for vets to get \ncare.\n  Second, the legislation makes face-to-face physical and mental health \nscreening mandatory 30 to 90 days after a soldier is deployed in a war \nzone. This will ensure that our fighting force is ready for battle, and \nthat we can identify and treat those at risk for PTSD. By making the \nexams mandatory, we can help eliminate the stigma associated with \nmental health screening and treatment.\n  Another problem veterans face is that the VA and DoD do not \neffectively share medical and military records. Older veterans often \nhave to wait years for their benefits as the Department of Defense \nrecovers aging and lost paper records. Under the Lane Evans Act, the \nDepartment of Defense would provide each separating service member at \nthe time of discharge with a secure full electronic copy of all \nmilitary and medical records to help them apply for healthcare and \nbenefits. DoD possesses the technology to do this now. The information \ncould be useful to VA to quickly and accurately document receipt of \nvaccinations or deployment to a war zone. The electronic data will also \nbe helpful in future generations when family members of veterans seek \ninformation about military service, awards, and wartime deployment that \ngo well beyond the existing single-sheet DD-214 discharge certificate, \nwhich is all veterans currently receive.\n  Finally, the legislation improves the transition assistance that \nNational Guardsmen and military reservists receive when they return \nfrom deployment. A 2005 GAO report found that because demobilization \nfor guardsmen and reservists is accelerated, reserve units get \nabbreviated and perfunctory transition assistance including limited \nemployment training. VA should provide equal briefings and transition \nservices for all service members regarding VA healthcare, disability \ncompensation, and other benefits, regardless of their duty status.\n  Lane Evans dedicated his life to serving this country and serving \nveterans. The legislation Senator Snowe and I are introducing today, \nhonors both the man and his mission, and will continue his legacy to \nthe next generation of American veterans.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of S. \n3988, the Lane Evans Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act \nof 2007. After serving with Lane Evans in the House of Representatives \nfor over a decade, I am honored to help introduce legislation that \nserves as a fitting tribute to a man whose unfaltering efforts on \nbehalf of our nation's veterans went unmatched.\n  I also applaud Senator Obama for introducing this vital legislation \nat a time when over 600,000 courageous men and women have returned from \ncombat in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In the past, Senator Obama and I \nhave worked in a bipartisan manner to bolster the military's ability to \ndetect and treat traumatic brain injury, and most recently, we have \nfought to reduce the backlog of claims at the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration, VBA. Once again,\n\n[[Page S117]]\n\nI thank Senator Obama for his continuing resoluteness and advocacy for \nour veterans.\n  Since the beginning of conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly 1.5 \nmillion brave Americans have deployed overseas to take part in the \nglobal war on terror. Of those 1.5 million Americans, at least 184,400 \nhave already received medical treatment from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA. It is time the VA and the Department of Defense, DOD, have \nthe capability to provide incoming veterans with timely and efficient \nmedical treatment and postdeployment services. For too long now, \nprovision of these critical services has been hampered by a lack of \nresources and policy restructuring.\n  In 2005, the Government Accountability Office revealed that the VA \nfaced a budget shortfall of $3 billion, due to the agency's inability \nto correctly gauge the benefits for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. As a \nresult of spending shortfalls, the VA was forced to dip into \ncontingency funds that could have compromised the funding for other \nvital veterans programs. In order to remedy these unacceptable \ndeficiencies within the veterans' benefit system, this legislation will \nsignificantly enhance the ability of the DOD and the VA to accurately \ntrack veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, by creating a data registry \nthat will hold a comprehensive list of VA health care and benefits use. \nI remind my colleagues that a similar data system was established in \n1998 for Gulf War I Veterans, and has been invaluable in assessing the \nnecessary budgetary planning for our injured veterans from that \nconflict.\n  However, not all combat wounds are caused by bullets and shrapnel. \nSeveral studies have indicated that due to the nature of warfare in \nIraq--with its intense urban fighting, terrorism and civilian combat--\nmay cause a spike in the prevalence of post traumatic stress disorder, \nPTSD. According to the Veterans' Health Administration, as of October \n2006, of the 184,524 Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom veterans who have sought care from the VA, 29,041 have been \ndiagnosed as having probable symptoms of PTSD.\n  I strongly believe that we have a commitment to ensure that veterans \nwith PTSD receive compassionate, world-class health care and \nappropriate disability compensation determinations. It is imperative \nthat we do all we can to detect, diagnose, and treat our veterans \nsuffering from PTSD as quickly as possible, in order to help our \nveterans and their families move beyond the psychological trauma of war \nand lead healthy, productive lives.\n  This legislation's proposed data registry will further assist the VA \nwith ongoing medical research into mental health, traumatic brain \ninjury, and many other conditions. This legislation will also require \nthe Department of Defense to conduct in-person physical and mental \nhealth exams with every service member 30 to 90 days after deployment \nto war zone, in order to ensure that potential cases of PTSD are \nidentified and treated in a timely manner. By making the exams \nmandatory, the stigma associated with mental health screening and \ntreatment can be eliminated. Additionally, multiple deployments to \ncombat zones may factor into a higher susceptibility to PTSD, stressing \nthe necessity for mental screening prior to redeployment, in order to \nensure that no servicemember experiencing symptoms of PTSD is returned \nto duty without treatment. If the VA and the DOD continues its current \nmental health screening policy, nondisclosures of PTSD symptoms will \ncontinue to deter early intervention and future VA mental health \nservices.\n  This legislation addresses the difficulties associated with PTSD \nsymptoms that develop over prolonged periods of time. Currently, the \nwindow for new veterans to obtain health care at the VA is 2 years. \nHowever, in many circumstances, it takes years for PTSD symptoms and \nother problems related to mental health to emerge. Therefore, this \nlegislation will extend the window for VA mental health care from 2 \nyears to 5 years, ensuring the necessary mental health treatment for \nall veterans who are struggling to recover from the traumas of war.\n  Further, this legislation will take large steps towards improving the \ntransfer of military and medical records in order for veterans to \nreceive the health care and benefits they deserve. This bill requires \nDOD to provide each separating service member a full electronic copy of \nall military and medical records at the time of discharge. By \nfacilitating the enhanced use of electronic records, veterans will be \nassured the proper access and management of their required care. \nCurrently, a lack of swift access to military records and medical \nrecords has hampered the VA's ability to treat veterans in need of care \nin a timely and effective manner.\n  According to a December 2006 GAO report, while verifying veterans \nclaims of PTSD, regional VA offices are unable to directly access and \nsearch an electronic library of medical and service records for all \nservice branches, and therefore, must rely on a DOD research \norganization, whose average response time to regional office requests \nis nearly 1 year. Clearly, such a processing delay is not only \ninexcusable, it is potentially harmful to the veteran and his or her \nfamily. Increased access to electronic records will allow the VA to \nquickly identify the occurrence of stressful events or experiences that \nmay lead to the necessary treatment for PTSD.\n  Finally, this legislation will also require the VA to provide equal \nbriefings and transition services for all service members regarding VA \nhealth care, disability compensation, and other benefits, regardless of \nstatus. Often times, guardsmen and reservists receive limited \ntransition assistance and employment training, largely due to their \naccelerated demobilization. Thus, this legislation will provide \nequitable and fair transition services for all returning veterans, \nregardless of their service branch, component or military status.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those brave Americans who \nserved in uniform with honor, courage, and distinction. The obligation \nour nation holds for its veterans is enormous, and it is an obligation \nthat must be fulfilled every day. Since the attacks of September 11, \nmillions of brave American men and women have answered our nation's \ncall to service. Congress must now do everything in its power to answer \nour veterans' call, to ensure that they receive the medical care and \ntreatment that they rightly earned and rightly deserve.\n  Once again, I am pleased to join Senator Obama in introducing S. 988, \nbecause I believe it is crucial to the welfare of our Nation's \nveterans, and I urge my colleagues to voice their support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 118. A bill to give investigators and prosecutors the tools they \nneed to combat public corruption; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Pryor to \nintroduce the ``Effective Corruption Prosecutions Act of 2007,'' a bill \nto strengthen the tools available to Federal prosecutors in combating \npublic corruption. This bill gives investigators and prosecutors the \nstatutory tools and the resources they need to ensure that serious and \ninsidious public corruption is detected and punished.\n  In November, voters sent a strong message that they were tired of the \nculture of corruption. From war profiteers and corrupt officials in \nIraq to convicted Administration officials to influence-peddling \nlobbyists and, regrettably, even Members of Congress, too many supposed \npublic servants were serving their own interests, rather than the \npublic interest. The American people staged an intervention and made it \nclear that they would not stand for it any longer. They expect the \nCongress to take action. We need to restore the people's trust by \nacting to clean up the people's government.\n  The Senate's new leadership is introducing important lobbying reform \nand ethics legislation. Similar legislation passed the Senate last \nyear, but stalled in the House. This is a vital first step.\n  But the most serious corruption cannot be prevented only by changing \nour own rules. Bribery and extortion are committed by people bent on \ngetting around the rules and banking that they won't get caught. These \noffenses are very difficult to detect and even harder to prove. Because \nthey attack the core of our democracy, these offenses must\n\n[[Page S118]]\n\nbe found out and punished. Congress must send a signal that it will not \ntolerate this corruption by providing better tools for federal \nprosecutors to combat it. This bill will do exactly that.\n  First, the bill extends the statute of limitations for the most \nserious public corruption offenses. Specifically, it extends the \nstatute of limitations from five years to eight years for bribery, \ndeprivation of honest services, and extortion by a public official. \nThis is an important step because public corruption cases are among the \nmost difficult and time-consuming cases to investigate and prosecute. \nThey often require use of informants and electronic monitoring, as well \nas review of extensive financial and electronic records, techniques \nwhich take time to develop and implement.\n  Bank fraud, arson, and passport fraud, among other offenses, all have \n10-year statutes of limitations. Since public corruption offenses are \nso important to our democracy and these cases are so difficult to \ninvestigate and prove, a more modest extended statute of limitations \nfor these offenses is a reasonable step to help our corruption \ninvestigators and prosecutors do their jobs. Corrupt officials should \nnot be able to get away with their ill gotten gains just by waiting out \nthe investigators.\n  This bill also facilitates the investigation and prosecution of an \nimportant offense known as Federal program bribery, Title 18, United \nStates Code, section 666. Federal program bribery is the key Federal \nstatute for prosecuting bribery involving state and local officials, as \nwell as officials of the many organizations that receive substantial \nFederal money. This bill would allow agents and prosecutors \ninvestigating this important offense to request authority to conduct \nwiretaps and to use Federal program bribery as a basis for a \nracketeering charge.\n  Wiretaps, when appropriately requested and authorized, are an \nimportant method for agents and prosecutors to gain evidence of corrupt \nactivities, which can otherwise be next to impossible to prove without \nan informant. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) \nstatute is also an important tool which helps prosecutors target \norganized crime and corruption.\n  Agents and prosecutors may currently request authority to conduct \nwiretaps to investigate many serious offenses, including bribery of \nfederal officials and even sports bribery, and may predicate RICO \ncharges on these offenses, as well. It is only reasonable that these \nimportant tools also be available for investigating the similar and \nequally important offense of federal program bribery.\n  Lastly, my bill authorizes $25 million in additional Federal funds \nover each of the next four years to give federal investigators and \nprosecutors needed resources to go after public corruption. Last month, \nFBI Director Mueller in written testimony to the Judiciary Committee \ncalled public corruption the FBI's top criminal investigative priority. \nHowever, a September 2005 Report by Department of Justice Inspector \nGeneral Fine found that, from 2000 to 2004, there was an overall \nreduction in public corruption matters handled by the FBI. The report \nalso found declines in resources dedicated to investigating public \ncorruption, in corruption cases initiated, and in cases forwarded to US \nAttorney's Offices.\n  I am heartened by Director Mueller's assertion that there has \nrecently been an increase in the number of agents investigating public \ncorruption cases and the number of cases investigated, but I remain \nconcerned by the Inspector General's findings. I am concerned because \nthe FBI in recent years has diverted resources away from criminal law \npriorities, including corruption, into counterterrorism. The FBI may \nneed to divert further resources to cover the growing costs of \nSentinel, their data management system. The Department of Justice has \nsimilarly diverted resources, particularly from United States \nAttorney's Offices.\n  Additional funding is important to compensate for this diversion of \nresources and to ensure that corruption offenses are aggressively \npursued. My bill will give the FBI, the United States Attorney's \nOffices, and the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice \nnew resources to hire additional public corruption investigators and \nprosecutors. They can finally have the manpower they need to track down \nand make these difficult cases, and to root out the corruption.\n  If we are serious about addressing the egregious misconduct that we \nhave recently witnessed, Congress must enact meaningful legislation to \ngive investigators and prosecutors the resources they need to enforce \nour public corruption laws.

A bill to prohibit profiteering and fraud relating to \nmilitary action, relief, and reconstruction efforts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill that \ncreates criminal penalties for war profiteers and cheats who would \nexploit taxpayer-funded efforts in Iraq and elsewhere around the world. \nLast year, despite the mounting evidence of widespread contractor fraud \nand abuse in Iraq, the Republican-controlled Senate would not act on \nit. Instead, the Congress took a terrible misstep in seeking to end the \nwork of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. I have \nbeen proposing versions of this bill\n\n[[Page S119]]\n\nsince 2003, when it did pass the Senate. Unfortunately, this crucial \nprovision was stripped out of the final version of a bill by a \nRepublican-controlled conference committee.\n  There is growing evidence of widespread contractor fraud in Iraq, yet \nprosecuting criminal cases against these war profiteers is difficult \nunder current law. We must crack down on this rampant fraud and abuse \nthat squanders American taxpayers' dollars and jeopardizes the safety \nof our troops abroad. That is why I renew my efforts for accountability \nand action with the introduction of the War Profiteering Prevention Act \nof 2007. I am pleased to join with Senators Bingaman, Kerry, Harkin, \nRockefeller, Dorgan, Wyden, Schumer, Cantwell, Bill Nelson, Clinton, \nLautenberg and Menendez to introduce this legislation.\n  Congress has sent billions upon billions of dollars to Iraq with too \nlittle accountability and too few financial controls. More than $50 \nbillion of this money has gone to private contractors hired to guard \nbases, drive trucks, feed and shelter the troops and rebuild the \ncountry. This is more than the annual budget of the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Instead of results from these companies, we are seeing penalties \nlevied for allegations of fraud and abuse. At least 10 companies with \nbillions of dollars in U.S. contracts for Iraq reconstruction have paid \nmore than $300 million in penalties since 2000, to resolve allegations \nof bid rigging, fraud, delivery of faulty military parts and \nenvironmental damage. Seven other companies with Iraq reconstruction \ncontracts have agreed to pay financial penalties without admitting \nwrongdoing.\n  In 2005, Halliburton took in approximately $3.6 billion from \ncontracts to serve U.S. troops and rebuild the oil industry in Iraq. \nHalliburton executives say that the company received about $1 billion a \nmonth for Iraq work in 2006. In addition, last month, we learned of new \nplans to spend hundreds of millions more to create jobs in Iraq.\n  Last year, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction \nfound that millions of U.S. taxpayer funds appropriated for Iraq \nreconstruction have been lost and diverted. Yet we continue to send \nmore taxpayer funds to Iraq, without accountability.\n  Too much of this money is unaccounted for, and many of the facilities \nand services that these funds were supposed to pay for are still \nnonexistent. We in Congress must ask--where did all the money go? We \nneed to press for more accountability over the use and abuse of \nbillions of taxpayers' dollars sent as development aid to Iraq, not \nless.\n  A new law to combat war profiteering in Iraq and elsewhere is sorely \nneeded and long overdue. Although there are anti-fraud laws to protect \nagainst the waste of U.S. tax dollars at home, no law expressly \nprohibits war profiteering or expressly confers jurisdiction on U.S. \nfederal courts to hear fraud cases involving war profiteering committed \noverseas.\n  The bill I introduced today would criminalize ``war profiteering''--\novercharging taxpayers in order to defraud and to profit excessively \nfrom a war, military action, or reconstruction efforts. It would also \nprohibit any fraud against the United States involving a contract for \nthe provision of goods or services in connection with a war, military \naction, or for relief or reconstruction activities. This new crime \nwould be a felony, subject to criminal penalties of up to 20 years in \nprison and fines of up to $1 million, or twice the illegal gross \nprofits of the crime.\n  The bill also prohibits false statements connected with the provision \nof goods or services in connection with a war or reconstruction effort. \nThis crime would also be a felony, subject to criminal penalties of up \nto 10 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million, or twice the \nillegal gross profits of the crime.\n  The measure also addresses weakness in the existing laws used to \ncombat war profiteering, by providing clear authority for the \nGovernment to seek criminal penalties and to recover excessive profits \nfor war profiteering overseas. These are strong and focused sanctions \nthat are narrowly tailored to punish and deter fraud or excessive \nprofiteering in contracts, both at home and abroad.\n  The message sent by this bill is clear--any act to exploit the crisis \nsituation in Iraq or elsewhere overseas for exorbitant gain is \nunacceptable, reprehensible, and criminal. Such deceit demeans and \nexploits the sacrifices that our military personnel are making in Iraq \nand Afghanistan, and around the world. This bill also builds on a \nstrong legacy of historical efforts to stem war profiteering. Congress \nimplemented excessive-profits taxes and contract renegotiation laws \nafter both World Wars, and again after the Korean War. Advocating \nexactly such an approach, President Roosevelt once declared it our duty \nto ensure that ``a few do not gain from the sacrifices of the many.''\n  Our Government cannot in good faith ask its people to sacrifice for \nreconstruction efforts that allow some to profit unfairly. When U.S. \ntaxpayers have been called upon to bear the burden of reconstruction \ncontracts--where contracts are awarded in a system that offers little \ncompetition and even less accountability--concerns about wartime \nprofiteering are a grave matter.\n  Combating war profiteering is not a Democratic issue, or a Republican \nissue. Rather, it is a cause that all Americans can support. When I \nfirst introduced this bill in 2003, it came to be cosponsored by 21 \nSenators. The Senate Appropriations Committee also unanimously accepted \nthese provisions during a Senate Appropriations Committee markup of the \n$87 billion appropriations bill for Iraq and Afghanistan for Fiscal \nYear 2004, and this provision passed the Senate. Passing bipartisan war \nprofiteering prevention legislation was the right thing to do then, and \nit is the right thing to do now.\n  I am hopeful that in a new year, and with a new Congress, we can make \na fresh start and forge a bipartisan partnership on this important \nissue that will result in passage of this bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 119\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to extend benefits to \nservice sector workers and firms, enhance certain trade adjustment \nassistance authorities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Improvement Act of 2007 with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Norm Coleman.\n  In 2006, the United States passed, signed or concluded no fewer than \nfive new free trade agreements. This June, the President's authority to \nnegotiate trade agreements will expire. Congress should extend the \nPresident's authority to negotiate these deals. But when we do, we must \nraise the bar higher than before. Each deal must surpass the last, in \norder to take advantage of and adjust to changes in the global \nmarketplace that affect American businesses and workers.\n  Congress will consider these agreements on their merits. In most \ncases, these deals will mean more access for American producers and \nservice providers. In some few cases, these agreements could mean more \nand fiercer competition for producers and providers here at home.\n  Competition is the engine that drives market economies like ours. It \nspawns innovation and creates new jobs. But just as jobs are created in \nnew sectors of our economy, jobs are also lost in other sectors which \nexperience sudden or unfair competition from abroad.\n  Whether and how effectively we help those firms and workers who feel \nthe negative effects of our national trade policy will, in large part, \ndetermine whether and how effectively we can move a trade agenda \nforward this year.\n  During the last several Congresses, we have experienced unprecedented \nchange in the global marketplace and in our labor market at home. I \nhave worked to raise the bar on our efforts to help workers affected by \nthese changes. Today, I propose again, more urgently than ever, that \nCongress and the administration work together to adapt our national \nworker adjustment strategies to the challenges of globalization. The \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Improvement Act is a first and necessary \nstep in that direction.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Improvement Act includes many \nproposals that Congress should consider before the program expires this \nSeptember. The Act extends coverage to more of the workers who are \naffected by trade and globalization. And the Act will improve the \noverall efficiency and effectiveness of the program.\n  For more than a century, the manufacturing sector drove the American \neconomy. So, when President Kennedy decided to open the American \neconomy to more trade, he established the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprogram to help workers in the manufacturing sector adjust to change.\n  Today, our economy depends upon service exports. More than 75 percent \nof the American labor force work in services. While many service sector \njobs cannot be outsourced, technology change makes it possible to \nprovide many services remotely, in such fields as accounting, \nhealthcare, and computers and information technology. So when a large \ncall center left Kalispell, Montana, three years ago for Canada, the \nMontana workers left behind did not have access to the same benefits \nthat workers laid off from the Columbia Falls Aluminum manufacturing \nplant did. They should have.\n  Last year, the Department of Labor agreed, for the first time ever, \nthat workers who produce software, an intangible product, should be \neligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance. That was a step in the right \ndirection. We should take the next step this year. We should finally \nextend coverage to American service workers. That is what my bill \nproposes.\n  Trade Adjustment Assistance certification takes place on a case-by-\ncase, plant-by-plant basis. This means that while two factories \nproducing the same products may both experience foreign competition \nthat leads to layoffs, often only one of those factories' laid off \nworkers gets certified as eligible for the program.\n  Consider the softwood lumber industry. At least 12 out of 35 Trade \nAdjustment Assistance petitions filed by workers in Montana's softwood \nlumber industry over the last 7 years were denied by the Department of \nLabor. Yet, all of these mills were similarly affected by the same \nmarket conditions--dumped and subsidized Canadian imports. The \nInternational Trade Commission found that Canadian imports injured or \nthreatened to injury the softwood lumber industry on a national scale.\n  But the Department of Labor's certification process does not take \ninto account the bigger--and often more meaningful--picture. It simply \nrelies on data provided by individual companies that lay off the \nworkers to make its case-by-case determination.\n  The legislation that I introduce today makes industry-wide \ncertification automatic for workers anywhere in the United States if \nthe President, the International Trade Commission, or another qualified \nFederal agency determines that imports are harming that industry. My \nbill also authorizes, but does not require, the Secretary of Labor to \nmake industry-wide determinations if she receives three or more \npetitions in one industry within one 6-month period, or if the Senate \nFinance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee pass a \nresolution requesting such an investigation.\n  We can anticipate and in some cases even prevent displacements by \nrenewing and expanding our commitment to small and medium-sized \nAmerican companies looking to recapture their competitive edge. One \nkey, yet small program that can help prevent displacements and shifts \nin production to overseas is the TAA for Firms program in the \nDepartment of Commerce. The Firms program reaches out to companies that \nhave experienced decreasing sales or production due to import \ncompetition and have laid off or expect to lay off workers.\n  This program is chronically under-funded, and it should also be \navailable to service sector firms. This bill would authorize $50 \nmillion for this program to reach more small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses across the nation before they are forced to lay off their \nAmerican workers and close their doors.\n  This bill also moves the Firms program from the Economic Development \nAdministration at Commerce back into the International Trade \nAdministration. That's where it was previously. And frankly that's \nwhere it ought to have remained. Despite the Firms program's proven \ntrack record, proposals related to the program under the Economic \nDevelopment Administration have sought to either defund the program \naltogether, or to limit eligibility by increasing the profit-loss \nmargin required for participation and arbitrary termination of firms \nafter 2 years. The Firms program is a trade program and should be \nadministered by an agency whose primary mission is to help American \ncompanies to adjust to and benefit from trade.\n  In 2002, with the passage of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform \nAct, I had great expectations for our first wage insurance \ndemonstration project. In theory, wage insurance--or Alternative Trade \nAdjustment Assistance--encourages swift re-entry into the workforce by \nreplacing a portion of a worker's lost wages when a worker accepts a \nlower paying job within 6 months of a layoff. Workers who choose wage \ninsurance over traditional Trade Adjustment Assistance training and \nincome assistance often have less access to good training or simply \ncannot afford to be out of work during their training. Wage insurance \nprovides an incentive for employers to hire lower-skilled and older \nworkers and train them on the job.\n  In practice, I have been disappointed with the Department of Labor's \nimplementation of the wage insurance proposal that we crafted in 2002. \nIn a 2004 review by the Government Accountability Office, the \nDepartment of Labor's implementation of the benefit came up far short \nof the mark. Last\n\n[[Page S121]]\n\nyear, the Government Accountability Office once again found that the \nDepartment needed to improve its implementation, focusing specifically \non its outreach to and direction of state employment service offices.\n  I hope to work with the Department of Labor on strategies that will \nimprove its outreach. Wage insurance can help put people back to work, \nand can even save money over traditional Trade Adjustment Assistance. \nBut it cannot do either of those things if no one knows about the \nbenefit.\n\n  This bill streamlines the process to qualify for wage insurance, and \nlowers the eligible age from 50 to 40. Wage replacement should be \navailable to younger workers who would re-enter the workforce more \nquickly if they could afford the often steep wage cut.\n  Another key component of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act \nwas the health care tax credit to help displaced workers and some \nretirees maintain access to health insurance coverage. As health costs \ngrow, losing health insurance can be as financially devastating to \nworkers as losing a job. While I still believe that the TAA health care \ntax credit holds promise, this is clearly an area where reforms are \nneeded to help the credit achieve its purpose.\n  Today, the TAA health care tax credit helps only a fraction of the \nhundreds of thousands eligible for assistance. In its first 2 years, \nless than 6 percent of eligible workers and retirees enrolled. A GAO \nreport released last year studying five major plant closings in 2003 \nand 2004 found that only 3 to 12 percent of eligible workers enrolled. \nMore than half of the workers studied didn't sign up for the tax credit \nbecause the 65 percent subsidy was too low to make health coverage \naffordable.\n  The tax credit also suffers from complexity and administrative red \ntape. More than half of eligible workers in GAO's recent study didn't \neven know about the benefit. About a third of workers who knew about \nthe benefit decided not to enroll because it was too confusing. Even \nthose who understand it have to navigate complex rules and requirements \nto get the benefit.\n  We need to make this program simpler, more affordable, and more \nseamless so that more workers can take it up in the years ahead. We \nneed to improve the information that workers and retirees get about the \nprogram and create systems to ensure that they get it. We need to cut \ndown on the red tape. And we need to look at options to make this \nbenefit more affordable so that we can truly reach the hundreds of \nthousands eligible for this benefit that Congress intended to help when \nwe enacted these reforms 4 years ago. I plan to introduce a bill later \nin the year that will achieve these goals for reforming the health care \ntax credit and will look forward to working with Senator Coleman and \nother colleagues in this effort.\n  The forces of globalization, like trade and technology change, have \ncreated tremendous opportunities for American businesses and workers, \nfrom cutting the cost of living to increasing the margin of profit. \nTrade accounts for a quarter of our gross domestic product. The \nadjustments we have made to maximize trade's benefits save the average \nAmerican household $9,000 annually.\n  But we must also make adjustments to respond to the challenges that \ncome with globalization. American businesses in the 21st century face \nrapidly-changing consumer preferences and ever-swifter technological \nadvances. Global competition is fierce. Innovation is the key to these \ncompanies' continued prosperity.\n  The same holds true for American workers. They know that they must \nadjust to changes in the labor market if they are to maintain their \nplace in it. Workers must be prepared for one or more career shifts \nbefore retirement. They must acquire more skills, and refresh their \nskills more often.\n  We can help American companies adapt, and regain their competitive \nedge in the global marketplace. We can help more trade-displaced \nworkers get back into the workforce. We should help these workers adapt \nnot only to trade displacement, but to all the other aspects of \nglobalization as well.\n  American workers and the companies that employ them must each \ncontinually adjust to a changing world marketplace. So too should our \nworker adjustment strategies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 122\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the project for hurricane and storm \ndamage reduction, Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita revealed the \nGulf Coast's vulnerability to storms and flooding. With the help of \ngenerous Americans, the people of the gulf coast have been working hard \nover the last year and a half to rebuild their economy, their \ncommunities, and their lives.\n  Since these devastating storms struck in 2005, Congress directed the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers to better protect America's gulf coast. \nYet Congress's failure to pass a Water Resources Development Act WRDA, \nhas delayed much of the needed protection. Of all of the many worthy \nprojects throughout the Nation awaiting WRDA passage, there is one \nhurricane protection project that stands out and cries for immediate \ncongressional authorization with or without a WRDA bill. Accordingly, I \nam introducing legislation to singularly authorize this long overdue \nproject known as ``Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Hurricane \nProtection.''\n  This project includes a series of levees, locks and other systems \nthrough Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes in Louisiana. When complete, \nthe Morganza to the Gulf project will protect about 120,000 people and \n1,700 square miles of land against storm surges such as those caused by \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  The Morganza to the Gulf project is distinguishable from all other \nprojects awaiting WRDA passage because it was originally authorized in \nthe last enacted WRDA bill in 2000, with the requirement that the Army \nCorps of Engineers deliver a favorable feasibility report by December \n31 of that year. The Corps eventually submitted its report more than a \nyear late, causing the authorization to expire despite the Corps' \nfavorable recommendation.\n  Though repeated attempts have been made, Congress has been unable to \ndeliver a new WRDA bill since 2000. As a result, vital hurricane \nprotection for a portion of southeast Louisiana that the Corps \nrecommends after years of environmental and economic analysis is \nawaiting congressional action, and an area of America's gulf coast \nremains needlessly vulnerable. Notably, every failed WRDA bill that the \nSenate, the House, and its committees have separately passed since 2000 \nhas authorized the Morganza to the Gulf Hurricane Protection project. \nSimply stated, there is no other item in WRDA that has been kicked down \nthe road as many times as this.\n  This bill that I introduce today fully authorizes the Morganza to the \nGulf project in accordance with the plans and subject to the conditions \nof the Corps' report.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of my statement and the bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 123\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MORGANZA TO THE GULF OF MEXICO PROJECT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Army shall carry out \n     the project for hurricane and storm damage reduction, \n     Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico, Louisiana, substantially in \n     accordance with the plans, and subject to the conditions, \n     described in the Reports of the Chief of Engineers dated \n     August 23, 2002, and July 22, 2003, at a total cost of \n     $886,700,000, with an estimated Federal cost of $576,355,000 \n     and an estimated non-Federal cost of $310,345,000.\n       (b) Credit.--The Secretary shall credit toward the non-\n     Federal share of the cost of the project elements the cost of \n     design and construction work carried out by the non-Federal \n     interest before the date of the partnership agreement for the \n     project elements if the Secretary determines that the work is \n     integral to the project elements.\n       (c) Operations and Maintenance.--The operation, \n     maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of the \n     Houma Navigation Canal lock complex and the Gulf Intracoastal \n     Waterway floodgate features of the project described in \n     subsection (a) that provide for inland waterway \n     transportation shall be a Federal responsibility, in \n     accordance with section 102 of the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2212).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 124. A bill to provide certain counties with the ability to \nreceive television broadcast signals of their choice; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, another piece of legislation that I am \nintroducing today addresses an issue important to citizens of southern \nColorado.\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\nThe problem is this: cable and satellite subscribers in two southern \nColorado counties are forced by current law to receive New Mexico \ntelevision stations. Lately, I hear almost every day from my \nconstituents that they would prefer to receive Colorado television over \nNew Mexico television.\n  The problem stems from the fact that these two Colorado counties are \nlocated in the Albuquerque designated market area, as determined by \nNielsen Media Research. As a matter of fairness, citizens of Colorado \nshould be eligible to receive Colorado TV. Consumers should choose \nwhich television stations they receive, especially since they are the \nones paying for it.\n  The bill I am introducing does just that. It makes a commonsense \nchange to the law that allows citizens of La Plata and Montezuma \nCounties to receive television stations from Denver, not Albuquerque.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill that \nis nearly identical to laws enacted in previous Congresses that \naddressed similar problems in other States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 125. A bill to establish the Granada Relocation Center National \nHistoric Site as an affiliated unit of the National Park System; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill dealing with the \nGranada Relocation Camp, also known as Camp Amache. It played an \nimportant, but sad, part in United States history. Camp Amache, one of \n10 internment camps in the Nation, was established in August 1942 by \nthe U.S. Government during World War II as a place to house the \nJapanese from the west coast and was closed on August 15, 1945. This is \na significant part of American history and it should be preserved. My \nbill today will designate the Granada Relocation Camp as a national \nhistoric site in Colorado.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 126. A bill to modify the boundary of Mesa Verde National Park, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, another piece of legislation I am \nintroducing today will authorize the expansion of the boundary of Mesa \nVerde National Park. The boundary adjustment will allow for the \nincorporation of 324 acres of land owned by the Henneman family, which \nis being purchased by the Conservation Fund for conveyance to the park, \nas well as a 38-acre parcel that will be donated to the park by the \nMesa Verde Foundation.\n  Mesa Verde National Park protects some of the best preserved and most \nnotable archeological sites in the world. There are over 4,000 known \narcheological sites in the park, including 600 cliff dwellings. These \nsites were constructed by ancestral Puebloans, who occupied this area \nfor over 700 years, from 600 A.D. to 1300 A.D.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 127. A bill to amend the Great Sand Dunes National Park and \nPreserve Act of 2000 to explain the purpose and provide for the \nadministration of the Baca National Wildlife Refuge; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Baca National Wildlife Refuge Purpose \nbill will give the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service management tools that \nwill allow the agency to run the Baca National Wildlife Refuge in a way \nthat achieves the most beneficial use of this wonderful natural \nresource. The Baca National Wildlife Refuge consists of 92,500 acres of \nwetlands, sage brush, and riparian lands adjacent to the Great Sand \nDunes National Park in southern Colorado. I, along with my former \ncolleague from Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, U.S. \nRepresentative Scott McInnis, sponsored the legislation that converted \nthe Sand Dunes from a monument to a park. This legislation also \nauthorized the Federal acquisition of the Baca Ranch lands and I remain \nactively interested in the area's management.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 128. A bill to amend the Cache La Poudre River Corridor Act to \ndesignate a new management entity, make certain technical and \nconforming amendments, enhance private property protections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation which will \nextend congressional authorization for the Cache la Poudre Heritage \nArea in northern Colorado and will give local citizens greater \nmanagement authority over the area. Under the original legislation, \nauthored by former Colorado. Senator Hank Brown, the Secretary of \nInterior was to appoint a commission to work with the National Park \nService and manage the area, but because of a technicality, the \nSecretary was unable to appoint the commission. In response, local \ncitizens stepped up and formed the Poudre Heritage Alliance to support \nthe Heritage Area until an official commission could be named. This \nlegislation would rectify this, and empower local residents to continue \nthe work they have been doing on behalf of the heritage area.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 129. A bill to study and promote the use of energy-efficient \ncomputer servers in the United States; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill that will \nauthorize the EPA to conduct a study of the growth in energy \nconsumption by computer data centers operated by the Federal Government \nand by private corporations. The study will also examine industry \nmovement toward energy efficient microchips and computer servers, \npotential cost savings associated with the movement to more efficient \nmachines and what, if any, impacts to performance come with increased \nefficiency. The results of the study will allow us to more fully \nunderstand the impact that the growing number of computers in use \nthroughout the country has on energy consumption. This information will \nbetter position Congress to make recommendations to Federal agencies on \ntheir energy use and computer selection.\n  It will also provide private industry with information that will \nallow them to choose computer models that will decrease their energy \nconsumption, making their companies more efficient and profitable.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 130. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nextend reasonable cost contracts under Medicare; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, currently American seniors enjoy Medicare \nhealth plans called cost contracts. Under legislation I am introducing \ntoday, seniors will be able to continue utilizing these valued health \nplans.\n  Medicare cost contract plans are vital to America. Cost contracts \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries in many rural areas and small cities \nthroughout our country with an affordable, high-quality option to the \ntraditional Medicare fee-for-service plan. For many of these \nbeneficiaries, Medicare Advantage plans do not provide access to \nphysicians in the community.\n  Medicare cost contracts are managed care plans that are reimbursed on \na cost basis for providing health services. Under current law, cost \ncontracts are one option for Medicare beneficiaries. Cost contract \npremiums cover Medicare deductibles and additional benefits not covered \nby basic Medicare. Further, for the costs of a normal Medicare fee-for-\nservice copayment, seniors with cost contracts can use any Medicare \nprovider regardless of whether they participate in the health plans \nnetwork. This is critical in rural areas where physicians are scarce.\n\n  Cost contracts are vital to seniors who have them. From New York to \nOregon, and even to Hawaii, America's seniors are enrolled in cost \ncontract plans. Cost contracts are especially important in rural \nColorado. Of the Coloradans with cost contract plans, 89 percent live \nin rural Colorado, where few physicians will see patients under \nstraight Medicare or Medicare Advantage.\n  Many beneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare cost contract plans \nlive on limited incomes. Under the traditional Medicare program, \nbeneficiaries incur considerable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, \nMedicare supplemental insurers frequently age-adjust premiums\n\n[[Page S127]]\n\nand either refuse coverage or impose coverage restrictions for pre-\nexisting conditions. Medicare cost contract plans provide an affordable \nalternative.\n  Unfortunately, under current law cost contracts soon will terminate.\n  I believe Congress should work to extend Medicare cost contracts \nfurther. My bill, the Medicare Cost Contract Extension and Refinement \nAct of 2007, would accomplish this by extending by five years the cost \ncontract sunset date of December 31, 2007, to December 31, 2012.\n  Cost contracts have been a bipartisan issue, with bipartisan support \nin the past. Senator Wyden of Oregon worked to get an extension for \ncost contracts in the 109th Congress, and I look forward to working \nwith him again during the 110th.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 131. A bill to extend for 5 years the Mark-to-Market program of \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I turn now to the issue of housing. \nCongress created the Mark-to-Market Program in 1997 to reduce Section 8 \ncosts while preserving the affordability and availability of low-income \nrental housing. The purpose of the program is to reduce the property \nrents to market level while simultaneously restructuring property debt \nto prevent FHA defaults.\n  Studies seem to show that the program has been an overwhelming \nsuccess. Nearly 250,000 units of affordable housing have been preserved \ndue to the Mark-to-Market Program. This is affordable housing that \nwould have been permanently lost as affordable otherwise. According to \nHUD, the program has also saved taxpayers more than $2 billion.\n  The original legislation authorized the Mark-to-Market Program for 4 \nyears, which was subsequently extended for 5 additional years. \nTherefore, the Mark-to-Market program authority was scheduled to expire \non September 30, 2006. Fortunately, the program authority was \ntemporarily extended under the continuing resolutions.\n  When the program was extended in 2001, it appeared that 5 additional \nyears would be sufficient time for nearly all eligible properties to \ncomplete the Mark-to-Market process. However, more recent projections \nshow that nearly 78,000 properties will face rent reductions over the \nnext 5 years.\n  It is important to note that even though the program will expire, \nthese Section 8 properties with above market rates will still be \nrequired to have their rents reduced to market levels. Without the \nproper tools to also restructure the debt, many owners will lack \nsufficient funds for property maintenance or mortgage payments. Because \nmany Section 8 properties are also FHA insured, this will result in a \nsignificant number of claims against FHA, in addition to many tenant \ndisplacements.\n  Clearly, no one finds this a desirable scenario. Failure to extend \nthe Mark-to-Market Program would be bad for tenants and bad for \ntaxpayers. Thus, I am pleased to join with Senator Reed of Rhode Island \nin reintroducing the Mark-to-Market Extension Act of 2007. Our bill \nwould extend the program for 5 additional years to allow the remaining \nproperties to go through the Mark-to-Market process. Frankly, I can see \nno downside to extending the program; It maintains affordable housing \nfor less money.\n  I am pleased to work with industry groups and with my colleagues to \nsee that this very worthwhile program is extended for an additional 5 \nyears.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 132. A bill to end the trafficking of methamphetamines and \nprecursor chemicals across the United States and its borders; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the first bill I present today is to \naddress one of the biggest current scourges of our citizens--\nmethamphetamine abuse.\n  Just this week, a report published by Colorado's Meth Task Force \ncited Denver as a major distribution center for meth in the U.S.\n  Our Nation has been hard hit by the illegal trafficking of meth \nacross U.S. borders. This is a national issue that is growing at a rate \nthat constantly presents a challenge to our talented law enforcement \nofficials. Through our work on the Combat Meth Act, we have provided \nthem with many tools to fight the domestic production of meth. We are \nnow called upon to respond to the issue of foreign produced meth as it \npresents a growing threat to the U.S.\n  In just 10 years, meth has become America's worst drug problem--worse \nthan marijuana, cocaine or heroin. My home state of Colorado, like the \nrest of the Nation, faces challenges associated with the growing \nepidemic. Although the number of meth labs in the state is on the \ndecline, meth distribution remains rampant because of Denver's location \nat the intersection of two major interstate highways, both of which \nserve as pipelines for the distribution of meth after it enters our \ncountry.\n  This evidence is echoed by the many local drug task forces, law \nenforcement officials, and District Attorneys who are tasked with \ntackling meth within our communities and who I have worked with on this \nissue.\n  According to estimates from the DEA, an alarming 80 percent of the \nmeth used in the United States comes from larger labs, increasingly \nabroad, while only 20 percent of the meth consumed in this country \ncomes from small laboratories.\n  Therefore, I propose that we improve efforts to curb the flow of meth \nboth within and across our borders. We must take steps to expand \nenforcement to reduce the amount of meth being trafficked into the \nUnited States by establishing stricter penalties for meth offenders, \nimproving coordination with foreign law enforcement officials, and \nexamining the serious meth problems faced by Indian reservations.\n  The Methamphetamine Trafficking Enforcement Act of 2007 that I am \nintroducing today is a first step to fighting the trafficking of this \ndrug. My bill addresses the distribution issue by dramatically lowering \nthe quantity and dollar amount thresholds for federal criminal \nprosecution of leaders of methamphetamine distribution rings.\n  The trafficking of meth across our borders makes Federal action \nnecessary, but this is not our war to fight alone. This bill also \npresses upon the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of \nState, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security to \ninclude new ways to curb the illicit use and shipment of \npseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and similar chemicals in multilateral and \nbilateral negotiations. Federal law enforcement officials will \ncollaborate with their foreign counterparts to fight meth \ninternationally. Working together, we can find a long term solution.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the use, production and \ndistribution of meth on Indian lands has increased in the past decade. \nWith limited numbers of tribal law enforcement officials, meth can \neasily flow into and be trafficked out of many Indian reservations. \nThis bill urges the Attorney General to research and report to Congress \nthe challenges faced by all Indian reservations and make \nrecommendations to help them address meth trafficking and abuse.\n  We must recognize the immediacy of the issue of methamphetamine \ntrafficking. It is important that we protect the U.S. and its borders \nto ensure national security and the safety of our communities. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on this issue and invite them to \ncosponsor the Methamphetamine Trafficking Enforcement Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 133. A bill to promote the national security and stability of the \neconomy of the United States by reducing the dependence of the United \nStates on oil through the use of alternative fuels and new technology, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, in 2005, Congress enacted the Renewable \nFuels Standard, RFS, as part of the Energy Policy Act. The RFS is a \ncommitment by the United States government that, henceforth, ethanol \nmust comprise a substantial part of the national vehicle fuel supply, \nwith a goal of 7.5 billion gallons of ethanol in our gasoline by 2012.\n  Ethanol production has responded vigorously to this national policy. \nIn fact, in only two years, ethanol production has boomed to where it \nnow far exceeds the RFS target for this year. It is\n\n[[Page S128]]\n\nwidely anticipated that ethanol production will surpass the target for \nthe year 2012 by the end of this year, five years early.\n  Clearly, it is time to increase the RFS targets. I am pleased to be \nan original cosponsor of the bill introduced today by my colleagues, \nSenator Harkin and Senator Lugar, that will increase those targets to \n30 billion gallons by the year 2020 and 60 billion gallons by the year \n2030. I hope my colleagues will support the provisions of that bill.\n  But for an expanded RFS to be successful, we must lay further \ngroundwork. We cannot meet the targets and deadlines of an expanded RFS \nwithout a robust package of policies that set the stage for the next \ndecade.\n  So far, we've met our biofuels goals by producing ethanol made from \nsugars that come from corn. This approach, by itself, has been \nprofoundly successful in many rural communities but will eventually \nreach its maximum capacity. While that day is still several years away, \nwe must begin preparations now. We must build upon our current path. We \nmust continue our pursuit in cracking the code for corn cellulosics. We \nmust pour the foundation for the next generation of biofuels made from \nthe broadest range of agriculture feedstocks. Our vocabulary must \nexpand to cellulosics and biobut- anols, manure and miscanthus.\n  The American Fuels Act, which I introduce today, breathes life into \nan expanded RFS. The American Fuels Act is the heart, the centerpiece, \nthe key to ensuring that an expanded RFS is successful. That's why I am \npleased to be joined today by my esteemed colleagues, Senator Lugar and \nSenator Harkin, in the introduction of this bill.\n   The premise of the American Fuels Act is to create a ``Biofuels \nTriangle'' that focuses on (1). production, (2). distribution, and (3) \nconsumption.\n  To expand production, we create an ``Alternative Diesel Standard'' \nfor diesels that complements the RFS for gasoline. The Alternative \nDiesel Standard requires 2 billion gallons of alternative diesels into \nthe 40 billion gallon domestic diesel supply by the year 2016, \nencouraging greater use of biofuel feedstocks like vegetable oils, \nanimal fats, coal-to-liquids, manure, and municipal waste. We call for \nthe establishment of a cellulosic biomass fuels credit of an additional \n76.5 cents per gallon so that first-generation cellulosic plants can be \nbuilt to meet the 250 million gallon production goals by 2012.\n  To expand distribution, the American Fuels Act provides a tax credit \nfor ethanol producers to invest in on-site blending equipment, \nbypassing oil refineries so that E-85 can be transported directly to \nthe pump at your local gas station. Our bill also provides freedom for \nfuel franchisers by making it illegal for oil companies to stop their \nbranded franchises from selling biofuels should these local businessmen \nwish to respond to their customer's request for biofuels. This bill \nalso gives franchisers the power to sue oil companies for imposing any \nrestrictions.\n  And to expand consumption, the American Fuels Act encourages the \nmanufacture of more vehicles that can function on higher ethanol blends \nlike E-85 so that more passenger cars to be flexible fuel vehicles. We \nprovide a $100 tax credit to automakers for each ethanol-capable \nvehicle produced beyond the CAFE credit or any other government \nrequirement. We require that 100 percent of the Federal fleet must be \nethanol-capable or hybrids in the next 7 years. And we require that any \npublic transit agency that uses Federal dollars to upgrade bus fleets \nmust purchase an alternative fuel bus, or pledge to use alternative \nfuels in those buses.\n  To oversee these efforts, we create a Director of Energy Security in \nthe Office of the President to ensure that our massive investment in \ndomestically produced fuels get the national security leadership and \ncoordination it requires.\n  Our dependence on oil is hurting our economy and jeopardizing our \nnational security by keeping us tied to the world's most dangerous and \nunstable regimes. It's the fossil fuels we insist on burning--\nparticularly oil--that are the single greatest cause of climate change \nand the damaging weather patterns that have been its result. Never has \nthe failure to take on a single challenge so detrimentally affected \nnearly every aspect of our well-being as Nation. And never have the \npossible solutions had the potential to do so much good for so many \ngenerations to come.\n  That's why I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the \nAmerican Fuels Act.

A bill to authorize the construction of the Arkansas Valley \nConduit in the State of Colorado, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am introducing the Arkansas Valley \nConduit bill, which will ensure the construction of a pipeline that \nwill provide the small, financially strapped towns and water agencies \nalong the lower Arkansas River with safe, clean, affordable water. This \nproject was originally authorized by Congress in 1962, over 40 years \nago, as a part of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project. Due to several long \nyears of drought and increasing Federal water quality standards, \ncurrent water delivery methods are not enough. By creating an 80-\npercent Federal, 20-percent local cost share formula to help offset the \nconstruction costs of the conduit, this legislation will protect the \nfuture of southeastern Colorado's drinking water supplies and prevent \nfurther economic hardship.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 135. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to acquire land \nfor\n\n[[Page S134]]\n\nthe purposes of expanding Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, another bill dealing with the large \nmilitary presence in Colorado relates to the expansion of the Army's \nPinon Canyon Maneuver Site. Due to an emphasis on rapid mobility, \nmodularity, and maneuverability in recent years, the Army's ability to \nproject force across the battlefield has increased exponentially. As \nsuch, the Army transformation is also driving higher their requirement \nfor training space.\n  With its close location to Fort Carson, Pinon Canyon was perfectly \nsuited for the Army's training needs 20 years ago. However, with the \narrival of 10,000 new soldiers to Fort Carson, the Army has determined \nthat the size of the site needs to be increased in order to meet Fort \nCarson's new operational training requirements.\n  I have been told repeatedly by Army officials that the genesis of \nFort Carson's expansion proposal occurred when several landowners \napproached Fort Carson and expressed their strong desire to sell. I \nalso understand that sufficient numbers of willing sellers exist to \nsupport a significant expansion of the site. However, many in the \ncommunity surrounding Pinon Canyon have major questions that need to be \nanswered.\n\n  In order to get some of these major questions answered, a reporting \nrequirement was placed in the 2006 Defense Authorization bill, approved \nby both the Senate and the House. However, the Department of Army is \nrestricted on communicating about any specific land acquisition \nproposal until a waiver for that site has been granted by the Secretary \nof Defense, which has yet to be granted. Thus, the Army's hands were \ntied and they were unable to meet the full reporting requirements in \nthe 2006 Defense authorization. I understand the difficult position the \nArmy is on this issue, but I believe it is absolutely necessary that \nthey provide the information to the community and to Congress prior to \nany acquisition of property.\n  The leadership at Fort Carson has done a great job of reaching out \nand providing what information it could to the local communities. \nHowever, the Pentagon has not been as forthcoming. I believe the \nCongress and, more importantly, the local communities in Southeastern \nColorado need more information before we can decide whether this \nproposed expansion is necessary and appropriate.\n  With these objectives in mind, today I am introducing a bill that \nclearly defines the process under which the Army can expand the Pinon \nCanyon Maneuver Site. This legislation prohibits the use of eminent \ndomain, requires the Army to pay fair market value. Most importantly, \nthe bill does not allow the Army to proceed with land acquisition until \nit delivers the answers previously sought on the environmental and \neconomic impacts of expansion and also must offer options for \ncompensating the loss of property tax revenue.\n  It is vital that the Army take the time to answer these important \nquestions to help alleviate the affected communities concerns. A number \nof counties and small towns in Southeastern Colorado could be adversely \naffected by this expansion, and this study will help us better \nunderstand the extent of these impacts and provide options for \nmitigating them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 136. A bill to expand the National Domestic Preparedness \nConsortium to include the Transportation Technology Center; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, in another area, the events of the past \nseveral years remind us of the vital role of first responders in \nresponding to natural disasters and terrorists attacks. It is important \nthat our first responders receive the training needed to make critical, \nlife-saving decisions under emergency circumstances. I believe that an \nessential element of preparing our first responders is to provide them \nwith hands-on experience in real-world training environments.\n  The importance of real world training was called to my attention by a \nvisit to the Transportation Technology Training Center, TTC, in Pueblo, \nCO. There, I witnessed first hand the tools at our Nation's disposal to \nequip our first responders with the training they need, specifically in \nthe context of rail and mass transit. But our national training \nconsortium does not currently include a facility that is uniquely \nfocused on emergency preparedness within the railroad and mass transit \nenvironment. The inclusion of TTC would fill a critical gap in its \ncurrent training agenda.\n  TTC is a federally owned, 52-square-mile multimodal testing and \ntraining facility in Pueblo, CO, operated by the Association of \nAmerican Railroads, AAR. Each year, an average of 1,700 first \nresponders travel to Pueblo, CO, to participate in TTC's training \nprogram. The facility has trained more than 20,000 students in its 20-\nyear history.\n  The ERTC is regarded as the ``graduate school'' of hazmat training \nbecause of its focus on hands on, true to life, training exercises on \nactual rail vehicles, including tank cars and passenger rail cars. The \nERTC is uniquely positioned to teach emergency response for railway-\nrelated emergencies.\n  It is for these reasons that today I introduce a bill authorizing the \nNational Domestic Preparedness Consortium, as expanded to include the \nTransportation Technology Center in Pueblo, CO, and providing for its \ncoordination and use by the Department of Homeland Security in training \nthe Nation's first responders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 137.

A bill to require the Federal Government to purchase fuel \nefficient automobiles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last year many Americans paid over $3--and \nin some places in California, $4--for a gallon of gasoline.\n  At the same time, oil companies made record profits. Enough is \nenough!\n  We need to help the American public and reduce our dependence on oil. \nThe Federal Government should be taking the lead on this issue. Sadly, \nit is not.\n  In 2005, the Federal Government purchased 64,000 passenger vehicles. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, the average fuel economy of \nthe new vehicles purchased for the fleet in 2005 was an abysmal 21.4 \nmiles per gallon.\n  Today, hybrid cars on the market can achieve over 50 miles per gallon \nand SUVs can obtain 36 miles per gallon. The Government's average of \n21.4 miles to the gallon is too low.\n  Instead, our government needs to purchase fuel-efficient cars, SUVs, \nand light trucks. This can be done today. I drive a Toyota Prius that \ngets over 50 mpg. The Ford Escape SUV can get 36 mpg.\n  The Federal Government should be a leader in protecting our \nenvironment and national security.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the Government Fleet Fuel Economy Act. \nThe bill requires the federal government to purchase vehicles that are \nfuel-efficient to the greatest extent possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 148. A bill to establish the Paterson Great Falls National Park in \nthe State of New Jersey, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today with great pride to \nreintroduce legislation which would create a national park in my \nhometown of Paterson, NJ, The Paterson Great Falls National Park Act of \n2007, which I first introduced last year, would bring long-deserved \nrecognition and accessibility to one of our Nation's most beautiful and \nhistoric landmarks. I am pleased that my colleague from New Jersey, \nSenator Menendez, is cosponsoring this legislation.\n  The Great Falls are located where the Passaic River drops nearly 80 \nfeet straight down, on its course towards New York Harbor. It is one of \nthe tallest and most spectacular waterfalls on the east coast, but the \nincredible natural beauty of the falls should not overshadow its \ntremendous importance as the powerhouse of industry in New Jersey and \nthe infant United States. Indeed, in 1778, Alexander Hamilton visited \nthe Great Falls and immediately realized the potential of the falls for \nindustrial applications and development. Hamilton was instrumental in \ncreating the planned community in Paterson--the first of its kind \nnationwide--centered on the Great Falls, and industry thrived on the \npower generated by the falls. Rogers Locomotive Works, the premier \nsteam locomotive manufacturer of the 19th century, was\n\n[[Page S136]]\n\nlocated in the shadow of the falls, as were many other vitally \nimportant manufacturing enterprises.\n  President Ford recognized the importance of the area by declaring the \nfalls and its surroundings a ``National Historic Landmark'' in 1976; he \ncalled the falls ``a symbol of the industrial might which helps to make \nthe United States the most powerful nation in the world.'' Now, it is \ntime that we recognize the importance of this historic area by making \nit New Jersey's first national park. This would be of special \nimportance because so few of our national parks are in urban areas. I \nbelieve that it is time we acknowledge that many of our most \nsignificant national treasures are located in densely populated areas, \nand creating a national park in Paterson is an ideal opportunity to do \njust that.\n  I grew up in Paterson, and I have appreciated the majesty and beauty \nof the Great Falls for many years. By creating a national park in \nPaterson, more Americans can be exposed to the exceptional cultural, \nnatural, and historic significance of the Great Falls, and that is why \nI will passionately advocate for the passage of this bill. I have been \ndelighted to again work with my good friend, Congressman Bill \nPascrell--another longtime resident of Paterson--on this issue, as well \nas with a bipartisan group of lawmakers from my home State, all of whom \nbelieve strongly in this cause. I urge my colleagues to support the \npassage of this legislation, which is so important to New Jersey and \nall of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Paterson Great Falls \n     National Park Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Great Falls Historic District in Paterson, New \n     Jersey is the site Alexander Hamilton selected to implement \n     his vision of American economic independence and transform a \n     rural agrarian society based on slavery into a global economy \n     based on freedom.\n       (2) President Ford announced the designation of the \n     Historic District as a National Historic Landmark in 1976 and \n     declared it ``a symbol of the industrial might which helps to \n     make America the most powerful nation in the world''.\n       (3) The Historic District was established as a National \n     Historic District in 1996.\n       (4) Exceptional natural and cultural resources make the \n     Historic District America's only National Historic District \n     that contains both a National Historic Landmark and a \n     National Natural Resource.\n       (5) The Historic District embodies Hamilton's vision of an \n     American economy based on--\n       (A) diverse industries to avoid excessive reliance on any \n     single manufactured product;\n       (B) innovative engineering and technology, including the \n     successful use of water, a renewable energy source, to power \n     industry and manufacturing;\n       (C) industrial production of goods not only for domestic \n     consumption but also for international trade; and\n       (D) meritocracy and opportunities for all.\n       (6) Pierre L'Enfant's water power system at Great Falls and \n     the buildings erected around it over two centuries constitute \n     the finest and most extensive remaining example of \n     engineering, planning, and architectural works that span the \n     entire period of America's growth into an industrial power.\n       (7) A National Park Service unit in Paterson is necessary \n     to give the American people an opportunity to appreciate the \n     physical beauty and historical importance of the Historic \n     District.\n       (8) Congress and the National Park Service recognized the \n     national significance of the Historic District through \n     listing on the National Register of Historic Places and \n     designation as a National Historic Landmark and a National \n     Historic District.\n       (9) The Historic District is suitable for addition to the \n     National Park System because--\n       (A) the national park will promote themes not adequately \n     represented in National Park System, including aspects of \n     African-American history and the inspiration Great Falls has \n     been for renowned American writers and artists;\n       (B) the national park will promote civic engagement by \n     attracting and engaging people who currently feel little or \n     no connection to National Parks or the founding fathers;\n       (C) the national park will interpret America's developing \n     history in the historical and global context; and\n       (D) the national park will foster partnerships among \n     federal, state and local governments and private donors and \n     non-profit organizations.\n       (10) The Historic District is a physically and fiscally \n     feasible site for a national park because--\n       (A) all of the required natural and cultural resources are \n     on property largely owned by local government entities;\n       (B) it is of a manageable size; and\n       (C) much of the funding will come from private donors and \n     the State of New Jersey, which has committed substantial sums \n     of money to fund a state park that will assist in the funding \n     of the national park.\n       (11) The national park provides enormous potential for \n     public use because its location and urban setting make it \n     easily accessible for millions of Americans.\n       (12) The historic Hinchliffe stadium, adjacent to the \n     Historic District, was home to the New York Black Yankees for \n     many years, including 1933 when it hosted the Colored \n     Championship of the Nation, and it was added to the National \n     Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service in \n     2004.\n       (13) Larry Doby played in Hinchliffe Stadium both as a star \n     high school athlete and again as Negro League player, shortly \n     before becoming the first African-American to play in the \n     American League.\n       (14) A National Park Service unit, in partnership with \n     private donors and state and local governments, represents \n     the most effective and efficient method of preserving the \n     Historic District for the public.\n       (15) A National Park Service unit in Paterson is necessary \n     to give the Historic District the continuity and \n     professionalism required to attract private donors from \n     across the country.\n       (16) Though the State of New Jersey will be a strong \n     partner with a significant financial commitment, the State \n     alone cannot preserve the Historic District and present it to \n     the public without a National Park System unit in Paterson.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a unit of the National Park System in \n     Paterson, New Jersey, consisting of the Historic District and \n     historic Hinchliffe Stadium; and\n       (2) to create partnerships among Federal, State, and local \n     governments, non-profit organizations, and private donors to \n     preserve, enhance, interpret, and promote the cultural sites, \n     historic structures, and natural beauty of the Historic \n     District and the historic Hinchliffe Stadium for the benefit \n     of present and future generations.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Historic district.--The term ``Historic District'' \n     means the Great Falls National Historic District in Paterson, \n     New Jersey, consisting of approximately 118 acres, as \n     specified in the National Register of Historic Places.\n       (2) National park.--The term ``national park'' means the \n     Paterson Great Falls National Park established by section 4.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (4) Management plan.--The term ``management plan'' means \n     the integrated resource management plan prepared pursuant to \n     section 6.\n       (5) Partnership.--The term ``Partnership'' means the \n     Paterson Great Falls National Park Partnership established in \n     section 7.\n       (6) Advisory council.--The term ``Advisory Council'' means \n     the Paterson Great Falls National Park Advisory Council \n     established pursuant to section 8.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to address the effect of the death of a defendant in \nFederal criminal proceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator \nSessions in re-introducing the ``Preserving Crime Victims' Restitution \nAct.'' The Act would clarify the rule of law and procedures that should \nbe applied when a criminal defendant, such as former Enron CEO Kenneth \nLay, dies after he has been duly convicted, but before his appeals are \nfinal.\n  This bill passed the Senate unanimously at the end of the 109th \nCongress, but unfortunately it was not taken up by the House. Except \nfor minor, technical corrections, this new bill is the same as what the \nSenate passed in the last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to \nspeedily pass this bill, as you did before, so that it can be enacted \ninto law.\n  As I mentioned when I introduced this bill last fall, we have worked \nclosely with the Department of Justice in crafting this legislation, \nand have used much of DOJ's suggested language. DOJ fully supports the \nprinciples contained in this bill, and has indicated that it supports \nfixing this problem now to ensure that, despite a defendant's death, \nhard-won convictions are preserved so that restitution remains \navailable for the victims of crime.\n  This bill would establish that, if a defendant dies after being \nconvicted of a federal offense, his conviction will not be vacated. \nInstead, the court will be directed to issue a statement that the \ndefendant was convicted--either by a guilty plea or a verdict finding \nhim guilty--but then died before his case or appeal was final.\n  It would codify the current rule that no further punishments can be \nimposed on a person who is convicted if they die before a sentence is \nimposed or they have an opportunity to appeal their conviction. It \nwould clarify that, unlike punishment, other relief (such as \nrestitution to the victims) that could have been sought against a \nconvicted defendant can continue to be pursued and collected after the \ndefendant's death. It would establish a process to ensure that after a \nperson dies, a representative of his estate can challenge or appeal his \nconviction if they want, and can also secure a lawyer--either on their \nown or by having one appointed and, if the Government had filed a \ncriminal forfeiture action--in which it had sought to reach the \ndefendant's assets that were linked to his crimes--the Government would \nget an extra 2 years after the defendant's death to file a civil \nforfeiture lawsuit so that it could try to recover those same assets in \na different, and traditionally-accepted manner.\n  The need for this legislation was vividly demonstrated on October 17, \n2006, when U.S. District Judge Sim Lake, of the Southern District of \nTexas, wiped clean the criminal record of Enron founder Kenneth Lay, \neven after a jury and judge had unanimously found him guilty of 10 \ncriminal charges, including securities fraud, wire fraud involving \nfalse and misleading statements, bank fraud and conspiracy.\n  The decision to dismiss Mr. Lay's conviction was not based on any \nerror in the trial, suggestion of unfairness in the proceedings, or \nallegation of his innocence. Instead, it was simply based on the fact \nthat Mr. Lay died before his conviction had been affirmed on appeal, \nunder a common law rule known as ``abatement.''\n  In other words, the order essentially meant that Mr. Lay was \n``convicted but not guilty''--``innocent by reason of his death.''\n  Judge Lake granted this dismissal even in the face of DOJ Enron Task \nForce filings, which noted how Mr. Lay's conviction ``provided the \nbasis for the likely disgorgement of fraud proceeds totaling tens of \nmillions of dollars.'' In other words, the dismissal meant that \nmillions of dollars that the jury found was obtained by Mr. Lay \nillegally at the expense of former Enron employees and shareholders, \nwould remain untouched in the Lay estate. These employees and \nshareholders will now find it much harder to lay claim to these ill-\ngotten gains held by Mr. Lay's estate, because they will be unable to \npoint to his criminal conviction as proof of his wrongdoing.\n  I do not fault Judge Lake for issuing this order. He made it clear \nthat he was simply following the binding precedent issued in 2004 by \nthe full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, in a case called \nUnited States v. Estate of Parsons.\n  But as I noted in a letter I wrote to Attorney General Gonzales on \nOctober 20, 2006, the Fifth Circuit's Parsons decision goes far beyond \nthe traditional rule of law in this area. While the common-law doctrine \nof abatement has historically wiped out ``punishments'' following a \ncriminal defendant's death, the Supreme Court has never held that it \nmust also wipe out a victim's right to other forms of relief such as \nrestitution, which simply compensate third parties who were injured by \ncriminal misconduct.\n  As the six dissenters in Parsons noted, the majority's `` `finality \nrationale' is a completely novel judicial creation which has not been \nembraced or even suggested by . . . other courts.'' The Third and \nFourth Circuits, for example, have expressly refused to take this \nposition, and upheld a restitution order after a criminal defendant's \ndeath.\n  The Parsons decision was remarkable in several other respects, \nincluding the fact that (as the dissenters noted), its new rule of law \nwas apparently inspired by a single law review article. That academic \npiece boldly claimed that a criminal defendant's right of appeal is \n``evolving into a constitutional right,''\n\n[[Page S139]]\n\nand suggested that a conviction untested by appellate review is \nunreliable and illegitimate. This notion runs contrary to the \ntraditional rule applied in virtually every other context--where a \njury's findings are typically respected under the law.\n  Of course a defendant is presumed innocent at the outset of his case. \nAfter a jury has deliberated and unanimously issued a formal finding of \nguilt, however, that presumption of innocence no longer stands.\n  The Parsons ``finality'' rationale even raises the possibility that a \ndefendant who fully admitted his wrongdoing and pleaded guilty, but who \nthen died while an appeal of his sentence was pending, could have his \nentire criminal conviction erased.\n  In fact, that has already occurred, in the 1994 case of United States \nv. Pogue, where the D.C. Circuit ordered the dismissal of a conviction \nof a defendant whose appeal was pending--even though the docketing \nstatement had said that the defendant intended to challenge only his \nsentence, and not his underlying conviction.\n  Following Judge Lake's decision, I sent a letter to the Attorney \nGeneral, asking him to appeal the order and continue the fight for \nEnron victims. Unfortunately, the Justice Department decided in \nNovember to withdraw its appeal, leaving it up to the victims \nthemselves to pursue any further relief.\n  I am very disappointed in this decision. These victims have had their \nlivelihoods and retirement stripped from them, and they deserved a \nJustice Department that was willing to fight vigorously to protect \ntheir interests.\n  Enron's collapse in 2001 wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 \nbillion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension plans. \nWhen America's seventh largest company crumbled into bankruptcy after \nits accounting tricks could no longer hide its billions in debt, \ncountless former Enron employees and shareholders lost their entire \nlife savings after investing in Enron's 401(k) plan.\n  Many of these Enron victims have been following closely the years of \npreparation by the Enron Task Force, and the four-month jury trial and \nseparate one-week bench trial, hoping to finally recover some \nrestitution in this criminal case. And despite Mr. Lay's vigorous \nefforts to avoid being held accountable for his actions, a conviction \nwas finally secured.\n  Yet now these people have essentially been victimized again. They \nwill be forced to start all over in their efforts to get back some \nportion of the pension funds on which they expected to subsist, and the \nother hard-earned assets that will remain beyond their reach, despite \nthe unanimous, hard-fought verdicts finding Mr. Lay guilty of all ten \ncounts with which he had been charged.\n  I believe in situations like this, leaving the victims without this \nrecourse is an unacceptable outcome. That is why I am introducing this \nbill to prevent further injustices like this from ever happening again.\n  While I have no desire for our Government to punish a criminal \ndefendant who dies, the calculation should be different when we are \ndetermining how to make up for harm suffered by other innocent victims.\n  This legislation offers a fair solution and orderly process in the \nevent that a criminal defendant dies prior to his final appeal.\n  The time has come for Congress to end this injustice--hopefully, by \nacting quickly enough to assist these Enron victims, but in any event \nin a way that will solve the problems that the Lay dismissal so starkly \nillustrated.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly pass this bill, as you \ndid in the 109th Congress, so that we can enact it into law in the \n110th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 149\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the safe Drinking Water Act to protect the \nhealth of pregnant women, fetuses, infants, and children by requiring a \nhealth advisory and drinking water standard for perchlorate; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould order EPA to promptly establish a health advisory and then a \ndrinking water standard for perchlorate. I am pleased that the Senior \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and the Senior Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, have joined as original cosponsors of this \nmeasure.\n  This legislation will require the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) to establish a standard for perchlorate contamination in \ndrinking water supplies by December 31, 2007. EPA still has not \ncommitted to establishing a tap water standard for this widespread \ncontaminant, decades after learning that perchlorate is a problem in \nour drinking water.\n  Perchlorate is a clear and present danger to California's and much of \nAmerica's health. We cannot wait any longer to address this threat. EPA \nneeds to get moving and protect our drinking water now.\n  Drinking water sources for more than 20 million Americans are \ncontaminated with perchlorate. Perchlorate is the main ingredient in \nrocket fuel, which accounts for 90 percent of its use. Perchlorate is \nalso used for ammunition, fireworks, highway safety flares, air bags, \nand fertilizers. It dissolves readily in many liquids, including water, \nand moves easily and quickly through the ground.\n  Perchlorate was first discovered in drinking water in 1957, and at \nthe latest in the mid-1980s, EPA was aware that perchlorate \ncontaminates drinking water. Since 1997, when California developed a \nnew, more sensitive testing method that can detect perchlorate down to \n4 parts per billion, perchlorate has been found in soil, groundwater, \nand surface water throughout the U.S.\n  According to a May 2005 report from the Government Accountability \nOffice, perchlorate contamination has been detected in water and soil \nat almost 400 sites in the U.S., with levels ranging from 4 parts per \nbillion to millions of parts per billion.\n  GAO also said that limited EPA data show that perchlorate has \npolluted 35 States and the District of Columbia, and is known to have \ncontaminated 153 public water systems in 26 States. Those data likely \nunderestimate total exposure, as illustrated by the finding\n\n[[Page S141]]\n\nof the California Department of Health Services that perchlorate \ncontamination has affected at least 276 drinking water wells sources \nand 77 drinking water systems in California alone.\n  The Food and Drug Administration and other scientific researchers \nhave detected perchlorate in the United States food supply, including \nin lettuce, milk, cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, wheat, and \nspinach, and in human breast milk.\n  Perchlorate can harm human health, especially in pregnant women and \nchildren, by interfering with thyroid gland, which is needed to produce \nimportant hormones that help control human health and development. The \nthyroid helps to ensure children's proper mental and physical \ndevelopment, in addition to helping to control metabolism. Thyroid \nproblems in expectant mothers or infants can affect babies, and result \nin delayed development and decreased learning capability.\n  The largest and most comprehensive study to date on the effects of \nlow levels of perchlorate exposure in women was recently published by \nresearchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nCDC found that there were significant changes in thyroid hormones in \nwomen with low iodine levels who were exposed to perchlorate. The CDC \nresearchers also found that even small increases in low-level \nperchlorate exposure may affect the thyroid's production of hormones in \niodine deficient women. About 36 percent of women in the U.S. have \niodine levels equal to or below those of the women in the study.\n  EPA has not established a health advisory or national primary \ndrinking water regulation for perchlorate. Instead, the agency has \nestablished a ``Drinking Water Equivalent Level'' (DWEL) of 24.5 parts \nper billion for this toxin. The agency's DWEL does not take into \nconsideration all routes of exposure to perchlorate, and has been \ncriticized by experts for failing to sufficiently consider the body \nweight, unique exposure, and vulnerabilities of certain pregnant women \nand fetuses, infants, and children. It is based primarily upon a small \nhuman study by Greer et al., which tested a small number of adults. The \nDWEL also does not take into account the new much larger studies from \nCDC, and other data indicating potential effects at lower perchlorate \nlevels than previously found.\n  Alarming levels of perchlorate have been discovered in Lake Mead and \nthe Colorado River, the drinking water source for millions of Southern \nCalifornians. Communities in the Inland Empire, San Gabriel Valley, \nSanta Clara Valley, and the Sacramento area are also grappling with \nperchlorate contamination.\n  My bill will ensure that EPA acts swiftly to address this threat to \nour health and welfare. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \npass this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Pregnant Women \n     and Children From Perchlorate Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) perchlorate--\n       (A) is a chemical used as the primary ingredient of solid \n     rocket propellant;\n       (B) is also used in fireworks, road flares, and other \n     applications.\n       (2) waste from the manufacture and improper disposal of \n     chemicals containing perchlorate is increasingly being \n     discovered in soil and water;\n       (3) according to the Government Accountability Office, \n     perchlorate contamination has been detected in water and soil \n     at almost 400 sites in the United States, with concentration \n     levels ranging from 4 parts per billion to millions of parts \n     per billion;\n       (4) the Government Accountability Office has determined \n     that the Environmental Protection Agency does not centrally \n     track or monitor perchlorate detections or the status of \n     perchlorate cleanup, so a greater number of contaminated \n     sites may already exist;\n       (5) according to the Government Accountability Office, \n     limited Environmental Protection Agency data show that \n     perchlorate has been found in 35 States and the District of \n     Columbia and is known to have contaminated 153 public water \n     systems in 26 States;\n       (6) those data are likely underestimates of total drinking \n     water exposure, as illustrated by the finding of the \n     California Department of Health Services that perchlorate \n     contamination sites have affected approximately 276 drinking \n     water sources and 77 drinking water systems in the State of \n     California alone;\n       (7) Food and Drug Administration scientists and other \n     scientific researchers have detected perchlorate in the \n     United States food supply, including in lettuce, milk, \n     cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots, cantaloupe, wheat, and spinach, \n     and in human breast milk;\n       (8)(A) perchlorate can harm human health, especially in \n     pregnant women and children, by interfering with uptake of \n     iodide by the thyroid gland, which is necessary to produce \n     important hormones that help control human health and \n     development;\n       (B) in adults, the thyroid helps to regulate metabolism;\n       (C) in children, the thyroid helps to ensure proper mental \n     and physical development; and\n       (D) impairment of thyroid function in expectant mothers or \n     infants may result in effects including delayed development \n     and decreased learning capability;\n       (9)(A) in October 2006, researchers from the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention published the largest, most \n     comprehensive study to date on the effects of low levels of \n     perchlorate exposure in women, finding that--\n       (i) significant changes existed in thyroid hormones in \n     women with low iodine levels who were exposed to perchlorate; \n     and\n       (ii) even low-level perchlorate exposure may affect the \n     production of hormones by the thyroid in iodine-deficient \n     women; and\n       (B) in the United States, about 36 percent of women have \n     iodine levels equivalent to or below the levels of the women \n     in the study described in subparagraph (A); and\n       (10) the Environmental Protection Agency has not \n     established a health advisory or national primary drinking \n     water regulation for perchlorate, but instead established a \n     ``Drinking Water Equivalent Level'' of 24.5 parts per billion \n     for perchlorate, which--\n       (A) does not take into consideration all routes of exposure \n     to perchlorate;\n       (B) has been criticized by experts as failing to \n     sufficiently consider the body weight, unique exposure, and \n     vulnerabilities of certain pregnant women and fetuses, \n     infants, and children; and\n       (C) is based primarily on a small study and does not take \n     into account new, larger studies of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention or other data indicating potential \n     effects at lower perchlorate levels than previously found.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to require the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to establish, by not later than 90 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, a health advisory \n     for perchlorate in drinking water that fully protects \n     pregnant women, fetuses, infants, and children, taking into \n     consideration body weight and exposure patterns and all \n     routes of exposure to perchlorate; and\n       (2) to require the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to establish promptly a national primary \n     drinking water regulation for perchlorate that fully protects \n     pregnant women, fetuses, infants, and children, taking into \n     consideration body weight and exposure patterns and all \n     routes of exposure to perchlorate.\n\n     SEC. 3. HEALTH ADVISORY AND NATIONAL PRIMARY DRINKING WATER \n                   REGULATION FOR PERCHLORATE.\n\n       Section 1412(b)(12) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 300g-1(b)(12)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(C) Perchlorate.--\n       ``(i) Schedule, health advisory, and standard.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the \n     Administrator shall publish a health advisory and promulgate \n     a national primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate, \n     in accordance with the schedule and provisions established by \n     this subparagraph, that fully protect, with an adequate \n     margin of safety, the health of vulnerable persons (including \n     pregnant women, fetuses, infants, and children), taking into \n     consideration body weight, exposure patterns, and all routes \n     of exposure.\n       ``(ii) Health advisory.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this subparagraph, the Administrator \n     shall publish a health advisory for perchlorate in accordance \n     with clause (i).\n       ``(iii) Proposed regulations.--Not later than August 1, \n     2007, the Administrator shall propose a national primary \n     drinking water regulation for perchlorate in accordance with \n     clause (i).\n       ``(iv) Final regulations.--Not later than December 31, \n     2007, after providing notice and an opportunity for public \n     comment, the Administrator shall promulgate a national \n     primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate in \n     accordance with clause (i).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 152. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to establish a program to help States expand the educational \nsystem to include at least 1 year of early education preceding the year \na child enters kindergarten; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S142]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce the Early \nEducation Act. This bill will enable children across our nation to be \nprepared with the initial skills and abilities to successfully begin \ntheir education.\n  I strongly believe that there should be a national commitment to \nestablish that all children have access to high quality prekindergarten \nprograms. This bill is a step forward in making that possible.\n  Of the nearly 8 million and 3- and 4-year-olds that could be in early \neducation, fewer than half are enrolled in an early education program. \nIn my State of California alone, just 65 percent of 4-year-olds are in \npreschool.\n  The result is that too many children come to school ill-prepared to \nlearn. They lack language and social skills. Almost all experts now \nagree that an early education experience is one of the most effective \nstrategies for improving later school performance.\n  Researchers have discovered that children have a learning capacity \nthat can and should be developed at a much earlier age than was \npreviously thought. The National Research Council reported that \nprekindergarten educational opportunities are critical in developing \nearly language and literacy skills and preventing reading difficulties \nin young children.\n  Furthermore, studies have shown that children who participate in \nprekindergarten programs are less likely to be held back a grade, show \ngreater learning retention and initiative, have better social skills, \nare more enthusiastic about school, and are more likely to have good \nattendance records.\n  In fact, prekindergarten programs pay for themselves in long-term \nbenefits. It is estimated that for every dollar invested in early \neducation, about $7 are saved in later costs.\n  My bill, the Early Education Act, would create a program in at least \n10 States to provide one year of prekindergarten early education in the \npublic schools. There is a 50 percent matching requilement, and the \n$300 million authorized annually under this bill would be used by \nStates to supplement--not supplant--other Federal, State or local \nfunds. This bill would serve approximately 136,000 children.\n  Our children need a solid foundation that builds on current education \nsystem by providing them with early learning skills. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 153. A bill to provide for the monitoring of the long-term medical \nhealth of firefighters who responded to emergencies in certain disaster \nareas and for the treatment of such firefighters; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I introduce the Healthy Firefighters Act, \nan important bill that would protect the firefighters who respond to \nemergencies. The bill is inspired by the brave firefighters from the \nSan Jacinto Ranger District, who responded to the Esperanza Incident \nwildfire in southern California in October of 2006.\n  We rely on firefighters to protect us when disaster strikes, and they \nselflessly place themselves in danger to provide that protection. One \ndanger they face in the course of performing their duties is exposure \nto toxins--including fine particulates, carbon monoxide, sulfur, \nformaldehyde, mercury, heavy metals, and benzene--that can have a \nsignificant negative effect on their health.\n  We owe it to this country's brave firefighters to minimize their \nsacrifice for our safety, to the greatest extent possible. My bill \nwould require the U.S. Fire Administrator to contract with a medical \nresearch university to conduct long-term medical health monitoring of \nfirefighters who responded to emergencies in any areas declared a \ndisaster by the Federal Government, and provide healthcare for those \nfirefighters who suffer health problems as a consequence of their work \nin those disaster areas. Pulmonary illness, neurological damage, and \ncardiovascular damage are examples of illnesses for which firefighters \nwould be monitored and treated under this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider and pass this bill to benefit \nfirefighters, who are among this country's most heroic citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself, Mr. Obama, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Pryor, Ms. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Bond, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Enzi, Ms. \n        Landrieu, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 154. A bill to promote coal-to-liquid fuel activities; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coal-to-\nLiquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2007.\n  For too long, America has ignored its energy security. Many of us can \nremember the energy crises of the 1970s. We were held ransom by a \nmonopolistic oil cartel and forced to endure shortages, gas lines, and \nhigh prices. In the early 1980s, just as America began to invest in \nalternative fuels, the oil-producing states of the world crashed prices \nto make new technology uncompetitive.\n  During most of the last 25 years, we have enjoyed low prices and \nplentiful supply, but we have paid a price. Today, we find America is \naddicted to oil.\n  Since September 11, we have seen the fragile state of our energy \nmarkets. Domestic disasters and terrorism can send energy prices \nspiraling out of control. Our energy resources are stretched to the \nlimits, and small supply disruptions ripple through the entire economy. \nAmerica needs a secure domestic source to ease our dependency on \nimported oil.\n  That is why today I am reintroducing my bill, the Coal-to-Liquid Fuel \nPromotion Act with the current Presiding Officer, Senator Obama of \nIllinois. I have worked with the coal and fuel industries, the \nDepartment of Defense, and environmental groups to identify the needs \nof the coal-to-liquid industry and the best way for the Government to \nsupport the coal-to-liquid development.\n  Coal has long been America's most abundant fuel resource and has \ndriven our economic growth since the industrial revolution. In the \ncoal-to-liquid process, coal is gasified, the gas is run through the \nFischerTropsch process, and the resulting fuel is refined into jet fuel \nand diesel fuel. The final product is cleaner than conventional fuels \nbecause nearly all of the sulfur and nitrogen is removed.\n  While this technology is just taking root in America, South Africa \nmeets 30 percent of its fuel needs with coal. CTL technology lets \nAmerica capitalize on a domestic resource that will fuel economic \ngrowth and produce the energy security required in today's world. Many \nof my colleagues may ask one question right now: If this technology is \nso great and could replace expensive imports from the Middle East, why \nhasn't it been done already? The answer is simple: costs and market \nuncertainty.\n  A typical size CTL plant costs more than $2 billion to construct. \nWith complicated plans and environmental permits, a new plant could \ntake 5 to 8 years to build. This is a challenge for even the biggest \nrisk-takers on Wall Street. Raising the capital needed to develop a new \ntechnology is always difficult, but the multibillion dollar investment \nscale of a CTL plant has made it nearly impossible.\n  On top of this is the uncertainty of the price of oil. America has \nseen oil prices rise dramatically in the last few years. But investors \nare concerned that oil prices could drop to the low levels of the 1980s \nand make CTL plants uncompetitive again. I believe oil prices will stay \nabove the price range that keeps CTL profitable, which is estimated to \nbe between $40 and $50 per barrel. But even if oil prices were to drop \nthat low in the next few decades, I believe CTL would more than pay for \nitself by insulating us from supply shocks and providing a secure \ndomestic fuel supply for the military, businesses such as airlines and \ntrucking, and the average American's car.\n\n  The Federal Government must act to help industry overcome these \nhurdles. This legislation will provide a combination of incentives to \ncreate a network of coal-to-liquid production in the United States.\n  The Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2007 has three parts. First, \nthis bill addresses the need to pull together the investors and the \nbillions of dollars required to build a CTL plant. It expands and \nenhances the Department of Energy's loan guarantee program included in \nthe Energy Policy Act we passed in 2005. It expressly authorizes\n\n[[Page S143]]\n\nDOE to administer loan guarantees for the Nation's first CTL plants. \nThese plants must be large scale, which is a minimum production of \n10,000 barrels a day of liquid fuel. This program is only for the first \n10 commercial plants. By then, we should have proven the economics of \nthis technology and no further incentives will be needed.\n  It also provides a new program of matching loans. The loans are \ncapped at $20 million and must be matched dollar-for-dollar by non-\nFederal money. They must be repaid as soon as the plants are financed.\n  Second, this legislation would fundamentally alter the economics of \nCTL plants during and after construction. It expands the investment tax \ncredits and expensing provisions enacted in the Energy Policy Act of \n2005. It increases the 20-percent tax credit for CTL plants to a \nmaximum of $200 million for each of the first 10 CTL plants. It also \nextends the expiring exploration of the fuel excise tax credits for CTL \nfrom 2009 to 2020. The current provisions will expire long before the \nfirst CTL plant is even operational. This extension will provide a \nmeaningful timeframe for CTL plants to benefit from the same tax \nincentives we offer renewable and hydrogen fuels.\n  This bill also provides an incentive for CTL plants to capture carbon \nemissions. We can use CO2 to produce oil in depleted wells \nor extract coalbed methane.\n  Third, this bill provides the Department of Defense the funding to \npurchase, test, and integrate CTL fuels into the military. In the last \nfew months, the Air Force has successfully tested CTL fuels in B-52 \nbombers. These tests are proving to the DOD and to industry that CTL \nfuels are as safe and reliable as the fuels produced today.\n  This legislation also instructs the DOD to conduct a study on CTL \nfuel storage and its inclusion in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  It authorizes the construction of storage facilities for CTL fuel and \nallows the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to hold up to 20 percent of its \nstock in the form of CTL-finished fuels.\n  By combining the abilities of the Department of Energy and the \nDepartment of Defense with incentives in the Tax Code, I am confident \nthis legislation will help Kentucky, and America, become the world \nleaders in coal-to-liquid fuel promotion. This coal-to-liquid fuel \nlegislation made headlines during the summer of 2006 when gas prices \nwere at a near record high. Yet when prices fell, the pressure to pass \nthis legislation also decreased. We have been very lucky that a mild \nwinter has held down demand. We will not always be this lucky.\n  No matter what energy prices are, America needs a domestic source of \nfuel. This year alone we will send $250 billion to foreign countries, \nmostly in the Middle East, just to buy oil. Imagine what we could have \ndone here at home with trillions of dollars we have spent on oil in the \nlast few decades.\n  There is no room for politics in energy security. In the 110th \nCongress, Senator Obama and I will work hard with all of our colleagues \nto pass this important legislation. I especially look forward to \nworking with my new chairman in the Energy Committee, Senator Bingaman, \nand my ranking member, Senator Domenici, on this important bill.\n  I now send to the desk the Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Promotion Act of 2007 \nand the related Coal-to-Liquid Fuel Energy Act of 2007. I ask unanimous \nconsent these two bills be printed with my remarks in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. without objection, the bills will be received \nand appropriately referred.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first I commend my colleague from Kentucky \nfor his legislation. This is an area in which I have had a continuing \ninterest as well. I salute him because one of the great challenges \nfacing our Nation is to dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign \nenergy. That is in our energy interest, it is in our economic interest, \nit is in our vital security interest. I commend my colleague from \nKentucky for coming to the floor and offering his proposal on what we \ncould do to make progress. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 154\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make the moratorium on Internet access taxes and \nmultiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce permanent; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing in this new \nCongress a bill to advance a cause for which I have been fighting for \nover 10 years now. The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act would extend \nthe current Internet tax moratorium, so that the Internet can remain \nfree from burdensome and discriminatory taxes.\n  Legislation to keep the Internet free from these taxes has passed the \nSenate 3 times since 1998 with sunsets that required consecutive \nextensions. A permanent moratorium on Internet taxation passed through \nboth the Commerce and Finance Committees in the 109th Congress yet \nfailed to get action on the Senate floor.\n  I come to the Floor again, bringing up Internet Taxation, because the \nmoratorium on Internet Taxation is set to expire on November 1st of \nthis year. In only 11 months, if Congress does not act, the moratorium \non Internet Taxation that has allowed the Internet and e-commerce to \nflourish will cease to protect American consumers and American \nbusinesses.\n  I don't want those who use the Internet to end up like our ancestors: \nthey were told the Spanish-American War telephone tax was \n``temporary,'' and that the tax was just needed to pay for the war. \nThat war ended two centuries ago, and Congress is just now getting \naround to getting rid of the tax!\n  The last time I checked, the Internet shows no sign of riding off \ninto the sunset, or becoming obsolete. You can bet that once \ndiscriminatory taxes are slapped on Internet users, those \ndiscriminatory taxes won't be going away any time soon either.\n  If you want to figure out how much discriminatory taxes could be, \njust look at your phone bill. Taxes and government fees already add as \nmuch as 20 percent in surcharges to consumer's telephone bills.\n  If you take a gallon of milk to the checkout counter and pay tax on \nthe purchase, the clerk can't turn around and charge you another tax if \nyou're going to use the milk in your cereal and another tax if you're \ngoing to put milk in your coffee. But that's what will happen to the \nInternet if the ban is not made permanent. You'd still pay all the \ntelephone taxes and all the franchise fees on cable, but on top of \nthose you'd pay even more taxes for the same service when you sign on \nto the Internet!\n  Discriminatory and double taxation of the Internet has been banned \nfor 8 years now. In all that time no one has ever come forward with \nevidence to show that the failure to impose discriminatory taxes has \nhurt them. No one has demonstrated why taxes that cannot be imposed in \nthe offline world should be imposed on identical online transactions.\n  Western Civilization may not end if the Permanent Internet Freedom \nAct is not passed, but you have to ask how many times Congress has to \nrevisit, re-litigate and re-approve a law that has been this effective. \nIt is time to make the Internet Tax moratorium permanent.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. McCain from Arizona and Mr. Sununu \nfrom New Hampshire for introducing this legislation with me today. They \nboth fought tirelessly alongside me and our former colleague, Mr. Allen \nfrom Virginia, to get the moratorium extended in 2004. I am pleased \nthat they are now replacing Mr. Allen as my bi-partisan partners on \nthis important piece of legislation. It is my hope that the three of \nus, working with the rest of our colleagues, can get this all-important \npiece of legislation passed early this year so we do not have to worry \nabout it as the November 1st deadline fast approaches.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Permanent Internet Tax \n     Freedom Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PERMANENT MORATORIUM ON INTERNET ACCESS TAXES AND \n                   MULTIPLE AND DISCRIMINATORY TAXES ON ELECTRONIC \n                   COMMERCE.\n\n       Section 1101(a) of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. \n     151 note) is amended by striking ``taxes during the period \n     beginning November 1, 2003, and ending November 1, 2007:'' \n     and inserting ``taxes:''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Wyden \nand Sununu in introducing the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act of \n2007. This bill would ensure that consumers never have to pay a toll \nwhen they access the Information Highway. Whether consumers log onto \nthe Internet using cable modem, DSL, dial-up or wireless services, \nunder this bill, they will not be taxed by any State or local \ngovernments for their Internet usage.\n  Keeping Internet access affordable to all Americans is a worthy \npolicy goal. The Internet has become a fixture and core component of \nmodem American life that has created and continues to generate social \nand economic opportunities throughout the United States.\n  In 1998, Congress put in place a temporary ban on any State or local \ntaxes on Internet access. Additionally, Congress placed a moratorium on \nmultiple or discriminatory State and local taxes on e-commerce \ntransactions to ensure the growth of online commerce. This moratorium \nwas extended in 2004, but is set to expire November 1, 2007. Our \nlegislation, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act of 2007, would make \nthe moratorium permanent.\n  Today, the U.S. ranks 12th in the world in per capita Internet \naccess, lagging behind competitors South Korea, the United Kingdom and \nCanada. This is absolutely unacceptable for a country that leads the \nworld in technical innovation, economic development, and international \ncompetitiveness. We certainly cannot afford to make Internet access \nmore difficult to obtain if we want to become more internationally \ncompetitive.\n  There is little doubt that the development and growth of the Internet \nwas aided by the tax moratorium. In 1998, the year the moratorium was \nfirst enacted, 36 percent of U.S. adults reported using the Internet. \nIn 2006, that number grew to 73 percent, an all time high according to \nan April 2006 Pew Internet & American Life Project Report. However, the \nreport also found that Americans in the lowest income households are \nconsiderably less likely to be online. Just 55 percent of adults living \nin households with less than $30,000 annual income go online, versus 73 \npercent of those whose income is between $30,000-$50,000. This \n``digital divide'' needs to be closed immediately. Continuing \nCongress's policy of reducing the cost of Internet access, by \npreventing the service from being taxed, is one step we can take now to \nclose the ``digital divide.''\n  As use of the Internet has grown, so has e-commerce. According to the \nmost recent comScore Networks report, Americans spent over $100 billion \non Internet purchases during 2006, a major milestone for retailers and \nthe World Wide Web. This legislation would ensure that online \ntransactions are not taxed by cities or States at a rate higher than \nother sales transactions. Again, the goal of this legislation is to \nmake the Internet affordable to all\n\n[[Page S149]]\n\nAmericans and foster the growth of the Internet.\n  With respect to the question of whether it is wise to make Internet \naccess tax free, Congress has a long history of giving tax incentives \nto commercial activities that we believe help our society. The Internet \nis a technology that is a source of and vehicle for significant \neconomic benefits. The proponents of this legislation strongly believe \nthe Internet clearly merits the tax incentives provided by this bill.\n  I recognize that there are some who wish to continue to make the \nInternet tax moratorium temporary. Their premise is that the Internet \nwill continue to evolve and thus Internet access may develop into a \nservice the States and localities would wish to tax. I believe that \nthis moratorium should be permanent to continue encouraging those very \nInternet-related innovations. By making the moratorium permanent, \nbusinesses that invest in and provide Internet access will be able to \noperate in a predictable tax environment. This will result in continued \ninvestment in this very important social, political and economic \nmedium.\n  Congress now has the opportunity to extend permanently the Internet \ntax moratorium and assure consumers that taxes will not inhibit the \noffering of affordable Internet access. By supporting this legislation, \nwe can continue to promote Internet usage by Americans as well as \nencourage innovation relating to this technology. For these reasons, I \nask my colleagues to support this pro-consumer, pro-innovation, and \npro-technology bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 158. A bill to expand access to affordable health care and to \nstrengthen the health care safety net and make health care services \nmore available in rural and underserved areas; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, in introducing the Access to \nAffordable Health Care Act, a comprehensive plan that builds on the \nstrengths of our current public programs and private health care system \nto make affordable health care available to millions more Americans.\n  One of my priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to \naffordable health care. There are still far too many Americans without \nhealth insurance or with woefully inadequate coverage. As many as 46 \nmillion Americans are uninsured, and millions more are underinsured.\n  Maine is in the midst of a growing health insurance crisis, with \ninsurance premiums rising at alarming rates. Whether I am talking to a \nself-employed fisherman, a displaced worker, the owner of a struggling \nsmall business, or the human resource manager of a large company, the \nsoaring costs of health insurance is a common concern.\n  These cost increases have been particularly burdensome for small \nbusinesses, the backbone of the Maine economy. Maine small business \nowners want to provide coverage for their employees, but they are \ncaught in a cost squeeze. They know that if they pass on premium \nincreases to their employees, more of them will decline coverage. Yet \nthese small businesses simply cannot afford to absorb double-digit \nincreases in their health insurance premiums year after year.\n  The problem of rising costs is even more acute for individuals and \nfamilies who must purchase health insurance on their own. Monthly \nhealth insurance premiums in Maine often exceed a family's mortgage \npayment. Clearly, we must do more to make health insurance more \navailable and affordable.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act, which we are introducing \ntoday, is a seven-point plan that combines a variety of public and \nprivate approaches. The legislation's seven goals are: one, to expand \naccess to affordable health care for small businesses; two, to make \nhealth insurance more affordable for individuals and families \npurchasing coverage on their own; three, to strengthen the health care \nsafety net for those without coverage; four, to expand access to care \nin rural and underserved areas; five, to increase access to affordable \nlong-term care; six to promote healthier lifestyles; and seven, to \nprovide more equitable Medicare payments to Maine providers to reduce \nthe Medicare shortfall, which has forced hospitals, physicians and \nother providers to shift costs onto other payers in the form of higher \ncharges, which in turn drives up health care premiums.\n  Let me discuss each of these seven points in greater detail.\n  First, our legislation will help small employers cope with rising \nhealth care costs.\n  Since most Americans get their health insurance through the \nworkplace, it is a common assumption that people without health \ninsurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that as many as 83 \npercent of Americans who do not have health insurance are in a family \nwith a worker.\n  Uninsured working Americans are most often employees of small \nbusinesses. In fact, some 63 per cent of uninsured workers are employed \nby small firms. Smaller firms generally face higher costs for health \ninsurance than larger firms, which makes them less likely to offer \ncoverage. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will help these \nemployers cope with rising costs by creating new tax credits for small \nbusinesses to make health insurance more affordable. It will encourage \nthose small businesses that do not offer health insurance to do so and \nwill help employers that do offer insurance to continue coverage for \ntheir employees even in the face of rising costs.\n  Our legislation will also provide grants to provide start-up funding \nto States to help businesses to form group purchasing cooperatives. \nThese cooperatives will enable small businesses to band together to \npurchase health insurance jointly. This will help to reduce their costs \nand improve the quality of their employee's health care.\n  The legislation would also authorize a Small Business Administration \ngrant program for States, local governments and non-profit \norganizations to provide information about the benefits of health \ninsurance to small employers, including tax benefits, increased \nproductivity of employees, and decreased turnover. These grants would \nalso be used to make employers aware of their current incentives under \nState and Federal laws. While costs are clearly a problem, many small \nemployers are simply not aware of laws that have already been enacted \nby both States and the Federal government to make health insurance more \naffordable. For example, in one survey, 57 percent of small employers \ndid not know that they could deduct 100 percent of their health \ninsurance premiums as a business expense.\n  The legislation would also create a new program to encourage \ninnovation by awarding demonstration grants in up to 10 States \nconducting innovative coverage expansions, such as alternative group \npurchasing or pooling arrangements, individual or small group market \nreforms, or subsidies to employers or individuals purchasing coverage. \nThe States have long been laboratories for reform, and they should be \nencouraged in the development of innovative programs that can serve as \nmodels for the Nation.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will also expand access to \naffordable health care for individuals and families. One of the first \nbills that I sponsored when I came to the Senate was legislation to \nestablish the State Child Health Insurance Program, which provides \ninsurance for the children of low-income parents who cannot afford \nhealth insurance, yet make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. \nSince 1997, this program, which is known as SCHIP, has contributed to a \none-third decline in the uninsured rate of low-income children. Today, \nover six million children--including approximately 14,500 in Maine--\nreceive health care coverage through this remarkably effective health \ncare program.\n  First, our legislation will shore up the looming shortfalls in SCHIP \nfunding that 17 states--including Maine--will face in Fiscal Year 2007 \nto ensure that children currently enrolled in the program do not lose \ntheir coverage. Just prior to adjournment in December, the Congress \napproved legislation to partially address these shortfalls. That \nlegislation, however, provides only about one-fifth of the funds \nneeded. Our legislation will close that gap.\n  Our legislation also builds on the success of the SCHIP program and \ngives States a number of new tools to increase participation. The bill \nauthorizes new grants for States and non-\n\n[[Page S150]]\n\nprofit organizations to conduct innovative outreach and enrollment \nefforts to ensure that all eligible children are covered. States would \nalso have the option of covering the parents of the children who are \nenrolled in programs like MaineCare. States could also use funds \nprovided through this program to help eligible working families pay \ntheir share of an employer-based health insurance plan. In short, the \nlegislation will help ensure that the entire family receives the health \ncare they need.\n  And finally, to help make health coverage more affordable for low and \nmiddle-income individuals and families who do not have employer-\nprovided coverage and who are not eligible for the expanded programs, \nour legislation would provide an advanceable, refundable tax credit of \nup to $1,000 for individuals earning up to $30,000 and up to $3,000 for \nfamilies earning up to $60,000. This could provide coverage for up to \nsix million Americans who would otherwise be uninsured for one or more \nmonths, and will help many more working lower-income families who \ncurrently purchase private health insurance with little or no \ngovernment help.\n  To strengthen our nation's health care safety net, the Access to \nAffordable Health Care Act calls for a doubling of funding over five \nyears for the Consolidated Health Centers program, which includes \ncommunity, migrant, public housing and homeless health centers.\n  These centers, which operate in underserved urban and rural \ncommunities, provide critical primary care services to millions of \nAmericans, regardless of their ability to pay. About 20 percent of the \npatients treated in Maine's community health centers have no insurance \ncoverage and many more have inadequate coverage, so these centers are a \ncritical part of our nation's health care safety net.\n  The problem of access to affordable health care services is not \nlimited to the uninsured, but is also shared by many Americans living \nin rural and underserved areas where there is a shortage of health care \nproviders. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act therefore calls for \nincreased funding for the National Health Service Corps, which supports \ndoctors, dentists, and other clinicians who serve in rural and inner \ncity areas.\n  The legislation will also give the program greater flexibility by \nallowing National Health Service Corps participants to fulfill their \ncommitment on a part-time basis. Current law requires all National \nHealth Service Corps participants to serve full-time. Many rural \ncommunities, however, simply do not have enough volume to support a \nfull-time health care practitioner. Moreover, some sites may not need a \nparticular type of provider on a full-time basis. Our bill therefore \ngives the program additional flexibility to meet community needs.\n  As the Senate co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Task Force on \nAlzheimer's Disease, I am particularly sensitive to the long-term care \nneeds of patients with chronic diseases like Alzheimer's and their \nfamilies.\n  Long-term care is the major catastrophic health care expense faced by \nolder Americans today, and these costs will only increase with the \naging of the baby boomers. Most Americans mistakenly believe that \nMedicare or their private health insurance policies will cover the \ncosts of long-term care should they develop a chronic illness or \ncognitive impairment like Alzheimer's Disease. Unfortunately, far too \nmany do not discover that they do not have coverage until they are \nconfronted with the difficult decision of placing a much-loved parent \nor spouse in long-term care and facing the shocking realization that \nthey will have to cover the costs themselves.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will provide a tax credit \nfor long-term care expenses of up to $3,000 to provide some help to \nthose families struggling to provide long-term care to a loved one. It \nwill also encourage more Americans to plan for their future long-term \ncare needs by providing a tax deduction to help them purchase long-term \ncare insurance.\n  Health insurance alone is not going to ensure good health. As noted \nauthor and physician Dr. Michael Crichton has observed, ``the future of \nmedicine lies not in treating illness, but preventing it.'' Many of our \nmost serious health problems are directly related to unhealthy \nbehaviors--smoking, lack of regular exercise, and poor diet. These \nthree major risk factors alone have made Maine the state with the \nfourth highest death rate due to four largely preventable diseases: \ncardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes. \nThese four chronic diseases are responsible for 70 percent of the \nhealth care problems in Maine.\n  Our bill therefore contains a number of provisions designed to \npromote healthy lifestyles. An ever-expanding body of evidence shows \nthat investments in health promotion and prevention offer returns not \nonly in reduced health care bills, but in longer life and increased \nproductivity. The legislation will provide grants to States to assist \nsmall businesses wishing to establish ``worksite wellness'' programs \nfor their employees. It would also authorize a grant program to support \nnew and existing ``community partnerships,'' such as the Healthy \nCommunity Coalition in Maine's Franklin County, to promote healthy \nlifestyles among hospitals, employers, schools and community \norganizations. And, it would provide funds for States to establish or \nexpand comprehensive school health education, including, for example, \nphysical education programs that promote lifelong physical activity, \nhealthy food service selections, and programs that promote a healthy \nand safe school environment.\n\n  And finally, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act would promote \ngreater equity in Medicare payments and help to ensure that the \nMedicare system rewards rather than punishes states like Maine that \ndeliver high-quality, cost-effective Medicare services to our elderly \nand disabled citizens.\n  The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and subsequent legislation did \ntake some significant steps toward promoting greater fairness by \nincreasing Medicare payments to rural hospitals and by modifying \ngeographic adjustment factors that discriminated against physicians and \nother providers in rural areas. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday will build on those improvements by establishing State pilot \nprograms that reward providers of high- quality, cost-efficient \nMedicare services.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act outlines a blueprint for \nreform based on principles upon which I believe a bipartisan majority \nin Congress could agree. The plan takes significant strides toward the \ngoal of universal health care coverage by bringing millions more \nAmericans into the insurance system and by strengthening the health \ncare safety net.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Main, Senator Collins, in introducing the Access to Affordable \nHealth Care Act. The latest available Census figures show that 46.6 \nmillion people in our country--including almost 19 percent of the \npeople in my home State of Louisiana--are without health insurance.\n  This statistic has been referred to so often in the media and in this \nbody that it is almost possible to hear it without realizing the full \nimpact of such uncertainty on one's day-to-day life. 46.6 million \npeople without health insurance means 36.3 million families struggling \nwith the knowledge that they may be just one hospitalization away from \nbankruptcy. It means 8.3 million children who may not be able to access \nthe care they need to prevent increasingly common and often \ndebilitating chronic illnesses such as diabetes and asthma, adversely \naffecting them for the rest of their lives. It means 27.3 million \nAmericans with jobs, who work everyday knowing that they still may not \nbe able to provide for their families in their time of need.\n  Across the country, small business owners and families are struggling \nwith the high cost of health care. This is particularly true in \nLouisiana and across the gulf coast, where recovery from the 2005 \nhurricanes has already placed heavy burdens on thousands of families \ntrying to rebuild and businesses working to reopen. Since 2000, the \nnumber of employees nationwide receiving health insurance through their \nemployers has actually decreased, reversing the progress we saw in the \n1990s. Small businesses create two out of every three new jobs in \nAmerica and account for nearly half of America's overall employment. \nYet only 26 percent of businesses with fewer than 50 employees can \noffer health insurance\n\n[[Page S151]]\n\nto their employees. The Access to Affordable Health Care Act gives the \nsmall businesses that are the backbone of this country the opportunity \nto help make their employees' lives just a little easier.\n  This legislation further provides for the expansion of the enormously \nsuccessful SCHIP program, allowing States to cover increased numbers of \npregnant women and poor, working adults. It allows for more community \nhealth centers and encourages health care providers to practice in the \nincreasingly underserved rural areas of all States. It gives businesses \nthe tools to not only insure their employees against illness but to \nencourage wellness, decreasing health care costs for everybody. It \nallows our government to reward States that find ways to improve health \noutcomes among Medicare patients, actively supporting the types of \ncost-efficient successes that improve the quality of life.\n  A country identified by its ingenuity and creativity has a moral \nresponsibility to do more than we have to provide its citizens with the \nability to keep their families safe and healthy. These comprehensive, \nreal steps forward will open new doors of opportunity and access to \naffordable health care for millions of American families and business \nowners, and I am proud to have partnered with Senator Collins in this \nimportant pursuit. I encourage my colleagues to consider this \nlegislation and to help provide our all our constituents with the peace \nof mind.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \n        Vitter):\n  S. 163. A bill to improve the disaster loan program at the Small \nBusiness Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, 16 months after Hurricane Katrina struck \nthe Gulf Coast, small business owners in New Orleans and across \nLouisiana are still struggling to keep their doors open and their \nemployees working. In those 16 months, I have worked with Senators \nSnowe, Landrieu, and Vitter to produce a comprehensive package to \nreform the SBA's Disaster Assistance program. The SBA's failed response \nin a time of unmatched need demonstrated to everyone that this program \nis broken and needs fixing.\n  Immediately after Hurricane Katrina hit, I introduced an amendment \nwith Senator Landrieu to the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice and \nScience appropriations bill to address the needs of Gulf Region small \nbusiness and homeowners. The amendment was adapted with input from \nChair Snowe, and a subsequent bipartisan amendment passed the Senate \nwith a vote of 96-0. Although the entire Senate supported the \namendment, it was stripped out of the bill in conference.\n  On September 30, 2005, I again worked with Chair Snowe and Senators \nLandrieu and Vitter to introduce a bipartisan proposal, the Small \nBusiness Hurricane Relief and Reconstruction Act of 2006 S. 1807. This \nproposal was opposed by the administration. In June, I introduced the \nSmall Business Disaster Loan Reauthorization and Improvements Act of \n2006, S. 3487 which once again attempted to comprehensively address the \nshortcomings of the SBA's Disaster Assistance program. Again, the \nadministration opposed this effort. In August, the Small Business \nCommittee unanimously reported S. 3778, the Small Business \nReauthorization and Improvements Act of 2006, which again put forward a \nbipartisan, comprehensive fix for this program. Finally, in December, \njust prior to the adjournment of the 109th Congress, yet another \nattempt was made at reaching a bipartisan consensus with the \nintroduction of S. 4097, the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan \nImprovements Act of 2006. The administration maintained its opposition \nto the fixes proposed in this bill.\n  Now, on the first day of this new Congress, I am introducing the \nSmall Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2007. \nOnce again, this bill enjoys bipartisan support by the chair and the \nranking minority member of the Small Business Committee, as well as by \nthe Democratic and Republican Senators of Louisiana, whose constituents \ncontinue to wait for their Government to respond appropriately. I am \nintroducing this bill on the first day of the 110th Congress because as \nthe incoming chair of the Small Business Committee, improving the \nDisaster Assistance program at the SBA is among my top priorities.\n  This bill includes directives for the SBA to create a private \ndisaster loan program, to allow for lenders to issue disaster loans. To \nensure that these loans are borrower-friendly, we provide authorization \nfor appropriations so that the agency can subsidize the interest rates. \nIn addition, the administrator is authorized to enter into agreements \nwith private contractors in order to expedite loan application \nprocessing for direct disaster loans.\n  The bill also includes language directing SBA to create an expedited \ndisaster assistance loan program to provide businesses with short-term \nloans so that they may keep their doors open until they receive \nalternative forms of assistance. The days immediately following a \ndisaster are crucial for business owners--statistics show that once \nthey close their doors, they likely will not open them again. These \nshort-term loans should help prevent those doors from closing.\n  A presidential declaration of Catastrophic National Disaster will \nallow the administrator to offer economic injury disaster loans to \nadversely affected business owners beyond the geographic reach of the \ndisaster area. In the event of a large-scale disaster, businesses \nlocated far from the physical reach of the disaster can be affected by \nthe magnitude of a localized destruction. We saw this when the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 affected businesses from coast \nto coast, and we saw it again with the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. \nShould another catastrophic disaster strike, the President should have \nthe authority to provide businesses across the country with access to \nthe same low-interest economic injury loans available to businesses \nwithin the declared disaster area.\n  Non-profit entities working to provide services to victims should be \nrewarded and given access to the capital they require to continue their \nservices. To this end, the administrator is authorized to make disaster \nloans to non-profit entities, including religious organizations.\n  Construction and rebuilding contracts being awarded are likely to be \nlarger than the current $2 million threshold currently applied to the \nSBA Surety Bond Program, which helps small construction firms gain \naccess to contracts. This bill increases the guarantee against loss for \nsmall business contracts up to $5 million and allows the administrator \nto increase that level to $10 million, if deemed necessary.\n  The bill also provides for Small Business Development Centers to \noffer business counseling in disaster areas, and to travel beyond \ntraditional geographic boundaries to provide services during declared \ndisasters. To encourage Small Business Development Centers located in \ndisaster areas to keep their doors open, the maximum grant amount of \n$100,000 is waived.\n  So that Congress may remain better aware of the status of the \nadministration's disaster loan program, this bill directs the \nadministration to report to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship of the Senate and to the Committee on Small Business \nof the House of Representatives regularly on the fiscal status of the \ndisaster loan program as well as the need for supplemental funding. The \nadiministration is also directed to report on the number of Federal \ncontracts awarded to small businesses, minority-owned small businesses, \nwomen-owned businesses, and local businesses during a disaster \ndeclaration.\n  Finally, gas prices continue to fluctuate, and fuel-dependent small \nbusinesses are struggling with the cost of energy. This bill provides \nrelief to small business owners during times of above average energy \nprice increases, authorizing energy disaster loans through the Small \nBusiness Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture \nto companies that are dependent on fuel.\n  In the 16 months since Katrina struck, I have visited New Orleans \nthree times. I have met with the lifeblood of that city--its small \nbusiness owners--the shopowners on Bourbon Street and on Magazine \nStreet who make that city unique. The people of New Orleans are \nresilient, and they remain hopeful; they are keeping their\n\n[[Page S152]]\n\nbusinesses open despite tourism that has been slow to return and \ndespite a government response that was painfully slow to arrive. \nSixteen months is too long a time to wait to reform and improve a \nprogram that could have breathed relief into this city's economy during \na time of desperation. As this new Congress begins, I call on my \ncolleagues to support this legislation, a bipartisan labor of more than \na year's worth of negotiations. The tools offered within this bill will \ngo a long way toward heading off another Katrina-like response to any \nfuture catastrophic disaster.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 163\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modernize the education system of the United \nStates; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few things are more indispensable to the \nUnited States than good schools. Today more than ever, a quality \neducation is the gateway to achieving the American dream and the best \nguarantee of equal opportunity for all our people, good citizenship, \nand an economy capable of mastering modern global challenges.\n  In 1965, as part of the War on Poverty, President Johnson signed into \nlaw the landmark Elementary and Secondary Education to strengthen \nAmerica by allocating substantial Federal resources to public schools \nfor the first time. In the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, \nwe reauthorized this landmark legislation, and for the first time made \na commitment that every child--black or white, Latino or Asian, native-\nborn or an English language learner, disabled or non-disabled--would be \npart of an accountability plan that holds schools responsible for the \nprogress of all students. It required every State to implement content \nand performance standards specifying what children should know and be \nable to do, and urged States to create high-quality assessments so that \nstudents' progress toward meeting those standards could be accurately \nmeasured. It expanded support for early reading and literacy skills and \noffered extra tutoring to students in struggling schools. It sought to \nimprove the quality of instruction by requiring all schools to provide \na highly-qualified teacher for every child.\n  We know these reforms can work. But good results are not possible \nwithout adequate investments. The No Child Left Behind Act recognized \nthat to move forward with these dramatic changes, schools would need a \ncontinued infusion of Federal resources, because the cost was obviously \ntoo great for States and local governments to bear alone.\n  Today, because of budget cuts and poor implementation, we still have \nmuch to do to ensure that no child is left behind. President Bush has \nshort-changed the promise made in the law by nearly $56 billion, \nleaving millions of children without the resources needed to reduce \nclass sizes, improve teaching, and set higher standards for our \nschools. Now, more than ever, it's important to deliver the resources \nour schools deserve. Thousands of schools are on watchlists in their \nStates and need Federal support and extra assistance to bridge the \nlearning gaps of their students.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act is again scheduled for reauthorization \nthis year, and we must work to ensure that its promise is fulfilled. \nAside from additional funding, one of our priorities must be to ensure \nthat the standards and assessments used to measure progress are fair \nand reliable. Accountability is only as good as the tests to measure \nprogress, and many States use tests that need substantial improvement. \nSome use exams that are not aligned to the standards that students must \nmeet. Others have manufactured artificially high test score gains by \nlowering standards and adjusting test scores in order to avoid \nunfavorable consequences under the law's accountability framework.\n  We need to shift our understanding of the Act away from the idea that \nit labels and penalizes schools, and toward a more productive framework \nthat helps schools and States reach higher, not lower. We should use \nthe well-regarded National Assessment of Educational Progress the \n``Nation's report card'' as a benchmark for the rigor of State exams. \nStates should also align their elementary and secondary school \nstandards with their standards for college entrance and success, \ncreating seamless systems that guide students from the beginning of \ntheir education to the achievement of a college degree.\n  The SUCCESS Act I am introducing today would assist States in these \nefforts. As the name suggests, it would provide Federal support for \nStates Using Collaboration and Cooperation to Enhance Standards for \nStudents. It would help ensure that public schools challenge all \nstudents to learn to high standards and provide needed help to schools \nwith the greatest needs.\n  The legislation updates the Nation's report card the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress to ensure that it sets a national \nbenchmark which is internationally competitive and is aligned with the \ndemands of the 21st century global economy. It expands our ability to \nmonitor science achievement. It requires the NAEP to measure student \npreparedness to enter college, the 21st century workforce, or the Armed \nServices. It also requires the Secretary of Education to examine the \ngaps in student performance on state-level assessments and NAEP \nassessments, and to assist States that wish to analyze how their \nstandards and assessments compare to the benchmark.\n  The SUCCESS Act provides critical resources to States to create ``P-\n16'' Preparedness Councils that will engage members of the early \nchildhood, K-12 and higher education communities, along with the \nbusiness and military communities, and other stakeholders to align the \nstandards with what is needed for success in college and the workforce. \nThe councils would be charged with ensuring that State\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\nstandards and assessments meet international benchmarks to improve \ninstruction and student achievement and prepare students to contribute \nin the global economy. It also provides funds to encourage \ncollaboration among States in raising the bar for student achievement \nby providing grants to States working together to establish common \nstandards and assessments that are rigorous, internationally \ncompetitive, and aligned with postsecondary demands.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this and other \nimportant proposals as we move toward the reauthorization of the No \nChild Left Behind Act. In the coming weeks, our Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions will hold a series of hearings and \nroundtable discussions to hear from experts and those dealing with the \nchallenges of the current law on a daily basis. Our goal is to work on \na bipartisan basis with all our colleagues in the Senate and in the \nHouse and with the Administration to develop a strong bipartisan bill \nthat builds on the positive aspects of the law, addresses the concerns \nabout its implementation, and encourages reforms that we know will work \nto help students succeed.\n  Teachers deserve the resources they need to help students achieve at \nhigher levels. In many schools, the most valuable resource that \nteachers require is time. Yet the U.S. ranks 11th among industrialized \nnations in the number of days children attend school. Innovative \napproaches are needed to extend the school day and year in high-need \nschools. We should recruit Americorps volunteers to coordinate \nacademically oriented extended-day programs for students and assist \nteachers during the school day.\n  We must also ensure that students in high poverty schools have access \nto good teachers. We should create incentives to attract the best \nteachers to the neediest schools, including increased salaries for \nteachers and principals with strong track records of success who work \nin hard-to-staff schools, and by creating ``career advancement \nsystems'' in which highly effective teachers serve as instructional \nleaders for new or less successful teachers. To help teachers improve \ntheir teaching, we should invest more in training them to use the best \ndata to improve instruction.\n  We should also help parents by replicating Boston's successful \ninitiative to place parent-family outreach coordinators in every high-\npoverty school, and offer grants to school districts to support \ncommunity programs that address children's social, emotional and other \nnon-academic needs.\n  We must invest in these and other reforms to give schools the \nresources they need to close the achievement gap and ensure that all \nstudents can stay on track to graduate and succeed.\n  Experience shows that each year yields greater success when \npolicymakers and educators commit in the long term to higher standards, \nbetter teacher training, stronger accountability, and extra help for \nstudents in need. The initial implementation of the No Child Left \nBehind Act has been flawed, but we can't abandon its vision of an \nAmerica in which every child is important and deserves to be educated \nand enjoy the full benefits of our society.\n  That vision is as enduring as America itself. As John Adams wrote in \nthe Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, the education of the people is \n``necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberty.'' More \nthan two hundred years later, we need to recapture that spirit, and \nmake ``No Child Left Behind'' a reality, not merely a slogan.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Throughout our Nation's history, the skills and \n     education of our workforce have been a major determinant of \n     the standard of living of the people of the United States.\n       (2) According to the most recent National Assessment of \n     Educational Progress, only 36 percent of the students in \n     grade 4 and 30 percent of the students in grade 8 reach the \n     proficient level in mathematics. In reading, only 31 percent \n     of the students in grades 4 and 8 reach the proficient level. \n     In science, only 29 percent of the students in grades 4 and 8 \n     reach the proficient level.\n       (3) A State-by-State comparison of the 2005 National \n     Assessment of Educational Progress average scale scores for \n     8th grade mathematics reveals that 31 States--more than \\1/2\\ \n     of the States in the Nation--scored more than 10 points \n     (about 1 grade level) below the highest scoring State, \n     Massachusetts.\n       (4) Student achievement in mathematics and science in \n     elementary school and secondary school in the United States \n     lags behind other nations, according to the Trends in \n     International Mathematics and Science study and other \n     studies, including the Programme for International Student \n     Assessment, that recently ranked United States secondary \n     school students 28th out of 40 first- and second-world \n     nations, and tied with Latvia, in mathematics performance and \n     problem solving.\n       (5) According to a report released in August, 2006, the \n     Nation loses more than $3,700,000,000 a year in the costs of \n     remedial education and in individuals' reduced earning \n     potential because students are not learning the basic skills \n     they need to succeed after high school.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To ensure students receive an education competitive \n     with other industrialized countries.\n       (2) To assist States in improving the rigor of standards \n     and assessments.\n       (3) To provide for the establishment of prekindergarten \n     through grade 16 student preparedness councils to better link \n     early childhood education and school readiness with \n     elementary school success, elementary student skills with \n     success in secondary school, and secondary student skills and \n     curricula, especially with respect to reading, mathematics, \n     and science, with the demands of higher education, the 21st \n     century workforce, and the Armed Forces, in order to ensure \n     that greater number of students, especially low-income and \n     minority students, complete secondary school with the \n     coursework and skills necessary to enter--\n       (A) credit-bearing coursework in higher education without \n     the need for remediation;\n       (B) high-paying employment in the 21st century workforce; \n     or\n       (C) the Armed Forces.\n       (4) To establish a system that encourages local educational \n     agencies to adopt a curriculum that meets State academic \n     content standards and student academic achievement standards \n     and prepares all students for success in elementary school, \n     secondary school, and post-secondary endeavors in the 21st \n     century.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to restrict any State from imposing a new \ndiscriminatory tax on cell phone services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nDeMint\n\n[[Page S164]]\n\nin introducing the Cell Phone Tax Moratorium Act of 2007. This bill \nwould put a stop to new discriminatory taxes on cell phone services for \na period of 3 years.\n  The average general sales tax in the U.S. today is around six \npercent, but the average State and local taxes and fees on cell phone \nservice comes in at about 17 percent. Consumers are left paying a hefty \nportion of their monthly cell phone bill to the Government for what \nmany believe is their most important communications device.\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures and the National \nGovernors' Association have issued policy positions calling for states \nto eliminate excessive and discriminatory taxes on communications \nservices. State and local governments have been working with the \ntelecommunications industry to find a solution to these excessive \ntaxes, but no agreement has been reached. During the three year \nmoratorium, it is my hope that State and local governments--in \ncooperation with industry--will work to eliminate discriminatory taxes \nand fees on wireless services.\n  Excessive taxes dampen innovation, and are regressive, hitting the \nmost vulnerable customers the hardest. Although more then 72 percent of \nall Americans own a cell phone, 26 percent said they could not live \nwithout it because it is their only communications source, according to \na recent Pew Internet and Life Project report. Cell phone only owners \nare often those who find it difficult to afford a wired and a wireless \nphone. Additionally, according to the same report, 74 percent of the \nAmericans say they have used their cell phone in an emergency and \ngained valuable assistance.\n  Some State and local governments cannot move beyond the idea that \nwireless services are some kind of luxury item that can be taxed at a \nhigher rate. These services may have been a luxury item many years ago, \nbut due to deregulation wireless services are more affordable than ever \nand even necessary for personal or business reasons. This is why it is \nperplexing that some states burden cell phone subscribers with taxes \nand fees that can be as high as 24 percent of a consumer's total bill.\n  Tax rates as high as this are generally associated with cigarettes \nand alcohol and known as ``sin taxes'' designed to reduce consumption. \nI cannot imagine it is the intention of states and localities to reduce \nconsumption of wireless services.\n  Mindful of the revenue requirements of States and localities, this \nbill does not eliminate existing discriminatory taxes. Nor does the \nbill prohibit states and localities from imposing new taxes on wireless \nservices that are not discriminatory. The bill simply puts a stop to \nthe creation of new discriminatory taxes on cell phone services.\n  Last year I introduced similar legislative language during a mark-up \nin the Senate Commerce Committee. The amendment passed with a vote 21-\n1. I am hopeful that this bill will once again be supported by the \nCommerce Committee and that it will be approved by the full Senate. I \nask my colleagues to join me in ending the discriminatory sales taxes \non this very popular communications service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 167. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to require the Secretary of \nEnergy to provide grants to eligible entities to carry out research, \ndevelopment, and demonstration projects of cellulosic ethanol and \nconstruct infrastructure that enables retail gas stations to dispense \ncellulosic ethanol for vehicle fuel to reduce the consumption of \npetroleum-based fuel; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Cellulosic \nEthanol Development and Implementation Act of 2007.\n   As a Nation, we should be striving for greater energy independence \nand for more environmentally friendly sources of fuel for our \nautomobiles. Cellulosic ethanol is fuel ethanol made from glucose, a \nsugar derived from the cellolose in biomass. It is chemically identical \nto ethanol made from food crops like corn and sugar cane. Cellulosic \nethanol is more difficult to make, because cellulose is a tough \nstructural material that gives plants their strength.\n  However, making ethanol from cellulose lets us tap into a much larger \nsource of sugars, and, therefore, potentially make much larger amounts \nof fuel ethanol, tens of billions of gallons or more. An additional \nbenefit is that cellulosic ethanol made from biomass is likely to \nproduce smaller amounts of greenhouse gases than corn ethanol, and far \nless greenhouse gases than gasoline it will replace. With continued \ntechnology improvements, it should be cheaper than gasoline. Because it \nis locally made, it reduces the need for oil imports.\n  An April 2005 study by the Department of Energy and Agriculture \nindicates that the country currently has a supply of biomass sufficient \nto displace 30 percent of the country's present petroleum use.\n  I am introducing this bill because I believe we should be doing more \nto harness our Nation's cellulosic ethanol potential. I have been a \nstrong proponent of using alternative transportation fuels and \nefficiency measures to reduce oil dependence. Last Congress, we took a \ngood first step in the development of cellulosic ethanol. The Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005, known as EPAct 05, requires that at least one-third \nof the Nation's ethanol be produced from cellulose by 2013.\n  In addition, EPAct 05 also created a new ethanol section of the Clean \nAir Act (Section 212). In that section, one subsection, section 212(e), \nincludes language I authored to establish a new cellulosic production \nconversion assistance grant program. That program, housed at the \nDepartment of Energy, provides financial assistance to encourage the \nbuilding of new cellulosic facilities in the U.S. The program was \nauthorized to receive $250 million in fiscal year 2006 and $400 million \nin fiscal year 2007.\n  Though Congress has taken the steps I've just described, I believe we \ncan and should do more, and the bill I introduce today does just that.\n  It would add two new cellulosic ethanol programs to the Clean Air \nAct. The first is a new competitive grant program for cellulosic motor \nvehicle fuel research and demonstration projects. Funded at $1 billion \nover 6 years, universities, Federal and State research labs, private \nindustry, nonprofit groups, or partnerships between any of these \ngroups, would be able to compete for funds.\n  My bill would also create a new pilot program for the installation of \nethanol fuel pumps at gas stations or any other needed infrastructure \nrequired to dispense ethanol fuel, such as a storage tank, for example. \nFunded at $1 billion over 6 years, the same entities that would \nparticipate in the research section of the bill would also be able to \ncompete for funds under this program. Successful applicants would have \nto provide 20 percent of the grant in matching funds.\n  Finally, my bill also extends the authorization for the original \ncellulosic grant program that is currently authorized in EPAct 05. The \nauthorization expires at the end of this year, and the bill I introduce \ntoday would extend it at $400 million per year thru 2010. This \nextension will ensure the program continues.\n  As Chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I believe \nthat our Nation's energy policy must focus on conservation, \nimprovements in energy efficiency, and the development of clean, \nrenewable energy technology. I continue to support measures to \naccomplish these goals, including the promotion of cellulosic ethanol. \nI believe this bill is an important next step in achieving these \nobjectives. I ask content that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 167\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in the Pikes Peak Region of \nColorado; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am reintroducing legislation to \nestablish a National Veteran's Cemetery in the Pikes Peak Region of \nColorado in order to meet the needs of veterans in southern Colorado. \nThis legislation is similar to what I have introduced and supported in \nthe past, and seeks to fill a void for many veterans and their \nfamilies. Colorado's fifth Congressional District contains the third \nhighest concentration of military retirees in the nation. Recent \nestimates show that there are as many as 175,000 veterans in the area, \nwhen including all of southern Colorado. This legislation will allow \nthousands of eligible southern Colorado military personnel, both active \nduty and retired as well as the many veterans living in the area, to \nhave a chance to find their final resting place in the region so many \nof them have come to love and appreciate.\n  This legislation has been influenced by the growing military retiree \nand veterans populations in the Pikes Peak region as well as community \nleaders and local Veterans Service Organizations who have repeatedly \nbrought this issue to my attention over the last several years. It is \nimportant to note the passion and perseverance of those that have \nsupported a National Veterans Cemetery and have worked tirelessly on \nthe issue. This legislation is truly citizen-generated and is a \ntestament to the dedication of veterans in the community.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 169. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to clarify \nFederal authority relating to land acquisition from willing sellers for \nthe majority of the trails in the System, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the National Trails System Willing Seller \nAct will pave the way for the completion of our Nation's most \noutstanding national trails. The legislation will amend the National \nTrails System Act of 1968 to make clear that the Federal Government may \npurchase land to complete several national trails from willing sellers. \nThe legislation specifically names nine trails that are spread across \nthe nation. The Continental Divide trail, stretching from Mexico \nthrough Colorado to the Canadian border, is among the trails that await \ncompletion.\n  I was successful in gaining Senate passage of this legislation in the \n108th Congress and am hopeful that both the House and Senate will act \non the bill this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. COBURN):\n  S. 171. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 301 Commerce Street in Commerce, Oklahoma, as the \n``Mickey Mantle Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague, Tom \nCoburn, to proudly introduce legislation to designate the facility of \nthe United States Postal Service located at 301 Commerce Street in \nCommerce, OK as the ``Mickey Mantle Post Office.''\n  Mickey Mantle emulates the Oklahoma spirit of hard work, charity, and \nsportsmanship. He is a shining example of how commitment and dedication \ncan lead to great success. I seek to name the post office in Commerce, \nOklahoma, in Mickey Mantle's honor. He is still known to Commerce by \nthe nicknames ``Commerce Comet'' or ``Commerce Kid''.\n  At age 4, Mickey Mantle moved with his family to Commerce where he \ngrew up, having been born in Spavinaw, OK. By his father who was an \namateur player and fervent fan, Mickey Mantle was named in honor of \nMickey Cochrane, the Hall of Fame catcher from the Detroit Tigers.\n  Signing with the New York Yankees in 1949, Mantle made his Major \nLeague Debut in 1951. He played his entire Major League career with the \nYankees. He was a twenty-time All Star and named American League MVP \nthree times. Mantle was a part of 12 pennant winners and 7 World \nChampionship clubs. Some of Mantle's records still hold today. He holds \nthe record for most World Series home runs 18, runs batted in 40, runs \n42, walks 43, extra-base hits 26, and total bases 123.\n  Mantle announced his retirement on March 1, 1969. In actually retired \non Mickey Mantle Day, June 8, 1969. In addition to the retirement of \nhis uniform number 7, Mantle was given a plaque that would hang on the \ncenter field wall at Yankee Stadium, near the monuments to Babe Ruth, \nLou Gehrig and Miller Huggins. In 1974, as soon as he was eligible, he \nwas inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame demonstrating his \nimportance to baseball and community.\n  Sadly, Mickey Mantle's father died of cancer at the age of 39, just \nas his son was starting his career. Mantle said one of the great \nheartaches of his life was that he never told his father he loved him.\n  After a bout with liver cancer himself, Mickey Mantle was given a few \nprecious extra weeks of life due to a liver transplant. The baseball \ngreat was overwhelmed by the selfless gift of a liver from a stranger; \ntherefore, Mickey became determined to give something back at the end \nof his life. Thus, in 1995, the year he died, the Mickey Mantle \nFoundation was established to promote organ and tissue donation, and \nMickey Mantle will be remembered for something more than his heroic \nbaseball career.\n\n[[Page S166]]\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation \nas we commemorate an outstanding athlete so that future generations \nwill be as inspired by his example of sportsmanship and charity as we \nhave been.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. DeMint):\n  S. 173. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish Medicare Health Savings Accounts; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to establish Medicare \nHealth Savings Account, HSAs. This bill will make HSAs available under \nMedicare in lieu of Medicare Medical Savings Account, MSAs. I have long \nbeen dedicated to quality health care and believe that seniors should \nhave the ability to make their own decisions regarding their health \ncare, so they can receive the health care they need and deserve. As a \nsenior myself, I appreciate how imperative it is that we seniors be \nprovided with a wide array of choices.\n  My desire to see my fellow Oklahomans and all Americans receive the \nbest possible health care is evidenced by my involvement in various \nhealth-related issues. I have always been a champion of rural health \ncare providers. In 1997, I was one of the few Republicans to vote \nagainst the Balanced Budget Act because of its lack of support for \nrural hospitals. At that time, I made a commitment to not allow our \nrural hospitals to be closed and am pleased we finally addressed that \nimportant issue in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 by providing \ngreat benefits for rural health care providers as well as a voluntary \nprescription drug benefit to seniors. In 2003, I also co-sponsored the \nHealth Care Access and Rural Equity Act, to protect and preserve access \nof Medicare beneficiaries to health care in rural regions.\n  In order to assist my State and other States suffering from large \nreduction in their Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP for \nMedicaid, I introduced a bill in the 109th Congress to apply a State's \nFMAP from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal years 2006 through 2014. The \npurpose of this legislation is to prevent drastic reductions in FMAP \nwhile revision of the formula itself is considered.\n  I am a strong advocate of medical liability reform and have \nconsistently been an original cosponsor of the Medical Care Access \nProtection Act and the Healthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to \nCare Act. These bills protect patients' access to quality and \naffordable health care by reducing the effects of excessive liability \ncosts. I am committed to this vital reform that would alleviate the \nburden placed on physicians and patients by excessive medical \nmalpractice lawsuits.\n  I have also worked with officials from the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS to expand access to life-saving Implantable \nCardiac Defibrillators and many other numerous regulations that would \naffect my rural State such as the 250 yard-rule for Critical Access \nHospitals.\n  As a supporter of safety and medical research, I have co-sponsored \nlegislation to increase the supply of pancreatic islet cells for \nresearch and a bill to take the abortion pill RU-486 off the market in \nthe United States.\n  In response to the shortages of flu vaccines experienced in years \npast, I introduced the Flu Vaccine Incentive Act to help prevent any \nfuture shortages in flu vaccines in both the 108th and 109th \nCongresses. My bill removed suffocating price controls from government \npurchasing of the flu vaccine while encouraging more companies to enter \nthe market. Also, my bill freed American companies to enter the flu \nvaccine industry by giving them an investment tax credit towards the \nconstruction of flu vaccine production facilities.\n  As a result of my sister's death from cancer and a treatment we \nlearned about not accessible in the United States that might have saved \nher life, Senator Sam Brownback and I introduced the Access, \nCompassion, Care and Ethics for Seriously-ill Patients Act, ACCESS, in \nthe 109th Congress. This bill offered a three-tiered approval system \nfor treatments showing efficacy during clinical trials, for use by the \nseriously ill patient population. Seriously ill patients, who have \nexhausted all alternatives and are seeking new treatment options, would \nbe offered access to these treatments with the consent of their \nphysician. I was pleased to learn that the Food and Drug Administration \nhas announced a proposal to offer expanded access to drugs to \nterminally ill patients.\n  My resolution to designate April 8, 2006, as ``National Cushing's \nSyndrome Awareness Day'' was passed by unanimous consent in the 109th \nCongress. The intent of this resolution is to raise awareness of \nCushing's Syndrome, a debilitating disorder that affects an estimated \n10 to 15 people per million. It is an endocrine or hormonal disorder \ncaused by prolonged exposure of the body's tissue to high levels of the \nhormone cortisol.\n  It was brought to my attention thanks to a staffer with Celiac \nDisease and an Oklahoma Celiac Support Group that there is a great need \nto raise awareness of celiac disease; therefore, I worked to get my \nresolution passed by unanimous consent to designate September 13, 2006 \nas National Celiac Disease Awareness Day. Celiac disease is an \nautoimmune disorder and a malabsorption disease that affects an \nestimated 2.2 million Americans. Celiac disease is, essentially, \nintolerance to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, oats and barley, \nas well as some medicines and vitamins.\n  Additionally, I have consistently co-sponsored yearly resolutions \ndesignating a day in October as ``National Mammography Day'' and a week \nin August as ``National Health Center Week'' to raise awareness \nregarding both these issues and have supported passage and enactment of \nnumerous health-care-related bills, such as the Rural Health Care \nCapital Access Act of 2006, which extends the exemption respecting \nrequired patient days for critical access hospitals under the federal \nhospital mortgage insurance program.\n  As the Federal Government invests in improving hospitals and \nhealthcare initiatives, I have fought hard to ensure that Oklahoma gets \nits fair share. Specifically, over the past 3 years, I have helped to \nsecure $5.2 million in funding for the Oklahoma Medical Research \nFoundation, the Oklahoma State Department of Health planning initiative \nfor a rural telemedicine system, the INTEGRIS Healthcare System, the \nUniversity of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, the Oklahoma Center for \nthe Advancement of Science and Technology, St. Anthony's Heart \nHospital, the Hillcrest Healthcare System, and the Morton Health \nCenter.\n  As a long supporter of HSAs, I believe all people should have access \nto them since they provide great flexibility in the health market and \nallow individuals to have control over their own health care. Medicare \nMSAs have existed since January 1, 1997, revised in December of 2003, \nbut they have not worked. No insurer whatsoever has yet offered any \nMedicare MSA under the current law. To fix this problem, my legislation \ncreates a new HSA program under Medicare that incorporates a high \ndeductible health plan and an HSA account while dissolving the existing \nMedicare MSA.\n  In tandem with my efforts, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nService, CMS, are launching an HSA demonstration project that would \ntest allowing health insurance companies to offer Medicare \nbeneficiaries products similar to HSA. This activity points to the \nAdministration's support of HSAs and desire to see all seniors receive \nthe best possible coverage.\n  As the July 13, 2006 edition of The Hill, explains, ``no legislation \nis pending that would integrate HSAs into the Medicare program .  .  \n.'' Thus, my legislation is necessary because real Medicare HSA reform \nis needed in order for seniors to have true flexibility and freedom of \nchoice in their health care.\n  Under my bill, beneficiaries who choose the HSA option will receive \nan annual amount that is equal to 95 percent of the annual Medicare \nAdvantage, MA, capitation rate with respect to the individual's MA \npayment area. These funds provided through the Medicare HSA program can \nonly be used by the beneficiary for the following purposes: as a \ncontribution into an HSA or for payment of high deductible health plan \npremiums. However, the individual also has the opportunity to deposit \npersonal funds in to the Medicare HSA.\n\n[[Page S167]]\n\n  My bill also guarantees that seniors be notified of the amount they \nwill receive 90 days before receipt to ensure they have time to \ndetermine the best and most appropriate HSA to accommodate needs. The \nbill also allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to deal \nwith fraud appropriately and requires providers to accept payment by \nindividuals enrolled in a Medicare HSA just as they would with an \nindividual enrolled in traditional Medicare.\n  Please join me in supporting this important legislation to give our \nseniors more choices regarding their health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 174. A bill to amend the Head Start Act to require parental \nconsent for nonemergency intrusive physical examinations; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation requiring parental \nconsent for intrusive physical exams administered under the Head Start \nprogram.\n  Young children attending Head Start programs should not be subjected \nto these intrusive physical exams without the prior knowledge or \nconsent of their parents. While the Department of Health and Human \nServices has administered general exam guidelines to agencies, the U.S. \nCode is not clear about prohibiting them without parental consent. To \nclarify the Code, my bill will not allow any non-emergency intrusive \nexam by a Head Start agency without parental consent. This would not \ninclude exams such as hearing, vision or scoliosis screenings.\n  This issue was brought to my attention by some of my constituents \nfrom Tulsa, OK, who felt their rights were violated when their children \nwere subjected to genital exams and blood tests without their consent. \nI am pleased to see that the Rutherford Institute has taken an interest \nin this crucial issue and are representing my constituents.\n  As a father and grandfather, I believe it is vital for parents to be \ninformed about what is happening to their children in the classroom. I \nhope that my colleagues will join me in support of this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \n        Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 180. A bill to provide a permanent deduction for State and local \ngeneral sales taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \npermanently correct an injustice in the tax code that has harmed \ncitizens in many States of this great Nation.\n  State and local governments have various alternatives for raising \nrevenue.\n  Some levy income taxes, some use sales taxes, and others use a \ncombination of the two. The citizens who pay State and local income \ntaxes have been able to offset some of their federal income taxes by \nreceiving a deduction for those State and local income taxes. Before \n1986, taxpayers also had the ability to deduct their sales taxes.\n  The philosophy behind these deductions is simple: people should not \nhave to pay taxes on their taxes. The money that people must give to \none level of Government should not also be taxed by another level of \nGovernment.\n  Unfortunately, citizens of some States were treated differently after \n1986 when the deduction for State and local sales taxes was eliminated. \nThis discriminated against those living in States, such as my home \nState of Texas, with no income taxes. It is important to remember the \nlack of an income tax does not mean citizens in these States do not pay \nState taxes; revenues are simply collected differently.\n  It is unfair to give citizens from some States a deduction for the \nrevenue they provide their State and local governments, while not doing \nthe same for citizens from other States. Federal tax law should not \ntreat people differently on the basis of State residence and differing \ntax collection methods, and it should not provide an incentive for \nStates to establish income taxes over sales taxes.\n  This discrepancy had a significant impact on Texas. According to the \nTexas Comptroller, the sales tax deduction saves a family of four $310 \na year, or a total of about $1 billion each year for the State's \nresidents who itemize deductions. The ability of taxpayers to deduct \ntheir sales taxes will lead to the creation of more than 16,500 new \njobs and the addition of $920 million in State economic activity.\n  Recognizing the inequity in the tax code, Congress reinstated the \nsales tax deduction in 2004 and authorized it for two years. Last year, \nwe extended the sales tax deduction for an additional two years. As a \nresult of our efforts, the 55 million of us in the eight States with a \nsales tax but no income tax are no longer discriminated against in the \ntax code. Unfortunately, the deduction is only in effect through 2007, \nand we must act to prevent the inequity from returning.\n  The legislation I am offering today will fix this problem for good by \nmaking the State and local sales tax deduction permanent. This will \npermanently end the discrimination suffered by my fellow Texans and \ncitizens of other States who do not have the option of an income tax \ndeduction.\n  This legislation is about reestablishing equity to the tax code and \ndefending the important principle of eliminating taxes on taxes. Last \nyear, the Senate voted 75-25 to instruct conferees to make this \ndeduction permanent. I hope my fellow Senators will once again support \nthis effort and pass this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Ensign, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \n        Stevens, and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 181. A bill to provide permanent tax relief from the marriage \npenalty; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nprovide permanent tax relief from the marriage penalty--the most \negregious, anti-family provision that has been in the tax code. One of \nmy highest priorities in the United States Senate has been to relieve \nAmerican taxpayers of this punitive burden.\n  We have made important strides to eliminate this unfair tax and \nprovide marriage penalty relief by raising the standard deduction and \nenlarging the 15 percent tax bracket for married joint filers to twice \nthat of single filers. Before these provisions were changed, 44 million \nmarried couples, including 2.4 million Texas families, paid an average \npenalty of $1,480.\n  Enacting marriage penalty relief was a giant step for tax fairness, \nbut it may be fleeting. Even as married couples use the money they now \nsave to put food on the table and clothes on their children, a tax \nincrease looms in the future. Since the 2001 tax relief bill was \nrestricted, the marriage penalty provisions will only be in effect \nthrough 2010. In 2011, marriage will again be a taxable event and 43 \npercent of married couples will again pay more in taxes unless we act \ndecisively. Given the challenges many families face in making ends \nmeet, we must make sure we do not backtrack on this important reform.\n  The benefits of marriage are well established, yet, without marriage \npenalty relief, the tax code provides a significant disincentive for \npeople to walk down the aisle. Marriage is a fundamental institution in \nour society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living \nin a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or to \nsuffer from child abuse. Research indicates these children are also \nless likely to be depressed or have developmental problems. Scourges \nsuch as adolescent drug use are less common in married families, and \nmarried mothers are less likely to be victims of domestic violence.\n  We should celebrate marriage, not penalize it. The bill I am offering \nwould make marriage penalty relief permanent, because marriage should \nnot be a taxable event. I call on the Senate to finish the job we \nstarted and make marriage penalty relief permanent today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Leahy, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 182. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to \nimprove\n\n[[Page S168]]\n\nthe ability of State and local governments to prevent the abduction of \nchildren by family members, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nHutchison, Feingold, Leahy, Snowe, Kennedy and Durbin in reintroducing \nthe ``Family Abduction Prevention Act,'' a bill to help the thousands \nof children who are abducted by a family member each year.\n  We introduced this legislation last Congress, and it passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent, but unfortunately, the bill was never \ntaken up by the House. This is important and needed legislation.\n  Family abductions are the most common form of abduction, yet they \nreceive little attention, and law enforcement agencies too often don't \ntreat them as the serious crimes that they are--too often dismissing \nthe seriousness of these cases as family disputes.\n  The Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2007 would provide grants to \nStates for the costs associated with family abduction prevention. \nSpecifically, it would assist States with costs associated with the \nextradition of individuals suspected of committing the crime of family \nabduction, costs borne by State and local law enforcement agencies to \ninvestigate cases of missing children, training for local and State law \nenforcement agencies in responding to family abductions, outreach and \nmedia campaigns to educate parents on the dangers of family abductions, \nand assistance to public schools to help with costs associated with \n``flagging'' school records.\n  Each year, over 200,000 children--78 percent of all abductions in the \nUnited States--are kidnapped by a family member, usually a non-\ncustodial parent.\n  More than half of the abducting parents have a history of domestic \nviolence, substance abuse, or a criminal record.\n  Unfortunately, many State and local law enforcement agencies \nfrequently treat these abductions as personal, family disputes. \nApproximately 70 percent of law enforcement agencies lack written \nguidelines on responding to family abduction and many are not informed \nabout the Federal laws available to help in the search and recovery of \nan abducted child.\n  Too often law enforcement assumes that a child is not in grave danger \nif the abductor is a family member. Unfortunately, this is not always \ntrue, and this assumption can endanger a child's life. Research has \nshown that the most common motive in family abduction cases is revenge \nagainst the other parent--not love for the child.\n  The effects of family abduction on children are often traumatic. \nAbducted children suffer from severe separation anxiety. To break \nemotional ties with the left-behind parent, some abductors will coach a \nchild into falsely disclosing abuse by the other parent to perpetuate \ntheir control during or after the abduction. And in many cases, the \nchild is told that the other parent is dead or did not really love \nthem.\n  For example, on Takeroot.org, a website devoted to the victims of \nfamily abductions, a young lady named Kelly told the story of how her \nparents were going through a bitter divorce and custody battle when she \nwas nine, and her brother was six. Her dad picked them up for a regular \nvisit, but then just kept on driving.\n  Kelly says, ``If I close my eyes, I can still see my mother waving \ngoodbye as we watched her from the rear window of our father's truck. . \n. . Little did we know that it would be close to a year before we would \nsee her again.''\n  Days later, Kelly started asking her father why they were continuing \nto drive--and why they were sleeping in the truck. After a while, her \nfather finally broke his silence and screamed at her that her mother \nhad given him the children because she didn't love them and that they \nwould just have to learn to deal with it.\n  For the next eleven months, they lived like fugitives on the run, \noften dirty and hungry, ``with very little money and even less love,'' \naccording to Kelly. ``We left in the middle of the night, never saying \ngoodbye to friends we may have made or people we met. I still see those \npeople in my mind's eye. I miss them. . . . Mostly, I miss the child I \nwas, the child I lost.''\n  The harm caused by these abductions cannot easily be put into words. \nIn many family abduction cases, children are given new identities at an \nage when they are still developing a sense of who they are. In extreme \ncases, the child's gender is masked to further avoid detection.\n  Abducting parents also often deprive their children of education and \nmuch-needed medical attention to avoid the risk of being tracked via \nschool or medical records.\n  As the child adapts to a fugitive's lifestyle, deception becomes an \nintegral part of their life. The child is taught to fear those that one \nwould normally trust, such as police, doctors, teachers and counselors. \nEven after recovery, the child often has a difficult time growing into \nadulthood.\n  In some cases, the abducting parent leaves the child with strangers, \nor locations where their health, safety, and other basic needs may be \nextremely compromised.\n  For example, in Lafayette, CA, two girls abducted by their mother \nended up under the control of a convicted child molester. When Kelli \nNunez absconded with her daughters, 6-year-old Anna and 4-year-old \nEmily, in violation of court custody orders, she drove her daughters \ncross-country, and then returned by plane to San Francisco, where she \nhanded the children to someone holding a coded sign at the airport.\n  The person holding the sign belonged to a helpful-sounding \norganization called the California Family Law Center--but the \norganization was actually led by Florencio Maning, a convicted child \nmolester. For six months, Maning orchestrated the concealment of the \nNunez girls with help from other people.\n  Luckily, police were able to track down the girls, and they were \nsuccessfully reunited with their father. That success may have been due \nto the fact that California has been the Nation's leader in fighting \nfamily abduction.\n  In my State, we have a system that places the responsibility for the \ninvestigation and resolution of family abduction cases with the County \nDistrict Attorney's Office. Each California County District Attorney's \nOffice has an investigative unit that is focused on family abduction \ncases. These investigators only handle family abduction cases and \nbecome experts in the process.\n  However, most States lack the training and resources to effectively \nrecover children who are kidnapped by a family member. According to a \nstudy conducted by Plass, Finkelhor and Hotaling, 62 percent of parents \nsurveyed said they were ``somewhat'' or ``very'' dissatisfied with \npolice handling of their family abduction cases.\n  The ``Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2007'' would be an important \nfirst step in addressing this serious issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation, just as you \ndid in the 109th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 183. A bill to require the establishment of a corporate average \nfuel economy standard for passenger automobiles of 40 miles per gallon \n2017, and for other purpose; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the bill that I introduce today features \nlanguage that would remove the legal ambiguity that for years has \ninhibited the Secretary of Transportation from raising fuel economy \nstandards for passenger cars, and the measure would mandate that a fuel \neconomy standard for passenger cars be set at 40 miles per gallon by \nmodel year 2017. By providing authority to increase standards for \npassenger cars, and requiring a specific fuel economy standard target, \nthis bill would provide consumers with fuel savings at the pump, limit \nthe Nation's dependence on foreign oil, and significantly reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  The bill would remove from the current Corporate Average Fuel Economy \n(CAFE) statute the requirement that the Secretary of Transportation \nsubmit to Congress any proposal to increase or decrease fuel economy \nstandards. This requirement has been deemed unconstitutional by the \nU.S. Supreme Court. This legal hurdle, coupled with years of Federal \nfunding legislation precluding the Secretary from reviewing CAFE, has \nprevented increases in fuel economy in the domestic passenger vehicle \nfleet.\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\n  The Secretary recently completed a dramatic reform of the fuel \neconomy standards for the light-truck fleet, and he might have made \nsimilar reforms to the passenger fleet but for the statutory ambiguity \nof the current CAFE statute. I applaud the Secretary for his recent \nCAFE increases for light trucks, and I commend the administration for \nits seven light truck CAFE increases in the last six years. But the \ntime has come for the Secretary to increase fuel economy standards for \npassenger cars as well.\n  In 2000, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) issued a report that \nconcluded that the benefits resulting from CAFE since its \nimplementation in 1978 clearly warrant Government intervention to \nensure fuel economy levels beyond what may result from market forces \nalone. The NAS panel found that CAFE has led to marked improvements in \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, fuel consumption, and dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  Mr. President, the United States imports almost 11 million barrels of \ncrude oil every day, compared with only five million produced here at \nhome. And over two million imported barrels hail from the Persian Gulf \nregion. The terrorist attacks waged on this country on September 11, \n2001, and the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East has brought into focus \nthe need to reduce our dependence on all foreign oil. The savings \nachieved by increasing fuel economy standards for the entire U.S. \npassenger vehicle fleet is essential if we are to increase our energy \nindependence and national security.\n  This bill also would require the Secretary of Commerce to create a \nnational registry system that, for the first time, would enable the \nautomobile industry to trade fuel economy credits with other industries \nthat generate greenhouse gas emissions. Participation in the registry \nwould be voluntary, and any entity conducting business in the United \nStates would be eligible to utilize the services of the registry. \nTherefore, automobile manufacturers would be able to contribute or \npurchase emissions credits with other industries that generate \ngreenhouse gases in order to achieve compliance with CAFE and emissions \nstandards.\n  Mr. President, any change to fuel economy standards requires the \ncareful balance of many factors, including national security, consumer \npreference, domestic employment, as well as the need for powerful and \ndurable vehicles in rural America, including my home State of Alaska. \nThe amendment would provide the Secretary the authority to balance \nthese considerations, and to make the appropriate and necessary fuel \neconomy increases. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 183\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Pryor, Mr. Carper, Mr. Biden, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Clinton, and \n        Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 184. A bill to provide improved rail and surface transportation \nsecurity; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, last year we made significant improvements \nto the Nation's transportation security system by enacting the SAFE \nPort Act, which strengthened the security of our Nation's ports and \nmaritime vessels. Yet, during the conference on this important bill, \nthe Congress failed to seize the opportunity to enact comprehensive \ntransportation security legislation that would have provided real \nhomeland security for our entire transportation system. The Senate-\npassed version of the SAFE Port Act contained essential provisions that \nwould have strengthened security in all of the surface modes of \ntransportation, including passenger and freight rail, public transit, \ntrucking, intercity bus and pipelines. But jurisdictional infighting \nand a lack of political will kept the leadership of the House of \nRepresentatives from agreeing to, or even attempting to consider, these \nprovisions in conference.\n  Given the urgent need for surface transportation security \nimprovements, Cochairman Stevens and I are introducing the Surface \nTransportation and Rail Security Act of 2007, or STARS Act, to once \nagain offer the Congress an opportunity to enact a comprehensive \ntransportation security bill. We have all seen the possible \nconsequences of an attack on critical surface transportation systems in \nMadrid and London. We have all heard about possible threats and foiled \nplots aimed at our rail tunnels and stations here at home. The time has \ncome for us to address these vulnerabilities and risks in a \ncomprehensive and coordinated way that ensures that in the rush to \nprotect one mode of transportation we don't shift vulnerability towards \nother, less secure, transportation modes.\n  The STARS Act combines the rail, truck, bus, pipeline and hazardous \nmaterials security provisions that were included in the Senate-passed \nSAFE Port Act into a stand-alone bill, which the Commerce Committee \nwill soon consider. These provisions were endorsed unanimously by the \nSenate during consideration of the SAFE Port Act, and the House of \nRepresentatives overwhelmingly voted to instruct its conferees to \ninclude these provisions in the Conference Report--advice the House \nleadership declined to accept. Additionally, the rail security portion \nof this package has already passed the Senate twice in prior Congresses \nand has been endorsed by railroads and rail labor alike. This kind of \nsupport demonstrates both the necessity of these improvements and the \ndistinct possibility that we can finally enact these provisions into \nlaw this Congress.\n  The legislation that we introduce today reflects the Commerce \nCommittee's substantial expertise over the issues of transportation \nsecurity. The time has come to advance these improvements, and protect \nthe vital surface transportation assets that grant us the quality of \nlife and economic health that we all cherish. Our legislation presents \nan opportunity to make immediate progress on transportation security, \nand it is my sincere hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting \nconsideration and passage of this measure as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 184\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CERTAIN PERSONNEL LIMITATIONS NOT TO APPLY.\n\n       Any statutory limitation on the number of employees in the \n     Transportation Security Administration of the Department of \n     Transportation, before or after its transfer to the \n     Department of Homeland Security, does not apply to the extent \n     that any such employees are responsible for implementing the \n     provisions of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, over five years since 9/11, much of \nour Nation's transportation systems remain vulnerable to terror attack. \nThere are many reasons for the lack of action by the Federal \nGovernment, but we can no longer simply look the other way. Last year, \nthe Congress had an opportunity to make significant strides to improve \nthe security of our freight and passenger rail systems, highways, \npublic transit systems, trucking and intercity bus operations, and \npipeline systems. The Senate passed my amendments and amendments by \nother Senators to the SAFE Ports Act to address the security of these \nimportant modes of transportation. In fact, the House of \nRepresentatives overwhelmingly voted to instruct its conferees to \ninclude these provisions in the final conference report of the SAFE \nPorts Act.\n  Unfortunately, House Republican leaders stripped them out of the \nfinal version of the bill behind closed doors, instead enacting a ban \non internet gambling. The actions by the House Republican leaders \nfurther delayed real progress in securing our homeland from terror. I \nbelieve the Federal Government must take a leadership role in securing \nour country from terrorism. States cannot on their own be left \nresponsible for securing these interstate modes of transportation.\n  That is why I am proud to be an author of the Surface Transportation \nand Rail Security Act of 2007. I have worked with my committee co-\nchairmen--Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens--to ensure this bill gets \nquickly considered. Its provisions are not new to anyone. They were \nconsidered, and agreed to, merely four months ago by the Senate. I am \nhopeful that they will again be quickly considered and adopted.\n  This bill specifically requires accountability from the Department of \nHomeland Security, by ensuring that our rail systems have been analyzed \nfor security risk. It authorizes necessary funding for making these \nsecurity improvements and specifically includes $400 million for tunnel \nsecurity improvements in the New Jersey/New\n\n[[Page S179]]\n\nYork region. I will seek further Federal funding for improving security \nof the New Jersey/New York region's tunnels and bridges in additional \nlegislation to be introduced this month, by working with my colleagues \non the appropriate committees in the Senate.\n  Last month, the Bush Administration proposed certain improvements to \nour nation's rail systems, but these proposals fell far short of what \nis needed to secure our country. For instance, the Administration \nproposal fails to take specific actions to improve the security of \nrailroad stations, bridges, and tunnels. More people use Amtrak's Penn \nStation in New York City than use all three major New Jersey-New York \nregion airports, Newark Liberty International, JFK, and LaGuardia \nairports, every day. This bill takes a much more comprehensive \napproach, by authorizing the funding needed to make these important \nsecurity improvements.\n  Our Nation's freight rail systems move some 12 billion tons of cargo, \nbut we are not doing enough to protect those systems. Some of this \ncargo includes hazardous chemicals and other dangerous materials which \ntravel within feet of our schools, hospitals, neighborhoods, and snake \nright through the middle of our cities. The potential for disaster \nlooms large, as the misuse of these shipments can produce an effect \nthat a weapon of mass destruction would on our communities. Clearly \nmuch more thought needs to be put into how we move this dangerous \ncargo, and the Federal Government must be involved. The Bush \nAdministration must agree with this assessment, as their proposal would \nstrictly forbid states or communities from acting on their own to \nprotect their residents from these risks.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this \nimportant legislation gets considered and enacted soon. We cannot \nafford to delay any further these vital security improvements to our \ncountry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 185. A bill to restore habeas corpus for those detained by the \nUnited States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will introduce legislation denominated \nthe Habeas Corpus Restoration Act. Last year, in the Military \nCommissions Act, the constitutional right of habeas corpus was \nattempted to be abrogated. I fought to pass an amendment to strike that \nprovision of the Act which was voted 51 to 48. I say ``attempted to be \nabrogated'' because, in my legal judgment, that provision in the Act is \nunconstitutional.\n  It is hard to see how there can be legislation to eliminate the \nconstitutional right to habeas corpus when the Constitution is explicit \nthat habeas corpus may not be suspended except in time of invasion or \nrebellion, and we do not have either of those circumstances present, as \nwas conceded by the advocates of the legislation last year to take away \nthe right of habeas corpus.\n  We have had Supreme Court decisions which have made it plain that \nhabeas corpus is available to noncitizens and that habeas corpus \napplies to territory controlled by the United States, specifically, \nincluding Guantanamo. More recently, however, we had a decision in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia applying the habeas \ncorpus jurisdiction stripping provision of the Military Commissions \nAct, but I believe we will see the appellate courts strike down this \nlegislative provision.\n  The contention that the gravamen or the substance of habeas corpus is \nprovided by the statutory review to the Circuit Court of the District \nof Columbia is fallacious on its face. All the statute does is allow \nfor a review of the regularity of proceedings. In my prepared \nstatement, I cite an example of litigation before a federal district \ncourt, where a person charged with consorting with al-Qaida asked: \n``What was the name of the person? He asked: What was the name of the \nperson I'm supposed to have consorted with? And the Presiding Officer \nsaid: I don't know, which, according to the opinion, brought uproarious \nlaughter from the audience. Here a man is charged with consorting with \nal-Qaida, and they cannot even tell him the name of the person he is \nalleged to have consorted with.\n  The hearing before the Judiciary Committee, which I chaired, \ncontained expansive, detailed evidence about the proceedings under the \nreview provisions in Guantanamo, which are grossly, totally \ninsufficient.\n  The New York Times had an extensive article on this subject, starting \non the front page, last Sunday, and continuing on a full page on the \nback page about what is happening at Guantanamo. It is hard to see how \nin America, or in a jurisdiction controlled by the United States, these \nproceedings could substitute for even rudimentary due process of law.\n  As I might add, the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act was introduced in \nthe 109th Congress. I offered the bill on behalf of myself and Senator \nLeahy. Consequently, we had this bill listed in the 109th Congress as a \nSpecter-Leahy bill, and with Senator Leahy's consent, it is denominated \nas the Specter-Leahy bill again in the 110th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my prepared text be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to \n     introduce the ``Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007.'' Last \n     September, during debate on the Military Commissions Act, I \n     introduced an amendment to strike section 7 of the Act and \n     thereby preserve the constitutional right of habeas corpus \n     for the approximately 450 individuals detained at Guantanamo \n     Bay. Because my amendment was not agreed to, by a narrow vote \n     of 48-51, the right to the writ of habeas corpus was denied \n     to those detainees. The privilege of the writ of habeas \n     corpus has therefore been suspended.\n       On December 5, with my colleague Senator Leahy, I \n     introduced the ``Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2006'' to \n     restore the writ of habeas corpus and bring this country back \n     into compliance with the United States Constitution. After \n     all, the United States Constitution is unambiguous in Article \n     1, Section 9, Clause 2, where it states: ``The privilege of \n     the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when \n     in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may \n     require it.'' Today, along with Senator Leahy, I am \n     reintroducing this important legislation.\n       The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act is very simple: It \n     strikes the federal habeas corpus limitations imposed by the \n     Military Commissions Act and the Detainee Treatment Act. In \n     so doing, the bill affords aliens detained by the United \n     States within its territorial jurisdiction, including those \n     detained at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, the right to \n     challenge their detention and military commission trial \n     procedures by an application for writ of habeas corpus. It \n     will ensure that the constitutional right of habeas corpus is \n     afforded to all individuals detained by the United States \n     government.\n       The Framers explicitly intended to extend habeas \n     protections to all, absent a case of rebellion, invasion, or \n     the interest of public safety. This principle was ratified by \n     the Supreme Court in the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, where \n     Justice O'Connor stated ``[a]ll agree that absent suspension, \n     the writ of habeas corpus remains available to every \n     individual detained within the United States.''\n       This protection extends to those detained in Guantanamo \n     since it is a facility exclusively under the control of the \n     United States. In Rasul v. Bush, the Supreme Court held that \n     habeas corpus rights apply even to aliens held at Guantanamo \n     Bay. One does not need to be a United States citizen to be \n     afforded basic constitutional habeas corpus rights and the \n     U.S. Constitution draws no distinction between American \n     citizens and aliens held in U.S. custody.\n       Although some argue that Combatant Status Review Tribunals, \n     commonly referred to as ``CSRTs,'' are an adequate and \n     effective means to challenge detention in accordance with the \n     Supreme Court's decision in Swain v. Pressley, I couldn't \n     disagree more. In my view, CSRTs are a sham. We have learned \n     a great deal about the cursory review provided by these \n     tribunals at Guantanamo Bay. They operate with very little \n     information. Somebody is picked up on the battlefield. There \n     is no record preserved as to what that individual did. If \n     there was a weapon involved, it was collected and mixed in \n     with many other weapons. There is no chain of custody or even \n     a record of what was seized. In sum, CSRTs are nothing more \n     than a one-sided interrogation by the military tribunal \n     members. These proceedings simply do not comport with basic \n     fairness because the individuals detained do not have the \n     right to know what evidence there is against them. As Justice \n     O'Connor wrote in her plurality opinion in the Hamdi case, \n     ``[a]n interrogation by one's captor, however effective an \n     intelligence-gathering tool, hardly constitutes a \n     constitutionally adequate factfinding before a neutral \n     decisionmaker.'' It is essential that we provide an adequate \n     means to evaluate the legality of an individual's continued \n     detention.\n       Typically, the CSRT will advise the detainee that the \n     evidence against them is\n\n[[Page S180]]\n\n     classified and restrict access. The U.S. District Court in \n     the In re Guantanamo case criticized the manner in which the \n     CSRT required detainees to answer allegations based on \n     information that cannot be disclosed. In a comical scene \n     during the hearing, a detainee advised the tribunal that he \n     could not answer an allegation that he had associated with a \n     known al Qaida operative because the tribunal would not \n     provide the name of the alleged operative. Since the tribunal \n     would not even provide the name of the operative, the \n     detainee could not answer even the most basic of allegations. \n     While laughter filled the courtroom at the time when the \n     detainee could not answer this simple allegation, we should \n     not forget the seriousness of this process and the manner in \n     which we are treating detainees of the United States.\n       The Military Commission Act's habeas corpus provisions were \n     debated at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing held on \n     September 25, 2006. At the hearing, I heard from a \n     distinguished and varied panel of witnesses, including the \n     attorney who represented Hamdan before the Supreme Court. \n     Perhaps most compelling during the hearing was the testimony \n     of the former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of \n     Illinois, Thomas Sullivan, who has been to Guantanamo on \n     many occasions and has represented many detainees. Mr. \n     Sullivan was especially compelling when he made reference \n     to a number of individual cases where the proceedings \n     before the CSRT were completely insufficient. He cited \n     hearings where individuals were summoned before the \n     tribunal, but did not speak the language, did not have an \n     attorney, did not have access to the information which was \n     presented against them, and continued to be detained. \n     These individuals either did not know what their charges \n     were, or those charges of which they were aware were vague \n     and illusory. For example, in the case of Abdul Hadi al \n     Siba'i, Mr. Sullivan described how his client had been \n     returned to Saudi Arabia after several months of \n     detainment and without a trial or any notice, \n     compensation, or apology. One can only suspect that the \n     United States government understood that the continued \n     detainment of this particular individual was wrong and \n     would expose weaknesses at trial.\n       The failure to afford habeas review rights to detainees has \n     concerned Kenneth Starr, former Solicitor General and U.S. \n     Court of Appeals Judge for the District of Columbia. In a \n     letter directed to me as Judiciary Chairman, Mr. Starr \n     expressed his concern ``about the limitations on writ of \n     habeas corpus contained in the comprehensive military \n     commissions bill.''\n       If Justice O'Connor feels that detainees have the right to \n     habeas review, but we are denying them this avenue of review, \n     how are detainees supposed to rebut facts that they are not \n     allowed to confront? This is why federal courts should be \n     open to hear habeas petitions of these detainees. The Supreme \n     Court is clear, and we should apply this precedent to the \n     current situation involving detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\n       On the recent 5-year anniversary of 9/11, President Bush \n     repeated his commitment to bring terrorists to justice. \n     However, statistics tell us that most of the terrorists at \n     Guantanamo will never see the inside of a courtroom. Hundreds \n     will be held indefinitely. Of the over 400 detainees who \n     remain at Guantanamo, the Pentagon says another 110 have been \n     labeled as ``ready to release.'' But the real number we need \n     to look at is the remaining 325 or so detainees. How many \n     will face trial? Media reports citing Pentagon sources \n     suggest that only approximately 70 detainees will face trial.\n       This leaves approximately 250 detainees--more than half of \n     those still at Guantanamo--who will be held indefinitely \n     simply because the United States considers them to be too \n     dangerous or in possession of sensitive intelligence \n     information. These detainees will have no ability to \n     challenge their confinement. My bill will ensure these \n     individuals held in U.S. custody will be afforded the \n     basic constitutional right to petition for habeas corpus \n     review.\n       The short history of the Military Commissions Act \n     underscores the need for this legislation. The day after the \n     Act became law, the Justice Department filed notices in each \n     of the 181 Guantanamo habeas cases pending before the United \n     States District Court for the District of Columbia, \n     highlighting the jurisdiction-stripping and retroactivity \n     provisions of the Act. In at least one noteworthy case, the \n     District Court has already agreed that it now lacks authority \n     to hear such a habeas petition.\n       On December 13, 2006, Judge James Robertson dismissed the \n     habeas petition of Salim Ahmed Hamdan--of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld \n     fame--for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. While I \n     disagree with Judge Robertson's conclusion that Hamdan has \n     ``no constitutional entitlement to habeas'' because he was \n     detained in Guantanamo rather than inside the United States, \n     this conclusion demonstrates the lack of judicial recourse \n     available to such detainees. Of course, the Military \n     Commissions Act is not strictly limited to those held in \n     Guantanamo. In another case, on November 13, 2006, the \n     Department of Justice filed a motion with the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to dismiss the habeas petition \n     of alleged enemy combatant Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri. Unlike \n     Hamdan and other Guantanamo detainees, al-Marri has been \n     detained inside the United States. While we could simply wait \n     for the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of \n     denying habeas rights to such detainees, I believe the United \n     States Congress has an obligation to act now and reverse this \n     wrong.\n                                  ____\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, on the first day of this new Congress, I \njoin Senator Specter to reintroduce a bill to restore the Great Writ of \nhabeas corpus, a cornerstone of American liberty since the founding of \nthis Nation. The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 bill continues \nour efforts to amend last year's Military Commissions Act, to right a \nwrong and to restore a basic protection to American law. This is an \nissue on which we continue to work together and urge Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to join with us.\n  As Justice Scalia wrote in the Hamdi case: ``The very core of liberty \nsecured by our Anglo-Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom \nfrom indefinite imprisonment at the will of the Executive.'' The remedy \nthat secures that most basic of freedoms is habeas corpus. It provides \na check against arbitrary detentions and constitutional violations. It \nguarantees an opportunity to go to court, with the aid of a lawyer, to \nprove one's innocence. This fundamental protection was rolled back in \nan unprecedented and unnecessary way in the run up to last fall's \nelection by passage of the Military Commissions Act.\n  The Military Commissions Act eliminated that right, permanently, for \nany non-citizen determined to be an enemy combatant, or even \n``awaiting'' such a determination. That includes the approximately 12 \nmillion lawful permanent residents in the United States today, people \nwho work and pay taxes in America and are lawful residents. This new \nlaw means that any of these people can be detained, forever, without \nany ability to challenge their detention Federal court--or anywhere \nelse--simply on the Government's say-so that they are awaiting \ndetermination whether they are enemy combatants.\n  I deeply regret that Senator Specter and I were unsuccessful in our \nefforts to stop this injustice when the President and the Republican \nleadership insisted on rushing the Military Commissions Act through \nCongress in the weeks before the recent elections. We proposed an \namendment that would have removed the habeas-stripping provision from \nthe Military Commissions Act. We fell just three votes short in those \npolitical charged days. It is my hope that the new Senate and new \nCongress will reconsider this matter, restore this fundamental \nprotection and revitalize our tradition of checks and balances.\n  Giving Government such raw, unfettered power as this law does should \nconcern every American. Last fall I spelled out a nightmare scenario \nabout a hard-working legal permanent resident who makes an innocent \ndonation to, among other charities, a Muslim charity that the \nGovernment secretly suspects might be a source of funding for critics \nof the United States Government. I suggested that, on the basis of\n\n[[Page S181]]\n\nthis donation and perhaps a report of ``suspicious behavior'' from an \noverzealous neighbor, the permanent resident could be brought in for \nquestioning, denied a lawyer, confined, and even tortured. Such a \nperson would have no recourse in the courts for years, for decades, \nforever.\n  Many people viewed this kind of nightmare scenario as fanciful, just \nthe rhetoric of a politician. It was not. It is all spelled out clearly \nin the language of the law that this body passed. In November, the \nscenario I spelled out was confirmed by the Department of Justice \nitself in a legal brief submitted in federal court in Virginia. The \nJustice Department, in a brief to dismiss a detainee's habeas case, \nsaid that the Military Commissions Act allows the Government to detain \nany non-citizen designated an enemy combatant without giving that \nperson any ability to challenge his detention in court. This is true, \nthe Justice Department said, even for someone arrested and imprisoned \nin the United States. The Washington Post wrote that the brief ``raises \nthe possibility that any of the millions of immigrants living in the \nUnited States could be subject to indefinite detention if they are \naccused of ties to terrorist groups.''\n  In fact, the situation is even more stark than The Washington Post \nstory suggested. The Justice Department's brief says that the \nGovernment can detain any non-citizen declared to be an enemy \ncombatant. But the law this Congress passed says the Government need \nnot even make that declaration: They can hold people indefinitely who \nare awaiting determination whether or not they are enemy combatants.\n  It gets worse. Republican leaders in the Senate followed the White \nHouse's lead and greatly expanded the definition of ``enemy \ncombatants'' in the dark of night in the final days before the bill's \npassage, so that enemy combatants need not be soldiers on any \nbattlefield. They can be people who donate small amounts of money, or \npeople that any group of decision-makers selected by the President \ndecides to call enemy combatants. The possibilities are chilling.\n  The Administration has made it clear that they intend to use every \nexpansive definition and unchecked power given to them by the new law. \nNovember's Justice Department brief made clear that any of our legal \nimmigrants could be held indefinitely without recourse in court. \nEarlier in November, the Justice Department went to court to say that \ndetainees who had been held in secret CIA prisons could not even meet \nwith lawyers because they might tell their lawyers about the cruel \ninterrogation techniques used against them. In other words, if our \nGovernment tortures somebody, that person loses his right to a lawyer \nbecause he might tell the lawyer about having been tortured. A law \nprofessor was quoted as saying about the Government's position in that \ncase: ``Kafka-esque doesn't do it justice. This is `Alice in \nWonderland.' ''\n  We have eliminated basic legal and human rights for the 12 million \nlawful permanent residents who live and work among us, to say nothing \nof the millions of other legal immigrants and visitors who we welcome \nto our shores each year. We have removed a vital check that our legal \nsystem provides against the government arbitrarily detaining people for \nlife without charge. We may well have also made many of our remaining \nlimits against torture and cruel and inhuman treatment obsolete because \nthey are unenforceable. We have removed the mechanism the Constitution \nprovides to check government overreaching and lawlessness.\n  This is wrong. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American. It is \ndesigned to ensure that the Bush-Cheney Administration will never again \nbe embarrassed by a United States Supreme Court decision reviewing its \nunlawful abuses of power. The conservative Supreme Court, with seven of \nits nine members appointed by Republican Presidents, has been the only \ncheck on this Administration's lawlessness. Certainly the last Congress \ndid not do it. With passage of the Military Commissions Act, the \nRepublican Congress completed the job of eviscerating its role as a \ncheck and balance on the Administration.\n  Some Senators uneasy about the Military Commissions Act's disastrous \nhabeas provision took solace in the thought that it would be struck \ndown by the courts. Instead, the first court to consider that \nprovision, a federal court in the District of Columbia, upheld the \nprovision. We should not outsource our moral, legal and constitutional \nresponsibility to the courts. Congress must be accountable for its \nactions and we should act to right this wrong.\n  Abolishing habeas corpus for anyone who the Government thinks might \nhave assisted enemies of the United States is unnecessary and morally \nwrong. It is a betrayal of the most basic values of freedom for which \nAmerica stands. It makes a mockery of the administration's lofty \nrhetoric about exporting freedom across the globe.\n  We should take steps to ensure that our enemies can be brought to \njustice efficiently and quickly. I introduced a bill to do that back in \n2002, as did Senator Specter, when we each proposed a set of laws to \nestablish military commissions. The Bush-Cheney Administration rejected \nour efforts and designed a regime the United States Supreme Court \ndetermined to be unlawful. Establishing appropriate military \ncommissions is not the question. We all agree to do that. What we need \nto revisit is the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus for millions \nof legal immigrants and others, denying their right to challenge \nindefinite detainment on the, government's say-so.\n  It is from strength that America should defend our values and our \nConstitution. It takes commitment to those values to demand \naccountability from the Government. In standing up for American values \nand security, I will keep working on this issue until we restore the \nchecks and balances that are fundamental to preserving the liberties \nthat define us as a nation. We can ensure our security without giving \nup our liberty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 186. A bill to provide appropriate protection to attorney-client \nprivileged communications and attorney work product; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the legislation which I am introducing is \nthe Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act. This legislation was \npreviously introduced in the 109th Congress.\n  In 2003, the Department of Justice adopted the provisions of the so-\ncalled Thompson Memorandum, which allowed prosecutors to request that \ncompanies under investigation waive their attorney-client privilege, \nand that, absent such a waiver, prosecutors may consider the company's \nrefusal to waive privilege in the charging process. As a result, the \nlegal and business community complained that, if the attorney-client \nprivilege is not waived, the corporation and individuals may get a \nstiffer charge.\n  The Department of Justice has recently revised the Thompson \nMemorandum, with Deputy Attorney General McNulty substituting what is \nnow known as the McNulty Memorandum. Prior to the release of the \nMcNulty Memorandum, I had a number of discussions with Department of \nJustice officials, and I thank the Department of Justice for the effort \nwhich they have made, but it is not sufficient. The new memorandum is \ninadequate in its protection of the attorney-client privilege.\n  Although the McNulty Memorandum is inadequate in failing to protect \nattorney-client privilege, it does improve another part of the \nDepartment of Justice's prior procedure under the Thompson Memorandum, \nwhich effectively denied the payment of counsel fees so that people who \nwere charged were unable to defend themselves without bankrupting \nthemselves in defense. That provision of the earlier Thompson \nMemorandum was declared unconstitutional in a case in the Southern \nDistrict of New York.\n  Mr. President, again, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nmy statement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2006\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to \n     introduce the ``Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of \n     2007,'' which remains necessary despite Deputy Attorney \n     General Paul McNulty's issuance of a new set of corporate \n     prosecution guidelines on December 12 of last year. Although \n     the new McNulty memorandum, which replaces\n\n[[Page S182]]\n\n     the memorandum issued by former Deputy Attorney General Larry \n     Thompson, makes some improvements, the revision continues to \n     erode the attorney-client relationship by allowing \n     prosecutors to request privileged information backed by the \n     hammer of prosecution if the request is denied.\n       This bill will protect the sanctity of the attorney-client \n     relationship by prohibiting federal prosecutors and \n     investigators from requesting waiver of attorney-client \n     privilege and attorney work product protections in corporate \n     investigations. The bill would similarly prohibit the \n     government from conditioning charging decisions or any \n     adverse treatment on an organization's payment of employee \n     legal fees, invocation of the attorney-client privilege, or \n     agreement to a joint defense agreement. This bill will \n     hopefully force the Department of Justice to issue a \n     meaningful change to its corporate charging policies beyond \n     the changes in the McNulty Memorandum, which came ``a day \n     late and a dollar short'' according to Frederick Krebs, the \n     president of the Association of Corporate Counsel.\n       There is no need to wait to see how the McNulty memorandum \n     will operate in practice. The flaws in that memorandum are \n     already apparent. Moreover, before the issuance of the \n     McNulty memorandum last month, the Thompson memorandum has \n     been undermining the attorney-client relationship in the \n     corporate context for nearly 4 years. In January 2003, then-\n     Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson issued a memorandum to \n     all Justice Department components throughout the United \n     States entitled ``Principles of Federal Prosecution of \n     Business Organizations.'' This memorandum, which was prepared \n     on the heels of the establishment of the President's \n     Corporate Fraud Task Force, set forth various factors for \n     federal prosecutors to consider when deciding to prosecute \n     corporations or other business organizations. The so-called \n     ``Thompson memorandum'' lists a corporation's ``cooperation \n     and voluntary disclosure'' as one of the chief factors to be \n     considered in making a charging decision.\n       Just as the Thompson memorandum was issued with laudable \n     goals in mind, the McNulty memorandum was, no doubt, the \n     product of good intentions. Nevertheless, it continues to \n     threaten the viability of the attorney-client privilege in \n     business organizations by allowing prosecutors to request \n     privilege waiver upon a finding of ``legitimate need''--a \n     standard that should guide the most basic of prosecutorial \n     requests, not sensitive requests for privileged information.\n       Just as the standard is inadequate, so is the level of \n     internal review. Although the McNulty memorandum establishes \n     some internal review for such waiver requests, it does so in \n     a way that diminishes the importance of a corporate client's \n     ability to communicate with its lawyers. The memo creates two \n     different categories of privileged information and provides \n     very little protection to client communications to the \n     attorney while providing significant protection and DOJ \n     internal review for attorney communications to the client. \n     The memo identifies the two subcategories of privileged \n     information as: (1) ``purely factual information,'' which \n     consists of witness statements, interview memoranda, factual \n     chronologies and summaries, and reports containing \n     investigative facts documented by counsel; and (2) attorney \n     advice to the client, including attorney notes, memoranda, \n     and notes.\n       The first category of information, formally labeled \n     Category 1 information by DOJ, may be requested with approval \n     at the U.S. Attorney-level with consultation with the \n     Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. The \n     consultation requirement is not defined in any way in the \n     memo. By failing to define what it means ``to consult'' with \n     the Assistant Attorney General, the McNulty memo fails to say \n     whether the Assistant Attorney General can overrule the U.S. \n     Attorney's decision. Unless there is a meaningful review of \n     the U.S. Attorney's decision, it is difficult to see how the \n     McNulty memo provides better safeguards for Category 1 \n     information than the interim-McCallum memo, issued in October \n     2005, which mandated a U.S. Attorney-level ``written waiver \n     review process'' for all attorney client privilege waiver \n     requests.\n       As noted above, the new McNulty memo does provide greater \n     protections for attorney advice and communication to the \n     client, which the memo labels ``Category 2'' information. The \n     McNulty memo protects Category 2 information in the first \n     instance by making clear that it may be sought only if the \n     prosecutor thinks Category 1 information provides an \n     incomplete basis for the investigation. If such a request is \n     deemed necessary, the request for Category 2 information must \n     be approved by the Deputy Attorney General.\n       Although the McNulty memo provides greater protection for \n     Category 2 information, the memo does not explain why such \n     information will ever be needed by prosecutors outside of \n     attorney advice in furtherance of a crime or fraud or \n     where the advice is subject to an advice of counsel \n     defense, both of which are expressly exempted from the \n     waiver request process outlined in the memorandum. Thus, \n     the only two types of attorney advice that are likely to \n     be relevant in a criminal investigation are exempted from \n     the memo's coverage. With that exception, I fail to see \n     why Category 2 information is needed at all. Prosecutors \n     do not need to know what attorneys are advising their \n     clients unless the advice is in furtherance of a crime or \n     the client puts the advice in issue by raising it as a \n     defense.\n       No less than the Thompson memo, the new McNulty memo \n     discourages corporate employees from having frank \n     conversations with lawyers, which makes it difficult for \n     companies who desire to prevent possible corruption from \n     making appropriate remedies. The Department of Justice will \n     not prevent corporate misconduct if it continues to \n     inadvertently discourage the types of internal investigations \n     and dialogues corporate officials need to detect and prevent \n     corporate fraud.\n       In the next rewrite of its corporate prosecution \n     guidelines, the Administration needs to look in the mirror. \n     If the President refused to disclose documents or information \n     after invoking a claim of executive privilege, it would not \n     consider itself to be ``uncooperative.'' Rather, the \n     executive would simply be doing its job in representing a \n     client. Yet, when the tables are turned, the Justice \n     Department has memorialized a policy instructing its \n     prosecutors to discourage attorneys from doing their job \n     effectively.\n       The right to counsel is too important to be passed over for \n     prosecutorial convenience. It has been engrained in American \n     jurisprudence since the 18th century when the Bill of Rights \n     was adopted. The 6th Amendment is a fundamental right \n     afforded to individuals charged with a crime and guarantees \n     proper representation by counsel throughout a prosecution. \n     However, the right to counsel is largely ineffective unless \n     the confidential communications made by a client to his or \n     her lawyer are protected by law. As the Supreme Court \n     observed in Upjohn Co. v. United States, ``the attorney-\n     client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for \n     confidential communications known to the common law.'' When \n     the Upjohn Court affirmed that attorney-client privilege \n     protections apply to corporate internal legal dialogue, the \n     Court manifested in the law the importance of the attorney-\n     client privilege in encouraging full and frank communication \n     between attorneys and their clients, as well as the broader \n     public interests the privilege serves in fostering the \n     observance of law and the administration of justice. The \n     Upjohn Court also made clear that value of legal advice and \n     advocacy depends on the lawyer having been fully informed by \n     the client.\n       As a former prosecutor, I am acutely aware of the enormous \n     power and tools a prosecutor has at his or her disposal. As \n     former Supreme Court Justice and then Attorney-General Robert \n     Jackson stated in his 1940 speech to U.S. Attorneys, ``The \n     prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and \n     reputation than any other person in America. His discretion \n     is tremendous. He can have citizens investigated and, if he \n     is that kind of person, he can have this done to the tune of \n     public statements and veiled or unveiled intimations.'' Thus, \n     the federal prosecutor has enough power without the coercive \n     tools of the privilege waiver, whether that waiver policy is \n     embodied in the Holder, Thompson, McCallum, or McNulty \n     memorandum. I see no need to have the Justice Department \n     publicly express a policy that encourages waiver of attorney-\n     client privilege, especially where the policy is backed by \n     the heavy hammer of possible criminal charges. Cases should \n     be prosecuted based on their merits, not based on how well an \n     organization works with the prosecutor. As Justice Jackson \n     warned in the same speech, ``the most dangerous power of the \n     prosecutor [is] that he will pick people that he thinks he \n     should get, rather than pick cases that need to be \n     prosecuted.''\n       Just as the Holder and Thompson memoranda before it, the \n     McNulty memorandum embodies bad public policy by empowering \n     federal prosecutors at the expense of the attorney-client \n     relationship. Consequently, I echo the comments of the \n     following organizations and individuals who have criticized \n     the McNulty memorandum:\n\n     ``The Justice Department's new corporate charging guidelines \n     for federal prosecutors fall far short of what is needed to \n     prevent further erosion of fundamental attorney-client \n     privilege, work product, and employee protections during \n     government investigations.''--Karen Mathis, ABA President.\n\n     ``While containing some improvements, this new policy does \n     not adequately protect the right to attorney-client \n     privilege, and unwisely ignores many of the recommendations \n     of former senior Justice Department officials, the American \n     Bar Association, and a massive coalition of some of the \n     nation's most prominent business, legal, and civil rights \n     groups.''--Stanton Anderson, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n     ``The McNulty Memorandum still falls short of protecting the \n     attorney-client privilege, and the related work product \n     doctrine, which derives from it.''--Martin Pinales, \n     President, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.\n\n     ``[T]his memo is a day late and a dollar short. Asking \n     prosecutors to get permission before formally requesting that \n     companies waive their attorney-client privilege will not put \n     an end to the `culture of waiver' that exists within DOJ. Our \n     research shows that more often than not, requests for waiver \n     are not asked for outright, but are coercively inferred.''--\n     Frederick Krebs, President, Association of Corporate Counsel.\n\n     ``Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty's memorandum is a \n     disappointment. It perpetuates the dynamic that compels \n     companies to ``voluntarily'' waive their rights in order to \n     get favorable treatment or to avoid the\n\n[[Page S183]]\n\n     death penalty of a federal indictment.''--Caroline \n     Fredrickson, Director, ACLU Washington legislative office; \n     George Landrith, President, Frontiers of Freedom; Stephanie \n     A. Martz, Director, White Collar Crime Project, National \n     Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers; Daniel J. Popeo, \n     Chairman, Washington Legal Foundation, in a letter to the \n     editor of USA Today.\n\n       My bill amends title 18 of the United States Code by adding \n     a new section, Sec. 3014, that would prohibit any agent or \n     attorney of the United States government in any criminal or \n     civil case to demand, request or condition treatment on the \n     disclosure of any communication protected by the attorney-\n     client privilege or attorney work product. The bill would \n     also prohibit government lawyers and agents from conditioning \n     any charge or adverse treatment on whether an organization \n     pays attorneys' fees for its employees or signs a joint \n     defense agreement.\n       While I am glad that the Justice Department revised the \n     Thompson memorandum, I am hopeful that the Department will \n     act again to reform the McNulty memorandum. In the absence of \n     such action, this legislation is needed to ensure that basic \n     protections of the attorney-client relationship are \n     preserved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 186\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Attorney-Client Privilege \n     Protection Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Justice is served when all parties to litigation are \n     represented by experienced diligent counsel.\n       (2) Protecting attorney-client privileged communications \n     from compelled disclosure fosters voluntary compliance with \n     the law.\n       (3) To serve the purpose of the attorney-client privilege, \n     attorneys and clients must have a degree of confidence that \n     they will not be required to disclose privileged \n     communications.\n       (4) The ability of an organization to have effective \n     compliance programs and to conduct comprehensive internal \n     investigations is enhanced when there is clarity and \n     consistency regarding the attorney-client privilege.\n       (5) Prosecutors, investigators, enforcement officials, and \n     other officers or employees of Government agencies have been \n     able to, and can continue to, conduct their work while \n     respecting attorney-client and work product protections and \n     the rights of individuals, including seeking and discovering \n     facts crucial to the investigation and prosecution of \n     organizations.\n       (6) Despite the existence of these legitimate tools, the \n     Department of Justice and other agencies have increasingly \n     employed tactics that undermine the adversarial system of \n     justice, such as encouraging organizations to waive attorney-\n     client privilege and work product protections to avoid \n     indictment or other sanctions.\n       (7) An indictment can have devastating consequences on an \n     organization, potentially eliminating the ability of the \n     organization to survive post-indictment or to dispute the \n     charges against it at trial.\n       (8) Waiver demands and other tactics of Government agencies \n     are encroaching on the constitutional rights and other legal \n     protections of employees.\n       (9) The attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, \n     and payment of counsel fees shall not be used as devices to \n     conceal wrongdoing or to cloak advice on evading the law.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to place on \n     each agency clear and practical limits designed to preserve \n     the attorney-client privilege and work product protections \n     available to an organization and preserve the constitutional \n     rights and other legal protections available to employees of \n     such an organization.\n\n     SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE OR \n                   ADVANCEMENT OF COUNSEL FEES AS ELEMENTS OF \n                   COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 201 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 3013 the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 3014.

A bill to provide sufficient resources to permit electronic \nsurveillance of United States persons for foreign intelligence purposes \nto be conducted pursuant to individualized court-issued orders for \ncalls originating in the United States, to provide additional resources \nto enhance oversight and streamline the procedures of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, to ensure review of the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program by the United States Supreme Court, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am reintroducing the text of S. 4051, \nwhich I originally introduced on November 14 of last year. And the \ntitle articulates it in a succinct way, so I will read that. It is: a \nbill to provide sufficient resources to permit electronic surveillance \nof United States persons for foreign intelligence purposes to be \nconducted pursuant to individualized court-issued warrants for calls \noriginating in the United States, to provide additional resources to \nenhance oversight and streamline the procedures of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, and to ensure review of the \nTerrorist Surveillance Program by the United States Supreme Court.\n  I made a number of efforts in the 109th Congress to subject the \nPresident's surveillance program to judicial review in accordance with \nthe existing law that a search-and-seizure warrant or a wiretap ought \nnot to be issued without a judge making a finding of probable cause and \nauthorizing that kind of a search and seizure or that kind of a \nwiretap.\n  Without going into the entire history, that bill was refined to the \npoint where it is articulated in S. 4051 of the 109th Congress, which \nwould provide for individualized warrants for calls originating in the \nUnited States and going out. That can be accomplished, according to the \nCIA, if there are additional resources, which this bill provides, and \nif the time for retroactive approval is extended from 3 days to 7 days.\n  With respect to calls originating outside the United States and \ncoming in,\n\n[[Page S184]]\n\nwe are advised there are simply too many of those to cover, so that on \nthose calls the bill would expedite the judicial review which is \ncurrently in process.\n  A Federal court in Detroit has declared the President's program \nunconstitutional, and it is now pending in the Sixth Circuit. This bill \nwould mandate review by the Supreme Court of the United States and \nwould put review in the Federal courts on an accelerated timetable.\n  There are objections to proceeding with legislation along this line \nbecause of an interest in having hearings. Well, we have had a whole \nseries of hearings, and the administration has refused to tell the \nJudiciary Committee the details of the program. Under our division of \nauthority, it is the Intelligence Committee which has jurisdiction over \nthis kind of a program.\n  But, we could proceed with hearings and still enact legislation which \nwould provide constitutional protection for calls originating in the \nUnited States, which is the more serious category. Citizens here, \npeople here in the United States, would have individual warrants and a \njudicial determination of probable cause before the surveillance and \nthe wiretaps were put into effect.\n  Meanwhile, the program goes on. It has been going on since late 2001. \nIt has been known to the public since December 16, 2005. And each day \nthat passes, there are more taps, there are more searches and seizures, \nthere is more surveillance, which may not comport with constitutional \nprovisions.\n  There may be the motivation to show that the President has broken the \nlaw. And there is no doubt that the surveillance program does violate \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. But the President \ncontends that he has inherent article II power as Commander in Chief \nwhich supersedes the statute. And he may be right about that. But only \na court can determine. And under the existing standards, the court must \nmake a determination of the nature of the invasion of privacy \ncontrasted with the importance for the public welfare of providing \nsecurity. That is a judicial function.\n  It seems to me that where you have an avenue to have probable cause \nestablished in the traditional way on calls going out of the United \nStates, we ought to utilize it. We ought not to have that program \ncontinue in effect without having that kind of constitutional \nprocedure.\n  And then, as to calls originating outside of the United States, if \nthe President is right, that can be determined by the courts. Let that \nproceed in that manner. And, the justification for delay--that we need \nto show the President of the United States has violated the law--is a \nwholly insufficient justification to withhold legislation that would be \na major improvement to this surveillance program.\n  We can conclude, in my view, that he has violated FISA. But to \nrepeat--and I do not like to repeat--he may have the constitutional \nauthority for the surveillance program, but that has to be determined \nby a judicial proceeding.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 187\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise the short title of the Fannie Lou Hamer, \nRosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization \nand Amendments Act of 2006; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nlegislation I am introducing today, which has the support and co-\nsponsorship of several of my colleagues including Senators Reid, Leahy, \nFeinstein, Boxer and Menendez.\n  This is a simple, straight forward measure to include the name of \nCesar E. Chavez, a truly remarkable civil rights leader and American, \ninto the title of the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act passed \nlast year.\n  With my bill, the title of this Act would be referred to as the \nFannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, and Cesar E. Chavez \nVoting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. I am \nproud to have been part of a unanimous Senate that reauthorized this \nlandmark piece of civil rights legislation. Reauthorizing the Voting \nRights Act extended the open door for every American to exercise their \nright to participate in the representative democracy founded by our \nConstitution, and cherished by our people. In that spirit, it is \nfitting that Cesar Chavez's name be included with the other names \nhonored in this bill--as pioneers who helped pave the way to ensure \nthat all Americans have a voice in electing their Government at the \nvoting booth.\n  Cesar Chavez is an American hero. Like the venerable American leaders \nwho are now associated with this effort, he sacrificed his life to \nempower the most vulnerable in America. For this reason, he continues \nto be an important part of our country's journey on the path to a more \ninclusive America. Cesar Chavez believed strongly in our American \ndemocracy and saw the right to vote as a fundamental cornerstone of our \nfreedom. I believe it is fitting that his name be a part of the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act.\n  President Lyndon Johnson once stated: ``The vote is the most powerful \ninstrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and \ndestroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are \ndifferent from other men.'' With his simple but powerful slogan ``Si Se \nPuede'' or yes, it can be done, Cesar Chavez reminded us of this truth.\n  Still, throughout our history and even today, many Americans have \nbeen shut out of our most fundamental right, the right to vote. When \nPresident Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law, he \nrestored the faith of millions of African Americans, Hispanic \nAmericans, Native Americans, and others who had historically been kept \nfrom voting.\n  As our Nation moved forward in the next chapter of civic equality and \ninclusion with the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act last year, \nwe demonstrated to millions of Hispanic Americans this body's continued \ncommitment to safeguarding their right to vote. To include Cesar E. \nChavez's name to that commitment today is an important change because \nof the message it sends Hispanic Americans. It serves as a signal of \nCongress' commitment to an inclusive America that brings all Americans \ninto our democratic process.\n  This past November, more than 86 million Americans voted all across \nthe country. Fifty years ago, before the enactment of the Voting Rights \nAct, many would not have been able to do so. It is important and \nfitting that we honor those civil rights leaders whose contributions \nand courage helped pave the way for today's more inclusive democracy, \nand it is fitting that the name of Cesar E. Chavez be included with \nthem in the title of last year's Voting Rights Act reauthorization. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on this small change, and am \nhopeful that they will approve my proposal to revise the official title \nof this\n\n[[Page S186]]\n\nlandmark reauthorization as the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta \nScott King, and Cesar E. Chavez Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and \nAmendments Act of 2006.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 192. A bill providing greater transparency with respect to \nlobbying activities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Feingold, Collins, and Lieberman in introducing a bill to \nprovide greater transparency into the process of influencing our \nGovernment, and to ensure greater accountability among public \nofficials.\n  The legislation proposes a number of important and necessary reforms. \nIt would provide for faster reporting and greater public access to \nreports filed by lobbyists and their employers under current law. It \nwould require greater disclosure of lobbyists' contributions and \npayments to lawmakers and entities associated with them, as well as \nfundraising and other events they host. the bill also would require \ngreater disclosure from both lobbyists, and Members and employees of \nCongress, of travel that is arranged or financed by a lobbyist or his \nclient.\n  To address the problem of the revolving door between Government and \nthe private sector, the bill would strengthen the lobbying restrictions \non former senior members of the Executive Branch, former Members of \nCongress, and former senior congressional staff. It would require that \nMembers publicly disclose negotiations they are having with prospective \nprivate employers to ensure there is no conflict of interests. The bill \nalso would modify the provision in current law that exempts former \nFederal employees who go to work for Indian tribes as outside lobbyists \nand agents from the revolving door laws.\n  The bill would prohibit all gifts from lobbyists to lawmakers and \ntheir staff. To ensure that such a ban is not circumvented, the bill \nalso would require Members of Congress and their staff to pay the fair \nmarket value for travel on private planes and the fair market value of \nsports and entertainment tickets. Members and staff would also have to \npost the details of their privately-sponsored work trips on-line for \npublic inspection.\n  The bill would establish an independent, non-partisan Office of \nPublic Integrity. Armed with a number of investigative tools, the \nOffice of Public Integrity would investigate alleged misconduct by \nMembers and their staff and make appropriate recommendations to the \nSenate Ethics Committee for final disposition.\n  Finally, the bill would help us combat wasteful, porkbarrel spending. \nIt would amend Congressional rules to allow lawmakers to challenge \nunauthorized appropriations, earmarks, and policy riders in \nappropriations bills.\n  Mr. President, when I introduced similar legislation over a year ago, \nI regretted that such reform was even necessary. And, I voted against \nthe bill that was ultimately passed in the Senate because it lacked a \nnumber of elements essential to true reform.\n  Unfortunately, the need for such reform has only become more acute. \nThe American people's faith and confidence in this venerable \ninstitution has steadily eroded. The day after the mid-term elections, \nCNN reported that, according to national exit polls, voters were \nconcerned about corruption and ethics in Government more than any other \nissue. I can tell you the polls, if not spot on, are not far off.\n\n  During my travels around the country last year, it quickly became \nclear that there is a deep perception that we legislators do not act on \nthe priorities of the American people, that special interests, and not \nthe people's interests, guide our legislative hand. This loss in \nconfidence is not limited to a single party or ideology; rather, it \ncuts across the spectrum. It is a perception bred by recent \nCongressional failures and scandals, which I need not chronicle here.\n  We can begin to restore faith in this institution by divesting \nourselves of some of the perks and privileges that have somehow crept \ninto public service. Take, for example, free meals and sports and \nentertainment tickets. The American people have rightfully come to see \nthe abuse of such perks as a corrupting influence. In a string of \nguilty pleas last year, several lobbyists, former congressional aides, \nand a congressman admitted that such gifts were used as bribes. Quite \nfrankly, there is no good reason why Members of Congress and their \nstaff cannot forgo such gifts from lobbyists. No one would seriously \ncontend that they are necessary for us to conduct the people's \nbusiness. A total gift ban would go a long way towards restoring the \npublic's confidence in us.\n  Another critical aspect requiring reform is the ability of a Member \nto travel on a corporate jet and only pay the rate of a first class \nplane ticket. This bill requires Senators and their employees who use \ncorporate or charter aircraft to pay the fair market value for that \ntravel. While I appreciate that such a change is not popular with some \nof my colleagues, the time has come to fundamentally change the way we \ndo things in this town. Much of the public views our ability to travel \non corporate jets, often accompanied by lobbyists, while only \nreimbursing the first-class rate, as a huge loophole in the current \ngift rules. And they are right--it is. I have no doubt that the average \nAmerican would love to fly around the country on very comfortable \ncorporate-owned aircraft and only be charged the cost of a first-class \nticket. It is a pretty good deal we have got going here. We need to \nface the fact that the time has come to end this Congressional perk.\n  At a time when the public is questioning our integrity, the Senate \nneeds to more aggressively enforce its own rules. We can do this not \njust by making more public the work that the Senate Ethics Committee \ncurrently undertakes, but by addressing the conflict that is inherent \nin any body that regulates itself. That is why I am again proposing the \ncreation of a new Office of Public Integrity with the capacity to \ninitiate and conduct investigations, uncolored by partisan concerns and \nunconstrained by collegial relationships.\n  Finally, Mr. President, if we are truly serious about reform, we need \nto address what some have coined the currency of corruption--earmarks. \nIn 1994, there were 4,126 earmarks. In 2005, there were 15,877--an \nincrease of nearly 400 percent! But there was a little good news for \n2006 solely due to the good sense that occurred unexpectedly when the \nLabor HHS appropriations bill was approved with almost no earmarks, an \namazing feat given that there were over 3,000 earmarks the prior year \nfor just that bill. Yet despite this first reduction in 12 years, it \ndoes not change the fact that the largest number of earmarks have still \noccurred in the last three years--2004, 2005, and 2006.\n  Now, let us consider the level of funding associated with those \nearmarks. The amount of earmarked funding increased from $23.2 billion \nin 1994 to $64 billion in FY 2006. Remarkably, it rose by 34 percent \nfrom 2005 to 2006, even though the number of earmarks decreased! \nEarmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000, and more than tripled \nin the last 10 years. This explosion in earmarks led one lobbyist to \nderide the appropriations committees as favor factories. The time for \nus to fix this broken process is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, this past election, the American people sent a clear \nmessage: clean up the way business is done in our capitol. As faithful \npublic servants, we are obligated to respond. Let us respond \nmeaningfully, to assure the American people that we are here promoting \nthe interests of main street over that of K Street, and that we are \nmore interested in public service than the perks and privileges offered \nus. Let us also remind ourselves that we came here in the sincere \nbelief that public service is a noble calling, a reward unto itself.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues in joining me on this bill. I think \nour Nation and this venerable institution will be all the better for \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S.J. Res. 1. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to require a balanced budget \nand protect Social Security surpluses; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the balanced \nbudget\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\namendment to the Constitution of the United States. I, for some years, \nalong with my colleagues in a bipartisan way, have spoke to this issue. \nToday, in a new year and in a new Congress, Americans are eager to see \na new direction for our country. They have seen Federal spending \nincrease by $200 billion from fiscal years 2005 to 2006. They have \nwatched the Federal deficit swell into hundreds of billions of dollars, \nand they have borne the costs. Our spending system is broken and, in my \nopinion, so is our Tax Code.\n  The new year is a time for new solutions to this problem. When new \nsolutions that draw upon old principles of limited government and \nfiscal responsibility and tax simplicity and fairness are how you \napproach a problem, I think Americans once again will listen, and they \nwill allow us to build a system that increasingly builds faith, once \nagain, with the American people and America's taxpayers. It is simply \ngetting back to basics. We must look at the big picture of Federal \nspending as a crisis in our country and begin to speak the language \nthat is fundamental to reform in itself, not instead of half measures \nor bits or pieces or nibbling around the edges. But as both of our \nleaders have spoken in the last hour to bipartisan efforts, they speak \nof bold strokes to solving problems for America, and I think that is \nwhat Americans expect of us as their leaders. We must look at it simply \nand reduce the deficit--I would hope we could eliminate it--and to do \nso with a Tax Code that is fairer, more balanced, certainly simpler, \nand not so complex that the American taxpayers collectively have to \nspend billions of dollars a year simply in complying with the Tax Code \nitself.\n  In the coming months, I will address all three components of the \nFederal spending crisis, including a flat tax and a budget process that \nreforms what we get done here, and that we get it done in a timely \nmanner. I begin with a balanced budget amendment to the United States \nConstitution. For many Americans, one of the signs of our deep respect \nfor the Constitution is to acknowledge that, in exceptional cases, a \nproblem finally rises to a level that it can only be addressed through \na constitutional adjustment in our government.\n  I believe spending is at that crisis level and we here, Democrat and \nRepublican, have demonstrated our inability to deal with it in a timely \nand responsible fashion. So it is time we act. My balanced budget \namendment would require Congress to pass a balanced budget every year \nto ensure that Social Security surpluses are set aside exclusively to \nmeet the future needs of beneficiaries and to require a supermajority \nin both the House and the Senate to raise the Nation's debt limit. In \naddition, it recognizes that national security is a priority of this \nCongress by providing essential exceptions for war and imminent \nmilitary threats. In other words, over the last several years a \nbalanced budget amendment would not have deterred us from funding, as \nappropriate and necessary, our engagement in Iraq and to make sure the \nmen and women who are there on the front lines today are adequately \nprovided with the necessary tools.\n  Thomas Jefferson said it so well, and he said this:\n\n     . . .with respect to future debt, would it not be wise and \n     just for that nation to declare in the constitution they are \n     forming that neither the legislature, nor the nation itself \n     can validly contract more debt than they may pay?\n\n  His logic is simple. His logic is right. I urge you to join me in \nmaking fiscal responsibility constitutionally acceptable--and a habit--\nof this Nation's Capitol.\n  With the first piece of legislation I introduce to the 110th \nCongress, I call on the Senate to pass a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution, a bill of economic rights for our future and our \nchildren.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this joint resolution \nproposing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe joint resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 1\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following article is proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to \n     all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States within seven years after the date of its submission by \n     the Congress:\n\n                              ``Article--\n\n       ``Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not \n     exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House of Congress shall \n     provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts \n     by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 2. Total receipts shall include all receipts of \n     the United States Government except those derived from \n     borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the \n     United States Government except for those for repayment of \n     debt principal.\n       ``Section 3. Any surplus of receipts (including \n     attributable interest) over outlays of the Federal Old-Age \n     and Survivors Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Funds shall not be counted for purposes of this \n     article. Any deficit of receipts (including attributable \n     interest) relative to outlays of the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Funds shall be counted for purposes of this article, \n     and must be completely offset by a surplus of all other \n     receipts over all other outlays.\n       ``Section 4. The limit on the debt of the United States \n     held by the public shall not be increased, unless three-\n     fifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law \n     for such an increase by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 5. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall \n     transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United \n     States Government for that fiscal year, in which total \n     outlays do not exceed total receipts.\n       ``Section 6. No bill to increase revenue shall become law \n     unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House by a rollcall vote.\n       ``Section 7. The Congress may waive the provisions of this \n     article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is \n     in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by a \n     joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number \n     of each House, which becomes law.\n       ``Section 8. The Congress shall enforce and implement this \n     article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \n     estimates of outlays and receipts.\n       ``Section 9. This article shall take effect the second \n     fiscal year beginning after its ratification.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S187-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 1--INFORMING THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THAT \n                  A QUORUM OF EACH HOUSE IS ASSEMBLED\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 18\n\n       Whereas military families, through their sacrifices and \n     their dedication to the United States and its values, \n     represent the bedrock upon which the United States was \n     founded and upon which the country continues to rely in these \n     perilous and challenging times: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that the month of \n     November should be designated as ``National Military Family \n     Month''; and\n       (2) the Senate encourages the people of the United States \n     to observe ``National Military Family Month'' with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to honor all our military \nfamilies by submitting a Resolution to designate November as National \nMilitary Family Month. As we all know, memories fade and the hardships \nexperienced by our military families are easily forgotten unless they \ntouch our own immediate family.\n  Today, we have our men and women deployed all over the world, engaged \nin this war on terrorism. These far-ranging military deployments are \nextremely difficult on the families who bear this heavy burden.\n  To honor these families, the Armed Services YMCA has sponsored \nMilitary Family Week in late November since 1996. However, due to \nfrequent ``short week'' conflicts around the Thanksgiving holidays, the \ndesignated week has not always afforded enough time to schedule \nobservances on and near our military bases.\n  I believe a month long observation will allow greater opportunity to \nplan events. Moreover, it will provide a greater opportunity to \nstimulate media support.\n  A resolution will help pave the way for this effort. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this tribute to our military \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S189-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 19--HONORING PRESIDENT GERALD RUDOLPH FORD\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Alexaner, Mr. Allard, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nBiden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Brownback, \nMr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, \nMr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nColeman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Craig, \nMr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nGraham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. \nLugar, Mr. Martinez, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Ms. \nMikulski, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson \nof Nebraska, Mr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, Mr. \nTester, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thune, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, \nMr. Webb, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was ordered held at the desk:\n\n                               S. Res. 19\n\n       Whereas Gerald Rudolph Ford, the 38th President of the \n     United States, was born on July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Nebraska;\n       Whereas Gerald Ford was raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, \n     where he was active in the Boy Scouts and where he excelled \n     as both a student and an athlete during high school;\n       Whereas after graduating from high school, Gerald Ford \n     attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where he \n     played on the university's national championship football \n     teams in 1932 and 1933, and was honored as the team's most \n     valuable player in 1934, before graduating with a B.A. degree \n     in 1935;\n       Whereas Gerald Ford later attended Yale Law School and \n     earned an LL.B. degree in 1941, after which he began to \n     practice law in Grand Rapids;\n       Whereas Gerald Ford joined the United States Naval Reserve \n     in 1942 and served his country honorably during World War II;\n       Whereas upon returning from his service in the military, \n     Gerald Ford ran for the United States House of \n     Representatives and was elected to Congress;\n       Whereas Gerald Ford served in the House of Representatives \n     from January 1949 to December 1973, winning reelection 12 \n     times, each time with more than 60 percent of the vote;\n       Whereas Gerald Ford served with great distinction in \n     Congress, in particular through his service on the Defense \n     Appropriations Subcommittee, of which he rose to become \n     ranking member in 1961;\n       Whereas in addition to his work in the House of \n     Representatives, Gerald Ford served as a member of the Warren \n     Commission, which investigated the assassination of President \n     John F.

Con. Res. 1\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States successfully \n     defended freedom and democracy for over 40 years in a global \n     Cold War against an aggressive Communist tyranny;\n       Whereas President Ronald Wilson Reagan's demonstration of \n     unwavering personal conviction during this conflict served to \n     inspire millions of people throughout the United\n\n[[Page S190]]\n\n     States and around the world to seek democracy, freedom, and \n     greater individual liberty; and\n       Whereas President Reagan's determined stand against the \n     Soviet Union during his 8 years as President served as the \n     catalyst for the collapse of the Soviet Union: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that an \n     artistic tribute to commemorate the speech given by President \n     Ronald Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate on June 12, 1987, \n     during which he uttered the immortal words, ``Mr. Gorbachev, \n     tear down this wall!'', should be placed within the United \n     States Capitol.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, finally, I would like to note that nearly \n20 years ago, on June 12, 1987, President Ronald Reagan stood at the \nBerlin Wall, at the Brandenburg Gate, and issued his--issued \nliberty's--famous challenge to Soviet tyranny:\n  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this Wall!\n  I am submitting a resolution today calling for an artistic rendering \nof that moment in time to be painted into the Capitol, along with the \nother significant scenes of our Nation's past. As we walk through the \nbuilding today, we can see scenes from the Nation's founding, from the \nCivil War, our westward expansion, even the Moon landing and Challenger \nastronauts. I would like to also see Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate. I \nthink it would be entirely appropriate to have this image added. It \nwould be an important reminder of the struggle this Nation undertook. \nIt would stand for the millions of Americans who did their part for \nnearly half a century in that struggle, both military and civilian. And \nit would testify to the greatness of our Nation, and the greatness of \nour 40th President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S190-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S190-S198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FOREIGN TRAVEL FINANCIAL REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following reports for standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n      CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22 U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON\n                                                          AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION AND FORESTRY FOR TRAVEL FROM JULY 1 TO SEPT. 30, 2006\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSaxby Chambliss:\n    Greenland..............................

STAFFORD WHITE ROCKS NATIONAL RECREATION AREA\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of S. 159 which was introduced earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 159) to redesignate the White Rocks National \n     Recreation Area in the State of Vermont as the Robert T. \n     Stafford White Rocks National Recreation Area.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is with great sadness that I rise \ntoday to bid a final goodbye to one of Vermont's most distinguished \npublic servants. On Saturday, December 23, just before Christmas, \nformer Senator Bob Stafford from Vermont passed away at the venerable \nage of 93. He leaves behind a tremendous legacy of which he and his \nfamily and fellow Vermonters and all Americans should be exceptionally \nproud. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Robert Stafford, an \nextraordinary Vermonter, and especially a very dear and close friend.\n  He will be greatly missed by me, my wife Marcelle, and by so many \nother Americans all across our country. We send our condolences to his \nwife Helen and his family.\n  Born in Rutland in 1913, Senator Stafford attended his hometown's \npublic schools. He completed his undergraduate work at one of our \nNation's finest undergraduate institutions, Middlebury College. He \nbriefly attended the University of Michigan Law School but ultimately \nearned his law degree from Boston University School of Law in 1938.\n  Bob was a remarkable person not only because of his service as a \nstatesman but also for his service in the military. He is a prime \nexample of what has been so aptly named the ``greatest generation.''\n  Senator Stafford courageously stepped forward to serve our Nation \nduring not one but two foreign wars. In 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. \nNavy and served on active duty from 1942 to 1946. Again, when the \nKorean war began, he served from 1951 to 1953 as an officer in the \nNavy. Bob later became the first commander of the Navy Reserve Center \nin Burlington, VT. The center later moved to White River Junction in \n1995, and I was pleased to recommend to the Navy that the new facility \nbe named the Robert T. Stafford Naval Reserve Center. They happily \nobliged. Throughout his life, Bob remained extremely proud of his Navy \ncareer. I still remember that beautiful day when we opened the new \nNaval Reserve facility named in honor of his leadership.\n  Indeed, the recently completed Lake Champlain Navy Memorial was \ndedicated in his honor by the unanimous recommendation of its founding \ncommittee, made up of Navy veterans, retirees, and reservists.\n  Bob Stafford was an absolute giant in Vermont politics. He spent \nalmost 30 years representing our great State, first in the U.S. House \nof Representatives, and then in the U.S. Senate. Prior to his arrival \nin Washington in the early 1960s, he served his fellow Vermonters \ncloser to home, holding a number of prominent State positions.\n  He served as Rutland County State's attorney and deputy State \nattorney general, and finally as our State attorney general. From 1957 \nto 1959, Bob Stafford held the post of Lieutenant Governor. In 1959, he \nwent on to become Governor.\n  In 1960, Bob Stafford was elected to Vermont's sole seat in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. He won five successive reelections. In \nSeptember of 1971, he resigned his House seat to accept an appointment \nto the U.S. Senate following the death of Senator Winston Prouty.\n  After he won a special election in January 1972, Bob proceeded to \nrepresent Vermont in the Senate during the next 17 years. I had the \ndistinct privilege of serving with him during all but 2 of those years. \nHe also had serving with him from the time he was Governor through the \nHouse and the U.S. Senate a most remarkable Chief of Staff, Neal \nHouston. He and Neal Houston were like brothers. They could almost \ncomplete each other's sentences. When I spoke to Neal and heard the sad \nnews about Senator Stafford's passing, I knew he felt that he had lost \na member of his own family.\n  When I first came to Washington as a young man in 1974, I was a 34-\nyear-old junior Senator from Vermont. We didn't have any kind of \norientation for new Senators at that time. Bob Stafford was an \nindispensable mentor to me. I will never forget the leadership and \nfriendship he offered me during that challenging time.\n  Interestingly enough, Senator Stafford was sort of the epitome of a \nVermont Republican in the proudest tradition. I was the only Democrat \never elected. He took me under his wing during those early years. He \nwas enormously helpful to me, his younger, far less experienced junior \ncolleague. I will never forget that he even allowed me the use of his \noffice before I was assigned a space of my own, where we could \ninterview people for positions in my office and where telephone calls \ncould be answered. He brought me around and introduced me to both \nRepublicans and Democrats and basically vouched for me.\n\n  But Bob and his wife Helen's kindness extended far beyond the \nconfines of the Senate office buildings. Helen was kind enough even to \noffer to babysit our children when Marcelle and I were so new in town \nthat we had nowhere to turn for childcare while we were house-hunting. \nThis is a remarkable couple.\n  To this day, Marcelle and I hold enormous gratitude for the \nfriendship the Staffords offered during our early years in Washington. \nThat friendship has continued throughout the years, and we have many \nfond memories of visiting their home on Sugar Hill Road. Even after Bob \nleft the Senate, we would drop by and visit. We had some most \nremarkable conversations--some political, some family, and after all of \nthem I would leave with a smile on my face.\n  Bob was an extremely well liked member of the Republican Party. He \nserved at one time in the Republican leadership, but he also formed \nmany close friendships with Senators on the Democratic side. Always \nrespectful, always polite, Bob Stafford consistently recognized the \nimportance of moderation and compromise. He, better than most, knew how \nto form bipartisan alliances.\n  In his quiet and unassuming manner, Bob Stafford fought hard for the \nissues that mattered most to him. He believed passionately that higher \neducation should be more accessible to all Americans, regardless of \ntheir socioeconomic status, and he was instrumental in creating the \nstudent loan program which today bears his name. The Stafford Student \nLoan Program has made higher education more accessible for millions of \nAmericans, even for some who work in my office today. Bob was a \nchampion of vocational education. Today the Stafford Technical Center, \nlocated in his hometown of Rutland, serves the needs of hundreds of \nstudents in Rutland County.\n  Bob showed tremendous leadership in blocking President Reagan's \nattempts to slash health and education funding. Thanks to Bob \nStafford's hard work, programs for disabled Americans and legal aid \nwere left largely intact during much of the 1980s when other programs \nwere starkly scaled back. His chairmanship made sure they were \nprotected.\n  Bob Stafford also played an important role in another issue of \nenormous relevance today, Federal emergency assistance. In 1988, \nPresident Reagan signed into law the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \nand Emergency Assistance Act, a bill which provides the statutory \nauthority for Federal disaster response activities pertaining to FEMA \nprograms.\n  While his achievements in the areas of education and Federal disaster \nrelief were certainly superb, I believe his most enduring legacy will \nbe for the work he did in protecting the environment and public health. \nHe helped\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\nshape and strengthen some of our Nation's most critical environmental \nlaws for over two decades.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee from 1981 \nto 1986, Bob Stafford was instrumental in persuading Congress to expand \nand strengthen the Superfund toxic waste cleanup law in the mid-1980s. \nIt was in large part due to Robert Stafford's unwavering commitment to \nthis bill in 1980 that the Superfund Act became law at all. As many of \nus know, this law has been indispensable in forcing industry polluters \nto contribute money to finance cleanup and restoration of contaminated \nwastesites.\n  Bob Stafford believed passionately in the Federal Government's \ncommitment to improving the quality of our Nation's air. This was never \nmore evident than in his steadfast work to uphold the Clean Air Act \nwhen it was under attack during the 1980s. He did not shirk from taking \non his friend President Reagan as well as auto manufacturers and other \nindustry groups in refusing to roll back this critical air pollution \nlaw.\n  In fact, I remember talking to him once. They were so anxious to get \nhim to change and let these rollbacks go through that they invited him \ndown to the White House, to spend some one-on-one time with President \nReagan. The Reagan administration amazed many of their members \nafterward that Bob didn't back off at all. He came back and kept on \nprotecting the environment.\n  I said to him: Bob, what happened when you went down there to talk \nwith President Regan?\n  He said: Well, the President had notes of what he was supposed to say \nand he said it. Then he looked at me and he said: Bob, you're probably \nnot going to give in, are you? Bob said: No, no, I'm not, Mr. \nPresident, but I certainly appreciate the time to be with you.\n  I said then: What did you talk about the rest of the time?\n  Oh, we talked about our kids, we talked about sports, we talked about \na lot of other things. He said: I had a wonderful conversation with \nPresident Reagan. But he did not budge on the environment, something no \nVermonter would do.\n  His concern about the contamination of our air was truly remarkable. \nThe consistent and clear manner in which he spoke about the danger of \nozone depletion, acid rain, and the release of greenhouse gases related \nto global warming, during a very difficult period, was a source of \ninspiration to so many of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It \ncertainly was an inspiration to me.\n  As EPW chairman, Senator Stafford also led the fight to improve the \nquality of our water. Working closely with Senator John Chafee and \nothers on both sides of the aisle, his leadership was critical in \nreauthorizing the Clean Water Act in 1987. Bob cited the passage of \nthis act as the culmination of one of the greatest bipartisan efforts \nin protecting our Nation's environment. It really was. Republicans and \nDemocrats came together. It gave me enormous pride to see him appear 3 \nyears ago before the Senate in celebrating the act's 30-year \nanniversary. Thanks to Bob's leadership during those difficult years of \nderegulation, our Nation was able to make great strides in reducing the \nlevels of pollutants and contaminants in our water.\n  Even after he retired from Congress, he served Vermont in many ways. \nHe was a member of the University of Vermont's School of Natural \nResources Advisory Committee and attended the day-long hearings with \nhis wife Helen up to just a few years ago. He also lectured at UVM, \nNorwich University, and Castleton State College. In 2003, his old alma \nmater, Middlebury College, honored both Bob and his wife Helen, also a \nMiddlebury graduate, by inaugurating the Robert and Helen Stafford \nProfessorship in Public Policy. Two people who had been together almost \nall their lives are together in this professorship.\n  Also in retirement, Bob continued to fight for clean air. In 1995, he \njoined forces with his friend and former colleague, Senator Edmund \nMuskie, in incorporating the Clean Air Trust, a nonprofit organization \ndedicated to upholding and enforcing clean air legislation.\n  He leaves so many impressive achievements for his lifelong work in \npublic service. But outside these public accomplishments, Senator \nStafford was also a man of many personal hobbies and interests. It kind \nof reflects who he is. On weekends, he liked to slip out of Washington \nwith his wife Helen and enjoy time on his boat, a full Moon, cruising \ndown the Chesapeake Bay. Marcelle and I were fortunate enough to join \nthem on occasion. He loved the water. He loved everything about \nsailing. You can tell why the Navy holds him in such high regard back \nhome.\n  He took flying lessons as a young man. He eventually got his pilot's \nlicense in the early sixties. In fact, he would pilot a leased Cessna \nback and forth between Washington and Vermont.\n  It was a mark of this unique Senator that he welcomed and helped the \nfirst Senator of the other party to be elected in Vermont. I will \nalways remember and cherish the walks we took down the halls and the \ntimes we would sit and talk at lunch. People thought we were talking so \nmuch about politics. We were talking about Vermont. We were talking \nabout whether the foliage season was going to start early or late, and \nwe would make a determined judgment when it would be. Heck, we had not \nthe foggiest idea but, boy, we had fun determining when it would start.\n  No Senator could have learned as much from his fellow Senator as I \ndid, nor could a senior Senator be so patient and understanding with \nhis junior. Throughout our time together, when I had been inclined to \nmove impulsively, it would be Bob Stafford who would help me decide \nwhat was truly in the best interest of the country and Vermont. He was \nthe most unflappable person I have ever known.\n  I remember flying to Vermont with him once on a commercial airline. \nThe plane hit a tremendous amount of turbulence. We suddenly dropped \nthousands of feet. At least one person was airborne in the cabin, and \nthings were flying around. I know my pulse raced ever so fast. When the \npilot finally got control of the plane with a shuddering, banging \nmaneuver, I sat there stunned. I had sweat soaking through my shirt. \nBob simply folded his paper--which he never stopped reading--turned to \nme and in a quiet voice said: Patrick, just think if this plane had \ngone down. Tomorrow morning there would have been a long line outside \nthe Governor's office. Everybody would be saying what a terrible \ntragedy that we have lost our Senators, but, Governor, I am willing to \nbe appointed to either one of the seats. I found that I was not so \nfrightened, and I was able to laugh until it hurt, and I did laugh.\n  Bob Stafford was a man who dedicated his entire adult life to public \nservice because he deeply believed in the value of public service. And \nno matter where life took him, Bob stayed close to his Vermont roots. \nHe never forgot the people he served. While many younger Vermonters and \nAmericans may not know much about Bob Stafford, his public service and \nleadership are examples for all of us. Our country would do well to \nstop and take notice of his life and reflect on how we should all serve \nour Nation better with his bipartisan leadership style.\n  It is with tremendous sadness that I say goodbye to this truly \ndistinguished American, more importantly to an exceptionally dear \nfriend. To honor Robert Stafford's legacy, Senator Sanders and I, along \nwith Congressman Peter Welch from Vermont, introduced a bill to rename \nthe White Rocks National Recreation Area. This is an area Senator \nStafford created in 1984. We are naming it after him. White Rocks was \namong his most beloved natural areas in our State. We know that he and \nHelen could actually see the towering white cliff face of White Rocks \nMountain from their home. This will remind generations of future \nVermonters of Senator Stafford's towering achievements and the humanity \nof his spirits.\n  I hope all my colleagues will support this legislation.\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, on this first day of the 110th \nCongress, I pay tribute to a former Member of this esteemed Chamber. On \nDecember 23, 2006, Senator Robert Stafford passed away. This was a \ntremendous loss for both Vermont and the country. There is no doubt, \nhowever, that his accomplishments in many areas will continue to be \nfelt across this great Nation for countless years to come.\n\n[[Page S201]]\n\n  A native of Rutland, VT, Senator Stafford was born in 1913. Before \nrepresenting Vermont in Washington, Bob Stafford spent years serving \nthe people of our State, including as Attorney General. In 1960 he \nbegan service as Vermont's single voice in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, where he remained until 1971, when he became a Member \nof this hallowed body. During his 17 years in the United States Senate, \nSenator Stafford was known for his commitment to bipartisanship and \ncongeniality.\n  Senator Stafford left his mark on our country in more ways than can \nbe mentioned here today. He had an unwavering dedication to making \neducation within reach of all our country's citizens and today, \ncountless Americans--maybe even some of the younger members in this \nChamber--have benefited from the Stafford Student Loan program. \nAdditionally, his commitment to the environment and public health was \nunshakable. Bob Stafford, from his position as Chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee from 1981 until 1986, worked \ntirelessly to address both air and water quality issues, even when it \nmeant doing so against the wishes of his own leadership, at the highest \nlevels. His courage on all of these issues, and so many others, will \nnever be forgotten.\n  Leaving the Senate did not stop Robert Stafford from contributing to \nthe common good. In fact, he remained active at the state level and \ncontinued to fight for protection of the environment. I can only hope \nthat I will be as engaged for as long as he was.\n  To honor Senator Stafford, Senator Leahy and I, along with \nRepresentative Welch, introduced a bill today to re-designate the White \nRocks National Recreation Area in our fine state as the ``Robert T. \nStafford White Rocks National Recreation Area.'' This is a small, but \nfitting, tribute to his memory.\n  Bob Stafford was a true public servant. I am humbled to be serving \nthe State of Vermont in the seat he once held. He dedicated his life to \nserving others and to creating a better world. My thoughts are with his \nfamily as they mourn his passing. And may the example he set during his \nmany years be emulated for many to come.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I come to the floor briefly to speak \nabout a bill I introduced today on the first day of this 110th Congress \nto signify its importance to our State and to speak about that for a \nmoment.\n  But before I do, I want to give my public congratulations to the new \nleadership of this Chamber, to thank the Senator from Nevada and the \nSenator from Kentucky, the majority leader and the minority leader, for \ntheir gathering together of the Senators today, as the Presiding \nOfficer also attended--a quite historic meeting of almost 100 of us in \nthe Old Senate Chamber--and their commitment to us and to the Nation, \nalthough it was a private meeting, to work in a more collegial, \ncooperative way as this Congress begins and to try to forge the \nbipartisan solutions I think our country called for as a reflection of \nthe outcome of the last elections.\n  I, for one, publicly want to commit myself to that endeavor and to \nwork toward that end, as I continue to work across the aisle with many \nin the other party, and even Members such as the Presiding Officer in \nour own party, in the Democratic Party, to get the job done for our \nStates.\n  In that regard, I introduced this bill today to authorize a project \nand to ask for special consideration for this very important levee and \nhurricane protection project in the State of Louisiana called Morganza \nto the Gulf. As today we look forward into what we are going to do with \nthis new hope and new spring and new era of cooperation, that is \nterrific. But we also need to think about looking a little bit backward \nas to what we did not get done in the last Congress or the Congresses \nbefore so we can pick up that work and move forward.\n  This initiative, Morganza to the Gulf, would fall into that category \nof a project that was actually approved not only by the last Congress, \nthe 109th Congress, but the 108th and the 107th, and started back \nactually decades ago. And because of just a few technical glitches \nresulting in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' failure to timely \ncomplete its report, the contingent authorization of the Morganza \nproject expired. Eventually, the Corps submitted its report more than a \nyear late and\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\nrecommended authorization of the project.\n  Madam President, this project when completed will protect 120,000 \npeople in south Louisiana, many of whom were devastated by two of the \nworst storms and subsequent flooding in the history of our country only \n2 years ago, in 2005. However, these people are left vulnerable without \nthis project being completed. It was part of a major WRDA bill, the \nWater Resources Development Act, of which this Congress worked together \nin quite an extraordinary bipartisan effort, as the Presiding Officer \nknows. You have been a part of that effort.\n  It comes out of the EPW Committee, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Democrats on that committee and Republicans worked very \nhard, into the late hours of the night, trying to get that bill \nthrough. But for a number of reasons, this massive bill, with billions \nof dollars of projects, could not pass in the final hours.\n  But this one project, of all of the projects in the Nation, I believe \ndeserves special attention, not because it is in Louisiana, not because \nSenator Vitter and I represent this, and not only because our State \nreceived devastation from Katrina and Rita but because this is the one \nhurricane protection project that actually had been approved in the \nlast WRDA bill. But because of untimeliness on the part of the Corps of \nEngineers, we could not get it authorized in the last bill, and it \nshould be first to be approved now.\n  I do not know what is going to happen with our WRDA bill. I am \ncertain the Senator from California, who has pledged her support, and \nthe ranking member of that committee, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, who \nis familiar with this, understand the special nature of this issue. \nWhether we can move this independently, I do not know. But I am going \nto ask. Until we are told no, we are going to try. Senator Vitter is \nnot here to speak for himself, but I know he feels very strongly about \nthis, as indicated by his own actions and strong words he has put in \nthe Record. Our House Members, both Republicans and Democrats, could \nmake the same arguments on the House side.\n  I know people may be tired of seeing the Senators from Louisiana and \nMississippi come down and talk about the gulf coast. But it is \nAmerica's energy coast. It is a working coast. There are working people \nwho live in real communities, large and small, whose homes have been \ndevastated, whose churches have been destroyed, whose schools have been \ndestroyed, and who still look to us to help them, to not waste their \nmoney or others' money in the relief but to spend it wisely and well \nand to provide at least the Federal partnership for these hurricane \nprotection levees. And that is what this is.\n  The communities of Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, located in \nsoutheast Louisiana, which are the heart of America's energy coast, are \nwilling and able to do their engineering, to put up their own money, to \nmake sure that the projects are done in an expedited fashion. But they \ncannot begin without this Federal authorization.\n  So I have introduced as stand-alone legislation, the Morganza to the \nGulf of Mexico Hurricane Protection Project, as my first bill, to \nindicate the continued need throughout south Louisiana and the gulf \ncoast for more protection from hurricanes and smart engineering, to say \nwe are not going to stop asking for the things we think are most \ncertainly meritorious of this Congress's attention and to continue to \nsay that with all the challenges of housing, health care, education, \nsmall business recovery, et cetera, that hurricane protection for \nlevees and coastal restoration remains a constant need for the gulf \ncoast and, I would predict, for other coasts around the country that \nneed to wake up to the dangers of rising tides, surges from whatever, \ntsunamis on the west coast, hurricanes on the east coast, as a \npotential, and get serious about the business of stronger \ninfrastructure and better planning about where and where not to build \nclose to the coast.\n  But again, these are working communities that are there--not \nsunbathing, not condos--running ports, laying pipelines, and giving the \nNation the energy infrastructure it needs. These people, just like in \nthe big cities of New Orleans and Baton Rouge and Lafayette and Lake \nCharles--these small communities of Houma and Lafourche and Cocherie \nand Golden Meadow and places that no one in Washington has ever heard \nof, but we visit all the time, deserve the protection of their Federal \nGovernment based on what they contribute to the Nation.\n  So I thank the Presiding Officer for letting me speak for the Record \non this issue. I thank the leadership for giving me this time and \ncommend it for the Senate to consider. Hopefully, we can pass it within \nthe first weeks of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S202-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S202-S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STEWARDSHIP OF THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I want to spend a few minutes today to \nkind of summarize some of the events of the past year and kind of also \nto put the Senate on notice that what this election was about is us \nbeing good stewards with the taxpayers' money.\n  I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. I happen to be \nthe Senator who held that bill up in the wee hours of the morning. \nThere were some real good reasons why I did that. It is a great example \nof the habits that we have to change. There is no question that levee \nsystem needs to be authorized, and it will be authorized this year. \nThere is no question. But there was a drudging component that was added \nto that bill. Nobody knew what it was going to cost, at least $100 \nmillion. That portion had not cleared the committee, and it was \nimportant that we not have habits such as that, to authorize programs \nthat we do not have any idea what they cost.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about bipartisanship. We can all be \npartisan for America. If you go to the Federal Government's Web site \nand go to the Comptroller General, David Walker, and you read what is \nthere--I would encourage every American and every Senator to go read \nit--what you will find is we are on an absolute unsustainable course. \nAnd the problems are bad now. Madam President, we have a $260 billion \ndeficit this year with ``Enron'' accounting statistics, about a $360 \nbillion accounting deficit by real accounting statistics. That is what \nwe are adding to the Nation's debt. That is what our kids get to pay \nback through a decreased standard of living. But I would encourage you \nto go read it. We cannot continue to do what Congresses over the last 5 \nyears have done; that is, we cannot spend new money because there is no \nnew money. So that means if we are going to authorize a new program, we \nneed to make sure a couple things happen. One is we need to make sure \nit does not duplicate something that is already there. And if it does, \nwe need to eliminate what it duplicates if, in fact, it is better \nbecause there is an opportunity cost of funding two programs that do \nthe same thing. One of them does it better, so every dollar you spend \non the one that does it less well costs us money in terms of the value \nfor our children.\n  Let me give you a couple other examples, things where our rules kind \nof mess us up. Because of the budgetary rules, Federal buildings in \nthis country are no longer owned by the Federal Government--new ones. \nWhy is that? For any other business, any individual would, if they are \ngoing to lease a building, try to lease purchase it. Because of our \naccounting rules, we lease them. Because if we lease purchase, then the \nagency has to show the entire cost of the building in their budget that \nyear.\n  Well, it does not make accounting sense. I happen to have a degree in \naccounting. It is crazy accounting. But what it does is force us to \nmake bad financial choices on fixed assets for the Federal Government. \nWe cannot get rid of the buildings that we don't want now. We spend $6 \nbillion--that is billion with a ``b''--a year maintaining buildings the \nFederal Government does not want. That is $6 billion. The Pentagon \nspends $3 billion. That is a total of $9 billion.\n  So if we had the $9 billion, if we could get rid of the buildings we \nwanted to by streamlining that process, we could save $9 billion a \nyear. Madam President, $9 billion would do a whole lot for the people \nof Louisiana as far as this levee system repair.\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\n  We know we can save about $30 billion every 5 years by having the \nbuildings we acquire or lease become lease purchase because then the \ntaxpayer gains from the real estate rise in value associated with those \nbuildings. We have a lot to change in what we do. I am not a partisan \nRepublican, but I am very partisan about the future of this country and \nwhat has to change to do that.\n  Some other examples I would want the American public to know that we \ncould do something about tomorrow: We have an earned-income tax credit \nthat has a 40-percent error rate on it. That means billions of dollars \nevery year get paid to people who do not qualify for their earned-\nincome tax credit, but we do not fix it. We have not fixed it. Shame on \nus. We have $350 billion a year that is owed in taxes to the Federal \nGovernment--that is what the tax gap is this year--that will not be \ncollected.\n  As a matter of fact, last year, the IRS, through incompetency, was \nputting on board a new program. They threw away their old program. But \nthe new program was not ready, so they do not have a way to go back and \ntrack the problem tax payments. That is going to cost us $50 billion, \n$60 billion in lost revenues--one stupid error after another.\n  We have a program to help people with food called food stamps, except \nwe have an error rate there, where we give out $1.6 billion to people \nwho are absolutely not eligible for that program every year. In this \nvery short conversation of what we have talked about, we have talked \nabout over $400 billion that we would have. We would not be running a \ndeficit now if we did some things efficiently.\n  In the last 2 years, the subcommittee I chaired, along with Tom \nCarper, the Senator from Delaware, had 46 hearings oversighting Federal \nfinancial management. We came up with, either from waste, fraud or \nduplication--not counting the tax gap, not counting any of these other \nthings I have talked about--$200 billion of fraudulent, wasteful or \nduplicative programs associated with the Federal Government.\n  What the American people ought to be asking us is, rather than \ncreating new programs, fix the ones we have. Make them efficient. \nEliminate the duplications.\n  I am planning, when I come back, to send a letter to my colleagues \noutlining what my procedures plan to be in terms of blocking new bills \nto the floor. I thought I would read it into the Record tonight so that \nif anybody has any disagreement with it, they would come speak with me.\n  First is for me to agree to a unanimous consent on legislation in the \n110th Congress, the bill has to conform to the vision of the limited \nFederal Government set forth by the Constitution and our Founding \nFathers. In other words, it has to be constitutional.\n  Second, if it creates or authorizes a new Federal program or \nactivity, it must not duplicate an existing program or activity.\n  Third, if a bill authorizes new spending, it must be offset by \nreductions in real spending elsewhere.\n  If a program or activity currently receives funding from sources \nincluding, but not limited to, the Federal Government, the bill shall \nnot increase the Federal Government's share of that spending.\n  Finally, if a bill establishes a new foundation, museum, cultural or \nhistoric site, or other entity that is not an agency or a department, \nthe Federal funding should be limited to the initial start-up cost plus \nan endowment that can be added to through private funding.\n  The way we get out of the problems facing our country starting in \n2012 is to endow the future rather than expand it. If we start endowing \nthings--one of the former Presiding Officers, the Senator from \nArkansas, had a plan to honor Bill Clinton's birthplace home. I am not \nagainst that at all. But the average cost to the American taxpayer for \nevery President's birthplace home--and there are only 22 of them--is a \nmillion dollars a year. Divide that out for a minute. That is $3,000 a \nday to take care of a birthplace home. Most Americans would kind of \nlike to have that to care for their home.\n  The answer to that is to create an endowment with a million dollars, \nset it up as a fund for the Bill Clinton birthplace home endowment. It \ncan never be touched. People can give money to that, and they can care \nfor that. The earnings off of that will be about $60,000 a year. That \nis about $200 a day, or about $5,800 a month. Most people in America--\nas a matter of fact, the vast majority of people in America don't come \nclose to spending that on maintaining their home in a year. So we can \ngenerously endow what needs to happen for the future and use the power \nof compound interest to help secure the future for our kids.\n  My hope is that this spirit of bipartisanship we are starting off \nwith will lead us to do the things the American people want us to do, \nand that is to get control of this behemoth we call the Federal \nGovernment. We can do it if we work together and if we are partisan for \nour children, partisan for the future of our country, and if we will do \nthe oversight. If our oversight is going to point at what President \nBush did wrong rather than what we can do right to fix programs, \neliminate inefficiencies and fraud and waste, we will do much more for \nthe country.\n  I hope the words we have heard today will be acted on the entire 2 \nyears of the 110th Congress. If they are and we follow these \nguidelines, we will see a surplus much sooner than 2012. We can do that \nbut not without the hard work and dedication that says future \ngenerations are worth it, worth us doing what we need to do to make the \ndifference. We could take care of every need of the people in Louisiana \nbecause we have tons of waste where we are spending in the wrong way, \nwhether it is bridges to Alaska or railroads across Mississippi or \nfinancing defense contractors when insurance is going to pay their bill \nanyway; we could do it.\n  We have to stop playing the game and start thinking about the long \nterm. My hand is out to work with anybody, whether on this side of the \naisle or the other side, who wants to solve the fiscal problems facing \nthis country. Then we can get about solving health care and retirement \nprograms associated with Social Security and Medicare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/04/senate-section/article/S203-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ORDER FOR MEASURE TO BE HELD AT THE DESK--S.
