Madam President, reserving the right to object, I wanted \nto have a minute before to explain the lay of the land.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to the chairman and leader of the bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, for the interest of all Members, we have \nbeen working now since Monday to pass a technical corrections bill, \nwhich, it seems to me, should have been passed very quickly. It \nbasically makes some corrections to the last big highway and transit \nbill so certain projects that have been held up for technical reasons \ncan go forward, and others that weren't ready, pushed aside, and \nanother can go forward. This will unleash about a billion dollars' \nworth of important programs for our Nation.\n  These projects have been vetted, and they have been posted on the Web \npage of the committee, as we must do according to our new ethics rules. \nWe are very pleased it looks like we might be able to wrap this up in \nthe next few hours.\n  As far as I am concerned, we are ready to vote. We have the Coburn \namendment and the Boxer amendment, which deal with a real problem that \noccurred at some point during the SAFETEA-LU consideration years ago. \nWe have corrected the problem in the bill. We want to now have some \ntype of investigation to find out exactly what went wrong and if there \nwere any crimes committed. There were two options. Senator Coburn is \nsetting up a complicated select committee of the House and Senate. We \nbelieve strongly that it creates constitutional problems, and we think \nit might interfere with a Justice Department investigation.\n  And then Senator Reid had recommended, I think a far better way to \nget at the problem, which is a Justice Department investigation. I have \nwritten an amendment to go along with that. We are hoping to vote on \nthat and then, hopefully, get to a cloture vote and final passage.\n  So that is the lay of the land, as best I see it. I wish I had more \ncontrol over this at the moment. If I did, we would be voting in 5 \nminutes on the whole package. Until then, I will see you as soon as we \nhave an agreement and, hopefully, we will get this matter done today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       Extension of the Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am on the floor to speak about \nsomething the majority leader proposed and that we have accepted by \nunanimous consent; that is, a 1-week extension of existing farm policy, \nthe existing farm bill.\n  I come to the floor to speak because last night I put a hold on that \nUC request. I, similar to many Senators--and especially American \nagriculture--am growing very frustrated and restless about the reality \nthat we don't have a farm bill. As we know, across America and in \ncentral parts of our country--certainly in the South--spring is here \nand it is planting season. The farm bill that is current law, which we \nextended a few moments ago, actually expired on September 30 of 2007.\n  It was in July 2007 that the House passed their version, and on \nDecember 14 we passed ours. Now, we have offered several extensions so \nthe principals--the House and Senate Ag committees--could work on their \ndifferences with the administration and solve these problems. Yet they \nhave not been able to do it.\n  Is this symbolic of a dysfunctional Congress that we have been \nexperiencing for the last several years, where we simply cannot grapple \nwith the big and responsible basic public policy issues of our country? \nIt appears to be that way. I will blame both sides on this issue. It is \nboth sides that are at fault that they cannot come together and, if you \nwill, split the difference and solve a problem that is the basic public \npolicy for American agriculture. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the \nHouse, opposes the tax provision within the bill. Why? She isn't a \nmember of the Finance Committee or a member of the Agriculture \nCommittee. Yes, she is the majority leader and, therefore, if she \nopposes it, she could certainly block it, and she can kill farm policy.\n  I have worked with Senator Harkin and Senator Saxby Chambliss for the \nlast month, and I know they have worked overtime. This is not a \ncriticism of our colleagues; it is a criticism of a dysfunctional \nsystem that no longer can cut a deal and make basic and important \npublic policy. So here we are, with one more extension. Saxby Chambliss \ncalled me this morning and said: Larry, would you give us another week? \nI said I would give them 1 more week, but, frankly, this is it; I will \nnot accept another extension next week on the farm bill, unless the \ndeal has been cut, unless the agreement has been made and it is simply \nthe procedure of putting it in writing and getting it to print and to \nthe President.\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\n  The President, when he signed the extension last time, said: ``Enough \nis enough.'' Even this week, he softly talked about vetoing an \nextension. So I guess the point I am trying to make is, what is at \nstake? Why are we bickering over the fine points, when the fundamental \npolicy points are in place?\n  Let's look at what we have done, because we ought to be proud of the \nwork of the new farm bill: Significant increases in conservation \nfunding for our working farmlands, including conservation, stewardship, \nand environmental quality incentive programs. These are programs that \nencourage farmers and ranchers to incorporate better tillage practices, \nthereby sequestering more carbon and doing their part as it relates to \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. We have added, for our dairies, \nbetter manure management practices to reduce methane gas emissions. \nHere we are talking about climate change. The President spoke to \nclimate change yesterday. Yet we cannot come to an agreement on \nsomething that would allow American agriculture to advance their \npractices to make it work, in their instance, and allow a contribution \nto the climate change carbon emissions issue.\n  There is a provision within the new farm bill that I and Senator \nStabenow have worked on--literally for 5 years--to get a new provision \nin the farm bill to recognize the near 50 percent of gross revenue \ncoming out of agriculture today, known as specialty crops. For the \nfirst time, we have a new title on specialty crops. If I say at the end \nof the week--and their work is not done--I am not going to extend it \nany more, I am going to have to forgo this. I am going to forgo it and \nsay to the farmers in Idaho and across America: Let's do a 2-year \nextension on existing policy, or at least 1-year extension so you know \nwhere you are when you get to planting season, instead of watching \nCongress fall all over itself because they cannot cut a deal.\n  Isn't it about time we settle our differences and show America we can \nfunction, that we can work the process? Have we truly become so \ndysfunctional and partisan on these fundamentally bipartisan issues \nthat they simply cannot be resolved? On our side, there is a bipartisan \neffort. I cannot speak to the House side. I have not been in the \nnegotiations. I can only see the results. The results simply don't \nexist. That is why this Senator is on the floor today speaking with \nconsiderable frustration over why we have a Congress that, months after \nthe expiration of the law, simply cannot get its work done. Commodity \nprograms maintain a safety net. Yes, commodity prices are high today \nand farmers are profiting. What goes up clearly can, and does, come \ndown in the commodity markets. A property safety net for wheat and \nbarley was in there. It is extremely important we do that.\n  There are nutritional program increases, making the school snack \nprogram nationwide to deal with better health, and fresh fruit \navailabilities for our schoolchildren. That is different and better. \nThe disaster assistance program will help aid our farmers and ranchers \nin a more efficient fashion in periods of serious drought and fire and \nother whole farm types of disasters.\n  There is an issue in agriculture and beef production that has been an \nissue of considerable contention over time. It is called country-of-\norigin labeling. The American consumer today, when they go to the shelf \nand pick up a commodity and look at it, wants to know where it comes \nfrom. Is it a domestic U.S. product or was it produced somewhere else \nin the world?\n  We know we have concern today about certain types of products coming \nout of China and other areas, and the consumer's right to know the \nmarketing certainly is important in country-of-origin labeling. We \nfinally acquiesced to implement country-of-origin labeling by September \nof this year. I don't know if we can do it if we keep shoving the farm \nbill out, keep extending it and not allowing the operative language to \ncome in place.\n  There are critical tax provisions within this bill. My colleague, \nSenator Mike Crapo, has an Endangered Species Act compliance in \nreduction and credits. There are wind energy credits and production tax \ncredits for cellulosic ethanol. Once again, as a nation that has grown \nincreasingly dependent on foreign energy sources, we are saying to \nAmerican agriculture in this farm bill: Here are some incentives for \nincreased production.\n  I was recently in Ottawa, Canada, looking at a cellulosic ethanol \nproduction plant, hoping it will be brought south of the border into \nthe United States so we can begin to use agricultural residues for the \npurpose of making ethanol, lessening the pressure on some of our grain \ncrops, especially our corn crops.\n  There are provisions in the bill to incentivize biodiesel. Yet those \nincentives are the kind Speaker Pelosi says are nonstarters, they are \ndeal breakers. How can making our country energy independent, how can \nincentivizing the promotion of the Endangered Species Act within \nprivate lands and giving folks the benefit of doing that be a deal \nbreaker? It simply demonstrates how this Congress cannot function \ntoday. We are basically on hold right now. We are not getting our work \ndone in a variety of areas, and agriculture and the farm bill is simply \na very tragic example of that type of effort, or lack thereof.\n  As I have said, September 30 of last year the policy expired. Current \nlaw was extended until March 15 and then again until tomorrow, and that \nis why the leader was on the floor today advancing it for 1 more week \nso that agriculture is not without policy in place.\n  This is the 17th. The work has not been done. This Monday, Chairman \nHarkin said he was fed up. If he is fed up and he is a prime \nnegotiator, what do we get? How do we deliver an ultimatum? I am not \nsure. But I am sure we will not, nor should we, allow American \nagriculture to be without policy.\n  All of the gains I have talked about, all of the gains that were \nnegotiated inside the Senate Agriculture Committee and inside the House \nAgriculture Committee could simply be wiped away because there is no \nwillingness or ability to come together and work together in behalf of \nAmerican agriculture.\n  So I agreed on a 1-week extension. This is not an ultimatum, this is \nsimply a statement of fact. I cannot agree any longer. American \nagriculture and Idaho's farmers need to know. They deserve to know. \nThey should not be kept in limbo bouncing on the end of a string \nbecause the politicians in Washington cannot get their act together and \nsimply cannot agree. We have always come to an agreement on \nagriculture. It has always been a bipartisan policy. I hope that \npractice of the past is a practice that ultimately can dominate the \nnegotiations over this coming week.\n  I hope my colleagues will keep their lights on during the weekend. It \nis time we work a little overtime to get this done because I am one of \nseveral Senators who are simply at a point of saying: Can't go there \nanymore; time to finish it; time to tell American agriculture: Here is \nthe new policy. And if we cannot, then let's extend the old policy and \ngive them certainty for a minimum of at least 1 year.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. I request permission to speak as in morning business for \nno more than 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tanker Replacement Program\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, on February 29, 2008, the U.S. Air Force \nannounced its award of the KC-45A air refueling tanker program, a \nreplacement to the aging KC-135 fleet. The two competitors in this \nprocess were Northrop Grumman-EADS on the one hand and the Boeing \nCompany on the other. After a 13-month-long process, the Northrop \nGrumman proposal was selected as the better product for the American \nsoldier and also the better value for the American taxpayer. It should \ncome as no surprise that this decision amounted to a major \ndisappointment for Boeing. Their employees and executives would \nunderstandably have appreciated the economic benefit such an award \nwould have brought to them.\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\n  The award of the tanker program to Northrop Grumman was not the first \nsetback to the Boeing Company in this regard.\n  In 2004, Congress intervened, in the fiscal year 2005 Defense bill, \nto terminate the Air Force tanker lease agreement. This agreement would \nhave been costly and simply bad public policy. Afterward, the Air Force \nresponded with one of the clearest and most transparent acquisition \nprocesses in history. The Air Force is now able to purchase and own 179 \nKC-45s for the same price it was going to spend to lease 100 Boeing \n767s.\n  Compared to the reactions in States where Boeing has a presence, the \nselection of Northrop Grumman was greeted with enthusiasm in Mobile, \nAL, and along the gulf coast of my State of Mississippi, where \nthousands of jobs will be created locally. The tankers will be built in \nMobile, but the economic impact will be felt throughout the gulf coast \nand, in reality, throughout the Nation. Such is the nature of the \ncompetitive process. One contestant is selected, and the other must \ndeal with disappointing news.\n  It is important for Senators to understand that the Air Force and the \nDefense Department utilized an extremely fair and open acquisition \nprocess. The Government requested and received proposals for the tanker \nin early 2007 and then continued with an open review process until \nNorthrop Grumman was announced as the winner in February of this year.\n  In winning this contract, Northrop Grumman simply did a better \nanalysis and provided a better solution for the Air Force. The KC-45A \ncarries more fuel, more passengers, and more cargo. It will also cost \nless to produce, passing along savings to the American taxpayers. By \nutilizing a broad base of suppliers in 49 of our 50 States, the \nNorthrop Grumman tanker will create 48,000 direct and indirect jobs \nacross our country.\n  Despite this, some want to stop this process from going forward. I \nhave been disturbed by the words and actions of Boeing and its \nsupporters. The level of misinformation injected into this process with \nthe clear intent of derailing the award is troubling for many reasons--\nnot the least of which is the precedent that would be set by Congress \nshould it overturn this decision. The Air Force should be allowed to \nmake this acquisition decision based solely on the facts and the merits \nof the two competing proposals, and that is exactly what it did in \nchoosing the Northrop Grumman tanker.\n  Let's look at some of the claims made by Boeing and its supporters--\nfirst, that the competition was somehow unfair. The Air Force and the \nDefense Department testified recently to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that the KC-45A tanker competition was perhaps the most \nrigorous, fair, and transparent acquisition in DOD history. This open \nprocess allowed for a significant amount of dialog among the Air Force, \nthe Department of Defense, and the two bidders. This included weekly \nteleconferences with the Air Force, which, during the review process, \nsent Northrop Grumman 295 evaluation notices. They sent approximately \n250 notices to Boeing.\n  Furthermore, following the formal request for proposals in January \n2007, the Air Force received no complaints from Boeing or anyone else \nthat the proposal request was somehow unfair. There were ample \nopportunities for those concerns to be aired, but no one said a word in \nthis regard. Considering this, it is very hard to make a straight-faced \nclaim that the process was not open or fair.\n  There has also been a high level of misinformation about the so-\ncalled exportation of American jobs. Some erroneously claim the \nNorthrop Grumman award will outsource thousands of U.S. jobs to Europe. \nThis is simply not true. No jobs are being exported to Europe. On the \ncontrary, the KC-45A will create thousands of new jobs in America and \nwill support a total of 48,000 direct and indirect jobs in 49 States, \nas I have said.\n  More than 230 suppliers across the United States helped make up the \n60 percent U.S. content in the KC-45A tanker. This will truly be \nAmerica's tanker, assembled in America by American workers and for the \nprotection of the American military. The KC-45A will be fully assembled \nand militarized for U.S. Air Force operations by American workers in \ntwo separate facilities in Mobile.\n  No sensitive military technology will be exported to Europe in \nconnection with this program. Instead, a new aerospace corridor will \ncontinue to grow and flourish along the gulf coast region.\n  The KC-45A tanker will join the Global Hawk, Fire Scout, joint cargo \naircraft, and the light utility helicopter production facilities that \nare already successfully producing high-reliability defense systems for \nour Nation. The light utility helicopter, for example, is being built \nby EADS North America in Columbus, MS. It is a true success for the \nArmy and for our economy. The Lakota, as the helicopter is known, was \ndelivered to the Army 3 months ahead of schedule. To date, 24 Lakota \nhelicopters have been delivered on or ahead of schedule. The Lakota has \nover 2,000 flight hours, with over a 90-percent full mission capable \nrate. In addition, EADS North America completed a 314,000-square-foot \nexpansion to its Mississippi facility to manufacture this helicopter. \nPerhaps most importantly, the program is on budget and on schedule to \ndeliver a critical platform to the American warfighter--just another \nexample of EADS North America producing a product for our country's \ndefense, using American workers.\n  There should be no doubt that the workforce in the gulf coast region \nis up to the task of building these complex systems. The results to \ndate on the systems I just mentioned speak for themselves.\n  Our workforce is second to none in the Nation. So this debate, as \nmuch as some would make you believe otherwise, is not about American \njobs versus European jobs. It is about where in the United States those \njobs will be.\n  A recent full-page ad in newspapers across the country represented \nthe worst of the misinformation. The ad claimed the Air Force selection \n``penalized the warfighter and the taxpayer.''\n  The facts tell another story. The KC-45A was evaluated to be a \nsuperior product for the warfighter. It was also judged by the Air \nForce to be a better value for the taxpayer, providing superior \nmilitary capability across the board at a lower total cost than the \ncompeting KC-767 aircraft.\n  The U.S. Air Force is not alone in choosing the KC-45A. Our friend \nand ally, the United Kingdom, recently announced the selection of this \nsame aircraft frame as the best solution to meet their national \nsecurity requirements. The U.K. selection is the fifth tanker \ncompetition in a row where the EADS platform was chosen as the winner \nover all other competitors. Australia, Saudi Arabia, and the United \nArab Emirates have also recently placed orders for this tanker.\n  Some are calling for tighter restrictions on the level of \ninternational content in U.S. defense systems. That, to my mind, would \nbe a mistake and would amount to changing the rules in the middle of \nthe game. The U.S. economy is tightly integrated into the global \neconomy, and the aerospace sector is no exception.\n  There are numerous examples of transatlantic cooperation on vital \nU.S. military programs where foreign suppliers do play essential roles. \nSome of the more visible programs include the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter \nproduced by Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and British Aerospace; \nthe VH-71 Presidential helicopter produced by Lockheed Martin and \nAugusta Westland, a European consortium; and the Joint Cargo Aircraft \nproduced by L-3, Boeing, and Alenia, built in Florida from an Italian \nairframe.\n  I don't recall anyone in this Chamber or from Boeing expressing \nconcern about the level of European participation in the Joint Cargo \nAircraft, which has only about 60 percent U.S. content, nor did anyone \ncomplain about possible interruption of supplies of spare parts, which \nsome have suggested would be a likely outcome of buying the KC-45A.\n  To repeat, Boeing's Joint Cargo Aircraft is 60 percent U.S. content \nand 40 percent international. When this contract was awarded, no one \nraised a single complaint about that. Now, when Boeing loses a \ncompetition to a partnership with a similar domestic-foreign ratio, \nthey make it sound as if the world is coming to an end.\n  It seems to me the level of noise depends on whose ox is being gored. \nI\n\n[[Page S3109]]\n\nmust stress this point. Any further delay of this contract would put at \nrisk the brave Americans flying the current Air Force fleet of KC-135 \ntankers. These aircraft, on average, are more than 45 years old. \nReplacement has been the Air Force's top modernization priority for \nseveral years.\n  If the GAO upholds the Air Force selection and denies Boeing's \nprotest, that should be the end of it. At that point, no Member of this \nbody should stand in the way of the program moving ahead. Any further \nefforts to delay the program would not only be harmful to our national \nsecurity but would be viewed by many of our foreign partners and allies \nas a major shift in U.S. policy.\n  From an economic point of view, potential retaliation by our European \nallies could have a negative impact on the current $6 billion in annual \npurchases of defense systems from the United States.\n  In closing, I would like to acknowledge that Boeing has every right \nto protest this decision to the Government Accountability Office. \nBeyond that, however, if this decision is not overturned by GAO, any \nattempt to alter this decision through the appropriations process or \nany other legislative maneuver would be dangerously shortsighted, in my \nopinion.\n  It would set a damaging precedent that would destroy our contract \nprocess now and in the future. Frankly, I would view such a move as an \nattack on the competition process itself, not only this award.\n  The workers along the gulf coast in Alabama and Mississippi and this \nentire corridor are ready to proceed with this work for our national \ndefense. We would all do well to step back and let the facts in this \nsituation speak for themselves. That is what the Air Force did when \nchoosing the Northrop Grumman tanker as the best option for our \nwarfighters' terms and the American taxpayer and their decision should \nbe allowed to stand.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments be in order to H.R. 1195, and that at 3:30 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to Boxer amendment No. 4539, and \nthat the amendment be modified to be to amendment No. 4146; to be \nfollowed by a vote in relation to Coburn amendment No. 4538, and that \nCoburn amendment No. 4540 be withdrawn once this agreement is entered; \nthat each of those two amendments be subject to a 60 affirmative vote \nthreshold, and that if neither achieves that threshold, then it be \nwithdrawn; that if either or both achieve the 60-vote threshold, that \nit be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nthat prior to each vote there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nand controlled in the usual form, and upon disposition of these listed \namendments, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture \non the Boxer substitute, amendment No. 4146; that if cloture is invoked \non amendment No. 4146, then the substitute, as amended, if amended, be \nagreed to, the committee-reported substitute, as amended, be agreed to, \nand the bill then read a third time; and without further intervening \naction or debate the Senate proceed to vote on passage of H.R. 1195, as \namended; that the cloture motion on the bill be withdrawn; provided \nfurther that after the first vote, all subsequent votes in the sequence \nbe limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                             Gas Tax Relief\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, about almost 24 hours ago I had asked the \nchairman of the committee about offering an amendment to this \nlegislation. It is clear that as a result of the agreement that has \nbeen worked out and the filing of cloture and so on that it is not \ngoing to be possible to get a vote on the amendment I was speaking \nabout.\n  But I would like to talk briefly about that amendment and indicate \nthat it would be offered on behalf of Senator McCain, my colleague from \nArizona, as well as other Senators, some of whom may want to also speak \nto it briefly.\n  We all know gasoline prices have risen dramatically. And the \namendment Senator McCain and I and others would offer would provide a \ntemporary tax holiday from Memorial Day to Labor Day, preventing the \nFederal Government from collecting the 18.4-percent tax, the gasoline \ntax, that otherwise motorists would pay.\n  I assure my colleagues that the highway trust fund, which that tax \ngoes into, would be kept whole with Federal revenues from the General \nTreasury. So the money we use to build highways and bridges and so on \nwould not be affected by this amendment.\n  Briefly, I think we all feel the pinch when we fill up our cars and \ntrucks. But listen to these statistics. According to economy.com, \ngasoline prices at the pump have increased from $2.22 to $3.33 a \ngallon, up 50 percent since the start of 2006.\n  I checked in my home State of Arizona yesterday. It was $3.38. There \nis very little that Congress can do in the near term to reduce gas \nprices other than this gas tax holiday. In the long term, we know we \nhave to add more production and refining capacity in our country and \nthat we have to encourage supplies to increase. But for right now, the \none thing that Congress can do, and do virtually immediately, is to \nprovide this short-term relief from the Federal gas tax.\n  At $3.33 a gallon, prices are the highest on record. Nearly 50 cents \nof the cost of each gallon of gas is due to taxes. According to the \nBureau of Labor Statics 2005 Consumer Expenditure Survey, families with \ntwo cars spent, on average, $2,013 on gasoline. Since that study was \nreleased prices have increased dramatically. Gasoline price increases \nimply families are now paying at least $3,065 on gasoline in a year.\n  A big chunk of that is Federal, State, and local taxes. In fact, the \naverage family pays nearly $170 in Federal gas taxes. With the growing \nfinancial strains placed on so many Americans' rising food prices and \nfalling home prices, the additional hit of rising fuel prices is \nbecoming a breaking point.\n  That is why my colleague, Senator John McCain, talked about the need \nto do something, and do something quickly, and proposed this gas tax \nholiday in comments he made to the Nation a couple of days ago, and why \nhe has asked this amendment be introduced on his behalf, as well as \nSenators Warner, Burr, Martinez, Lieberman, and Graham.\n  In an effort to ease some of the hardship caused by the higher fuel \nprices that I have indicated, the amendment would merely suspend the \n18.4-percent-per-gallon tax on gas and the 24.4-percent tax on diesel \nfuel from Memorial Day to Labor Day.\n  As I said, the amendment would not deplete the highway trust fund \nbalance. The amendment would offset any revenue loss from the \nsuspension of this tax with Treasury revenues. So the highway trust \nfound will remain whole.\n  We all agree that our roads and highways must be maintained to ensure \nthe safety of the road-traveling public, and this amendment would in no \nway impact highway construction.\n  It is interesting, last Memorial Day alone, approximately 32 million \nAmericans traveled by car 50 miles or more from home. So suspending the \nFederal excise tax during the summer when fuel prices have historically \nbeen at their highest level would allow millions of Americans to keep a \nfew more of their hard-earned dollars and help them better make ends \nmeet.\n  Two final comments: There is an argument that this loss should be \noffset somehow by programs raising taxes somewhere else. Of course, I \nhave never understood why, if you are going to provide tax relief to \nAmericans, you would want to provide the tax relief and then tax them \nin some other way.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, former Council of Economic Advisers, \nChairman Martin Feldstein, and Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin \nare three of the entities or individuals who have said it is \nunnecessary to offset temporary tax cuts when an economy is slowing.\n  The $150 billion stimulus bill that passed the Senate by a vote of 81 \nto 16\n\n[[Page S3110]]\n\nin early February was not offset. The $15 billion-plus housing bill \nthat passed the Senate 84 to 12 last week was not offset. Most of the \nrevenue losses associated with the housing bill benefited companies and \nother businesses, not consumers. If offsets were not needed to offset \nthe benefit to private firms, I ask why our amendment would need to be \noffset since it aids struggling American families.\n  Finally, I heard rumors that Senators would like to propose an \nalternative to what we have produced, a Democratic alternative that was \ndeveloped yesterday afternoon, that would effectively raise corporate \nincome taxes on oil and gas companies.\n  Now, I suppose everyone likes to pick on oil and gas companies, \nthough we sure want to have some gasoline in the pumps when we decide \nwe need to fill up our cars and trucks, but this proposal eliminates or \ncurtails the so-called section 199 domestic production deduction for \noil and gas companies.\n  What that means in regular English is effectively raising the \ncorporate income tax rate by 3 percentage points. That is exactly the \nwrong medicine at a time when our economy is not doing well. Let me \nrepeat that. The elimination of this tax incentive is designed to \nencourage oil and gas companies to produce oil and gas in the United \nStates so we do not have to go abroad and buy it from somewhere else.\n  I don't agree with this approach. Rather than raising taxes on oil \ncompanies, we should be encouraging them to explore for oil and to \nproduce oil and gas in the United States, to improve our energy \nsecurity and, importantly, to reduce prices for American consumers. Why \non Earth would anyone actually want to limit domestic production? \nReducing domestic production would only make the United States more \ndependent on foreign oil imports and would likely cause consumers to \npay even more at the pump. Besides, a tax increase of the type being \nproposed would have the effect of raising prices at the pump, as costs \nobviously would be passed on to consumers. That would obviously have a \nreverse impact, the exact opposite of what we are trying to do with a \nreduction of the gas tax on consumers of gasoline products.\n  Finally, there is a significant problem with the proposal to repeal \nsection 199 for U.S. oil companies. A proposal to do this passed the \nHouse of Representatives earlier this year. But this very same \nprovision that passed the House would have the effect of keeping the \n199 tax incentive for CITGO, the oil company owned by the Venezuelan \nGovernment; obviously, not a good idea while we are repealing it for \nAmerican companies, to leave that tax incentive for a competitor of our \noil companies owned by the Venezuelan Government. I don't know whether \nthat was unintentional, but that is the effect of the amendment. \nClearly that is not something we would want to do. I don't think we \nwant to hold consumer relief hostage to a tax increase.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4540, Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 4540 \nis withdrawn.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, because we need to \nmove this bill along. There are 500 important projects in it. I have \ncolleagues who want to add more projects. I want to say, for the \nbenefit of everyone, there are some very legitimate technical \ncorrections that still need to be done. I have committed to my \ncolleagues, both Democratic and Republican--I have spoken to Senator \nLincoln, Senator Landrieu, Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Hutchison, only \na few moments ago--that our committee, myself working with Senator \nInhofe and our colleagues, is going to come up with a follow-on \ntechnical corrections bill with the time to ensure it is put together \nright. We do have some different ethics rules these days. We want to \nmake sure we vet everything and everything is put up on the Web site. \nWe have a number of very important technical corrections still to be \ndone, but we are going to do it in the next 3 weeks in committee. We \nlook forward to it.\n  I read a very complex unanimous consent request, and I don't think \nanyone within the sound of my voice could possibly follow all of it. So \nI thought in plain English, for the good of myself as well as my \ncolleagues, I would say where we are. We are going to have a couple of \nvotes on the issue of Coconut Road, which is a real problem for us, and \nit has been straightened out in this bill. We fix the problem. But \nthere are colleagues who want to have an investigation, and we have two \nalternatives. One is the Coburn amendment which sets up what I consider \na very complicated special select committee with Members from both \nbodies. It will have public hearings. It will review things in public. \nIt will do all of that. At the end of that time, what the committee \nwill do is refer something to Justice, if they have found a problem. \nThat is the whole point of the select committee.\n  The problem is, if you read the Constitution, you see the debate \nclause. We believe, from our constitutional scholars on this side, that \nthat whole committee will fall. It will not be able to do its job. The \nHouse has told us they don't see how Senators can investigate House \nMembers and House Members can investigate Senate Members. We think the \nbest way to go, Senator Reid and I and others, is to have the Justice \nDepartment get right in there. Ours is not a sense-of-the-Senate \napproach. We require the Justice Department to move forward. Instead of \nhaving a big Senate-House committee, with the press flashing pictures \nand all the rest, just get to it and ask Justice to investigate. We \nalso worry, if there is a big committee--and there won't be, because \nthe House won't accept it anyway--irony of all ironies, the Coconut \nRoad fix will fall, because we fix it in this bill. If this bill falls \nbecause of this committee--because it is unconstitutional--there won't \nbe a fix to Coconut Road. It is going to go back to the terrible change \nthat somebody made in the dead of night. We don't want that to happen.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject that approach and support the Boxer-\nReid approach which I believe is straightforward. It makes sense. It \ngets right to the heart. If there is a crime, let's find out about it.\n  On the McCain amendment, I actually was looking forward to debating \nit. I hope we will be able to, because there is a lot of dispute about \nhow it would actually work in the real world. There is nothing in the \nMcCain amendment that tells the oil companies they can't pocket the 18 \ncents that is going to come off. We have seen the oil companies. In \nCalifornia, in some places, we are over $4. This hurts our hearts. We \nsee oil company profits soaring. If it were only the cost, they would \nbe having the same profit and passing on the cost. But, no, their \nprofits have gone up. We know about the CEO salaries and all the rest.\n\n  There is nothing in the McCain amendment--I would love to talk to \nJohn about that--that would say to the oil companies: Don't use this as \na moment to raise 18 cents. So where might we be?\n  We might do this, and we would have to now go to the general fund. \nAll taxpayers would have to pay for this. Let's be clear. There is no \npay-for in the McCain amendment--none at all. It goes to the Treasury. \nWho puts money in the Treasury? My taxpayers, your taxpayers, all \ntaxpayers. So taxpayers are now going to pay for this one way or the \nother. We take it away from the users and the taxpayers pay, and there \nis nothing in it that will ensure that the cost won't be nabbed and \ngrabbed by the oil companies. Then they get the extra 18 cents, and we \nhave blown a $9 billion hole in the Federal budget. It is amazing how \nmy colleagues could say, it is a time of stress. We have to do this. We \nneed to be a little bit more responsible.\n  I am looking forward to this debate. I like to pay for things. Maybe \nI am old-fashioned. I am an old economics major. I think it is good to \npay for things. I think we could figure out a way to pay for things. \nBut to say nobody gets hurt when the tab in the McCain amendment is \npicked up by all taxpayers is faulty. We will have to make up that $9 \nbillion. We Democrats think there is a way to do it. We see the profits \nof the oil companies. We say to the oil companies: Good for you, but \nthere is a point at which, when Americans are suffering, you have to do \na little bit more.\n  I, for one, look forward to debating the McCain amendment soon. We \nwill have that debate. But it isn't going to be on this bill. For that, \nI am grateful for this reason: We are bringing this to a close, and \nthis package is in many ways a ministimulus. It will unleash $1\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\nbillion into the economy. It will unleash some of these projects that \nare so important for our people who got stuck for technical reasons or \nhad to have minor changes for other reasons. This $1 billion, when it \nis unleashed, will create tens of thousands of good jobs, jobs building \nhighways, bridges, transit systems. We are very happy, and we expect to \nhave this vote at 3:30. We will have first the Boxer amendment, then \nthe Coburn amendment, then a cloture vote, and then a vote on final \npassage. We should be doing very well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Graham, Martinez, and Wicker be \nrecognized for a total of up to 10 minutes and that following their \nremarks, Senator Kennedy be recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there are a lot of things going on in \nWashington that people probably don't understand and wonder about. How \ncould my Government not do better than it is doing. This is one of the \nareas where most people understand what we are trying to do and would \nappreciate any effort on their behalf to accomplish relieving the gas \ntax for a period of time when a lot of Americans are traveling. If you \nbelieve that a $600 check to Americans that comes from the Treasury, \nthat is not offset, is a good thing to help the economy, like 81 of us \ndo, this builds on that concept.\n  The Senator from California asks what we are trying to do. We are \ntrying to build on some concepts that have already passed the body. We \nare injecting the economy with money so that people, consumers can buy \nmore to help stimulate the economy. We have all agreed on that being a \ngood idea. What is this doing? This is trying to take a Federal tax \nthat affects every American who drives a car during a window of time \nwhen many Americans are going to be on the road doing a lot of things \nthey have looked forward to and planned, to reduce the burden of \ntraveling, to energize the economy, whether it is in terms of \nrecreational travel or business dealings. That will build on the \nconcept we have already agreed on. Now is the time to put money back \ninto the pockets of consumers, and relieving the gas tax during this \ncritical time and during this window of time makes perfect sense. I \ncongratulate Senators McCain and Kyl. This will not be a hard sell to \nanybody out there who is paying taxes and driving a car. I hope we can \nfind a way to make this happen. The public would appreciate it. They \nare going to appreciate the checks they get. The money will go to good \nuse. If we could relieve the tax burden on traveling by 18.6 cents per \ngallon of Federal gas taxes during this window of time, people would \nappreciate it. They understand why we need to do it. It would be a good \nthing for the Congress, and I appreciate Senators McCain and Kyl \nputting this concept on the floor. It is sad we can't get it passed \ntoday, but I hope we do it sooner rather than later.\n  With that, being from South Carolina and Florida and Mississippi, \nwhere people travel to destinations that are attractive to come to, I \nhope we can pass this and help the American consumer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my colleague from \nSouth Carolina. I understand where we are. This amendment has been \nwithdrawn. However, let me touch on this issue for a few moments, \nbecause it is so very important that we give this concept due \nconsideration. In fact, at some point, the Senate should give it an up-\nor-down vote. A gas tax holiday from Memorial Day to Labor Day, which \nhas a number of cosponsors, would allow American taxpayers to suspend \nthe gas tax during that period of time. The fact is we are not in easy \ntimes in America today. We have rising gas prices, falling home prices, \nwhich is resulting in falling home equity opportunities for families to \nutilize their home as a means of defraying other costs in their \nfamily's life. As food prices go up, home prices are going down.\n  The price of gasoline has gone up tremendously. Unleaded regular has \nincreased 53 cents per gallon this year. As a matter of fact, a tax \nholiday of 18 cents a gallon gas tax and 24 cents a gallon on diesel \nfuel from Memorial Day to Labor Day will help American families, will \nhelp those who make a living driving on the road, moving and hauling \nthings through the trucking industry.\n  Why is it important to me as a Senator from Florida? We are a tourism \nState. A lot of tourists travel to Florida by car. In fact, the \noverwhelming majority of tourists come to Florida by car.\n  This is the average working family--the same people we are trying to \nhelp with this economic stimulus. This is allowing a family to throw \ntheir kids in the car and get on one of the interstate highways and \ncome down to Florida and visit the attractions, visit the beaches this \nsummer, and do what people do to bring families together, to be able to \nrecreate, to be able to vacation as families together.\n  This is an economic stimulus to the State of Florida. The State of \nFlorida is in hard times today because of the downdraft in the housing \neconomy. So this would act as a tremendous boost, and it would help \ntremendously the families who are traveling in Florida and coming to \nFlorida.\n  Gas is about $3.38 a gallon for regular in the State of Florida right \nnow. It is a 51-cent increase from what it was a year ago. We get about \n75 million tourists a year who come to the State of Florida. As a \nresult of that, a great deal of economic activity is generated. Over \nthe course of a year, about 25 million families are paying an \nadditional $68 million in Federal gas tax for just one fill-up. That is \non top of the fluctuating prices for a barrel of oil.\n  At the end of the day, we have to recognize this is an opportunity to \nprovide a stimulus to our economy, to help the Florida economy, and to \nhelp the American family to be able to vacation this summer.\n  The Department of Treasury would transfer funds under this amendment \nto make the highway trust fund whole. So, in other words, it is not \ngoing to create a hole in the highway trust fund. It will not mean a \ndiminution in our commitment to maintaining our infrastructure. It is \nsimply going to give families a break between Memorial Day and Labor \nDay. What a great thing. What a great time of year. For the 4th of July \nwe know millions of American families are going to set to the road--\nhopefully, set to the road--if they do not have to break to their kids \nthe bad news because of the situation today. Because of difficult \nfamily budgets, that kitchen table conversation may also include \nsaying: Children, guess what. We have to cancel our vacation to Florida \nthis summer. We can't afford to take the family car. The price of gas \nis too high.\n  This would be a way to give the American family a break.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4538\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment and comment on something else. \nThe distinguished Senator from California, Chairman Boxer, commented on \nthe issue of Coconut Road. It is in my State of Florida. I am very \nconcerned about what occurred in the situation there, which I think is \nwell known to my colleagues in the Senate.\n  The fact is, what happened here is, at best, a questionable \nprocedure. So the reason for Senator Coburn's amendment, which I have \ncosponsored, and Senator Nelson has cosponsored--so it is a bipartisan \namendment--is to try to get at the bottom of it. It is not to try to \ncreate a Justice Department investigation. I do not know if there is \nany criminal wrongdoing that has taken place. These are congressional \nactions which are, frankly, in many ways reprehensible in my view but \nwhich may not rise to criminality.\n  So the issue is, why not just investigate? Let's find out: How did \nthis happen? Because what I would hope we would all want to do is \nprevent this from happening in the future. Do we need to change rules, \ndo we need to change procedures, or do we need to simply allow the \npublic to know who did something like this and what their motivations \nwere? I am not sure it rises to criminality. That is what the Justice \nDepartment does. They investigate criminal conduct. I do think it rises \nto the level of conduct that is not becoming to public officials that \nis not designed to enhance the public trust.\n  The people of southwest Florida, who have tremendous traffic \nproblems--that I-75 is dramatically important to\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\ntheir lives, frankly, as to the cost of fuel, the cost of how much time \nthey spend idling on the highways--want to know what occurred here.\n  All I want to do is allow, through this process, to provide some \nclarity so they can know some answers. I believe the Coburn amendment \nis appropriate. I do not want to see this be created into some \ninquisition by the Justice Department but simply to get some Members to \ncome together around a table and say: How did this happen? What \nhappened here?\n  Let's give the people of southwest Florida the kind of answers they \ndeserve, they demand, and give confidence to the American people that \nthe Congress is acting in the people's best interests and not at the \nbehest of special interests.\n  With that, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on \nboth of these items, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, might I inquire, how much of the 10 \nminutes is remaining from the request of the Senator from California?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and a half.\n  Mr. WICKER. I will do my best.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain and Senator Kyl for putting \nforward this proposal. I was delighted to see it. I would, frankly, \nhope that Democrats and Republicans could come together on this issue \nin a bipartisan manner and provide this temporary relief for hard-\npressed Americans during the summer months.\n  Many people ask us, why are gas prices so high? Why is this \ncontinuing to happen? As we know, there are many complex factors \ninvolved in that: worldwide demand, countries such as China and India \nincreasing their demand for oil and gas at this point; also, unstable \ngovernments in oil-producing regions; and Americans' continued reliance \non foreign sources of oil.\n  But, also, I must confess the problem being experienced by Americans, \nin large measure, is due to Federal policies. In the mid-1990s, \nPresident Clinton vetoed a proposal to drill in ANWR, even though the \nresidents of the State of Alaska have asked us for permission to drill \nthere and have told us they are satisfied it can be done in an \nenvironmentally friendly manner. Also, we have had the refusal to \nproduce energy in America when we know it can be done in an \nenvironmentally safe way, whether that be the production of more crude \noil, oil shale, or liquefied coal.\n  So the Federal Government and this Congress bear a good bit of the \nresponsibility. In light of that, I think we have to ask ourselves--Mr. \nPresident, might I have an additional 1\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I think this Senate--Republicans and Democrats--needs to ask: We have \na choice. Do we ask the Federal Government to tighten its belt a bit \nand adopt this summer-long Federal gasoline tax holiday or do we \ncontinue to require American families to tighten their belts and pay \nhigher gasoline prices? Do we continue to require American farmers and \nsmall businesses, who have to use transportation to earn a living, to \ntighten their belts?\n  I think the better answer there is to provide 18 cents per gallon of \nrelief for American families, 24 cents per gallon of relief to those \nwho are required to use diesel to earn their livelihoods, and for the \nFederal Government to tighten its belt and absorb this $8 billion to $9 \nbillion that the Senator from California talked about.\n  The Senator from South Carolina mentioned we have already passed a \nmuch more expensive economic stimulus measure because we are concerned \nabout the economy. This economy could go either way. We can take action \nto prevent it from sliding into a recession. We have already adopted \none a few months ago. The McCain plan is another one. I \nenthusiastically support the concept. I think it is time we give \nAmericans a break at the pump. This would do so during an important \nperiod as our economy teeters on the edge.\n  I hope we continue to have this debate, as the Senator from \nCalifornia suggested, and adopt it on a bipartisan basis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                      Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate must act to pass the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act, and we must do so now. The House has already \nacted on this bill to restore the basic protection against pay \ndiscrimination as part of our Nation's commitment to equal justice and \nfull civil rights for all.\n  Protecting these fundamental rights and ending discrimination in all \nforms are essential to our success as a nation. Republicans and \nDemocrats worked together to enact our civil rights laws, and the \nAmerican people want and deserve these protections to be implemented in \nfull.\n  The guarantee of equal pay was first enacted in 1963. When President \nKennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, he emphasized that protection \nagainst pay discrimination is ``basic to democracy,'' and those words \nare still true today.\n  In the years that followed, Congress passed other strong, bipartisan \nlaws to strengthen the guarantee of equal pay for millions of \nAmericans. Over the years, the Senate has gone on record time and again \nin favor of fairness and against discrimination.\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted after long, difficult, and \ncontentious debate, but the cause of justice eventually prevailed. That \nlandmark legislation included many important protections, including, \nfor the first time, protection against pay discrimination on the job \nbecause of race, national origin, gender, and religion. That is title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Public accommodations is another \nvery major part of that legislation. But title VII provided these kinds \nof protections against discrimination. That legislation passed 73 to \n27.\n  We went on record again when the Age Discrimination in Employment Act \nwas passed in 1967, with unanimous support in the Senate. Equal pay for \nthose who are older; you are not going to be able to discriminate \nagainst the elderly. It was passed unanimously.\n  The consensus in favor of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which \noutlaws discrimination based on disability in federally funded programs \nand activities, was so strong it passed the Senate by a voice vote.\n  All of us are familiar with the fact that if there is going to be a \ndispute or major differences, people are going to call for a rollcall \nvote, even if there is going to be only a handful of people against it. \nIn this situation, with regard to fair pay, equal pay, in the areas of \nthose people who are working with the disabled, the guarantee was going \nto be fair pay. It, effectively, in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \npassed the Senate by a voice vote.\n  In 1990, the Senate passed the Americans with Disabilities Act 91 to \n6, and it was signed into law by the first President Bush. The first \nPresident Bush has stated--and I have heard him eloquently say it was \nthe most important piece of legislation that passed and he signed into \nlaw. It had protections against discriminating against those who are \ndisabled individuals.\n  We passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 by an overwhelming margin of \n93 to 5. That was a clear vote in favor of fairness. It too was signed \ninto law by the current President's father.\n  On this chart is the list where the Senate has addressed this issue \nof equal pay for equal work. Going back to 1963, these are the \ndifferent Presidents who signed legislation--including President \nJohnson, President Nixon, President Reagan, President Bush. Look at the \noverwhelming votes: a clear indication of what the intention has been \nby this Congress in terms of fairness and justice, and correctly so.\n  Each time we have considered the issue, the Senate has taken the high \nroad. Once again, we must demonstrate that we mean what we say. These \nimportant laws established the bedrock principle of equal pay for equal \nwork, and they have made our Nation a stronger and better and fairer \nland.\n  In these times of economic hardship, working people deserve more than \never the chance to earn a fair day's pay for an honest day's work. Yet, \nas a result of the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision--5 to 4: one vote--\nlast May in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, more American \nworkers will have to endure pay discrimination, without the means to \nstop it.\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\n  Let me show what is happening with regard to women at the present \ntime. We have serious economic challenges we are facing today. But look \nat the overall economic challenges, the downturn in our economy, and \nhow it is playing out in terms of women. Women's earnings are falling \nfaster than men's. We all hear about the falling of purchasing power \namong working families across this country. We can see it is falling a \ngood deal faster in terms of the decline in median wages in the year \n2007 for women.\n  As I mentioned, this legislation also applies in terms of African \nAmericans, the disability community, age discrimination, national \norigin quotas--all of them. Look what is happening with the current \neconomic crisis. Minorities are hit hardest by the economic downturn. \nSo we have the economic downturn going on, and we have this decision \nwhich said the employers are going to be able to discriminate against \nworkers on the basis of race, gender, national origin. It is \nunbelievable that a Supreme Court of the United States, 5 to 4, would \noverturn 5 to 6 major pieces of legislation that were decided \noverwhelmingly by this body over a 30-year period which say we want \nequal pay for equal work.\n  The list goes on. We know, basically, women make 77 cents for every \ndollar paid to men. That is existing. These are the current data of the \nU.S. census in 2007. So this is the current situation, generally. What \nwe are trying to do is change this; to get equal pay for equal work. \nBut inherently, this is where we are in 2007, and unless we change \nthis, it is going to continue or probably even grow worse.\n  It is reflected, as we would expect, in family income. This chart \nshows we are talking about equal pay for women, and this legislation \nalso applies to African Americans and national origin. Here we have \nAfrican-American men receiving 21 percent less pay than White men. We \nfind the same for Latinos. They are affected by this decision as well. \nLatinos receive 72 cents for every dollar earned by White workers. This \nshows the distinction, the annual distinction, about $8,000 a year. \nThis has been true.\n  So we know we are facing a difficult economic time. We also know the \npeople who suffer the most are the people--whether it is women, whether \nit is African Americans, whether it is Latino, whether it is disability \nor whether it is elderly, all those groups are affected by the \nLedbetter decision, and in the face of 30 years of this Congress saying \ntime and time and time again, in a bipartisan way, we are going to \ninsist on equality of pay for equal work. That is the issue. That had \nbeen the law. This legislation we are talking about with Ledbetter, we \nare trying to go back to what the law was.\n  This chart indicates--the light green is what we would go back to, \nand the dark green is where the EEOC held the same as we are proposing \nin this legislation. This had worked and worked effectively. That is \nwhy the CBO said this isn't any further additional burden on industry \nor business. We are going to hear that argument. We have the CBO study \nwhich says that, because basically most employers want to do the right \nthing. They understand it, they respect it, and they want to do the \nright thing. So they are not going to be penalized; it will be others \nwho will be penalized.\n  On this final point, as I mentioned the different groups affected, \nthis shows pay discrimination hurts all kinds of Americans. This orange \ndepicts the disabled, this is national origin, 760. These are cases of \npay discrimination charges, including 2,470 in terms of the gender; and \non race, 2,352; on age discrimination, 978. So this is 7,000--these are \nthe cases that are brought. Most estimates are it is in the hundreds of \nthousands of actual cases that are out there that people don't know \nabout.\n  Lilly Ledbetter didn't know about the fact that she was being \nshortchanged for years and years and years because people keep the \npayroll secret. Finally, she hears from others who are working and who \nare doing comparable work, and she gradually puts it together that she \nhas been shortchanged. Sure enough, she had been shortchanged for years \nand years and years. The local jury made the decision to pay the \ndamages and the Supreme Court overruled it and said: You are out of \nluck, Lilly Ledbetter. You should have brought your case within 180 \ndays of the time you were employed. Even though you didn't know about \nit, you still should have brought it. Even if you didn't know about it, \ntough luck. You have no remedies. No remedies. No remedies. It has been \ngoing on for years. None. That is fundamentally and basically wrong, \nand that is what we are changing.\n  We have very strong support for this legislation. We have the support \nof various groups, including the American Association of People With \nDisabilities; the AARP, obviously, because of discrimination of the \nelderly; Business and Professional Women, the NAACP, United Auto \nWorkers, National Congress of Black Women, the Religious Action Center, \nU.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce. They understand it and see it. The \nlist goes on. I will include a more complete list with my remarks for \nthe Record.\n  Many people give speeches on fairness and the need to help people in \nthese tough economic times. An important way we can do so is by proving \nwe still stand strongly against pay discrimination, that we would not \nallow the rights workers thought they had to be undone by misguided \ncourt decisions. Fair treatment for all employees is especially \nimportant now. As I mentioned, our faltering economy is hitting working \nfamilies hard. There were 230,000 jobs lost in the first 3 months of \nthis year. Unemployment rates climbed. Over 1 million working men and \nwomen have joined the unemployed since this past year.\n  Few doubt that we are now in a serious recession. It has been \nparticularly hard on women and minorities and on workers--particularly \nhard. Of the 80,000 jobs that were lost in this last month, 50,000 were \nconstruction workers. The unemployment rate among women has risen \nsharply in the past year. Minorities are suffering more. Unemployment \nfor African Americans is now well over 9 percent, almost twice the \nnational average.\n  The impact of unfair pay practices is staggering. Today, as I \nmentioned, women still earn 23 percent less than men; African \nAmericans, 21 percent less than White men; and Latinos earn 72 cents \nfor every dollar paid to White workers.\n  In fact, the financial security of all working men and women is \nundermined by this recession. Workers are suffering already, and \nmillions increasingly find their paychecks do not go far enough. They \ndon't deserve to bear the additional burden of discrimination in their \npay. The cost of this discrimination becomes more and more intolerable \nover time. Lilly Ledbetter lost tens of thousands of dollars over the \ncourse of her career because every paycheck made the burden of the \ndiscrimination even greater.\n\n  There is no doubt that the Supreme Court's decision in the Ledbetter \ncase has left employees without one of the fundamental protections \nagainst pay discrimination that Congress intended them to have. The \nCourt decision undermined their ability to hold employers accountable \nfor such discrimination by imposing serious and unnecessary obstacles \nto ending the discrimination against them.\n  Under the Ledbetter case, the time limit for filing of pay \ndiscrimination claim begins to run, as I mentioned, when an employer \ndecides to discriminate--not when the worker finds out about the \ndiscriminatory paycheck. Employers who conceal their illegal action for \n180 days are free to discriminate. They can pay women less than men. \nThey can pay African Americans less than Whites. They can pay older \nAmericans less than younger ones and pay religious minorities and \npersons with disabilities less than other workers. These employees can \nnever, ever obtain relief. Paycheck after paycheck can keep \nimplementing the discrimination, and workers have no way to hold \nemployers accountable.\n  Clearly, the decision has opened up a flagrant loophole in our civil \nrights, and the Congress cannot let it stand. Under this bill, the 180-\nday clock restarts with every discriminatory paycheck, so employees can \nchallenge ongoing discrimination, even if their employer successfully \nhides its true motives at first.\n  Lilly Ledbetter was one of the few women supervisors at the Goodyear \nTire and Rubber Company in Gadsen,\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\nAL. She worked at the plant for almost two decades, constantly fighting \nto prove that women could do a job traditionally done by men. She \nendured insults from her male supervisors. She was told the plant \ndidn't need women. Yet she persevered and gave the company a fair day's \nwork. She had children and both she and her husband were working hard \nto support them. She had no idea Goodyear was not living up to its \nresponsibility to pay her fairly.\n  For almost two decades, the company discriminated against her by \nusing discriminatory evaluations to pay her less than her male \ncolleagues who performed exactly the same duties. Many of those male \ncolleagues had less seniority and experience than she had, but they \nwere still paid more than she was for identical work.\n  The jury saw the injustice of Goodyear's mistreatment of Ms. \nLedbetter and awarded her full damages. Five members of the Supreme \nCourt ignored that injustice and ruled Ms. Ledbetter was entitled to \nnothing at all--nothing at all--because she filed her claim too late. \nThe Court's decision gives countless employers a free hand to conceal \nand continue illegal discrimination and leaves workers powerless to \nstop it.\n  The bipartisan Fair Pay Restoration Act will restore the clear intent \nof Congress when we passed the important laws I mentioned earlier. It \nwould restore the fair and reasonable rule that applied in the vast \nmajority of the country until May 29 of last year. If we pass this \nbill, we can go back to the longstanding rule that the clock begins to \nrun for filing a pay discrimination claim on the day a worker receives \na discriminatory paycheck, rather than the day the employer first \ndecides to discriminate.\n  By enacting this law, we will restore a rule that reflects how pay \ndiscrimination actually occurs in the workplace, and it will give all \nworkers a fair means to stop ongoing discrimination and obtain fair \ncompensation for the discrimination they have endured. By doing so, we \nwill also be helping to prevent employers from engaging in such \ndiscrimination in the first place.\n  There is nothing radical about the changes this bill will make. It \nsimply restores the law employers and workers had lived with for many \nyears, until last May 29, the date of the Supreme Court's distressing \ndecision.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in restoring the full strength of the \nantipay discrimination laws we have enacted in the past. Let's take a \nclear stand for all working men and women and pass the Lilly Ledbetter \nFair Pay Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list of supporters \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Organizations in Support of the Fair Pay Restoration Act (S. 1843)\n\n       LCCR; 9to5, National Association of Working Women; \n     Advocacy, Inc.; Alliance for Disabled in Action; Alliance for \n     Justice; American Association of People with Disabilities \n     (AAPD); AARP; American Association of University Women; \n     American Civil Liberties Union; American Federation of Labor \n     and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO); American \n     Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); \n     American Federation of Teachers (AFT); American Humanist \n     Association; American Library Association; Anti-Defamation \n     League; Asian American Justice Center; Association for Women \n     in Science; Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law; Business \n     and Professional Women.\n       Center for Inquiry; Center on Women and Policy; \n     Clearinghouse on Women's Issues; Coalition of Labor Union \n     Women (CLUW); Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities Rights \n     Task Force; Educational Foundation of America; Easter Seals; \n     Equip for Equality; Equal Rights Advocates; Federally \n     Employed Women; Feminist Majority; Healthy Teen Network; \n     International Union, United Auto Workers (UAW); Jobs with \n     Justice; Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law; \n     League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC); Legal \n     Momentum; Let Justice Roll Living Wage Campaign; MANA--A \n     National Latina Organization; Mexican American Legal Defense \n     and Educational Fund (MALDEF).\n       NAACP; NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc.; \n     National Academy of Engineering; National Association for \n     Girls and Women in Sports; National Association of Collegiate \n     Women Athletic Administrators; National Associations of \n     Commissions for Women; National Center for Lesbian \n     Rights; National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence; \n     National Coalition for Disability Rights; National \n     Committee on Pay Equity; National Congress of Black Women, \n     Inc.; National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW); National \n     Council of Women's Organizations; National Disability \n     Rights Network; National Education Association; National \n     Employment Lawyers Association; National Fair Housing \n     Alliance; National Gay and Lesbian Task Force; National \n     Organization for Women (NOW); National Partnership for \n     Women & Families; National Senior Citizens Law Center.\n       National Women's Conference Committee; National Women's Law \n     Center; National Women's Political Caucus; NETWORK, A \n     National Catholic Social Justice Lobby; OWL--The Voice of \n     Midlife and Older Women; Paralyzed Veterans of America; \n     People For the American Way (PFAW); Religious Action Center; \n     Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law; Service \n     Employees International Union (SEIU); The Disability Law \n     Center of Massachusetts; The Impact Fund; The WAGE Project, \n     Inc.\n       U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce; USAction; Veteran \n     Feminists of America; Wider Opportunities for Women; WIN \n     Group International; Women Employed; Women Work!

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe I have an obligation to say a few \nthings about the amendments offered by Senators Coburn and Boxer \nregarding the investigation of the Coconut Road controversy.\n  As most of my colleagues know, there are reports that a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives arranged to have the text of the 2005 highway \nbill changed during the enrolling process, which is quite unusual. This \nwas after the bill had passed both Houses. Serious allegations have \nbeen made about the motives of this Member for doing this. The facts \nare not certain, but some say they are clear.\n  The junior Senator from Oklahoma has done an important service by \nshining public attention on this matter. The facts are not yet all \nknown, as I have just said, but if these allegations--or some of them--\nare true, this is one more example of the corruption that permeated the \nCongress in recent years. We have two Members of Congress who have gone \nto prison. We have staff members who are in prison. Some are on \nprobation and have pled guilty. So it is fair to say there was a lot of \ncorruption in recent years.\n  Just last year, the new Democratic Congress passed S. 1, the most \nsweeping lobbying reform effort in the history of our country, in an \neffort to restore public trust in Congress. These reforms are already \nchanging the way business is done in Washington. Lobbyists have less \ninfluence, and there is more transparency in the legislative process.\n  We all agree that any misconduct in the legislative process should be \nfully investigated. Specifically, we want to get to the bottom of this \nalleged misconduct involving the Coconut Road provision in the 2005 \nhighway bill. The only disagreement between Senators Coburn and Boxer \nis how the investigation should be conducted.\n  Certainly, an investigation of the conduct of a Member of the House \nof Representatives should be done by the House. I think we get \nourselves into a problem we should not, constitutionally or morally, by \nhaving the House tell us what we should do as far as our own Senators. \nWe should not be telling them what they should be doing regarding House \nMembers. Our Constitution does not provide the Senate with authority to \ndirect a House committee to initiate any kind of action like that.\n  The Coburn amendment proposes a committee of Members from both the \nHouse and Senate conduct this investigation. But I believe Senators \nshould not and cannot investigate a House Member any more than a House \nMember should or could investigate a Senator. Although Senator Coburn's \ngoal of fully investigating the incident is worthy--and I think \neveryone shares his goal--the Senator's amendment is at odds with \narticle I of the Constitution.\n  If we send this constitutionally dubious amendment to the House, it \ncould jeopardize the entire highway technical corrections bill. Why do \nwe want to mess with that? We should not. That is why Senator Boxer has \nproposed that the Justice Department review the allegations of criminal \nmisconduct.\n\n  I would want everyone to recognize that in law, there is this saying: \nWhat are you trying to do, make a Federal case out of it? Why do we say \nthat? Because it puts the fear into people because they know the \nJustice Department does a better job than anyone else investigating \nwrongdoing.\n  So what Senator Boxer proposed is to let the Department of Justice \nreview the allegation of criminal conduct, which is the right way to \ngo, and it is not an easy way to go.\n  According to public reports, the Justice Department and the FBI may \nalready be investigating related matters, and who knows, maybe this \nprecise matter.\n  If violations of Federal criminal law occur, it is in the province of \nthe Justice Department and FBI to investigate and prosecute. The Boxer \namendment simply calls on the Justice Department to review allegations \nof impropriety and find if Federal criminal laws have been broken.\n  The Boxer amendment asks the Justice Department to act in an \nappropriate manner. In fact, to be precise, it says the Department \n``shall act consistent with applicable standards and procedures.'' In \neffect, we are asking that this be made a Federal case. This phrase \nrecognizes the importance of separation of powers that we have in our \ngreat country. The language incorporates the principles, privileges, \nand responsibilities that guide Congress's exercise of its \nconstitutional authority to discipline itself. It also remains true to \nthe principles of legislative autonomy and fair, neutral enforcement of \nthe laws.\n  This amendment does not waive any legislative privileges of Members \nor committees of Congress. It does not seek to intrude upon the \nconstitutional duty of each House of Congress to discipline its own \nMembers, nor does it alter the duty of the executive branch to \nfaithfully execute laws.\n  The amendment simply memorializes the reality that there are serious \nallegations that may rise, perhaps to the level of criminal violations.\n  Again, what we are trying to do is make a Federal case out of this. \nIt is entirely appropriate for the Justice Department to assume this \nresponsibility.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Boxer \namendment and oppose the Coburn amendment. I express my appreciation to \nSenator Boxer for her hard work on this bill and certainly on this \namendment. Those of us who know Senator Boxer know how tenacious she \nis. We have had the good fortune to work together for almost 26 years \nin Congress. I have the greatest affection, admiration, and respect for \nher as a person and her legislative skills and abilities. They \ncertainly have been made very apparent with the work done on this \nlatest piece of work which we hope will be completed in an hour or so \nfrom right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before the majority leader leaves the \nfloor, I thank him very much because he helped me enormously in this \nwhole matter of an investigation. What we all want to do is get to the \nbottom of what happened with this Coconut Road situation, where it \nappears as if there may have been some activity that merits punishment.\n  When we heard that Senator Coburn wanted to take on this issue, we \nwelcomed that because we do believe we have a responsibility to regain \nthe trust of our people. That is why under Senator Reid's leadership we \npassed the most far-reaching ethics reforms ever.\n  I see my friend is in the chair. She is part of the new class of \nSenators who pushed very hard for that legislation. Therefore, when \nSenator Coburn came forward, we believed we certainly wanted to do \nsomething. But what Senator Reid, because he is a distinguished \nattorney, taught me is, there is a speech and debate clause in the \nConstitution, and this investigation with a select committee, House \nMembers and Senate Members investigating each other and staff, could \nfall.\n  Here is the point, before my friend leaves the floor. The irony of \nall ironies is, if, in fact, the Coburn solution were to be adopted \ntoday and it did go forward, although we think it will bring the whole \nbill down, it wouldn't.\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\nBut let's say it is adopted. Nothing they do would really lead to \nanything until the end of their hearings. I call it kind of a circus \natmosphere where colleagues would come, flashbulbs in everybody's face, \nand they take testimony. Nothing of consequence would occur, I say to \nmy friend, until the end when they decide if there was something the \nJustice Department needed to look into.\n\n  Why have all that hoopla when you can get to the heart of the matter, \nwhich is saying to the Department of Justice: We want you--and this \nwill require them. It doesn't say you ``may,'' it says you ``shall'' \nlook into this. If the bill did fall, here is the totally irony: The \nfix to Coconut Road would fall. In other words, in the technical \ncorrections bill, we fix the problem. If this whole thing falls because \nof the Coburn amendment, then we go back to the real problem of \nsomebody changing the route of this particular road or building, \nfreeway, whatever it was that was going to increase somebody's \nproperty. That would be the worst of all worlds.\n  I thank my leader for his help on this matter. He knows when I heard \nabout this amendment, I said to him: Yes, we need to look into this, \nand he wanted to do it in the right way. He and his staff have been so \nhelpful in getting us to this point where we have a very good \nalternative. I hope everybody votes for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I hope everyone heard what the chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee just said. If we are unable \nto pass this technical corrections bill, which we hope to do in an \nhour, an hour and a half, if we fail to do that, the fix that was put \nin the bill, the technical correction that was made to take care of the \nCoconut Road problem would not be taken care of. That would be a \ntravesty and a circular road to nowhere.\n  I even hope my friend, Dr. Coburn, would withdraw his amendment. He \nperhaps will not do that, but I hope that everyone, Democrats and \nRepublicans--this is not a partisan issue. It deals with housekeeping \nthat we do. It is important.\n  I say to my friend, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, she also has another job that is extremely difficult and \nextremely important. She is chairman of the Ethics Committee. Having \nserved on that Ethics Committee and having chaired that committee for a \nlong time, I know it is a tough job. This gives me an opportunity \npublicly to say--and I think all Senators will extend this appreciation \nto her, Senator Cornyn and the other four Members who serve on that \nmost important committee, for the dedication and the hours they spend \naway from the cameras. These are in closed hearings talking about \nallegations made against individual Senators. They have done, and they \ncontinue to do, a remarkably good job.\n  There is no one who is in a better position today to talk about what \nis going on in the Senate with matters of violations having been \nalleged than the Senator from California.\n  What I think the amendment does is focus attention on the Justice \nDepartment, just where it should be. I hope everyone will go along with \nthat amendment, Democrats and Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, today I stand on the Senate floor and \ncontinue a very important discussion that I began with all of my \nRepublican classmates in the Senate several weeks ago. It is about the \nneed for dramatic, bold, health care reform in this country.\n  We adopted this as a class project, if you will. Again, I thank my \ncolleagues Senators Thune, Burr, DeMint, Martinez, Isakson, and Coburn \nfor their hard work on this important debate, on this important \ndiscussion.\n  Again, the idea is very simple: to put forward our conservative, \nfree-market principles and what vision that leads to in terms of \nnecessary, bold, transformative health care reform, and also to provide \na clear contrast between that vision and the alternative, which is \nclearly in our mind a big government solution, a one-size-fits all \nsolution that has the government role in health care grow and grow and \nprivate individual choice lessened and lessened.\n  In the first week of this discussion on the Senate floor, I rose and \nlaid out our broad principles and where we wanted this discussion to \nlead. Again, as I said that week, I believe there is great consensus in \nAmerica, almost universal consensus that our health care delivery \nsystem is badly broken and that major reform needs to take place. But, \nof course, having said that, the hard part is figuring out what that \nchange is and how it can work best for the American people.\n  As I said in those introductory comments, I believe the broad choices \nare clear. Our conservative, free-market vision is to empower the \nindividual, to maximize choice, to help everyone get good private \ninsurance that is accessible and affordable, to use taxpayer dollars \nwhere appropriate to help the truly poor afford that sort of good \nprivate insurance that stresses preventive care and other measures that \nwill bring down health care costs. But that is a very different vision \nfrom one based on Government first and foremost, based on Government \nprograms, one-size-fits-all, growing those programs and in the process \nlessening individual choice and responsibility and lessening the \nsanctity of the individual doctor-patient relationship.\n\n  In the second week of our discussion, our colleague John Thune came \nto the floor and elaborated on a very important component of this \nmessage, which is that we want to stress a choice of private health \nplans as a predominant factor in American health care versus Government \nprograms, or the one-size-fits-all, pushing people more and more in \nthat direction and increasing the dominance of Government in this very \nmajor sector of our economy.\n  Following up on that, I come to the Senate floor this week to talk \nabout a closely related principle and closely related theme, which is, \nagain, opting for individual choice and incentives versus forced \nenrollment or forcing action upon citizens by the Government. Again, \nthis is a crucial element of our vision for the dramatic, bold health \ncare reform we need.\n  We believe firmly and we believe strongly that individuals are \ncapable of choosing their own health insurance plan and that we must \ncontinue to focus on individuals and empowering individuals with \nchoices and with incentives, not forcing individuals in a certain \ndirection. So we are opposed to forcing people to enroll in certain \nplans rather than providing incentives for individuals to make rational \nchoices that fit their own circumstances.\n  Congress should be pushing reform that creates those incentives for \nindividuals, for employers, for insurance companies, and for States to \ncome up with innovative solutions. We shouldn't be forcing mandates \ndown people's throats, forcing them to enroll in any particular big \ngovernment or other program. The way we can most effectively maximize \nthis choice and empower the individual is through the Tax Code, \ncreating options for families and individuals through the Tax Code that \nhelp those families buy insurance, that create those incentives that \nmake sure it is accessible and affordable for everyone.\n  Now, as I suggest, Madam President, I have some pretty fundamental \nphilosophical objections to mandating action on people. But in addition \nto that, I have some very practical concerns. If we look at other \njurisdictions--States, even other countries--that force these mandates \non people, we find they really don't work in the end.\n  A few examples. Hawaii--obviously a State--has a mandate that all \nemployers must provide their workers with health insurance. Well, they \nthink that is a magic wand that just automatically solves the problem. \nBut it doesn't. First of all, unfortunately, it creates a barrier in \nmany instances to creating jobs, increasing employment, and growing \nbusiness. So that is a problem. But even beyond that, it doesn't insure \nall workers. In fact, in Hawaii, 10 percent of workers--not unemployed \npeople, not nonworkers, but\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\n10 percent of workers--- do not have health insurance. So there is the \nvery practical issue of simply throwing out an edict, a mandate from \nthe Government which doesn't accomplish the goal.\n  Another example is Canada. Canada requires everyone to be covered. \nAgain, that creates significant challenges in actually making that \nhappen and enforcing that rule. For instance, in the province of \nBritish Columbia alone, more than 40,000 people somehow slipped through \nthe cracks or slipped through that mandate. It isn't a magic wand, and \nit doesn't get done.\n  So we believe there is a better way, and that is to maximize choice, \nempower the individual, and create incentives. That will get a great \nnumber of people enrolled and provide more affordability and access to \nhealth care.\n  We believe, as a part of that, that existing Government programs can \nbe improved and modernized and made more efficient. And that is \nimportant. But we are opposed to attempts which often come up in this \nbody and the other body of Congress that try to significantly expand \nthese programs well beyond the bounds of how they were originally set \nup, well beyond the core constituencies or income levels for which they \nwere established. We believe that is going down the path of big \ngovernment, nationalizing health care, making government the dominant \nforce by far, and we don't want to do that.\n  We also believe that encouraging competition in the marketplace is \nkey to lowering health care costs. So we are opposed to price controls, \nprofit ceilings, rigid expensive requirements, and mandates that \nusually end up doing exactly the opposite.\n  We believe in recognizing that seniors have increasingly turned to \nMedicare Advantage Plans because they offer a better value and in many \ncases a higher quality of care than traditional fee-for-service \nMedicare. So we are opposed to efforts to dismantle these programs and \nagain lessen choice, lessen individual responsibility and choice, and \npush folks in one certain direction--back to a one-size-fits-all \ntraditional Medicare fee-for-service.\n  We also believe that taxes should be as low as possible and that the \nTax Code should be changed to put money back into families' hands, \nwhich would allow them to purchase their own health insurance. We are \nopposed to increasing taxes and using that money to pay for a big \ngovernment one-size-fits-all model.\n  Madam President, I look forward, as do all of my Republican Senate \nclassmates--Senators Thune and Burr, DeMint, Martinez, Isakson, and \nCoburn--to continuing this discussion, continuing this debate. As I \nsaid at the beginning, I believe virtually all of America agrees that \nthe American health care delivery system is badly broken, that we are \nin desperate need of not just tinkering around the edges but bold, \ndramatic reform. So we want to come forward and lay out those \nconservative and market-based principles that we believe are the right \ntype of change, the type of reform Americans want, reform that empowers \nthe individual, that respects that individual doctor-patient \nrelationship, and that maximizes choice and creates incentives, and not \nthe wrong choice that grows big government, that lessens choice, that \nincreases mandates, that pushes individuals in a certain direction \nrather than allowing them to understand what best meets their needs.\n  Next week, Madam President, we will continue the discussion as \nanother of my Republican Senate classmates takes to the floor to talk \nabout another issue in this important debate, and I look forward to \nlistening and participating in that discussion.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Coburn and Boxer Amendments\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wish to spend a few minutes just to \nmake some observations during this short debate we are going to have \nbefore the amendments are voted on.\n  We are going to have a vote on the Boxer amendment and then on the \nCoburn amendment, both trying to get to the bottom of a problem. We \nhave agreed to a 60-vote margin on both of those, but I wonder what \nhappens to this issue if neither of those amendments gets 60 votes, and \nwhy are we having a 60-vote margin? Everybody agrees that this \namendment about a postenrollment change to a bill needs to be solved. \nThe mystery surrounding how it happened, where it happened, and why it \nhappened needs to be solved. But now we have before us a hurdle which, \nin all likelihood, will eliminate our ability to find out.\n  It is claimed, and understandably, that my amendment would look into \na problem in the House. That assumption, however, is incorrect because \nnobody knows exactly where this enrollment change happened. Some may \nthink they do, but we don't know that.\n  Second of all, and probably more importantly, is the fact that a bill \nagreed to by both Houses of Congress was changed before it got to the \nPresident without our knowledge.\n  There also is the claim that if, in fact, we would have a bipartisan \ncommittee, with Members of both Houses looking into this, it is somehow \nprecedent setting. It is not. In 1992, the House and Senate did \ncombine--not on this specific issue--so there is a precedent there that \nno one can deny, that we looked at rules and processes and procedures, \nand we did that without any difficulty.\n  On the other side of the aisle is the Boxer amendment, which says we \nare going to ask the Justice Department. We are not going to ask them, \nactually, we are going to tell them that they shall do this.\n  The argument has been made that the speech and debate clause is \nviolated by my amendment. I don't think that is accurate, but I will \ntake that as an argument. But for the Boxer amendment to pass, the \nseparation of powers will be violated. These are not laws. These are \nrules of Congress. Yet we are going to now invite in the executive \nbranch to handle what we refuse to handle? The cynicism in me says that \nmaybe we don't want to know the answer to this question.\n  We very simply could have had a majority vote on both of these, and \nthe one that got the most votes would have won. We don't have the \nparliamentary power to force that to happen, and we do have the \nconcurrent agreement of the chairwoman of the EPW Committee to have a \nvote, which I appreciate. I would not tell her that I do not appreciate \nthat. I do appreciate the opportunity to have a vote. But the question \nstill remains: What happens if we don't get 60 votes? Will something \nhappen on this?\n  What I want us to do is restore the integrity of the enrollment \nprocess. If we fail to do that, if we fail to do that and if we invite \nthe executive branch into our Houses, we have failed--we have failed to \nlive up to our own responsibility in the Senate and in the House, and \nwe have failed to protect what is truly a separation between us and the \nexecutive branch in how we have gone about it.\n  So I thank the good nature and good humor of the chairman of the \ncommittee for the lively debate we had yesterday. But, someday, \nsomebody will write about this issue, and I am not sure history is \ngoing to be very kind to us as we worry about partisan issues, who gets \ncredit, who didn't, pointing fingers.\n  The fact is, we have a problem that should be solved by a joint group \nof Members of this body. To say we can't do that denies the fact that \nwe have integrity. We do have integrity. We do have honor. We do have \ncommitment. And most of all, we want to build the confidence of the \nAmerican people in Congress. I believe that will happen under my \namendment. I am not sure it will happen if we don't pass it. As a \nmatter of fact, I am certain that if we don't have one of these that \ngets accepted in conference, we will not be able to claim that.\n  I have heard the statements of the chairwoman of the EPW Committee, \nand I believe her statements. So whatever happens here, it is my hope \nthat she will encourage that to happen in conference. It won't be \ntelling the House what to do; rather, it will be asking them to concur \nthat we ought to look into this.\n  Washington has a problem, and the problem is this: We are not \nbelievable\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\nto the American public. More than 70 percent of the people in this \ncountry have no confidence in us, and we ought to be about repairing \nthe institution and repairing that confidence.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank my colleague for bringing this \nissue to our attention. I think he knows that in the beginning there \nwere some voices that said: Let's not deal with this. But we worked \ntogether, and we did come up eventually with a way to deal with it.\n  I think some of our colleagues believe that where there is a \nconstitutional issue and a precedent-setting issue here involving such \na delicate matter, such a matter that could lead to a criminal \ninvestigation and punishment, we ought to have some type of consensus \non it. But I share his concern.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute \nbefore we go to the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think if neither amendment gets 60 votes--and I \ncertainly hope the Boxer amendment does, and I expect it would, but I \ndon't know, it might not--I am already working on an alternative I \nwould talk to my friend about right now, which is for us to communicate \nin writing very strongly to the Justice Department and tell them how \nstrongly we feel.\n  I also wish to make the point that my friend is right. Someday, \nsomebody will write about this. People are already writing about it \nbecause of the work we are doing on this matter. The Senator and I have \nbeen quite forceful in the way we feel about this. People are writing \nabout it. My hope is that what we do is not create a new kind of select \ncommittee. My friend said it has been done before, and he may be right. \nBut why a committee when we can get right to the heart of the matter, \nwhich is: Was there a crime? If so, let's get to the bottom of it.\n\n  I do want to say, and I say this as chair of the Ethics Committee of \nthe Senate, nothing is more important to me than having a fair Ethics \nCommittee that works hard and is objective. Any Member of the Senate \ncan make a complaint any day of the week and it automatically is looked \nat. I want to reiterate that. If people have an issue, please, let us \nknow. That is why we are there.\n  For those of us who care a lot about this matter, we do need, if \nnobody gets 60--I hope we will, but if nobody does, this issue does not \ngo away as far as I am concerned. It cannot go away.\n  I think it is very important, the way we deal with this, to \nunderstand that if we do something that the House has constitutional \nobjections to and it brings down the technical corrections bill, the \nirony of ironies is the Coconut Road project doesn't get fixed, it goes \nback to the crooked way it was handled. We don't want that. We want to \nfix the Coconut Road problem and we want to have an investigation.\n  I yield the floor to get to the regular order at this time.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4539, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the regular order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on amendment No. 4539, offered by the \nSenator from California, as modified.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we have a very simple amendment. \nSometimes in simplicity is strength. Sometimes in simplicity is power. \nSometimes in simplicity you get to the place you want to get.\n  I do not like a lot of words. I believe a few words will say it. Look \nat what we say here:\n\n       Consistent with applicable standards and procedures--\n\n  which means everybody's rights are protected--\n\n     the Department of Justice shall review allegations of \n     impropriety regarding item 462 in section 1934(c) of Public \n     Law 109-59--\n\n  That is the Coconut Road project--\n\n     to ascertain if a violation of Federal criminal law has \n     occurred.\n\n  I think we know enough to warrant this kind of amendment. I think we \nknow enough to be concerned. I think we know enough to say to the \nJustice Department: Please pay attention to this. Do your work. Make a \ndetermination and get on with it because this is very serious.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I will repeat the three points I think \nare important. No. 1 is we do not know enough. The next amendment \nrelates to the Justice Department if we do know enough.\n  No. 2 is I am very hesitant to set a precedent that invites the \nJustice Department to come into the Senate and House to investigate us.\n  No. 3, and finally, the Justice Department does not have to do it \neven if we say they shall. They do not have to do it. There is no force \nof law that we can make the Justice Department come and investigate us. \nIf we did, our forefathers would roll over in their graves. That is \nwhat the separation of powers is all about. When we go directly to the \nJustice Department, we shirk our responsibility to control our own \nhouse and bring our own Members under it.\n  I urge my colleagues to not support this new precedent setting \nseeking of the Justice Department, in violation of the separation of \npowers, to come into the Senate and the House to do an investigation \nbefore we have done our own investigation to find out the jot and \ntittles.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 10 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to make the point, if we pass the Boxer amendment \ntoday and this bill gets signed into law by the President and we are \nrequiring the Justice Department to do this, then they will be breaking \nthe law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, we have voted an invitation to the \nJustice Department to investigate a rules violation in either the House \nor the Senate. We have set an amazing precedent.\n  What we recommend is a bicameral committee made up of four members of \neach body, two from each party, that would report back to the \nappropriate ethics committee or to the Justice Department, if there is, \nin fact, an infraction of law.\n  My hope would be that we would take care of the problems in our own \nbody. The House would take care of the problems in their body and that \nwe would, in fact, give greater than 36 votes to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Colleagues, this is very important. I wish to commend my \ncolleague for bringing this whole issue to the floor of the Senate. But \nI think we have done something important. We have taken his concerns to \nheart, and with a very big vote, we have stated that the Justice \nDepartment is now required to open an investigation.\n  What the Senator does is set up an elaborate commission of Senators, \nof House Members; it is political on its face. It will only put off the \nday until an investigation is done by Justice. Because after having \nthis elaborate commission, Senators investigating House Members, House \nMembers investigating Senators, it is unconstitutional on its face on \nthe speech and debate clause.\n  That will bring down this entire bill. Here is the irony of ironies. \nIf we bring this bill down, the fix of Coconut Road will fall. We fix \nthe Coconut Road problem in this bill.\n  I urge you, please say no to this idea because I feel we have done \nthe right thing on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this question, the yeas are 90, the nays \nare 2. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to speak to \nan amendment to the pending legislation by myself and Senator Casey, \nwhich would authorize an addition of lane miles in Pennsylvania to the \nAppalachian Development Highway System so that a vital highway project \ncan be constructed.\n  The Central Susquehanna Valley Thruway project is a proposed 13-mile, \nfour-lane limited access highway extending from the Selinsgrove Bypass \nof U.S. Routes 11/15 to PA Route 147 in Northumberland. Because the \nproject involves construction of a bridge across the Susquehanna River, \nthe estimated cost to construct it is $370 million. The current \nconditions are a major impediment to north-south travel in Central \nPennsylvania and this project is widely supported by State and local \nelected officials. In addition to the traffic problems it will address, \nthe project is a major economic development initiative in the \npredominately rural region between Williamsport and Harrisburg. The \nPennsylvania Department of Transportation, PENNDOT, has thus far not \nbeen able to identify the funds necessary to construct this project, \nand neither has the Federal Government. However, it has been suggested \nthat if the 12-mile route were added to the Appalachian Development \nHighway System, ADHS, it would open up a new source of funds which \nPENNDOT could use to construct this project.\n  The ADHS encompasses 2,600 miles across the Appalachian States and is \nadministered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. The intention of \nthis highway system is to improve the connectivity of economically \ndepressed Appalachian regions with metropolitan areas. Approximately \n500 miles of the ADHS have yet to be completed, including 178 miles \nwhich need to be completed within Pennsylvania. Although the affected \ncounties of Northumberland, Snyder, and Union are within the \nAppalachian region, this 12-mile route in question is not a part of the \nexisting ADHS system and therefore does not qualify for ADHS funding.\n  This amendment would authorize Federal ADHS assistance for the 13-\nmile thruway project. For purposes of connectivity, it would also \nauthorize a larger 52-mile segment from I-180 near Williamsport to the \nintersection of U.S. 11/15 and U.S. 22 near Duncannon as part of the \nADHS. This will connect the 13-mile system to the rest of \nPennsylvania's existing ADHS system, but the only segment of this 52-\nmile addition that would be eligible for funding under the amendment is \nthe 13-mile thruway project. Further the amendment provides that this \naddition will not affect Pennsylvania's Federal ADHS apportionment. It \nis important to note that the amendment does not provide more funding \nto Pennsylvania, it simply gives PENNDOT the ability to use existing \nADHS apportionment funding for this high-priority project.\n  Madam President, I also wish to speak to an amendment to the pending \nlegislation by myself and Senator Casey, regarding the use of ``toll \ncredits'' by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, PENNDOT, \nwith respect to construction of the U.S. Route 219 highway improvement \nproject in Somerset County, PA.\n  The Somerset County Commissioners have identified the U.S. Route 219 \nimprovement project as essential to improving north-south \ntransportation mobility and safety in Somerset County. The project \ninvolves construction of a four-lane, limited access highway connecting \nthe towns of Somerset and Meyersdale, PA. A 1999 study conducted by \nPENNDOT noted that this section of U.S. Route 219 has a number of \ndeficiencies that cause traffic congestion and high accident rates. The \nproject also promises economic benefits by linking motorists with a new \nbusiness park. PENNDOT received approval to conduct environmental and \nengineering studies in 1999 and planned on using ``toll credits'' to \nmatch $45 million in Federal funds allocated to the project through the \nAppalachian Development Highway System, ADHS, program. However, the \nnecessary land was not acquired until 2006, and in the meantime, the \n2005 SAFETEA-LU bill prohibited the use of toll credits as a non-\nFederal match requirement to ADHS funds.\n  Toll credits are a ``soft-match'' that allow States to substitute \nprevious, toll-financed transportation spending as a credit toward the \nmatch requirement. In doing so, it effectively increases the Federal \nshare to 100 percent, thereby reducing the pot of available Federal \nfunds. With the limited availability of Federal resources, I can \nunderstand why Congress would have an interest in ensuring that States \ncontribute actual dollars toward highway construction projects rather \nthan credits. That is why this amendment does not eliminate the \nprohibition on the use of toll credits to match ADHS dollars. This is \nsomething that we can debate as we consider the next highway and \ntransit authorization bill.\n  This amendment provides for a narrow exception to that prohibition. \nIt would allow PENNDOT, in the case of U.S. Route 219 only, to use toll \ncredits so that this important transportation and economic development \nproject can move forward. I believe this exception to the toll credit \nprohibition is warranted at this time because PENNDOT was planning on \nusing them when it entered the environmental and engineering phase of \nthis project. Without the ability to use credits, I am advised that \nPENNDOT has no matching funds available to finance this project.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senate is now debating the SAFETEA-LU \ntechnical corrections bill. It is regrettable that we had to file \ncloture on the motion to proceed to this bill in order to make progress \non this legislation. This is a technical corrections bill. It fixes \nmistakes made in the heat of passage of SAFETEA-LU, a bill that was 835 \npages long. These types of technical corrections bills are not at all \nuncommon, and almost always pass with little, if any debate, much less \ndisagreement.\n  All of the relevant committees the Banking Committee, which has \njurisdiction over the transit title of the bill, the EPW Committee, \nwith highway jurisdiction, and the Commerce Committee, which oversees \nhighway safety--have worked together in a bipartisan fashion to produce \na corrections bill with broad support.\n  I thank my colleague and ranking member on the Banking Committee, \nSenator Shelby, for his work in producing this title, which passed the \nBanking Committee unanimously in May of last year. I also want to \ncommend EPW Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Inhofe, as well as \nCommerce Chairman Inouye and Ranking Member Stevens, for their hard \nwork on developing this highly technical bill.\n  Unfortunately, despite these efforts, we have been blocked from \nmoving forward by a small handful of our colleagues. I want to thank \nthe majority leader for making time in the Senate's schedule to debate \nthis bill.\n  Although this is only a corrections bill, it will have a real impact \nfor our local communities, which are struggling to keep up with the \ndemands of crumbling infrastructure. There are funds that were \nauthorized in SAFETEA-LU to help meet these demands, but for technical \nreasons, they have not been distributed. This bill will unlock those \nfunds so that they can be used for the purpose for which they were \nintended, which is to shore up our transit systems, our roads and \nbridges--all of the vital components of\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\nthe transportation network that we rely on every day for the safe and \nefficient movement of people and goods.\n  The funds that would be unlocked by passage of this bill will allow \nfor critical maintenance and capital improvement projects to go forward \non our roadways; they will allow for dangerous overpasses to be \nreplaced; they will allow for transit systems to more efficiently meet \nthe needs of their riders; and they will allow for a greater degree of \nsafety on our roads and rails.\n  And it is important to understand, this bill does not cost a single \npenny. It allows funds that have already been authorized to be \ndistributed as intended.\n  The Banking Committee reported the transit title of this bill last \nMay. We worked closely with our colleagues here in the Senate as well \nas in the House to develop a bipartisan, consensus package. I want to \nagain thank my ranking member, Senator Shelby, for his efforts on this \nbill; he has worked hard to try to get this done since the last \nCongress.\n  The Banking Committee's title of this bill addresses the drafting \nerrors contained in the transit title of SAFETEA-LU and makes necessary \nchanges to various project authorizations so that funds can be \nreleased. In addition, I just want to note that this bill recognizes \nthe hard work and leadership of our former colleague, and past chairman \nof the Banking Committee, Senator Paul Sarbanes, by naming the Transit \nin Parks program, which he authored, after him.\n  It is more important than ever that we invest in our Nation's transit \nsystems. Safe, reliable, and efficient public transportation is \nessential if we are to tackle the growing problems of traffic \ncongestion, rising gas prices, and global climate change. Transit \nsystems provide significant benefits both to transit riders and to \nothers in the community, including employers, property owners, and \nautomobile drivers. For example, when people ride transit, the amount \nof time that transit riders and automobile drivers alike spend in \ntraffic goes down; in fact, the Texas Transportation Institute has \nestimated that transit saves Americans over $18 billion a year by \nreducing the time they would otherwise waste sitting on clogged \nroadways.\n  And, in this era of high gasoline prices, public transportation \nprovides an additional benefit: according to economists Robert Shapiro \nand Kevin Hassett, public transportation saves more than 855 million \ngallons of gasoline a year, helping to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil and providing us with a cleaner, healthier environment.\n  Transit ridership is at the highest level in 40 years, and strong \nsupport for transit is essential in light of this increasing demand. In \nfact, I strongly believe that if we are to keep up with the demands of \nour growing economy, we must renew our commitment to our Nation's \ninfrastructure, not just in transportation, but in water systems, \nhousing, and other areas. Senator Hagel and I have put forward a \nproposal to create a National Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage \nprivate investment through tax-credit bonds to fund large-scale, \nregionally or nationally significant infrastructure projects. I held a \nhearing on this proposal last month and I intend to hold another in the \ncoming weeks.\n  We have an enormous challenge before us in meeting the infrastructure \nneeds of our nation. The National Infrastructure Bank is not intended \nto be the only tool in our toolbox; neither is the technical \ncorrections bill we are discussing today.\n  But passage of the bill now before the Senate would be an essential \nstep forward in meeting that challenge. It would put an end to the \ntechnicalities that are holding up vital funding for road and transit \nimprovements. There is no excuse for any further delay in getting these \nfunds to the communities which need them.\n  Let me take just a moment to address the Administration's Statement \nof Administration Policy opposing one of the provisions in the transit \ntitle of this bill, related to the transit New Starts program. This \nprogram, which supports the development and construction of new transit \nsystems, is widely recognized for its focus on performance measures and \naccountability. Each applicant for New Starts funds enters a rigorous \nreview process based on statutory rating criteria, including factors \nsuch as mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and cost \neffectiveness. In order to more fully capture the impact that a major \ntransit project has on communities, Congress in SAFETEA-LU added \neconomic development and land use effects to the statutory list.\n  However, the Federal Transit Administration is not applying the \nstatutory rating criteria as Congress intended. Instead, the FTA has \nassigned inordinate weight to a few statutory factors, while giving \nothers, such as economic development and environmental benefits, only \nminimal weight.\n  The language in the technical corrections bill reiterates Congress's \nintent in SAFETEA-LU that each of the factors must be given comparable \nweight when evaluating New Starts grant applications. This language \npassed the House of Representatives last summer as part of their \ntechnical corrections package.\n  I say to my colleagues, I could not disagree more with the position \nthe administration is taking on this point. The language in the transit \ntitle has broad bipartisan support, both from the Banking Committee and \nfrom the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. If the \nAdministration does not agree with the criteria included in SAFETEA-LU \nfor the evaluation of New Starts projects, I would be happy to consider \ntheir views in the context of the next reauthorization. I intend to \nbegin that process later this year and I expect to proceed in an open \nand bipartisan way. In the meantime, the administration's \nresponsibility is to implement the law, and unfortunately they have \nfailed to do so in this case.\n  In conclusion, although it is technical, this is an important bill. \nIt has broad bipartisan support on both sides of the Capitol and would \nallow urgently needed funds to be distributed to the States and local \ncommunities trying to address their transportation needs. I commend it \nto my colleagues and ask for their support.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I am proud to support H.R. 1195, a bill to \namend the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity \nAct, and the benefits that it will provide to West Virginia and the \nrest of the country. However, I must oppose the two amendments offered \nby Senators Boxer and Coburn. Both amendments have the good intention \nof ensuring open and honest government, but I must oppose them because \nof my concerns about their implications, particularly as they may \nimpinge on the powers of the legislative branch.\n  I applaud the Senators for their attempts to eliminate any waste, \nfraud, and abuse that have plagued the Congress in previous years. As \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, I have instituted on-line \naccess to spending bills, so that the public may see where their tax \nmoney is being spent. But both of these amendments may inappropriately \nexpose Congress to scrutiny by the executive branch by way of the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Congress is fully capable of proceeding with its own internal \ninvestigations. Both Houses have bipartisan Ethics Committees that may \nundertake these investigations. If criminal activities are discovered \nin the course of a congressional inquiry, such crimes should then be \ninvestigated by the appropriate Federal authorities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Boxer substitute \namendment No. 4146, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The committee substitute, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden),\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. \nInouye), the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nLouisiana (Ms. Landrieu) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Sentor \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Hagel), \nthe Senator from Indiana (Mr. Lugar), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. \nMcCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator will state the requests.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2828\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we just heard objection, but we didn't \nget objection, finally, to the technical corrections bill. We are happy \nabout that. You and I serve together on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. We know our work is important because we know that no \ncountry can be great if it doesn't have an infrastructure that is up to \npar. The occupant of the chair knows more than most what it means when \na bridge collapses. We know what that means. So what we are doing here \nis a matter of life and death, quite often.\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\n  This technical corrections bill will make it possible to continue \nwork on over 500 projects that were stymied for various reasons. It is \ngoing to put a billion dollars into our economy, and it will provide \ntens of thousands of jobs. Senator Inhofe and I are very grateful \nthat--even though this was not an easy week and this bill took so many \ntwists and turns and we had to work our way through many issues--we \nhave arrived at the point where it passed.\n  Let me say how much I enjoyed working with my staff and the staff of \nSenator Inhofe. I am going to read the names of those who deserve to be \nrecognized and thanked. From my staff are Bettina Porier, Kathy \nDedrick, Tyler Rushforth, Jeff Rosato, Erik Olsen, Paul Ordal, and the \nrest of my staff. We do work as a team.\n  I thank Senator Inhofe's staff, and I am sure there are more to be \nthanked, but the ones I worked with closely are, of course, Andy \nWheeler, chief over there, Ruth Van Mark, James O'Keeffe, and Alex \nHerrgott. We are so grateful to you for being close to us, staying \nclose to us, letting us know when there were problems. We appreciate \nthat.\n  I say to the majority leader, Senator Reid, how much I appreciated \nhis interest in this bill. He really helped us. Bob Herbert, of his \nstaff, Ron Wynch, and Mike Castellano--we had technical issues and \nlegal issues and they were there.\n  If I am leaving anyone out, please know it is not my intention. So \nmany others helped us.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. CARPER. The Senator is leaving herself out and Senator Inhofe. On \nbehalf of all of us who have been anxious for this day--to see this \ntechnical corrections bill put together and have the result we have \nhad, I thank the Senator for dealing with the competing forces and \ngetting the job done. Someone said it was ugly, but it is beautiful in \nthe end. It is going to be good for the folks in all of our States. We \nworked together in a bipartisan way, and I am grateful for that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. Senator Carper, from Delaware, is \none of the senior members on the committee, whom we love working with. \nHe is part of our team. We have a great committee. It is why I like to \nbe a legislator.\n  I want to say, in closing, to floor staff, all of you here, thank you \nfor your patience. You have to answer questions. The pages have to be \navailable to us. You all let us know what is going on and whether we \nare doing it right or wrong. Of course, in particular, I thank Lula, \nTim, and Dave. Without the three of you, we could not have gotten this \ndone.\n  Yes, sometimes when you get to this point, it is a little like making \nsausage--that is what they say about how a bill becomes a law; it is \nnot a pretty thing. But we got it done. The most important thing is all \nof the people who helped us from the outside groups--I thank them--such \nas the construction industry, the construction workers, the transit \ndistrict operators, the sand and gravel people. You know who you are. \nYou made the point that we should not bog this bill down, that we \nshould get it going.\n  I am delighted we had a victory here with the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. We are pleased. Up and coming, we are going to have a \nmarkup in a couple of weeks, and then we will get to global warming. I \ndon't know how that will end, but I know it is going to be very \nexciting. We hope everybody will participate in that debate.\n  Is the Senator from Virginia going to speak?\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business''.)\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, today the Senate had a historic moment. We \npassed a bill that has been long awaited across America--one that was \nread about and heard about. It finally passed this afternoon. It was a \nbill called the technical corrections bill.\n  It was a bill that changed and corrected the punctuation and \nreferences in a highway bill we enacted several years ago. It was not \nthat historic. In fact, it is fairly routine. You see, after you pass a \nbill that affects the whole United States and billions of dollars, \nsometimes, on reflection, you find some of the facts were wrong, some \nof the words were wrong; and you have to clean it up. And so a \ntechnical corrections bill is very common around here. It happens to \ncorrect mistakes, to make sure things are done well and done \naccurately. It is the kind of bill that historically would pass without \nany debate whatsoever. Many times it would pass by a voice vote late at \nnight when no one is here because there is so little controversy \nattached to it.\n  So despite what I said at the outset, it is not that historic. But \nwhat made this process historic, and we are researching this, but we \nbelieve for the first time in the history of the Senate, the \nRepublicans initiated not one but two filibusters on our effort to pass \nthis technical corrections bill.\n  We brought this bill to the floor a week ago today, asked that it \npass, and then faced a filibuster from the Republicans. That filibuster \nwas broken on Monday, with a 93-to-1 vote, and then a second filibuster \nhad to be initiated by the Republicans before we could finally pass the \nbill today.\n  For those following this from the outside, I am afraid I might have \nlost some of them. But what it boiled down to was that the Republican \nminority was determined that we would burn 1 week of Senate activity on \na bill that should have taken 5 minutes. They were determined that we \nwould have a succession of rollcall votes on a bill which by and large \nhad no controversy. There was one little issue that could have been \nresolved quickly, perhaps in an hour, in a good-faith debate with a \nvote. They stretched it out for a week.\n  Why are we in this stall? Why do the Republicans want to slow us \ndown? It is part of a strategy. Republican filibusters this Congress, \nas of today, went up to 66; 66 Republican filibusters this Congress and \nstill counting. Is that a lot? Historically, the Senate has never had \nmore than 57 filibusters in any 2-year period. We have had 66 in a \nmatter of a year and 3 or 4 months. So they are about to break all \nrecords with filibusters in an attempt to slow down the Senate. They \ncan't even come to a bipartisan agreement on a technical corrections \nbill. The Republicans insist on these filibuster rollcalls on a \ntechnical corrections bill. Why?\n  First, they want to slow the Senate down as much as possible so we \ndon't act on issues that really count. They don't want us to take up an \nenergy bill to talk about energy tax credits so that we can expand \nrenewable sources of energy. They don't want us to take up a bill to \ndeal with children's health insurance, a bill vetoed twice by President \nBush, which would provide health care protection for many children not \npoor enough to qualify for Medicaid, not fortunate enough to have \nparents with health insurance. They don't want us to take up important \nlegislation dealing with the state of our economy, legislation to \nextend unemployment benefits to the millions of Americans who are out \nof work. Those numbers are reaching modern records. We know many of \nthese families are struggling to find a job. We want to extend benefits \nso these people can feed their families while they are looking for \nwork. Republicans don't want us to take up that legislation. So they \nkeep throwing filibusters in our path, slowing down the Senate, making \nsure the Senate never gets to the issues that are critically important. \nWhether it is funding our schools or paying for health care, taking \ncare of unemployed workers, providing money for medical research, \ntrying to bring down the high cost of gasoline, the high cost of health \ncare and college, they continue to throw filibusters in our path.\n  GOP is shorthand for the Republican Party. It technically used to \nstand for Grand Old Party. The Republicans in the Senate have created a \nnew GOP.\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\nThey want the Senate to be a ``Graveyard of Progress.'' They don't want \nus to take up this legislation. They don't want us to take up these \nissues. They don't want to see any change. They don't want to see any \nprogress. That is why their message at this point is so empty. All they \ncan do is say no, no to the issues that really count with American \nfamilies.\n  Eventually the American people will speak, in November, in an \nelection. They will decide whether this Republican approach of \nfilibusters and stopping progress and stopping change is what they want \nto see or whether they want to bring to the Senate new people who can \nstart moving this country forward. Eventually the American people have \nthe last word. I am sorry we have virtually wasted a week and the time \nof this great institution with more Republican filibusters. But it is \ntheir strategy; it is their plan. It is the way they address the \nserious issues facing America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3137-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3137-S3138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD FOOD CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I fear we are on the brink of a major \nhumanitarian crisis around the world. Food prices are rising beyond the \nreach of people in countries as disparate and far apart as Haiti, \nEgypt, and Thailand. Food prices and their increase have led to \ndemonstrations, sometimes even violent demonstrations in many parts of \nthe world, creating real threats to the stability of those countries. \nAs many as 33 countries face a growing risk of hunger and social unrest \nthat is caused when people are hungry and frightened about their \nfuture. Quite simply, I am concerned that we are steps away from a \nworld food crisis, a crisis that could have a dramatic impact on some \nof the world's poorest nations.\n  The other week, World Bank President Robert Zoellick warned:\n\n       For countries where food comprises about half to three-\n     quarters of consumption, there is no margin for survival.\n\n  In the United States, the poorest 20 percent, the poorest one-fifth \nof our population, spends about 16 percent of their income on food. It \nis a lot compared to many of us. But in the poorest nations, those \nfamilies spend more than half of what they earn to feed themselves. In \nNigeria, families spend an average of 73 percent of the money they earn \non food; in Vietnam, 65 percent. Even as food prices soar, humanitarian \naid has been forced to scale back. In Cambodia, the World Food Program, \nwhich is largely sustained and supported by the United States, has \nsuspended a feeding program for 500,000 schoolchildren because of food \nshortages. Rising food prices mean hunger, and with hunger and no real \nhope of ending it come panic, desperation, and, ultimately civil \nunrest.\n  At any given time, chronic hunger threatens the welfare of an \nestimated 850 million people in the world.\n  We talk a lot about the forces of extremists and terrorists and \nfundamentalists, how destabilizing they are with their acts of violence \nin countries where they kill innocent people. But I have to say, if \nthis world food crisis continues unabated, the instability of terrorism \nmay pale in comparison.\n  In Thailand, local farmers are reporting theft of their rice crops, \nas supplies from other countries are going down and prices are going up \ndramatically. Protests have turned violent in many places. In Yemen, \nfood prices have doubled in recent months. Protests and riots there \nleft at least 12 people dead. Protests in Cameroon earlier this year \nkilled more than two dozen people and led to desperate attempts by the \nGovernment to raise wages and reduce customs duties on food products. \nRioters in Burkina Faso looted stores and burned Government buildings. \nThe Prime Minister of Haiti was forced to resign following days of \ndeadly violence over rising food prices. Last weekend, a U.N. \npeacekeeper transporting food for his unit was dragged from his vehicle \nand shot execution style in the Haitian capital by protesters.\n  The risk of unrest is even more troubling in areas such as Darfur, \nwhere the World Food Program is feeding up to 3 million people a day. \nThis is a humanitarian time bomb which threatens to explode at any \nmoment.\n  I have seen food aid programs operate overseas, and they can make a \nbig difference. I saw one program when I traveled to a slum in Nairobi, \nKenya. It is a slum of lean-to homes where more than 600,000 people \nlive. It is called Kibera. If you saw the movie ``The Constant \nGardener,'' much of it was filmed in the slum of Kibera in Nairobi, \nKenya. Some people think up to 1 million people live there from time to \ntime, some 600,000. Nobody even knows.\n  When you visit there, there are people as far as the eye can see--\nkids playing in the streets, in the filth, in railway yards, \neverywhere.\n  But when I visited there, there was a scene that was almost hard to \nbelieve. It was near the holiday season. The local schools were on \nvacation, but they asked the students to come back to greet this \nSenator who was coming from America. About 40 or 50 children put on \ntheir uniforms, left their vacation time at home, to come back to \nschool. It wasn't to see me; believe me. It was because they promised \nthem that if they would come back to school that day, they would feed \nthem. The feeding program in that little school is part of what is \nknown as the McGovern-Dole school feeding program, named after two \nformer great Senators who served from South Dakota and Kansas.\n  I saw the way that food program worked. There was a noon lunch which \nconsisted of a pot of boiling cereal. It looked a lot like oatmeal or \nsome form of porridge. They ladled it into plastic cups. The kids stood \nin line like they were at Baskin Robbins in Springfield, IL, hoping to \nget a double-dip ice cream cone. They were so excited to get something \nto eat. It was the only meal they were going to have that day. They \nwere willing to put up with this politician, wear their uniforms, come \nin from vacation, on the chance they could fill that cup. They stood \nthere and waited, just to get one meal.\n  The World Food Program has issued an extraordinary emergency appeal \nbecause food programs like that one in Kenya may not last. There is a \nshortfall of some $500 million in food programs across the world. \nConsidering the high cost of food and fuel prices to transport it, the \nshortfall is no surprise. But it requires immediate action. The U.S. \ncontribution to the World Food Program is important because it doesn't \njust feed hungry kids. It tells the world who we are.\n  Right now there are people who are not our friends, who are in fact \nour enemies, who are advertising against the United States. On \ntelevision sets and other places around the world, there is an image of \nAmerica that is not even close to the truth. They suggest that we are \nwarmongers and selfish people. We are not.\n  We have to prove to the world again that our values count, and we \nwill stand behind them. This global food crisis is the kind of \nchallenge that gives us our opportunity.\n  It also is important to quell the growing security concerns attached \nwith a global food crisis. Senators John Kerry and Joe Biden joined me \ntoday in sending a letter to President Bush urging him to support \nadditional funding for food aid in the fiscal year 2008 supplemental \nappropriations bill. The President is going to come to us shortly and \nask for $108 billion to continue the war in Iraq and in Afghanistan. He \nwill tell us this is an emergency. The world food crisis is also an \nemergency. It is one we should deal with. If we are really focused on \nstability and peace in Iraq, we should not ignore the fact that the \nshortages of food and hunger around the world can lead to instability \nin many other places.\n  As a first step, the Department of Agriculture has committed to \nproviding $200 million in emergency food assistance through the Bill \nEmerson humanitarian trust. Bill Emerson, former Republican Congressman \nfrom the Boothill area of Missouri, was a fine fellow. I got to know \nhim when I served in the House. He really cared about children and \nfeeding people. So $200 million in his name is certainly money well \nspent.\n  Moving forward, though, we have to understand that is not enough. We \nare going to need to add more to make sure this crisis doesn't occur.\n  We can share our bountiful harvest. We can help the poorest people in \nthe world. We can demonstrate in that way the finest elements of the \nAmerican spirit.\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n  We recently had a hearing, in fact yesterday, before the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, where Jim Nussle, who is chairman of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, spoke. Jim comes from the State of \nIowa. He is a former Congressman, former chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee.\n  I asked him about this. I asked him if the administration would \nconsider, as part of their supplemental appropriations bill, including \nmore money for this global food crisis. I am afraid Mr. Nussle was \nadamant in saying they would not. They would not consider adding any \nmoney to the $108 billion for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said \nthat is all the President has asked for.\n  I hope Mr. Nussle will reconsider. I certainly hope the President \nwill reconsider. What is at issue is not a political fight. What is at \nissue is a fight for food so some of the poorest people on Earth can \nsurvive. The United States will have a chance to demonstrate to the \nworld our values and what we stand for. I hope we can do that by adding \nto this supplemental funding bill enough money to provide assistance to \npeople around the world who face deprivation and starvation because of \nthe current global food crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3138-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Echols\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today because a brave man from \nKentucky has fallen in the far-away country of Iraq. LCpl Thomas P. \nEchols was tragically killed on December 4, 2006, during combat \noperations in the city of Ramadi. The Shepherdsville, KY, native was 20 \nyears old.\n  Lance Corporal Echols was serving his second deployment in Iraq. For \nhis valor as a U.S. Marine, he received several medals, awards, and \ndecorations, including the National Defense Service Medal, the Navy and \nMarine Corps Commendation Medal, and the Purple Heart.\n  Raised in Shepherdsville, in Bullitt County, Tom was actually born in \nMount Clemens, MI, and as a result Tom brought with him to Kentucky a \nfast and true love for his University of Michigan Wolverines. His \ngrandfather, Don Wight, still recalls how his grandson once saved up \nmoney for weeks to buy tickets to a University of Michigan football \ngame.\n  ``I'm an MSU grad, he's a dyed-in-the-wool University of Michigan \nfan. Anything he could find that was U of M memorabilia, he had it,'' \nsays Don. ``He was just a good, fun-loving young man.'' Despite the \nlongstanding rivalry between the University of Michigan and Michigan \nState, Tom and his grandfather went to that Wolverines football game \ntogether.\n  While Tom's eyes looked north to his beloved Wolverines, his feet \nwere firmly planted in Kentucky. He attended Cedar Grove Elementary \nSchool, Bernheim Middle School, and Bullitt Central High School, all in \nShepherdsville. He graduated from Riverview High School in \nShepherdsville in 2004.\n  Growing up, Tom belonged to his school's football and track teams. He \nplayed video games and paintball. And in high school he participated in \nJunior ROTC and the drill team, perhaps preparing himself for the \nmilitary life he hoped would lie ahead.\n  Tom chose to pursue service in uniform by the time high school \ngraduation rolled around. His father, Kurt Echols, remembers his son \nthinking of a career in the Armed Forces as early as middle school. \nPerhaps Tom drew inspiration from his father, a veteran himself.\n  Tom ``was a good kid, loved sports, a big Michigan fan,'' Kurt says \nof his son, and remembers him as someone who always enjoyed a good \njoke.\n  In the fall of 2004, Tom enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was a \nmember of the 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division \nfrom Camp Lejeune, NC, and during his deployment to Iraq, his regiment \nfell under the command of the First Marine Expeditionary Force, \nForward.\n  Tom's longtime friend Tim Zamboroski was sorry to see the childhood \nbuddy he had grown up with whisked away to the other side of the world. \nAs kids, Tom and Tim used to play baseball together in the backyard. As \nmen, they would trade e-mails back and forth from America to Iraq.\n  ``I think he was pretty happy with serving the country,'' Tim says. \n``I'm going to miss him.'' When he heard Tom had been killed, Tim says \nhe felt as if he had lost a brother.\n  Lance Corporal Echols drove humvees during his first tour in Iraq, \nand by his second tour had become an infantryman.\n  While serving in the Marine Corps, he also became a husband, after \nasking Allyson Echols, whom he met in high school, to marry him.\n  Tom and Allyson married during the week of Thanksgiving in 2005. \nAllyson now raises the couple's young daughter, Julia, who sadly never \ngot to meet her father.\n  Tom was buried at the Zachary Taylor National Cemetery in Louisville, \nKY, with full military honors. A large crowd of people came to pay \ntheir final respects. Sheriffs from both Bullitt County and neighboring \nJefferson County were there, and Tom's father Kurt remembers with pride \nthat members of a local fire department erected a large American flag \nin honor of his son.\n  Our prayers are with the family of Lance Corporal Echols today as God \ncomforts them for their tragic loss. We are thinking of his wife \nAllyson; his daughter Julia; his parents Kurt and Rose; his sister \nRebecca; his brother Alexander; his grandparents Jerry and Sharon \nEchols and Donald and Mary Wight; and many other beloved family members \nand friends.\n  This U.S. Senate expresses its deepest gratitude for LCpl Thomas P. \nEchols's life of service. And we express our deepest gratitude for the \nEchols family, for nurturing this man, patriot, and marine who answered \nthe call in his country's time of need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3138-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3138-S3139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Week of the Young \nChild, taking place this week, April 13 through 19.\n  Sponsored by the National Association for the Education of Young \nChildren, the Week of the Young Child is held annually to honor young \nchildren and those who make a difference in their lives. This year's \ntheme is ``Bring Communities Together for Children--Children Bring \nCommunities Together''. This week presents an opportunity for us all to \nfocus on the needs of the 20 million young children around the country. \nIt shines a light on the importance of issues like affordable childcare \nfor working families, access to quality early childhood educational \nprograms, and the availability of adequate health care.\n  As a father and a grandfather, I am troubled by the fact that so many \nyoung children in this country live with the effects of poverty and \ninadequate health and child care every day. It is estimated that 24 \npercent of American children under the age of 6 live in poverty and 24 \npercent of those children are without health insurance. In addition, \nalthough nearly 50 percent of working families rely on outside \nchildcare, fees for these programs are skyrocketing, leaving them out \nof reach for too many. The Week of the Young Child highlights the role \nof the Federal, State, and local governments, as well as private \norganizations and the general public, in alleviating these problems and \nworking toward a stronger, healthier community.\n  The Week of the Young Child also gives us an opportunity to recognize \nand celebrate the programs and organizations that provide vital \nservices to young children and their families. For example, the Head \nStart Program provides comprehensive early education and health \nservices to almost 1 million low-income preschool children to help them \nprepare for and succeed in school.\n  Additionally, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, CCDBG, \nprovides funding to States for childcare services for low-income \nfamilies and activities intended to improve the overall quality and \nsupply of childcare. For families transitioning to financial\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\nindependence, CCDBG-funded services play an especially significant \nrole.\n  Investing in America's young children is one of the best steps we can \ntake to ensure the future success of our Nation. I am pleased to \nrecognize the Week of the Young Child, and I extend my thanks to those \nin Nevada--and around the country--who provide for our young children \non a daily basis.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I strongly support Senator \nSalazar's resolution designating this week, the third week in April, as \nthe ``Week of the Young Child.'' I hope the resolution represents a new \ncommitment by all of us in Congress to strengthen the services young \nchildren need to become full and productive members of our society in \nthe years ahead.\n  Last year's reauthorization of the Head Start Act was a significant \nstep in the right direction to assure access to quality early childhood \neducation. The act expanded coverage to families just above the poverty \nline and provided additional flexibility to assist more poor families \nas they make the transition to work and struggle to keep up with the \nrising cost of living in today's new economy. We also renewed our \ncommitment to underserved populations, such as Native Americans and \nmigrant and seasonal farm worker families, and worked to ensure that \nevery teacher in every Head Start classroom is highly qualified.\n  In addition, the reauthorization established an Early Childhood \nEducation Advisory Council to assess the needs children in of early \nchildhood programs and develop a comprehensive plan for improving the \nquality of services provided. That effort will improve professional \ndevelopment, upgrade standards, enhance connections among programs, and \nimprove data collection. States ready to take on the challenge of \nimplementing these needed improvements qualify for inventive grants to \nget that work underway. Together these reforms strengthen our \ncommitment to provide both quality childcare, and quality early \nlearning opportunities for the Nation's youth. But there is still much \nmore to be done.\n  The research is clear--high quality early education makes a profound \ndifference in the lives of children, especially at-risk children. In \nfact, many experts believe that 85 percent of a child's intellect is \nestablished before a child reaches the age of five. Unless we begin to \neducate at-risk children before they reach kindergarten, we may lose \nthem forever. Students who start school behind tend to stay behind, and \nearly childhood education makes all the difference. Those who have \naccess to high quality early childhood education are 30 percent more \nlikely to graduate from high school, twice as likely to go on to \ncollege, and are 40 percent less likely to need expensive special \neducation programs or be held back a grade.\n  But the positive benefits extend beyond the classroom. Early \nchildhood education helps to break the devastating cycle of crime and \npoverty. Nobel Laureate James Heckman's study of at-risk boys who \nreceive quality early education shows that less than 10 percent of the \nboys who participated would be convicted of a crime and less than 2 \npercent would end up on welfare--rates significantly lower than those \nwho did not receive such education.\n  Quality early education programs are supportive of young children in \nways that enable them to become productive members of society. By \ncultivating educated, law abiding members of society we help to \nguarantee our national competitiveness, the stability of our economy \nand the fabric of our communities for the years ahead. Early childhood \neducation creates better students, better workers and better citizens.\n  We must invest in such education for sake of our students and our \nnational well being. We know the best way to ensure that our students \nreceive quality early education is by giving them a highly qualified \nteacher. Yet, early childhood educators continue to be overworked and \nundervalued in our society. Prekindergarten teachers get paid on \naverage less than half what an elementary school teacher gets paid. The \nBureau of Labor statistics estimates that the average salary of a pre-\nschool teacher is $21,730--closer to the salaries of school bus \ndrivers, at $22,890, than any other group of educators, all with median \nsalaries over $44,000.\n  Inadequate wages make it nearly impossible to recruit and retain \nqualified early childhood educators. The number of childcare providers \nwith bachelor's degrees declines year after year, and neither their \nwages nor the high rates of turnover are acceptable. We must make it a \nnational priority to guarantee that early childhood educators are paid \nand supported in a manner that reflects their valuable contributions to \nour Nation's future.\n  We have come a long way in assuring that our Nation's young children \nhave access to the supports and services they need, but our mission is \nfar from complete. This is no time for complaining. We must continue to \nexpand our support for our nation's youngest children, for they truly \nare America's future. Let's use this ``Week of the Young Child'' to \nemphasize that vital point for communities across our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3139-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3139-S3141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 265TH ANNIVERSARY OF THOMAS JEFFERSON\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

We're really happy you're here.\n       We're here tonight to commemorate the 265th birthday of \n     Thomas Jefferson, here in a room where he once walked and in \n     a home where he once lived. In this house, President \n     Jefferson spread the word that liberty was the right of every \n     individual. In this house, Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark off \n     on the mission that helped make America a continental nation. \n     And in this house, Jefferson was known to receive guests in \n     his bathrobe and slippers. (Laughter.) Laura said no. \n     (Laughter.) I don't have a bathrobe. (Laughter.)\n       With a single sentence, Thomas Jefferson changed the \n     history of the world. After countless centuries when the \n     powerful and the privileged governed as they pleased, \n     Jefferson proclaimed as a self-evident truth that liberty was \n     a right given to all people by an Almighty.\n       Here in America, that truth was not fully realized in \n     Jefferson's own lifetime. As he observed the condition of \n     slaves in America, Jefferson said, ``I tremble for my country \n     when I reflect that God is just'' and ``that his justice \n     cannot sleep forever.'' Less than 40 years after his death, \n     justice was awakened in America and a new era of freedom \n     dawned.\n       Today, on the banks of the Tidal Basin, a statue of Thomas \n     Jefferson stands in a rotunda that is a memorial to both the \n     man and the ideas that built this nation. There, on any day \n     of the week, you will find men and women of all creeds, \n     colors, races and religions. You will find scholars, \n     schoolchildren and visitors from every part of our country. \n     And you will find each of them looking upward in quiet \n     reflection on the liturgy of freedom--the words of Thomas \n     Jefferson inscribed on the memorial's walls.\n       The power of Jefferson's words do not stop at water's edge. \n     They beckon the friends of liberty on even the most distant \n     shores. They're a source of inspiration for people in young \n     democracies like Afghanistan and Lebanon and Iraq. And they \n     are a source of hope for people in nations like Belarus and \n     Burma, Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Syria, North Korea and \n     Zimbabwe, where the struggle for freedom continues.\n       Thomas Jefferson left us on July 4, 1826--fifty years to \n     the day after our Declaration of Independence was adopted. In \n     one of the great harmonies of history, his friend and rival \n     John Adams died on the very same day. Adams' last words were, \n     ``Thomas Jefferson survives.'' And he still does today. And \n     he will live on forever, because the desire to live in \n     freedom is the eternal hope of mankind.\n       And now it's my pleasure to welcome Wilfred McClay to the \n     stage. (Applause.)\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       MRS. BUSH: Thank you very much, Mr. McClay and Mr. Wilson. \n     Thank you so--for your reflections on Thomas Jefferson's life \n     and his contributions to our nation, and thanks to each of \n     you for joining us today so we can learn more about the \n     legacy of one of America's most influential founding fathers.\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\n       Thomas Jefferson believed that education is the cornerstone \n     of a free society, so it's therefore little surprise that he \n     viewed the founding of the University of Virginia as one of \n     his top achievements, as we know from both of your talks. He \n     called the building of this school the last service he could \n     render his country, saying, ``Could I see it open? I would \n     not ask an hour more of life.''\n       But in fact Thomas Jefferson lived a little over a year \n     after the University of Virginia opened its doors. During \n     this time he was involved in the University activities, and \n     he invited students, including a young Edgar Allan Poe, to \n     dine with him each Sunday at nearby Monticello.\n       Today, Jefferson still shapes the lives of the students at \n     the school he founded. The architecture of his academical \n     village encourages free study in a collaborative environment, \n     and UVA's philosophy of student self-governance epitomizes \n     our third President's democratic ideals.\n       The 18 men I now introduce are heirs to this tradition. The \n     Virginia Gentlemen are UVA's oldest a cappella vocal \n     ensemble. They perform for distinguished audiences across the \n     country and around the world. Tonight is their first \n     performance at the White House, and we're happy to have them.\n       Here to perform a few musical selections, including the \n     University of Virginia's school song, please welcome the \n     Virginia Gentlemen. (Applause.)\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Richard Guy Wilson,\n\n\n                Commonwealth Professor, Architectural History,\n\n                                           University of Virginia.\n       Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, and Ladies and Gentlemen: Thank \n     you--an honor to speak on Thomas Jefferson and his \n     architectural accomplishments. Thomas Jefferson knew this \n     house very well,--he was the first full time occupant--John \n     Adams resided here for barely 4 months. The house remained \n     unfinished, many rooms--such as this one, were large bare \n     brick caverns, there was no grand staircase, and the floors \n     were rough. Visitors recalled that Jefferson kept several \n     tables of tools . . . one apparently in this room . . . \n     described as ``a long table'' that contained hammers, \n     chisels, and other implements, and the visitors remember him \n     taking the tools to fix locks, pound in nails in window \n     moldings as well as work in the garden.\n       Jefferson had offered his own designs for the Executive \n     Mansion or President's house as it was known back in 1791-92, \n     along with plans for the U.S. Capitol; this he projected as a \n     great domed structure. But Washington, apparently, rejected \n     his schemes and competitions were held. Jefferson served as \n     secretary of state in the 1st Washington administration and \n     that office--Secretary of State--was a bit different than \n     today, since it included internal administration as well as \n     foreign affairs. Jefferson also offered his scheme for laying \n     out Washington, D.C., (remember this is a ``new city'' and \n     created in the 1790s) and Jefferson's advice . . . not to \n     mention his loan of maps . . . is fundamental to the plan \n     along with the great mall developed by Major Pierre Charles \n     L'Enfant.\n       To return here to this building--the White House--\n     (officially so named in 1901), Jefferson while president \n     designed a number of additions including wings, the gardens, \n     and then he commissioned his close friend Benjamin Henry \n     Latrobe--who he also appointed in 1803 as the Architect of \n     the Capitol--to design both the north and south porticos; \n     Latrobe's porticos are the most distinguishing external \n     element of the building. It took many years to get the \n     porticos built . . . things were not that different then as \n     now on getting government projects underway, and finished.\n       I have outlined Thomas Jefferson's involvement in this \n     building to make a point,--the buildings he lived in, their \n     style, appearance, the furnishings--rugs, drapes, chairs--and \n     gardens were critical to him. As he once said: ``Architecture \n     is my delight, and putting up and pulling down one of my \n     favorite amusements.'' Jefferson was obsessed, wherever he \n     lived, whether in Charlottesville, Williamsburg, or Poplar \n     Forest, all in Virginia, or in Philadelphia during the 1770s, \n     New York, 1790s, or Paris, 1784-89. When he was the American \n     Ambassador to the Court of Louis XVI, he remodeled his \n     quarters even though he didn't own them. Monticello was in a \n     constant state of construction, and if any of you have lived \n     through a house remodeling, you know how conducive that is to \n     family harmony. Right? Jefferson lived in a construction zone \n     his entire life.\n       What were Jefferson's architectural achievements? He wrote \n     to his close friend James Madison (later an occupant of this \n     building):\n       ``But how is a taste in the beautiful art to be formed in \n     our countrymen, unless we avail ourselves of every occasion \n     when public buildings are to be erected, of presenting to \n     them models for their study and imitation? . . . . You see I \n     am an enthusiast on the subject of the arts. But it is an \n     enthusiasm of which I am not ashamed, as its object is to \n     improve the taste of my countrymen, to increase their \n     reputation, to reconcile them to the rest of the world, and \n     procure them its praise.'' TJ to James Madison, September 20, \n     1785.\n       This letter of 1785 was on the occasion of his design of \n     the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond. I would argue the \n     Virginia Capitol--or state house--is his most important \n     building, a large Roman temple that stands on Shockoe Hill in \n     Richmond--originally overlooking the James River. The \n     Virginia Capitol is one of the first major public building \n     constructed after the Revolution, and its classical ancestry \n     helped to determine the look of American governmental \n     architecture for the next several centuries. Instead of red \n     brick and skimpy classical details Jefferson gave us a \n     governmental image.\n       Thomas Jefferson is sometimes labeled a ``gentleman'' or an \n     ``amateur'' architect but this is a misnomer. Yes, he was \n     self-trained, but there were no architectural schools (they \n     were not invented in this country until the 1860s), rather he \n     learned from books and he had the largest architectural \n     library in the young republic, and he did the drawings, he \n     figured the specifications . . . How many bricks? How much \n     timber? How much glass to order, and he superintended the \n     construction. Jefferson designed houses, his own and those \n     for friends, utilitarian buildings such as shops, farm \n     structures, court houses, a jail (we think) and he frequently \n     offered his wisdom to his colleagues (he was ``Mr. Suggestion \n     Box''). But . . . and this makes him an amateur . . . he was \n     never paid, he did it all gratis.\n       Although the Virginia State Capitol is his most important \n     building--because of its legacy. . .his greatest I would \n     argue--is the ``academical village,'' of the University of \n     Virginia. It is totally his creation--yes . . . he did ask \n     for suggestions and advice--as any wise person does--but it \n     was or is his concept of what is the appropriate setting for \n     education. Jefferson felt that one learned as much from your \n     environment as from the professor gabbing away in a class \n     room. The University is great lawn enclosed on 3 sides and \n     open at the end. Pavilions for the professors and dormitory \n     rooms for the students on the two long sides are tied \n     together by colonnades of classical columns of various orders \n     and sizes. Dominating the composition at one end is the \n     Rotunda, a great domed building that housed the library. \n     Based upon the Pantheon in Rome, considered one of the great \n     and most perfect monuments of antiquity, Jefferson has taken \n     an ancient symbol, the dome of the cosmos to the Romans, the \n     dome of the heavens to Christianity, unity for our Capitol, \n     and transformed it once again, it becomes the dome of \n     enlightenment, of reason, it is the library, the mind of the \n     university. In his hands the library became the central \n     element--symbol of the modern university.\n       Jefferson saw his accomplishments in a very particular way, \n     and he both designed his obelisk shaped tombstone at \n     Monticello and ordered it would contain a very particular \n     statement . . . (He was ``Mr. Control'' to the end). It \n     contains nothing, nothing . . . about public offices he had \n     occupied. What it does say is: ``Here was buried Thomas \n     Jefferson Author of the Declaration of American Independence \n     of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom and Father \n     of the University of Virginia.'' Two writings which are \n     fundamental to our American freedoms and the institution by \n     which they would be carried out.\n\n                 Jefferson Birthday Celebration Remarks\n\n                 (By Wilfred M. McClay, Apr. 14, 2008)\n\n       Thank you, Mr. President, for your warm welcome, and for \n     the great honor of taking part in this celebration of Thomas \n     Jefferson's life.\n       It is always hard to know where to begin with Thomas \n     Jefferson. His early biographer James Parton described \n     Jefferson in 1775--one year before he wrote the Declaration \n     of Independence--as ``a gentleman of thirty-two, who could \n     calculate an eclipse, survey an estate, tie an artery, plan \n     an edifice, try a cause, break a horse, dance a minuet, and \n     play the violin.'' And at that point in his life, he was just \n     getting warmed up.\n       So how can we take his measure? Should we start by \n     recounting his political accomplishments over four decades of \n     public service, ranging from his entry into the Virginia \n     House of Burgesses in 1769 to his retirement from public life \n     in 1809, after two terms as the third President of the United \n     States?\n       Or do we stress instead his influence in the world of \n     ideas, through his powerful writings in support of American \n     independence--the greatest of these being, of course, the \n     Declaration of Independence itself, with its stirring \n     invocation of the God-given rights of every individual human \n     being--words that changed the course of human history, and \n     continue to do so today?\n       Or Jefferson's keen and unflagging interest in natural \n     science, as evidenced by his service as president of the \n     American Philosophical Society from 1797 to 1815, years that \n     overlap his entire tenure as President of the United States?\n       Or his love of architecture, as embodied in the graceful \n     neoclassical home Monticello that he designed and built for \n     himself near his Virginia birthplace on what was then the \n     western edge of settlement?\n       Not to mention his overwhelming passion for gadgetry, which \n     invariably impresses visitors to Monticello, who nearly \n     always remember the revolving bookstand, the dumbwaiter, the \n     copying machine, the automatic double doors, the Great Clock, \n     the triple-sash window, and countless other gizmos that the \n     ever-inventive Jefferson himself either designed or adapted.\n       And what about his founding of the University of Virginia \n     in nearby Charlottesville, whose serenely beautiful central \n     grounds he also designed? Or his great contributions to the \n     cause of religious and intellectual liberty, which for him \n     were essential to the dignity of the individual person, and \n     central to the work of a great university?\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\n       You all probably know that Jefferson, that inveterate \n     designer, even designed his own tombstone, and specified the \n     only things it was to say about his life: that he wrote the \n     Declaration and Virginia's Statute of Religious Freedom, and \n     that he was Father of the University of Virginia. Of how many \n     other men can it be said that their having served two full \n     terms as President of the United States--which I think we all \n     agree is no shabby achievement!--was in the second or third \n     tier of their accomplishments?\n       Some will object that all this praise fails to do justice \n     to the flaws in our subject. And that is true enough. Should \n     we then begin, as is overwhelmingly the fashion today, by \n     emphasizing Jefferson's complexity, his contradictions, his \n     shortcomings? That might not seem very charitable, or in \n     keeping with the spirit of the occasion. But it would have \n     the Jeffersonian virtue of honesty. And there are negative \n     aspects of Jefferson's life and career that simply cannot be \n     denied.\n       No one can deny that although Jefferson opposed slavery in \n     theory, he consistently failed to oppose it in practice, \n     including notably in the conduct of his own life at \n     Monticello.\n       No one can deny that Jefferson's racial views, particularly \n     as expressed in his book Notes on the State of Virginia, are \n     appalling by today's standards.\n       No one can deny that Jefferson often practiced a very harsh \n     brand of politics. His famously conciliatory words ``We are \n     all Republicans, we are all Federalists'' in his First \n     Inaugural Address were quickly belied by his ferocious \n     partisanship, which was relentlessly aimed at stigmatizing \n     the Federalist party and driving it out of existence.\n       Nor can one deny that his greatest act as President, the \n     Louisiana Purchase, and his worst, the Embargo Act, both \n     represented a complete repudiation of his most basic \n     principles about the dangers of big government and strong \n     executive authority.\n       These are not small flaws, nor are they the only ones. We \n     are not wrong to insist upon their being remembered, even on \n     this day. Still, the compulsion to criticize Jefferson has \n     gone too far. Jefferson is, I believe, one of the principal \n     victims of our era's small-minded rage against the very idea \n     that imperfect men can still be heroes--and that we badly \n     need such heroes. We have been living through an era that \n     feels compelled to cut the storied past down to the size of \n     the tabloid present. Perhaps the time has come for that to \n     change.\n       For when all is said and done, Thomas Jefferson deserves to \n     be remembered and revered as a great intellect and great \n     patriot, whose worldwide influence, from Beijing to Lhasa to \n     Kiev to Prague, has been incalculable, and whose belief in \n     the dignity and unrealized potential to be found in the minds \n     and hearts of ordinary people is at the core of what is \n     greatest in the American democratic experiment. It is in this \n     sense that James Parton was absolutely correct in making the \n     following proclamation: ``If Jefferson is wrong, America is \n     wrong. If America is right, Jefferson was right.''\n       Of course, we want to know more than Jefferson's words; we \n     want to feel that we know the man himself. But that is \n     exceptionally hard with Jefferson. He eludes our grasp. He \n     may well have been the shyest man ever to occupy the office \n     of President, awkward and taciturn except in small and \n     convivial settings, such as small dinner parties, where he \n     could feel at his ease, and shed some of his reticence.\n       He loathed public speaking, giving only two major speeches \n     while President, and none on the campaign trail. He often \n     felt that the work of politics ran against his nature, and \n     complained that the Presidency was an office of ``splendid \n     misery,'' which ``brings nothing but increasing drudgery & \n     daily loss of friends.''\n       Add to that the fact that he had more than a little bit of \n     the recluse in him. Twice he withdrew entirely from public \n     life, first in the 1780s, after a disappointing term as \n     governor of Virginia, then the second time at the conclusion \n     of his presidency, when he left Washington disgusted and \n     exhausted, anxious to be rid of the place. As he wrote a \n     friend, ``Never did a prisoner, released from his chains, \n     feel such relief as I shall on shaking off the shackles of \n     power.'' Never was he happier than when ensconced in his \n     Monticello retreat, his ``portico facing the wilderness'' \n     that he loved and found renewal in.\n       At bottom, I think Jefferson is best understood as a man of \n     letters. Literally. Jefferson wrote almost 20,000 letters in \n     his lifetime, and it is in these letters that he seems to \n     have felt freest and most fully himself. Although he \n     complained to John Adams that he suffered ``under the \n     persecution of letters,'' the opposite seems to have been the \n     case. This was a man who lived much of his life inside his \n     own head, and it is in these letters that he comes most fully \n     alive for us. He seems to have needed the buffer of letters \n     interposed between himself and the world; but with that \n     buffer in place, the otherwise awkward and taciturn Jefferson \n     became more open, wonderfully expressive and responsive to \n     his correspondents.\n       It was in his letters to Maria Cosway that we glimpse his \n     passionate nature, and the struggles between head and heart \n     that preoccupied much of his inner life. It is in his letters \n     to his nephew Peter Carr that we see his thoughts as a \n     preceptor and wise guide to the world's ways. And it was in \n     his magnificent correspondence with his old rival John Adams, \n     a dialogue that spanned fifty years until their deaths in \n     1826, that Jefferson most fully explored the deeper meaning \n     of the American experiment. He was constantly using his \n     correspondence to organize and sharpen his thinking, and it \n     is there that we see him most fully and vividly.\n       In any event, it is for his ideas, above all else, that we \n     honor Jefferson; and for the cause of human freedom and human \n     dignity that he so eloquently championed. His failings may \n     weigh against the man, but not against the cause for which he \n     labored so mightily. That should be a lesson to us today. \n     Like Jefferson, we are carriers of meanings far larger than \n     we know, meanings whose full realization cannot be achieved \n     in our lifetime, or even be fully understood by us, but which \n     we are nevertheless charged to carry forward as faithfully as \n     we can.\n       But unlike Jefferson, we have the benefit of being able to \n     stand on his shoulders, with his words to direct and inspire \n     us. ``We knew'' about Jefferson's faults, said the civil \n     rights leader, Representative John Lewis. ``But we didn't put \n     the emphasis there. We put the emphasis on what he wrote in \n     the Declaration. . . . His words were so powerful. His words \n     became the blueprint, the guideline for us to follow. From \n     those words you have the fountain.''\n       It is the same fountain that today, 265 years after \n     Jefferson's birth, still nourishes our lives, and shows no \n     sign of running dry. Today is a good day to drink from it \n     anew.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3141-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL CRITTENTON FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks the 125th anniversary of The \nNational Crittenton Foundation, the nationwide organization that \nsupports empowerment, self-sufficiency, and an end to cycles of \ndestructive behavior and relationships by at-risk girls and young \nwomen. The organization began as the National Florence Crittenton \nMission, founded in 1883 by 19th century philanthropist Charles \nCrittenton of New York City a year after his daughter Florence died at \nthe age of 5. His goal was to assist girls and young women in trouble, \nand in the years that followed, Florence Crittenton Homes became famous \nin communities across the United States and in foreign countries as \nwell.\n  One of the leading members of the Foundation today is the Crittenton \nWomen's Union in Boston, which began as a Florence Crittenton Home in \nthe city in 1896. It was launched by a pioneering group of women \nactivists who wanted it to be a ``big sister'' to ``unfortunate New \nEngland girls'' young unmarried mothers in need of shelter and moral \nguidance.\n  In the years that followed these two organizations joined forces and \ncombined with other organizations to create the Crittenton Women's \nUnion, which today empowers low-income women in our city by providing \nsafe housing, caring support services, education, and workforce \ndevelopment programs.\n  In addition to using its on-the-ground experience to shape public \npolicy and achieve social change, Crittenton Women's Union is also \nMassachusetts' largest provider of transitional housing for homeless \nmothers and their children and the founder of New England's first \ntransitional home for victims of domestic violence.

Mr. President, today I honor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, \nwho is retiring at the end of 2008, after a distinguished and \nillustrious career spanning 50 years as a\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\npublic servant in the State of California.\n  I wish to extend to Mrs. Burke, who served as a Representative of \nCalifornia's 37th Congressional District from 1973 to 1979, my sincere \ncongratulations for the decades of dedicated service that she has given \nto her Nation, her State, and her county.\n  She is currently serving as chair of the Los Angeles County Board of \nSupervisors and is in the final year of her fourth term on the board.\n  For the past 15 years, she has represented the Second Supervisorial \nDistrict.\n  Supervisor Burke will be remembered as a devoted public servant who \namassed numerous accomplishments and countless awards--in addition to \ninspiring women and minorities to pursue careers in public service.\n  As a product of the Los Angeles Unified School District, Mrs. Burke \ndeveloped an interest in public speaking and participated in several \ncitywide competitions during her high school years.\n  Her involvement in these events and many extracurricular activities \nhelped her to obtain scholarships to the UC Berkeley and later at UCLA.\n  In 1956, Mrs. Burke received a law degree from the University of \nSouthern California School of Law.\n  It was difficult for women, particularly African Americans, to \npractice law, because many private law firms showed little interest in \nhiring women as attorneys.\n  So Mrs. Burke opened her own law office in Los Angeles.\n  She specialized in immigration and civil rights and fought \nsegregation in real estate law.\n  Mrs. Burke was active in the civil rights movement with memberships \nin various local and national organizations.\n  She subsequently landed a staff attorney position on the McCone \nCommission, which investigated the causes of the 1965 Watts riots in \nLos Angeles.\n  She became a spokesperson for the underrepresented and, through a \ngrassroots campaign, won her first political office in 1966 as a \nCalifornia State assemblywoman.\n  It was a position she held for the next 6 years.\n  In 1972, Mrs. Burke became the first African American woman--west of \nthe Mississippi River--to be elected to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  She was selected to serve as vice chair of the 1972 Democratic \nNational Convention in Miami and later on the House Select Committee on \nAssassinations.\n  She also was the first Congresswoman to give birth while in office.\n  Mrs. Burke did not seek re-election to Congress in 1978 but instead \nran for attorney general of California.\n  She won the Democratic nomination, but subsequently was defeated in \nthe general election.\n  In 1979, Mrs. Burke was appointed by the Governor of California to \nfill a vacancy in the Fourth Supervisorial District in Los Angeles \nCounty and served in that capacity until the end of 1980.\n  She also was appointed by the Governor to serve on the Board of \nRegents of the University of California in 1982.\n  Two years later, Mrs. Burke was selected to serve as vice chair of \nthe 1984 U.S. Olympics Organizing Committee.\n  In 1992, she became the first African American elected to the Los \nAngeles County Board of Supervisors.\n  She played a significant role in the 2000 Democratic National \nConvention, hosting an event for hundreds of African American elected \nofficials nationwide.\n  Supervisor Burke represents nearly 2.5 million residents in the \nSecond District of the Nation's largest county.\n  Her efforts primarily have focused on improving the lives of \nchildren, encouraging economic development, and improving \ntransportation throughout Los Angeles, as well as promoting public \nsocial services, health care for the uninsured, and affirmative action \nfor women and the economically disadvantaged.\n  In addition, she has taken the lead in establishing a county archives \nsystem.\n  These are just some of Yvonne Brathwaite Burke's significant \naccomplishments.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate and the State of California, I extend my \nheartfelt gratitude for her immeasurable contributions throughout her \nrenowned career.\n  With sincere best wishes, I congratulate Supervisor Burke upon her \nretirement from elective office.\n  And I am pleased to join her many coworkers; her family: her husband \nWilliam, her daughter Autumn and stepdaughter Christine; friends; and \nassociates in wishing her health, happiness, and continued good fortune \nin her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3142-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING EASTER SEALS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I wish today to commend a standout chapter \nof a renowned organization, one that has been responsible for bringing \nlight to the lives of countless Americans throughout its existence. \nEaster Seals Delaware and Maryland's Eastern Shore is celebrating its \n60th year of providing critical help to those in need.\n  In 1948, the organization was started to meet the needs of children \nwith disabilities, and it has grown exponentially since then. This \nchapter served 18,000 Delawareans last year through eight locations, \nand they now have an annual operating budget of $15 million.\n  The services provided by the staff and volunteers at Easter Seals are \nwell known: speech and hearing therapy, assistive technology, and job \ntraining are just a few of the ways they help children and adults with \ndisabilities lead independent lives in their communities.\n  As we embark on spring this year, it is appropriate to recall the \nsymbol of Easter Seals: the lily. The lily makes us all think of \nrebirth and new life, which is exactly what Easter Seals provides to \nthose they help. It is why the lily has appeared on every Easter \n``Seal'' produced since the 1950s.\n  I would be remiss if I thanked Easter Seals Delaware and Maryland's \nEastern Shore without recognizing its driving force for the last half \ncentury. Sandra Tuttle, who has been associated with the organization \nfor nearly 50 years--including as its president and CEO since 1978--is \nstepping aside from her formal role. Her leadership has been the engine \nof this remarkable organization; her devotion, professionalism, and \nguidance are known to all associated with Easter Seals.\n  I wish her the best of luck in all her future endeavors and thank her \nfrom the bottom of my heart for what she has helped this organization \nbecome. The lives she has touched are without number. She truly is an \nangel walking among us.\n  I know I am not the first to thank Easter Seals in this Chamber, and \nI doubt I will be the last. This incredible organization, started by a \nfew people trying to make a difference for disabled children, has \nblossomed into the model for all such groups in America. I thank my \nlocal chapter for its work, congratulate it on this momentous occasion, \nand hope that its influence will continue to grow for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3142-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3142-S3143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING THE STATE OF ISRAEL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be able to offer my \nmost sincere congratulations to the State of Israel as it celebrates \nits 60th anniversary of independence. I am so proud that Israel has not \nonly survived, but has become one of the most prosperous and successful \ndemocracies anywhere in the world.\n  The Israeli National Anthem, Hatikvah, means, ``The Hope.'' That is \nreally what the modern State of Israel has been about over these 60 \nyears. Founded after the horrors of the Holocaust, the Jewish people \ncreated a place where their faith and history could be secured and \npassed from generation to generation. In this place, never again would \ndictators or fanatics be able to systematically persecute, terrorize, \nand murder entire communities or an entire people.\n  Hope sustained the Jewish people through 3,000 years of persecution \nthat culminated in the evils of the Holocaust. And for the last 60 \nyears, that same sense of hope for the future has allowed the people of \nIsrael to persevere in the face of continual assaults on its very \nexistence, whether they are in the form of war, terrorism, or \nassassination.\n  As Israel celebrates this milestone, I am proud to say that the \nUnited States has been by its side, offering support and assistance, \nand watching it grow\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\ninto an unparalleled partner in promoting the ideals of democracy, \npersonal freedom, and human rights.\n  The United States has also tirelessly supported Israel as it \ncontinues to seek lasting peaceful coexistence with its neighbors to \nbring a permanent end to years of suffering and senseless violence. And \nwe will continue to be there to support them in that effort.\n  When Yitzhak Rabin went before the Knesset in October 1995 to discuss \nthe ratification of the Israeli-Palestinian interim agreement, he said \nthe following:\n  ``Here, in the land of Israel, we returned and built a nation. Here, \nin the land of Israel, we established a state. The land of the \nprophets, which bequeathed to the world the values of morality, law and \njustice, was, after two thousand years, restored to its lawful owners--\nthe members of the Jewish people. On its land, we have built an \nexceptional national home and state.''\n  Israel is indeed an exceptional nation state, and this milestone is a \ngreat testament to the hope, faith, and perseverance of the Jewish \npeople. I offer my congratulations to Israel on the 60th anniversary of \nits founding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3143-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO HARVEY WHITE WOMAN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President. I wish to recognize a \ndistinguished member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Harvey White Woman. \nHarvey passed away on Monday, March 31, 2008 following a brave battle \nagainst a rare form of cancer. Though he was only 44, he carried the \nwisdom and insight of many elders and worked in a positive way to \neducate native and nonnative people on treaty and water rights. He was \noften asked to give presentations to adults and schoolchildren alike \nabout the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 as a way to educate the public, \nnot only about the history of this region of our country but also about \nthe promises that were made to native people.\n  In his work as an assistant to the Oglala Sioux Tribe's Fifth \nMember's office, Harvey's voice could be heard reminding us as Members \nof Congress of our duties to uphold those treaty obligations. He also \nserved on the board of the Lakota Fund in Kyle and most recently as the \nfirst director of the Wawokiye Business Institute. The Wawokiye \nInstitute gives specialized assistance to entrepreneurs who are working \ntoward realizing their goal of business success. Through his work and \npresentations on traditional entrepreneurship, many people around the \nworld gained a better understanding of the business instincts of native \npeople throughout history.\n  Harvey also led the newly formed Oglala Lakota Cancer Survivors, \nInc., on Pine Ridge, which is an effort to bring together those \nsurvivors and their families to talk about cancer and the unique \ncircumstances that native people face.\n  Harvey was taken from us too soon. I would like to extend my deepest \ncondolences to his family and his friends in this time of great loss \nand encourage them to go forward with Harvey's efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3143-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE LOUISIANA HONOR AIR\n\n Mr. VITTER.

A bill to improve and enhance research and programs on \ncancer survivorship, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Pediatric, \nAdolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship and Quality of Life \nAct, legislation introduced on the House side by Representatives Solis \nand Bono.\n  The National Cancer Institute estimates that there are more than 10 \nmillion cancer survivors in the United States. Advances in medical \nresearch have resulted in earlier diagnoses, more effective treatments, \nand improvements in medical outcomes for Americans with cancer.\n  These advances in cancer care are especially evident when examining \nour gains for pediatric cancers. The 5-year survival rate for children \nwith cancer has improved markedly over the past decades, from 56 \npercent for those diagnosed in the mid-1970s to 79 percent for those \ndiagnosed between 1995 and 2000. There are now more than 270,000 \nchildhood cancer survivors in the U.S., and that number is expected to \nincrease as we gain a better understanding of pediatric cancers and \nways to treat them.\n  But in the years that we have made these gains in addressing cancer \nin children, we have also learned that many of these survivors \nexperience what are known as ``late effects'' resulting from either the \ncancer or its treatment. These late effects include things like \nadditional cancers, osteoporosis, heart problems and reduced lung \ncapacity. As many as a quarter of childhood cancer survivors experience \nlate effects that are serious or life-threatening. We must be doing \nmore to ensure that the quality of life of children who have survived \ncancer is as high as possible, and that life-saving treatments result \nin as few long-term side effects as possible.\n  It is also important to note that health care disparities also impact \npediatric cancer care and survivorship. African-Americans, Hispanics, \nand Asian/Pacific Islander children have\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\nhigher rates of certain cancers than their white counterparts. In \naddition, due to disparities in access to care, these individuals may \nfail to receive adequate treatments for late effects of cancers. We \nneed to improve our efforts to ensure that racial and ethnic \ndisparities are eliminated from cancer care.\n  In a 2005 report, titled ``From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: \nLost in Transition'', the Institute of Medicine, IOM, recommended \nseveral measures we can take as a nation to improve the quality of life \nfor children and young adults who are impacted by cancer. The \nlegislation that I am introducing today will allow us to implement some \nof those recommendations, including expansion of cancer control and \nsurveillance programs, increasing research in survivorship, and \ndeveloping model systems of care and monitoring for cancer survivors. \nIt will also create grants to establish childhood cancer survivorship \nclinics, and help childhood cancer organizations expand and improve \ntheir work in providing care and treatment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to ensure \nthat we address the needs of cancer survivors throughout the lifespan, \nand help to improve the quality of life for the many children and \nfamilies that struggle with a cancer diagnosis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 2879. A bill to provide for orderly and balanced development of \nenergy resources within the Roan Plateau Planning Area of Colorado, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nensure responsible development of the energy resources under Colorado's \nRoan Plateau in a manner that minimizes the adverse impacts on its \nunique ecological resources while maximizing the financial returns to \nthe State of Colorado and to our country. This legislation was \ndeveloped jointly with my colleagues Representative John Salazar and \nRepresentative Mark Udall, who plan to introduce the legislation today \nin the House.\n  The Roan Plateau, an area of pristine wilderness in northwestern \nColorado, rises 3,500 feet out of the Colorado River Valley. It boasts \nnative cutthroat trout streams and has some of the best winter elk and \nmule deer habitat left in the heavily developed Piceance Basin. The \nRoan has long been a favorite destination for hunters and anglers. The \nmule deer, elk, black bear, and native trout that find habitat on top \nand at the base of the Roan Plateau are an economic engine all their \nown, drawing tourism and recreation dollars to towns like Glenwood \nSprings, Rifle, Silt, and Parachute.\n  Recently the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management, \nwhich oversees the public lands on the Roan and the minerals beneath \nthem, announced that it is opening these lands for energy development. \nUnder the BLM plan, 67,000 acres of public lands on and around the Roan \nPlateau will be open for natural gas drilling as soon as this year. We \nin Colorado are blessed to be home to significant energy resources, and \ntapping these resources is important to sustain our Nation's energy \nneeds and invigorate the Colorado State economy. But in its current \nform, the BLM plan lacks adequate protections for the Roan's land, \nwater, and wildlife--the very things that support the outfitters, \nguides, hotels and restaurants in the area. And by proposing to lease \nall of the undeveloped public lands at once, the BLM plan would sell \nColorado short.\n  Drilling is already happening on roughly half of the plateau that is \neither owned or leased by the natural gas industry. Without question, \nwestern Colorado is experiencing a boom in energy development. During \nthe decade of the 1990s, the average number of completed gas wells per \nyear in Garfield County--the home of the Roan--was 80. The number of \ncompleted wells has climbed rapidly since 2000, setting a new high each \nyear. In 2006, 840 new wells were completed in Garfield County. This \nrapid expansion of activity has created new jobs in the region, but has \nalso stoked new conflicts between the energy values and environmental, \necological, and recreation values of these lands. The impacts of this \ndevelopment are being felt by landowners and outdoor enthusiasts alike. \nSportsmen have watched as public hunting areas, habitat, and important \nwatersheds have been irreparably degraded as a result of widespread \ndevelopment.\n  With this level of development occurring we must ensure that the most \npristine areas of the plateau that remain are protected, that oil and \ngas development in the region occurs with minimal disturbance, and that \nColorado receives the best possible financial return on any oil and gas \nleases.\n  Our legislation has three main functions that work to address these \nissues. First, it requires phased leasing on top of the plateau to \nmaximize state revenues and better protect wildlife habitat and the \nenvironment. Second, it ensures protection of critical cutthroat trout \nwatersheds and other wildlife habitat on top and around the base of the \nRoan Plateau. Lastly, it contains a conforming amendment to the \nTransfer Act to ensure that Colorado receives its fair share of leasing \nrevenues rather than directing this money, as the Transfer Act \nspecifies, to the Anvil Points cleanup fund, which is in surplus.\n  The phased leasing provision requires BLM to lease less sensitive \nareas outside of cutthroat trout watersheds first, rather than leasing \nall available development areas at once. In selecting areas for \nleasing, BLM must take into consideration various factors designed to \nmaximize leasing revenues and to minimize the environmental and \necological impacts of development. Phased leasing will generate higher \nper-lease bids from industry--and more money for the Treasury and \nColorado--than the current BLM plan to lease the entire designated \ndevelopment areas at once.\n  The special protection provisions of the bill expand BLM's designated \n``Areas of Critical Environmental Concern,'' ACECs, to include the \nheadwaters of Northwater Creek and the East Fork of Parachute Creek \nabove the confluence with First Anvil Creek--both of which are critical \nnative cutthroat trout watersheds. The bill also permits gas \ndevelopment activities on top of the plateau outside ACECs that are \nwithin development corridors along existing ridge-top roads on slopes \nnot exceeding 20 percent. These measures will protect critical elk and \nmule deer habitat around the base of the plateau, while allowing \ndevelopment and recovery of the available natural gas under the Roan.\n  In 1907, President Teddy Roosevelt told a crowd that, ``In utilizing \nand conserving the natural resources of the Nation the one \ncharacteristic more essential than any other is foresight. The \nconservation of our natural resources and their proper use constitute \nthe fundamental problem which underlies almost every other problem of \nour national life.'' President Roosevelt's wisdom--over a century \nlater--is as valuable as ever to a Nation committed to protecting its \nland and water, but that is in dire need of affordable, domestic \nsources of energy.\n  The Roan is a special place. Protecting our State's last few \nremaining wild spaces, maximizing oil and gas leasing revenues from \nthese areas and supporting the communities that surround them need not \nbe at odds. This bill will replace BLM's plan with a better, more \nbalanced approach that will protect the most critical areas on the top \nof the Roan and provide the most benefit to the State of Colorado.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 2881. A bill to establish national standards for discharges from \ncruise vessels into the waters of the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I said there was an industry that \ngenerates millions of gallons of wastewater every day and that can dump \nthat waste with virtually no oversight, you might think that I was \nrecalling the days before the Clean Water Act. The truth is, though, \nthat such an industry exists today. I am talking about cruise ships.\n  That is why I am introducing the Clean Cruise Ship Act of 2008. This \nbill will require cruise ships to upgrade their wastewater treatment \nsystems to meet the standards of today's best available technology, \nwhich has been shown to significantly reduce the amount of pollutants \ndischarged from ships. This technology is already being\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\nused successfully on cruise ships in Alaska, thanks to that State's \nforward-thinking regulations.\n  The problem is real. The number of cruise ship passengers has been \ngrowing nearly twice as fast as any other mode of travel. In the U.S. \nalone the numbers are approaching ten million passengers a year. Some \nof these ships can carry 3,000 passengers. That is the size of a small \ncity. As cities do, these ships produce massive amounts of waste--over \n200,000 gallons of sewage each week; a million gallons of graywater \nfrom galleys, laundry, and showers; and over 35,000 gallons of oily \nbilge water that collects in ship bottoms.\n  Wastewater from cities, of course, is highly regulated. America \nwouldn't tolerate anything less. A city cannot simply dump waste into \nour waterways. We've seen, of course, what happens when municipal \nwastewater treatment systems are poorly operated or break down. People \nfall ill, beaches are closed, and ecosystems are harmed.\n  So what's the story for waste from cruise ships? Let us start with \n``black water'' sewage--human body wastes and other toilet waste. \nWithin three miles of shore, vessels can discharge this waste provided \nthat a ``marine sanitation device'' is installed. The Environmental \nProtection Agency released a draft report in December, however, that \nconcluded that these systems simply don't work. These sewage treatment \ndevices leave discharges that consistently exceed national effluent \nstandards for fecal coliform and other pathogens and pollutants. In \nfact, fecal coliform levels in effluent are typically 20 to 200 times \ngreater than in untreated domestic wastewater.\n  Beyond three miles from shore there are no restrictions on sewage \ndischarge. Cruise ships are free to dump their sewage and foul U.S. \nwaters with impunity.\n  The situation for graywater may be even more serious. Except in \nAlaska, cruise ship graywater requires no treatment whatsoever before \nbeing discharged, and there are no restrictions on where that dumping \ncan be done. Yet graywater from sinks, tubs, and kitchens contains \nlarge amounts of pathogens and pollutants--amounts that would never be \ntolerated from a land-based business. Fecal coliform concentrations, \nfor example, are ten to a thousand times greater than those in \nuntreated domestic wastewater. These pollutants sicken our marine \necosystems, wash up onto our beaches, and contaminate food and \nshellfish that end up on our dinner plates.\n\n  The Clean Cruise Ship Act seeks to solve this oversight in the \ncurrent regulations, just as Alaska State law has done. No discharges \nwhatsoever would be allowed within 12 miles of shore. Beyond twelve \nmiles, discharges of sewage, graywater, and bilge water would be \nallowed, provided that they meet national effluent limits consistent \nwith the best available technology. That technology works and is \ncommercially available now. The recent Environmental Protection Agency \nstudy found that these ``advanced wastewater treatment'' systems \neffectively remove pathogens, suspended solids, metals, and oil and \ngrease.\n  Under this legislation, the release of raw, untreated sewage would be \nbanned everywhere. No dumping would be allowed of sewage sludge and \nincinerator ash in U.S. waters. All cruise ships calling on U.S. ports \nwould have to dispose of hazardous waste in accordance to the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act. The bill would establish inspection and \nenforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.\n  There is one thing at this point I'd like to make clear. Many of us \nhere have been working hard to stop aquatic invasive species that slip \ninto our lakes and coastal waters in discharged ballast water. Alien \nspecies that have escaped into U.S. waters are causing massive harm. We \nhave to do everything in our power to prevent new invasive species from \ngetting loose.\n  With this in mind, many of us have been closely watching court cases \nsurrounding the Environmental Protection Agency's responsibility for \nregulating ballast water under the Clean Water Act. That litigation may \nhave implications for cruise ship wastewater pollution.\n  I have no intention of interfering with this court case. Likewise, I \nwant to emphasize that this bill in no way undermines the provisions of \nthe Clean Water Act that deal with discharges of pollution into the \nnation's waters. I have always supported the Clean Water Act. It will \ncontinue to be an important tool that, in conjunction with the Clean \nCruise Ship Act, can significantly reduce wastewater pollution from \ncruise ships.\n  The protection of U.S. waters is vital to our Nation's health and \neconomy. There are 4.5 million square miles of ocean in the U.S. \nterritorial seas--23 percent larger than our Nation's landmass. That's \nmore than any other country has. Cruise ship wastewater threatens the \nvery environments that family vacationers want to visit. Current \nregulations and voluntary guidelines for the cruise ship industry just \naren't good enough. No other industry is allowed to pollute our waters \nat will. The cruise ship industry is growing at nearly 5 percent each \nyear, which means that the problem is growing, as well.\n  Uncontrolled dumping of cruise ship pollution must stop. We can \nachieve that goal with the Clean Cruise Ship Act. I recognize, though, \nthat there may be other valid approaches. I encourage my colleagues to \nwork with me to pass legislation this year that will put a stop to the \ndumping of hazardous pollutants along our coasts. Together we can clean \nup this major source of pollution that is harming our waters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2881\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Cruise vessels carry millions of people through North \n     American waters each year, showcase some of the most \n     beautiful ocean areas in the United States, and provide \n     opportunities for passengers to relax and enjoy the oceans \n     and marine ecosystems.\n       (2) A single cruise vessel generates a tremendous amount of \n     waste each week, including an estimated 140,000 to 210,000 \n     gallons of blackwater (sewage) and 1,000,000 gallons of \n     graywater (including wastewater from dishwashers, showers, \n     laundry, baths, and washbasins). Onboard amenities such as \n     photo-processing, dry-cleaning, and hairdressing also \n     generate hazardous waste streams.\n       (3) In its final report, ``An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st \n     Century'', released in 2004, the United States Commission on \n     Ocean Policy found that these waste streams and the \n     cumulative impacts caused when cruise vessels repeatedly \n     visit the same environmentally sensitive areas, ``if not \n     properly disposed of and treated, can be a significant source \n     of pathogens and nutrients with the potential to threaten \n     human health and damage shellfish beds, coral reefs, and \n     other aquatic life,'' thus threatening the very environments \n     cruise vessel passengers seek to explore.\n       (4) The cruise industry has grown by more than 6 percent \n     annually since 2003 and is projected to continue growing. \n     Cruise vessel capacity is also expanding dramatically; today \n     cruise vessels can transport 5,000 passengers and crew \n     members, but the next generation of cruise vessels is \n     expected to carry 7,000 passengers and crew members. As the \n     total number of passengers increases and the number of \n     passengers per ship increases, the volume of waste entering \n     these ocean ecosystems and the impact of that waste on ocean \n     ecosystems will also increase.\n       (5) In a 2005 report requested by the International Council \n     of Cruise Lines, the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance \n     (OCTA) Science Panel recommended that ``[a]ll blackwater \n     should be treated'', that discharging treated blackwater \n     should be ``avoided in ports, close to bathing beaches or \n     water bodies with restricted circulation,\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\n     flushing or inflow'', and that blackwater should not be \n     discharged within 4 nautical miles of shellfish beds, coral \n     reefs, or other sensitive habitats.\n       (6) The OCTA Science Panel further recommended that \n     graywater be treated in the same manner as blackwater and \n     that sewage sludge be off-loaded to approved land-based \n     facilities.\n       (7) The United States lacks a comprehensive wastewater \n     management policy for large passenger vessels, and a new \n     statutory regime for managing wastewater discharges from \n     large passenger vessels that applies throughout the United \n     States is needed to protect coastal and ocean areas from \n     pollution generated by cruise vessels, to reduce and better \n     regulate discharges from cruise vessels, and to improve \n     monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of standards regarding \n     discharges.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect the \n     health and beauty of the marine and coastal ecosystems that \n     cruise passengers enjoy, by--\n       (1) prohibiting the discharge of any untreated sewage, \n     graywater, or bilge water from a cruise vessel calling on a \n     port of the United States into the waters of the United \n     States;\n       (2) prohibiting the discharge of any sewage sludge, \n     incinerator ash, or hazardous waste from a cruise vessel \n     calling on a port of the United States into the waters of the \n     United States;\n       (3) establishing new national effluent limits for the \n     discharge of treated sewage, treated graywater, and treated \n     bilge water from cruise vessels not less than 12 miles from \n     shore in any case in which the discharge is not within an \n     area in which discharges are prohibited; and\n       (4) ensuring that cruise vessels calling on ports of the \n     United States comply with all applicable environmental laws.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \nthe presentation of a flag of the United States to the children of \nmembers of the Armed Forces who die in service; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nCollins and Senator Isakson to introduce legislation that would provide \nthe secretaries of the military departments the authority to pay the \nnecessary expenses that would accompany the presentation of a flag to \neach child of a servicemember killed in the service of the Nation.\n  The presentation of a remembrance flag to the family of a deceased \nservicemember is a time-honored tradition for each of the services \nwhich commemorates and memorializes the service of our men and women in \nuniform who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the liberties \nand freedoms we cherish. The remembrance flag is a profound symbol of \nthe enduring appreciation of a grateful Nation.\n  Regrettably, however, there is an oversight in current law affecting \nwhich family members of a deceased servicemember may receive a flag. At \npresent, the statute authorizes the secretaries of the services to \npresent only two remembrance flags--one to the parents of the deceased \nservicemember and one to the person authorized to direct disposition of \nthe servicemember. In many instances, the person authorized to direct \ndisposition is also a primary next of kin of the servicemember. \nHowever, in cases where the primary next of kin are the children of the \ndeceased servicemember, which can occur in extended family situations, \nauthorities do not exist for the secretaries of the services to provide \na remembrance flag to the children of deceased servicemembers.\n  The legislation that my colleagues and I are introducing today will \nremedy this oversight. We believe that the children of deceased \nservicemembers should also be able to receive a remembrance flag in \nhonor of the sacrifice made by their parent. Clearly, this is the right \nthing to do. I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join Senator \nCollins, Senator Isakson, and me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Byrd):\n  S. 2883. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the centennial of the establishment of \nMother's Day; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nwomen of our Nation who have the cherished title of mother and \ngrandmother. Whether through natural means, adoption or foster care, \ntheir patience and unending well-spring of love and affection make an \nincredible difference in the lives of children.\n  No treasure, no riches can ever compare with a profoundly reassuring \nhug, the kind words that soothe broken spirits, or that reminder, \nrooted in affection, that we're not living up to our full potential. \nThey inspire, believe and ultimately profess enormous pride in us--no \nmatter our successes or failures.\n  That is why it is not surprising that a young woman from Grafton, \nWest Virginia, took to the streets of her hometown to honor her \nrecently departed mother's love and life by passing out white \ncarnations to all those who passed by. Anna Jarvis' one simple act of \npersonal commemoration in May 1908, grew year after year. Eventually, \nGrafton's efforts would be recognized by the entire State of West \nVirginia in 1910. This was the first time a state recognized Mother's \nDay, and many more would soon follow.\n  In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson declared the first national \nMother's Day, and from that day until now, mothers have been honored \nwith flowers, breakfast in bed, and of course, those endearing homemade \ncards by little children that are steeped in sentiment--and often \ncovered in glitter, macaroni and school paste.\n  My wife Sharon would tell you that there is nothing more important \nthan these simple gifts--first from our children, and now our \ngrandchildren. They are cherished touchstones.\n  At the same time, we think of our mothers as invincible. However, not \neven our mothers are immune to age or disease. For many families across \nthe country, Mother's Day takes on even deeper meanings as parents get \nolder.\n  In my own life, my mother was a tremendous force. Each Mother's Day \nwas a celebration of her spirit, intellect and determination--and all \nthis was put to the test in her battle with Alzheimer's disease. It's \nnot easy seeing the woman who raised you struggle with an illness that \nrobs her of her dignity and quality of life. I know that my family is \nnot the only one that has been touched by this disease--and I am \ncertainly not the only son who could talk in such a deeply personal way \nabout losing a mother. But just like Anna Jarvis, my sisters and I \nsought to honor our mother--and perhaps in the process help another \nmother or grandmother or family--by opening the Blanchette Rockefeller \nNeurosciences Institute.\n  So it is altogether fitting and proper that as we prepare to \ncommemorate that first, historic Mother's Day celebration in Grafton, \nthat we as a Nation begin to reconnect with what Anna Jarvis was trying \nto achieve--community recognition of the role that women play in all \nour lives.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that authorizes the U.S. Treasury \nto mint commemorative coins to celebrate the centennial of Grafton's \ncelebration. I am proud to have Senator Robert C. Byrd as an original \ncosponsor. The companion bill also has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by my West Virginia colleague, Shelley Moore Capito. \nThe proceeds from the sale of these coins won't go to the Government. \nInstead they will go to two organizations that are actively working to \nmake a difference in the lives of our Nation's women who are battling \nbreast cancer and osteoporosis--the Susan G. Komen for the Cure \nFoundation and the National Osteoporosis Foundation.\n  Every day can, and should be Mother's Day. Through this bill, \nAmericans will now have the chance to show, with the purchase of these \ncoins, the high\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nregard we have for not only our mothers and grandmothers, but our \nsisters and nieces, and all the women who have made a difference in our \nlives. In the process, we can contribute to funding research that will \nimprove the quality of their lives.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2884. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincentives to improve America's research competitiveness, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Research & \nDevelopment Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2008, legislation which would \nextend the R tax credit for 5 years, phase-out the Basic Credit, and \nraise the rate of the Alternative Simplified Credit from 12 percent to \n20 percent by 2010.\n  Those who have followed the ongoing discussions regarding the R tax \ncredit will recognize that the legislation I am introducing shares the \nframework of a proposal already put forward by the senior Senator from \nthe State of Utah, my good friend Orrin Hatch. Senator Hatch has done a \nsuperb job building a consensus around the need to transition to the \nAlternative Simplified Credit, and to raise that credit to provide a \nreal incentive to the many companies that are unable to benefit from \nthe Basic Credit structure. I applaud his efforts in this regard, and I \nthank him for lending his support to the bill I am introducing today.\n  I also want to note the contribution of the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, who has worked side-by-side with \nSenator Hatch on the Research and Development tax credit.\n  The chief distinction between our two bills is the duration of the \ncredit. The Hatch-Baucus bill proposes a permanent credit, while my \nbill would extend the R tax credit for five years. I certainly share \nthe goal of providing a permanent R tax credit, but I fear that the \ncost of doing so puts it beyond our reach. Yet we simply cannot \ncontinue to play ``stop-and-go'' with this critical research incentive. \nSince the R tax credit was first enacted in 1981, Congress has had to \nextend it a dozen times, and it expired again at the end of last year. \nThe constant uncertainty about the status of the credit has made it \nimpossible for companies to plan their research investments, and has \nseriously diminished the credit's role as an incentive for research and \ndevelopment here in the U.S.\n\n  A 5-year extension would give companies enough time to plan their \nresearch investments with the credit in mind, restoring the incentive-\neffect the R credit has always been intended to provide. Just as \nimportant, the time frame I am proposing, coupled with the increase in \nthe rate to 20 percent will allow for a smooth transition away from the \nBasic Credit to the Alternative Simplified Credit. The Basic Credit has \nserved its purpose, but it has become hopelessly outmoded. Under the \nBasic Credit methodology, companies wishing to calculate their R \ncredit must measure their current investments against a base that is \nstuck in the past--literally the tax years between 1984 and 1988. This \nperiod is simply not relevant to today's investment decisions, and \nbecause of that, fewer and fewer companies get any benefit at all from \nthe Basic Credit.\n  By contrast, the Alternative Simplified Credit methodology allows \ncompanies to calculate their credit using a rolling average of their \ndomestic investments over their three most-recent tax years.\n  The value of doing this is evidenced by the fact that most companies \nhave already switched to the Alternative Simplified Credit, even though \nit has been on the books for less than a year-and-a-half, and even \nthough the credit rate is only 12 percent compared to the Basic Credit \nrate of 20 percent.\n  The five-year extension I am proposing will allow for a smooth \ntransition to the Alternative Simplified Credit, and will bring the R \ntax credit up-to-date. Companies which still rely on the Basic Credit \nwill be allowed to continue that credit for another two years, just as \nis contemplated by the legislation that Senators Hatch and Baucus have \nworked so hard on.\n  Investment in research and development is critical to the \nbreakthroughs we need to keep our economy competitive, and to create \nthe good, high-paying jobs the American people deserve. The R tax \ncredit provides an important incentive for this investment, but it \nneeds to be updated so more companies can benefit from it. While making \nthe credit permanent is a worthwhile goal, the 5-year extension I am \nproposing today is ``do-able'', and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 2885. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe availability of industrial development bonds to facilities \nmanufacturing intangible property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould provide State and local development finance authorities with \ngreater flexibility in promoting economic growth that meets the \nchanging realities of an ever more global economy. Specifically, my \nbill would expand the definition of ``manufacturing'' as it pertains to \nthe small-issue Industrial Development Bond, IDB, program to include \nthe creation of ``intangible'' property. I am pleased to be joined by \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle including Senators Kerry, \nSmith, and Brown, in introducing this critical legislation to promote \neconomic development.\n  Our Nation's capacity to innovate is a key reason why our economy \nremains the envy of the world, even during these difficult economic \ntimes. Knowledge-based businesses have been at the forefront of this \ninnovation that has bolstered the economy over the long-term. For \nexample, science parks have helped lead the technological revolution \nand have created more than 300,000 high-paying science and technology \njobs, along with another 450,000 indirect jobs for a total of 750,000 \njobs in North America.\n  It is clear that the promotion of knowledge-based industries can be a \nkey economic tool for states and localities. This is especially true \nfor states that have seen a loss in traditional manufacturing. In my \nhome state of Maine, we lost 28 percent of our total manufacturing \nemployment over the last decade. I believe that it critical that we \nprovide states and localities with a wider range of options in \npromoting economic development. My legislation will do just that by \nexpanding the availability small-issue IDBs to new economy industries, \nsuch as software and biotechnology, that have proven their ability to \nprovide high-paying jobs.\n  These IDBs allow State and local development finance authorities, \nlike the Finance Authority of Maine, to issue tax-exempt bonds for the \npurpose of raising capital to provide low-cost financing of \nmanufacturing facilities. These bonds, therefore, provide local \nauthorities with an invaluable tool to attract new employers and assist \nexisting one's to grow. The result is a win- win situation for local \ncommunities providing them with much needed jobs. Consequently, it only \nmakes since to ensure that these finance authorities have maximum \nflexibility in options to grow jobs.\n  In addition, my bill provides some technical clarity to distinguish \nbetween the phrases ``functionally related and subordinate facilities'' \nand ``directly related and acillary facilities.'' Until 1988, there was \nlittle confusion based on Treasury regulations going back to 1972 that \nmade it clear that ``functionally related and subordinate facilities'' \nwere clearly eligible for financing through private activity tax-exempt \nbonds.\n  But, Congress enacted the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Bond \nAct of 1988 that imposed a limitation that not more than 25 percent of \ntax- exempt bond financing could be used on ``directly related and \nancillary facilities.'' While these two phrases appear to be very \nsimilar, they are indeed distinguishable from each other. \nUnfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service has blurred this \ndistinction between the phrases which has had an adverse impact on the \nway facilities are able to utilize tax-exempt bond financing. My\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\nlegislation would make it clear that ``functionally related and \nsubordinate facilities'' are not susceptible to the 25 percent \nlimitation.\n  We must continue to encourage all avenues of economic development if \nAmericas to compete in a changing and increasingly global economy and \nmy legislation is one small step in furtherance of that goal. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2885\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXPANSION OF AVAILABILITY OF INDUSTRIAL \n                   DEVELOPMENT BONDS TO FACILITIES MANUFACTURING \n                   INTANGIBLE PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) Expansion to Intangible Property.--\n       (1) In general.--The first sentence of section \n     144(a)(12)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining \n     manufacturing facility) is amended--\n       (A) by inserting ``, creation,'' after ``used in the \n     manufacturing'', and\n       (B) by inserting ``or intangible property which is \n     described in section 197(d)(1)(C)(iii)'' before the period at \n     the end.\n       (2) Clarification.--The last sentence of section \n     144(a)(12)(C) of such Code is amended to read as follows: \n     ``For purposes of the first sentence of this subparagraph, \n     the term `manufacturing facility' includes--\n       ``(i) facilities which are functionally related and \n     subordinate to a manufacturing facility (determined without \n     regard to this clause), and\n       ``(ii) facilities which are directly related and ancillary \n     to a manufacturing facility (determined without regard to \n     this clause) if--\n\n       ``(I) such facilities are located on the same site as the \n     manufacturing facility, and\n       ``(II) not more than 25 percent of the net proceeds of the \n     issue are used to provide such facilities.''.\n\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to bonds issued after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, Senator Snowe and I are introducing \nlegislation that would expand the availability of the Industrial \nDevelopment Bond, IDB, program. The small-issue IDB program has given \nState and local governments a low-cost source of financing to create \nand retain jobs in manufacturing plants.\n  Over the years, numerous technological advances have driven software \nand biotechnology to the forefront of our economy. According to the \nU.S. Census Bureau, there are more than 400 biotechnology companies in \nMassachusetts alone, employing more than 42,000 and paying more than $5 \nbillion in annual salaries.\n  Currently, the small-issue IDB program is limited only to \nmanufacturing facilities. As our economy continues to evolve, so must \nour policies. Our legislation would allow IDBs to be used for high-\ntechnology and biotechnology uses. The definition of manufacturing \nwould be broadened to include the creation of intangible property--\nspecifically, patents, copyrights, formulas, processes, designs, \npatterns, know-how and other similar items.\n  Expanding the current definition of manufacturing to include \n``knowledge based'' companies would promote economic development in our \nlocal communities as well as nationwide. This legislation is supported \nby the Council of Development Finance Agencies.\n  In addition to expanding the definition of manufacturing, the \nlegislation clarifies that a manufacturing facility includes \nfunctionally related and subordinate facilities as part of the \nfacility.\n  This legislation will provide a boost to the economy by fostering \ndevelopment in technology. I urge my colleagues to support this common \nsense change.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Salazar, Mr. \n        Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Smith, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Rockefeller, \n        Mr. Kyl, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2886. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to amend \ncertain expiring provisions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a tax package that \nwould extend relief from the alternative minimum tax and extend other \nmuch-needed individual and business provisions.\n  When the economy is turning down, Americans need certainty about \ntheir taxes. Families and businesses need to know what the tax law is.\n  That is why my bill provides a one year patch for the AMT. The patch \nwill hold the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT at 4.2 million. We \nwill not let more taxpayers fall into the alternative minimum tax.\n  Last year, Congress did not put a patch in place until December. We \nmust act sooner this year. Through this bill, Congress can act.\n  That is why my package contains a 2-year extension of provisions that \nexpired at the end of last year.\n  These include the qualified tuition deduction to give families relief \nfrom high tuition costs.\n  My package also includes the teacher expense deduction. This \ndeduction gives teachers some of the money that they spend on school \nsupplies to educate our children.\n  The package also includes the State and local sales tax deduction for \nthose States without an income tax.\n  The bill offers an extension of the research and development credit. \nThis credit gives an incentive to businesses to invest in research. It \nhelps to keep America competitive in the global economy.\n  My package will also extend provisions that expire this year for an \nadditional year.\n  The bill extends much-needed energy provisions.\n  Public and private investment in the renewable energy sector was \nabout $90 billion worldwide last year. That's a 27 percent increase \nover 2006.\n  Congress can direct this investment toward the U.S.--rather than \noverseas--by supporting clean energy tax incentives.\n  These incentives include tax credits for wind and solar power, \nefficient buildings and appliances, and clean renewable energy bonds.\n  These provisions are not only good energy policy. They also create \njobs.\n  This package would also extend wind and solar provisions.\n  The American solar industry employs 20,000 Americans. With a long-\nterm extension of the solar tax credit, that number would triple.\n  The American wind industry expanded by 45 percent in 2007. It \ncontributed about 30 percent of the new power capacity in America last \nyear.\n  These job-creating industries are growing fast. We should support \nthem. We know what happens when we don't.\n  For example, the tax credit for production of renewable energy was \nenacted in 1992, starting the growth of renewable power in the U.S.\n  But since 1999, this credit has expired three times. And when it \nexpires, clean energy suffers, leading to declines between 73 percent \nand 93 percent in wind energy investment.\n  We need to keep this credit going to ensure consistent investment in \nthe wind power industry.\n  This package would also promote energy efficiency. Efficiency is the \nlow- hanging fruit in the energy debate. We can make big strides toward \nenergy independence and a clean environment by getting more for our \nenergy buck.\n  For example, ENERGY STAR--a voluntary labeling program designed to \npromote energy-efficient products--saved businesses, organizations, and \nconsumers an estimated $14 billion in 2006.\n  Efficiency also creates jobs. The American Solar Energy Society \nreported that in 2006, the efficiency industry created 8 million jobs, \nover half of them in manufacturing.\n  The government plays a key role in sustaining the efficiency \nindustry, through tax incentives for efficient commercial buildings, \nhomes, and appliances.\n  This package would also extend the clean renewable energy bonds, or \nCREBs.\n  CREBs passed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. CREBs spurred more \nthan 700 new wind, biomass, solar, and hydro projects. The number of \nprojects far exceeded the funding available to pay for them.\n  But CREBs funding lapsed at the end of 2007. That halted development \nof new projects and the green-collar jobs that go with them. We must \nkeep these projects going.\n  The CREBs provision was written for non-taxable entities like rural \nco-ops. Those non-taxable entities cannot use other tax incentives in \nthis package.\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\n  I've listed just a few of the important energy items in this \nextenders bill. There are more. And I plan to build upon this package \nas it makes its way through the legislative process, with edits and \nadditional items. The Finance Committee has been working to that end \nfor the better part of a year.\n  Last June, the Finance Committee passed a roughly $30 billion energy-\ntax package, with a resounding bipartisan vote. A majority of the \nSenate voted for that bill.\n  But we were just shy of getting the required 60 votes.\n  We tried again in December, with a slimmer package. That time, we \nfell short of the required 60 by just one vote.\n  We then tried in February, as part of economic stimulus bill. We \noffered a package very similar to what passed last week. That amendment \ngot 58 votes.\n  Last week, this body passed, by a solid 88-8 vote, a package of \nenergy-tax extenders, similar to the package considered during the \neconomic stimulus debate.\n  A vote of 88 to 8 might suggest that there is smooth sailing ahead on \nenergy-tax legislation. But I'm afraid that's not the case.\n  The day before the Senate passed its housing bill, including the \nenergy-tax package, the House Ways and Means Committee passed its own \nhousing relief bill.\n  The Ways and Means bill restated the House's position on pay-go. The \nHouse requires that the most of the tax package be offset.\n  How did the Ways and Means Committee offset the bill? Largely with a \nprovision called ``basis reporting.'' President Bush included this in \nhis 2009 budget proposal.\n  In other words, the House paid for a tax package with an item already \nsupported, at least in principle, by the President.\n  While I believe that this Congress should have paid for energy-tax \nlegislation with the offsets passed by Finance Committee last year, \nit's not clear that passing that package gets us any further to \nextending these important tax incentives.\n  That is why I have been working on offsets that can pass both bodies \nand be signed by the President. That is what I will continue to do to \nget these important energy items--as well as other vital extenders--\npassed.\n  By taking care of this now, we can spend more of our time on other \nthings like tax reform.\n  I plan to hold several hearings and roundtables to cuss tax reform. \nWe began this week. I'm serious about simplifying our tax code. I am \nserious about helping the American people.\n  Congress should do more than just extend legislation. Congress needs \nto work on new policy, new legislation, and new ideas. And by enacting \nthis legislation, we can turn to those important goals. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this package.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2886\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the property and security of homeowners \nwho are subject to foreclosure proceedings, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. The legislation I have introduced with Senators Collins and \nLincoln attacks the growing problem of foreclosure rescue scams. I held \na revealing hearing in the Aging committee that uncovered the ways scam \nartists prey on homeowners already in financial and emotional distress. \nThese scams are another consequence of the mortgage crisis that is \nplaguing our country.\n  For most people, their home is their greatest asset. When a homeowner \nfalls behind in their mortgage payments, it is a great emotion strain. \nScam artists prey on an owner's desperation and give them a false sense \nof security, claiming they can help ``save their home.'' The types of \nscams vary, but the end result is that the homeowner is left in a more \ndesperate situation than before.\n  There are three types of prevalent scams. The first is ``phantom \nhelp,'' where the ``rescuer'' claims that they call the homeowner's \nlender and re-negotiate the loan for a fee. Often the homeowner will \npay the fee and the ``rescuer,'' will abandon the homeowner without \nperforming any intervention. The second is a ``rent-to-own'' scheme \nwhich is set up to fail. A homeowner will sign over the title of the \nhouse and make monthly payments to the scammer in order to help rebuild \ntheir credit. However, the monthly payments are extremely high and \noften result in the homeowner violating the contract and being evicted. \nFinally, a homeowner may be tricked into unknowingly signing over the \ntitle of their house and power of attorney to the scammer and the \nscammer will then sell the house to a third party. The scam artist \nmight give the homeowner a small amount of money, but often only a \nfraction of the actual selling price.\n  As one can clearly see, these scams are well crafted and extremely \ncomplicated. Catie Doyle, the Chief attorney for Legal Aid Society of \nMilwaukee, testified before the Special Committee on Aging, describing \nthe difficulties and problems lawyers are facing when trying to help \nvictims of these scams. One major problem she pointed out was that \nlawyers have to piece together both state and federal laws to untangle \nthese scams.\n  The Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Act that Senators Collins, Lincoln and I \nare offering will remedy Ms. Doyle's concerns. While there are some \nstates that have foreclosure rescue scam laws or are in the process of \nenacting them, many homeowners still go unprotected from these \npredators. This legislation will require that all contracts between a \nforeclosure consultant be in writing and fully disclose the nature of \nthe services and the exact amount. Additionally, the bill prohibits up-\nfront fees from being collected and prohibits a ``consultant'' from \nobtaining the power of attorney from a homeowner.\n  I also have a letter of support from a variety of consumer groups \nincluding the Center of Responsible Lending, Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, National Community Reinvestment Coalition, and the National \nCouncil of La Raza.\n  The foreclosure crisis is real. Most communities across the country \nare experiencing both the primary and secondary effects. It is \nimportant that we address fraud at the front end of the lending \nprocess, as well, as for those who face foreclosure. I hope that we can \nwork together to move this legislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (by request):\n  S. 2889. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nveterans' health care benefits, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation requested by \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as a courtesy to the Secretary and \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs. Except in unusual circumstances, it \nis my practice to introduce legislation requested by the Administration \nso that such measures will be available for review and consideration.\n  This ``by-request'' bill would address a range of issues. On the \nhealth care side, it would allow VA to contract with community \nresidential care programs for veterans with serious traumatic brain \ninjury. It would also eliminate copayments for all hospice care. \nFurther, it would expand continuing education benefits for physicians \nand dentists. Finally, it would allow the Secretary to disclose the \nnames and addresses of certain VA patients without prior written \nconsent to collect payment from third-party health plans.\n  On the benefits side, this legislation would permanently authorize VA \nto use data provided by the IRS and the Social Security Administration \nto verify the incomes of recipients of needs-based benefits from VA. VA \nuses this data to ensure that it does not disburse benefits and \npayments to individuals who do not legally qualify to receive them.\n  This legislation would also provide a cost-of-living increase for VA \ndisability compensation for service-connected veterans and dependency \nand indemnity compensation for survivors.\n  I am introducing this bill for the review and consideration of my \ncolleagues at the request of the Administration. As chairman of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I have not taken a position on this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2889\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are transmitting a draft bill, ``To \n     amend title 38, United States Code, to improve veterans' \n     health care benefits and for other purposes,'' We request \n     that the bill be referred to the appropriate committee for \n     prompt consideration and enactment. Enclosed with the bill is \n     a sectional analysis that describes each provision, provides \n     a rationale for the provision, and provides estimates of the \n     costs, savings and revenues that would result from enactment. \n     Our draft bill includes proposals contained in the \n     President's FY 09 budget request, to include a cost-of living \n     increase in rates of disability compensation and dependency \n     and indemnity compensation. Two of the proposals are \n     discussed in further detail below.\n       This Administration advocates focusing greater attention on \n     the long-term residential rehabilitation needs of veterans \n     with traumatic brain injuries who do not require nursing home \n     care but are unable to live independently in their homes. In \n     furtherance of that policy, our bill would authorize the \n     Secretary, in carrying out the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     (VA) community residential care program, to contract for \n     specialized residential care and rehabilitation services for \n     veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom and/or Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom (OEF/OIF) who: (1) suffer from traumatic brain \n     injury, (2) have an accumulation of deficits in activities of \n     daily living and instrumental activities of daily living that \n     affects their ability to care for themselves, and (3) would \n     otherwise receive their care and rehabilitation in a nursing \n     home, which exceeds their nursing needs. This authority would \n     provide the Department with a far more appropriate treatment \n     setting for the provision of long-term rehabilitation \n     services. VA estimates the discretionary cost of this \n     proposal to be $1,427,000 in fiscal year 2009 and $79,156,000 \n     over a 10-year period.\n       In 2004, Congress amended the law to eliminate copayment \n     requirements for hospice care furnished in a VA nursing home. \n     The bill contains a provision to exempt all hospice care from \n     copayments by amending 38 U.S.C. Sec. 1710 to eliminate co-\n     payment requirements for veterans receiving VA hospice care \n     either in a VA hospital or at home on an outpatient basis. \n     The provision would provide equitable treatment for all \n     veterans receiving such care and would also align VA with the \n     Medicare program, which does not impose co-payments for \n     hospice care (regardless of setting). There are no costs \n     associated with enactment of this proposal. Projected \n     discretionary revenue loss is estimated to be $149,000 in \n     fiscal year 2009 and $1,400,000 over 10 years.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that the \n     transmission of this legislative package is in accord with \n     the President's program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              James B. Peake, M.D.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Burr, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Martinez, Mr. Warner, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Sununu):\n  S. 2890. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a highway fuel tax holiday; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Kyl, Burr, Graham, Martinez, Warner, Chambliss, Lieberman, \nWicker and Sununu in introducing legislation that would provide all \nAmericans with a ``gas tax holiday'' this summer. This bill would \nsuspend the 18.4 cents-per-gallon Federal tax on gasoline and the 24.4 \ncents-per-gallon tax on diesel fuel from Memorial Day to Labor Day.\n  Today, this legislation was put forward on the Senate floor as an \namendment to the Highway Technical Corrections bill, but it was blocked \nfrom being considered. I now call on my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to come together to support this proposal that would provide \nimmediate relief to all Americans suffering from the high price of gas.\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\n  Mr. President, hardworking American families are facing many \ndifficult challenges due to the current economic realities facing our \ncountry. Now, more than ever, they find themselves having to choose \nbetween basic needs to provide for their families, and this is being \ngreatly exacerbated by rising gasoline prices, which have risen by more \nthan 58 percent in the last 14 months. That is why I am pleased to be \njoined by so many of my colleagues in offering a proposal to provide \nsome needed relief for every person who will be filling their gas or \ndiesel tanks this summer.\n  In the past year, the price of unleaded regular gas has increased 53 \ncents per gallon. Diesel fuel prices nationwide are now over $1.30 more \nper gallon more than this time last year. With the growing financial \nstrains placed on so many Americans--rising food prices and falling \nhome prices--the additional hit of rising fuel prices is becoming the \nbreaking point.\n  In an effort to ease some of the hardship caused by the higher fuel \nprices, our bill would suspend the Federal tax on gas and the tax on \ndiesel fuel from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Last Memorial Day, alone, \napproximately 32 million Americans traveled by car 50 miles or more \nfrom home. Suspending the federal excise tax during the summer, when \nfuel prices have historically been at the highest annually, would allow \nAmericans to keep a few more of their hard-earned dollars.\n  Now, let me be clear: this bill would not harm the Highway Trust \nFund. This bill would ensure that the Highway Trust Fund remains whole \nduring this ``gas tax holiday'' by transferring monies from the General \nTreasury. We all agree that our roads and highways must be maintained \nand improved to ensure the safety of the road-traveling public, and \nthis amendment would do nothing to impact highway construction.\n  So, my colleagues have an opportunity to take meaningful action to \nease some of the financial burdens that are impacting all hardworking \nAmericans every time they fill up their gas or diesel tanks. Let's put \nsome acton behind the usual rhetoric around here and vote to ease their \ntax burden this summer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, Mr. Brown, \n        Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2891. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to apply \nthe protections of the Act to teaching and research assistants; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is important for Congress to do more \nto guarantee graduate students the right to organize and to bargain \nover their wages and working conditions as teaching and research \nassistants, so I am introducing legislation today to do so.\n  More than ever in modern education, teaching and research assistants \nare in classrooms every day, educating students in colleges and \nuniversities across the country. Their numbers are increasing as the \nnumber of full time faculty dwindles. Often, teaching and research \nassistants are now doing the same job as junior faculty members.\n  In fact, the classroom is a workplace for these scholars. It's where \nthey earn the money they need to pay to put food on their tables and a \nroof over their heads. They deserve the right to stand together and \nmake their voice heard in their workplace. Like other employees, they \nshould have the right to join a union and improve their working \nconditions. Obviously, better wages and working conditions for them \nalso means better education for their students.\n  In 2004, however, a decision by the National Labor Relations Board \nchanged the law and denied fundamental workplace rights and protections \nfor teaching and research assistants. This ruling stopped an active \norganizing movement in its tracks and deprived thousands of teaching \nand research assistants of their right to organize and bargain over \ntheir wages and working conditions.\n  It is hardly the only bad decision by the National Labor Relations \nBoard under the Bush administration, which has been the most anti-\nworker, anti-labor, anti-union NLRB in history. The Board has let \nworkers down at every turn. It has blocked efforts to gain union \nrepresentation, undermined workers' attempts to improve their pay and \nbenefits, and exposed them to penalties for seeking to improve their \nworking conditions.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is supposed to protect the rights \nof American workers, but it is failing teaching and research \nassistants, just as it has failed so many others. By passing the \nTeaching and Research Assistants Collective Bargaining Rights Act, \nCongress will give these workers back the rights that the National \nLabor Relations Board has taken away. This legislation amends the \ndefinition of employee under the National Labor Relations Act to \nexplicitly include teaching and research assistants at private \nuniversities and colleges and restores the law to where it was before \nthe Bush board's anti-worker decision.\n  This bill is a significant step forward in restoring workers' rights, \nand I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3162-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 519--WELCOMING POPE BENEDICT XVI TO THE UNITED STATES \nAND RECOGNIZING THE UNIQUE INSIGHTS HIS MORAL AND SPIRITUAL REFLECTIONS \n                        BRING TO THE WORLD STAGE\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. McCain, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \nBurr, Ms. Collins, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Dole, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Craig, \nMs. Murkowski, Mr. Thune, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Enzi, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nHatch, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Allard) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 520\n\n       Whereas, in the United States and around the world, more \n     than 1,000 species are officially designated as at risk of \n     extinction and thousands more also face a heightened risk of \n     extinction;\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\n       Whereas the actual and potential benefits that may be \n     derived from many species have not yet been fully discovered \n     and would be permanently lost if not for conservation \n     efforts;\n       Whereas recovery efforts for species such as the whooping \n     crane, Kirtland's warbler, the peregrine falcon, the gray \n     wolf, the gray whale, the grizzly bear, and others have \n     resulted in great improvements in the viability of such \n     species;\n       Whereas saving a species requires a combination of sound \n     research, careful coordination, and intensive management of \n     conservation efforts, along with increased public awareness \n     and education;\n       Whereas \\2/3\\ of endangered or threatened species reside on \n     private lands;\n       Whereas voluntary cooperative conservation programs have \n     proven to be critical to habitat restoration and species \n     recovery; and\n       Whereas education and increasing public awareness are the \n     first steps in effectively informing the public about \n     endangered species and species restoration efforts: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 16, 2008, as ``Endangered Species Day''; \n     and\n       (2) encourages schools to spend at least 30 minutes on \n     Endangered Species Day teaching and informing students \n     about--\n       (A) threats to endangered species around the world; and\n       (B) efforts to restore endangered species, including the \n     essential role of private landowners and private stewardship \n     in the protection and recovery of species; and\n       (3) encourages organizations, businesses, private \n     landowners, and agencies with a shared interest in conserving \n     endangered species to collaborate in developing educational \n     information for use in schools; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to become educated about, and aware of, threats to \n     species, success stories in species recovery, and \n     opportunities to promote species conservation worldwide; and\n       (B) to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nto establish the third annual Endangered Species Day on May 16, 2008. I \nam introducing this resolution with Senators Collins, Cantwell, \nLieberman, Clinton, Kerry, Brown, Snowe, Levin, Boxer, and Feingold \nwhose co-sponsorship I appreciate.\n  I want to commend my constituent, Mr. David Robinson, who first \nsuggested the establishment of an Endangered Species Day. Mr. Robinson \nis an example of people who really do make a difference.\n  The designation of Endangered Species Day will provide many wonderful \nopportunities for the public to familiarize themselves with the status \nand recovery efforts of endangered species in our country and around \nthe world.\n  Last year, more than 50 events were held across the country to \nhighlight endangered species success stories. The Governor of Maine, \nand the cities and counties of Santa Barbara, San Diego, and San \nFrancisco also declared state and local Endangered Species Days. Zoos \nand aquariums across the country, such as the Roger Williams Zoo and \nthe San Diego Wild Animal Park, also held educational events.\n  Based on the success of last year, I am confident that the events of \nthis year's Endangered Species Day will continue to foster increased \ncommunication and awareness about many of the most endangered species \nby encouraging such activities as school field trips to the zoo or \nattending a lecture at the local library. In my city of San Francisco, \nthe Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the Farralones National \nMarine Sanctuary plan to hold special tours and viewings of endangered \nspecies to commemorate this special day.\n  Endangered Species recovery programs in California are examples of \nthe conservation and management efforts that have helped significantly \nrestore populations of California condor, the least Bell's vireo \nsongbird, and the California gray whale. Over 300 species classified as \neither endangered or threatened currently call California home, and \nefforts to protect them will ensure that they continue to do so.\n  Despite these success stories, we need to be aware that more can be \ndone. At this time, we have more than 5,000 threatened species in the \nU.S. and abroad, which receive protection. One small step is to \nincrease awareness about the seriousness of the circumstances facing \nmany of these endangered species and educating the public about them.\n  I am introducing this bill with the hope that Endangered Species Day \ncan spark the wonder and interest in our youth to continue the \nconservation efforts we have begun, but still are far from finishing.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3163-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 521--AUTHORIZING THE TAKING OF A PHOTOGRAPH IN THE \n                  CHAMBER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nresoultion; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 522\n\n       Whereas on November 29, 1947, the United Nations General \n     Assembly voted to partition the British Mandate of Palestine \n     and create a Jewish state;\n       Whereas on May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed \n     the establishment of the sovereign and independent State of \n     Israel, and the United States Government established full \n     diplomatic relations with Israel;\n       Whereas the desire of the Jewish people to establish an \n     independent modern State of Israel is an outgrowth of the \n     existence of the historic kingdom of Israel established in \n     the Land of Israel 3,000 years ago, with the city of \n     Jerusalem as its capital;\n       Whereas for over 2,000 years, there has been continuous \n     Jewish presence and residence in the land comprising the \n     modern State of Israel;\n       Whereas the establishment of the modern State of Israel as \n     a homeland for the Jewish people followed the slaughter of \n     more than 6,000,000 European Jews during the Holocaust;\n       Whereas since its establishment 60 years ago, the modern \n     State of Israel has rebuilt a nation, forged a new and \n     dynamic democratic society, and created a thriving economic, \n     political, cultural, and intellectual life despite the heavy \n     costs of war, terrorism, and unjustified diplomatic and \n     economic boycotts against the people of Israel;\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\n       Whereas the people of Israel have established a vibrant, \n     pluralistic, democratic political system, including freedom \n     of speech, association, and religion; a vigorously free \n     press; free, fair and open elections; the rule of law; a \n     fully independent judiciary; and other democratic principles \n     and practices;\n       Whereas Israel has developed some of the leading \n     universities in the world, and 8 Israeli citizens have been \n     awarded the Nobel Prize;\n       Whereas Israel has developed an advanced, entrepreneurial \n     economy, is among the world's leaders in the high-tech \n     industry, and is at the forefront of research and development \n     in the field of renewable energy sources;\n       Whereas Israel regularly sends humanitarian aid, search-\n     and-rescue teams, mobile hospitals, and other emergency \n     supplies, to help victims of disasters around the world, \n     including the 1994 Rwandan civil war, the 1998 bombing of the \n     United States Embassy in Kenya, the 1999 earthquakes in \n     Turkey, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2005 hurricanes \n     along the southern coast of the United States, and the 2007 \n     fires in Greece;\n       Whereas Israel has absorbed millions of Jews from countries \n     throughout the world and fully integrated them into Israeli \n     society;\n       Whereas Israel has bravely defended itself from repeated \n     terrorist and military attacks since its independence;\n       Whereas successive leaders of Israel have sought to achieve \n     peace with Israel's Arab neighbors;\n       Whereas Israel has established peaceful bilateral relations \n     with neighboring Egypt and Jordan and has made its desire to \n     establish peaceful relations with all Arab states abundantly \n     clear;\n       Whereas for 6 decades, the United States and Israel have \n     maintained a special relationship based on mutually shared \n     democratic values, common strategic interests, and moral \n     bonds of friendship and mutual respect;\n       Whereas the American people feel a strong affinity for the \n     Israeli people based on common values and shared cultural \n     heritage; and\n       Whereas the United States continues to regard Israel as a \n     strong and trusted ally and an important strategic partner: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historic significance of the 60th \n     anniversary of the reestablishment of the sovereign and \n     independent State of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish \n     people;\n       (2) reaffirms the bonds of friendship and cooperation which \n     have existed between the United States and Israel for the \n     past 60 years, and commits to strengthening those bonds;\n       (3) commends the people of Israel for their remarkable \n     achievements in building a new state and a pluralistic, \n     democratic society in the face of terrorism, as well as \n     hostility, ostracism, and belligerence from many of their \n     neighbors;\n       (4) reaffirms its support for Israel's right to defend \n     itself against threats to its security and existence;\n       (5) reaffirms its enduring support for Israel as Israel \n     pursues peace with its neighbors; and\n       (6) extends the warmest congratulations and best wishes to \n     the State of Israel and the Israeli people for a peaceful, \n     prosperous, and successful future.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with the distinct \nhonor of introducing a resolution with my friend Senator McConnell \ncommemorating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the modern State \nof Israel.\n  On this historic occasion, Jews and non-Jews from around the world \nwill come together to celebrate 60 years of Israeli independence. Out \nof the dark shadows of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of over 6 \nmillion Jews, and many others, the state of Israel was reborn on the \nvery same lands where the Jewish people had maintained a continuous \npresence for more than 2 millennia.\n  As an American, I am so proud that the United States has stood by \nIsrael, our closest of allies, from the very beginning of its modern \nexistence. On May 14, 1948, the date on which the people of Israel \nproclaimed the establishment of the sovereign and independent state of \nIsrael, the United States was right there to offer our unwavering \nsupport and establish full diplomatic ties with our new friend. Sixty \nyears later, I want the new generations of Israelis and Jewish-\nAmericans to know that America reaffirms its commitment to the U.S.-\nIsrael alliance and pledges to strengthen the bonds we have forged \nthroughout the decades.\n  Yom Ha'atzmaut, the Israeli Independence Day, falls on May 8th this \nyear, the same day the world traditionally celebrates the Allied \nvictory over Nazism. Because of America's commitment to defeating \nEuropean fascism, the histories of the United States and Israel will be \nforever linked. For it was from the ashes of World War II that our \ngreat country rose to become a global superpower at the same time a \nbeacon of democracy and hope was established in the Holy Land.\n  Today, we face a new set of challenges to peace and freedom. As we \nhave so many times before, the United States and Israel will stand \ntogether to combat those who seek to undermine the right of a Jewish \nstate to exist. The Middle East remains an extremely volatile region \nwith a series of ongoing violent conflicts, so it is a great comfort to \nknow that we have a strong partner in such a strategically important \npart of the globe.\n  In a region long dominated by autocratic and monarchic traditions, \nIsrael has been a paragon of democratic pluralism. Over the course of \nits modern existence, Israeli society has defended the principles we, \nas Americans, hold in such high esteem: freedom of speech, religion, \nand the press, an independent judiciary, and free market capitalism. \nIsrael's strong democracy, despite being constantly under siege from \nneighboring states and terrorist entities, shows a remarkable \ncommitment to the ideals of freedom and democracy.\n  Millions of Americans will undoubtedly commemorate this momentous \nanniversary, including thousands in my home State of Nevada. I am very \nfortunate to hail from a part ofthe country with such a dynamic Jewish \ncommunity; one that is committed to promoting the interests of our \ngreat State in any way they can. I would like to offer special \ncongratulations to all those folks in Nevada who have worked so hard to \nput on events to honor the 60th anniversary of Israeli independence.\n  In the spirit of continuing the tradition of strong U.S.-Israel \nrelations, I urge this entire chamber to wish all those who choose to \ncelebrate this occasion another 60 years of happiness and prosperity. \nMy best wishes for a safe and peaceful anniversary celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/17/senate-section/article/S3164-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3164-S3165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4542.
