Mr. President, we have tried and tried and tried to get the \nRepublicans to allow us to go to conference on ethics, on lobbying \nreform and also on the 9/11 Commission recommendations. They have \nprohibited us from doing that.\n  In the Senate, there are procedural blocks that can be placed on \nmeasures, and they have done that. They have done it for reasons that \nare fleeting in importance. We were ready to do ethics and lobbying \nreform, and someone stepped in and said: Well, I don't like the earmark \nprovision, I want them to be handled some other way--a diversion, a \ndilatory tactic to stop this Congress from doing what it needs to do \nregarding lobbying and ethics reform.\n  Republicans are trying to stop reform. We have lived in a culture of \ncorruption during Republican leadership. For the first time in 131 \nyears, someone working in the White House is indicted, the man is now \nin prison, Scooter Libby. Safavian, head of Government contracting for \nthe President, appointed by the President, handles billions of dollars \nfor the Government contracting, he was led away from his office in \nhandcuffs; he is now in prison.\n  The majority leader in the House of Representatives was convicted \nthree\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\ntimes within 1 year of ethics violations. He was indicted in the State \nof Texas. He resigned.\n  Another Member of Congress is serving jail time for corruption. \nAbramoff, whose tentacles seem to go throughout this town, is in \nprison.\n  Trips to Scotland to play golf, lavish gifts by lobbyists, parties by \nlobbyists, free travel on airplanes, the legislation that passed the \nSenate eliminates all that. I have only given a brief capsule of the \ncorruption in this town under Republican leadership. I have only given \na brief capsule of what they have done to prevent our going to \nconference.\n  I want all of the Republicans to know, I am not going to ask again \nfor unanimous consent to go to conference. When they get ready to go to \nconference, they can come to us.\n  But everyone should understand that prior to the August recess, we \nare going to complete ethics and lobbying reform. We are going to do it \nif we have to spend nights, weekends, take days out of our August \nrecess. Everyone has had fair warning.\n  It takes a lot of time to overcome the hurdles they have placed in \nfront of us, but we are going to do that. It will eat up valuable \nSenate time, but we are going to do it. We are going to complete \nlobbying and ethics reform. That was the first bill we placed on the \nagenda, ethics and lobbying reform, to try to have the American people \nfeel better about their Congress and what we do.\n  I can still remember 9/11. I was in S-219. I was the first one in \nthat room that morning. It was a Tuesday morning. It is when Senator \nDaschle held his leadership meeting. Senator Breaux came in and said: \nFlip on the TV, something is happening in New York. We could see one of \nthe buildings burning.\n  Without elaborating in great detail, the leadership meeting started, \nsomeone came and got Senator Daschle. There was an evacuation of this \nbuilding that took place. There was a plane heading toward the Capitol.\n  It would take someone living in New York to understand the horror of \nthat day, I believe. But it was a horrible day. There was a 9/11 \nCommission appointed after great turmoil and consternation. The \nPresident fought that for a number of months. Finally, it was done, a \nbipartisan commission. They came back with recommendations. It has been \nalmost 3 years and those have not been implemented.\n  We passed in the Senate, as one of our top priorities, implementation \nof the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Remember, that same commission \ngraded the Bush administration on how they were implementing those \nrecommendations: Ds and Fs.\n  With the legislation we passed, all As. Once again, the Republicans \nhave stood in our way procedurally and will not let us go to \nconference. Yesterday someone came in and said: Well, I do not like \nwhat happens postaudit; we need to make sure that following the \nspending of those moneys the audit trail is appropriate.\n  So do I. So does every member of the Senate. We want this money spent \nwisely and properly. This is a diversionary, delaying tactic to stop us \nfrom doing this.\n  The President did not want the 9/11 Commission appointed in the first \nplace. He wouldn't implement the recommendations. He is trying to stop \nthe Congress from forcing him to sign a bill.\n  I will say the same thing on the 9/11 Commission recommendations that \nI said on ethics and lobbying reform. I am no longer going to come and \nbeg the Republicans to do what is good for the country. It is up to \nthem. When they get ready to do the 9/11 Commission recommendations, \ncome to us and we will appoint conferees immediately and complete the \nconference within a matter of a couple of days.\n  Like ethics and lobbying reform, we are going to complete this before \nthe August recess. Now, is that going to shorten the August recess? It \nis up to the Republicans. But we are going to complete this \nlegislation. It is not right that two of the most important issues \nfacing this country, ethics and lobbying reform--getting rid of the \nculture of corruption--and implementing the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations should not go into effect.\n  The 9/11 Commission recommendations, they are not just for the State \nof New York, they are for our country, to protect people in Las Vegas \nand Reno, to protect Hoover Dam, where millions of people cross that \nbridge every year, to make sure there is not some terrorist act, \nthrowing something over that dam, disrupting power that is generated \nthat goes, most of it, to California, or the water sources, most of \nwhich goes to California.\n  I think this is a very dangerous game the Republicans are playing, \ndelaying the implementation of ethics and lobbying reform and the \nimplementation of the 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8732-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to salute our majority leader, \nSenator Reid, for what he said. The bottom line is, these are two very \nimportant pieces of legislation.\n  The other side cannot come up with many substantive objections, none, \nas we have heard yesterday when they moved to block it. But they have \nhad a policy of obstruct, obstruct, obstruct. Why, you might ask? How \ndoes it help a political party? How does it help a Senator to obstruct \nthings that are motherhood and apple pie such as ethics and lobbying \nreform, the 9/11 Commission, things desperately needed, first by this \ntown and second by the whole Nation and of course my State.\n  The answer is very simple. When you are divided, as the other side is \non about every issue; when you can't lead, as yesterday's immigration \nbill showed, the President's No. 1 domestic priority--fewer than a \nquarter of the Senators on that side voted for it--there is only one \nanswer that can unify; that is, obstruct.\n  There is one problem with that--there are two. The main problem is: \nIt is wrong for America. It is wrong for America. The second is, it \ndoes not work politically. That is why we are seeing the fact that so \nmany on the other side are so worried.\n  So I wish to salute our majority leader. I will--and I know all the \nMembers on our side will--stand with him side by side. If we have to \nmeet at 2 in the morning, if we have to go into the August recess to \nget these things done, we will.\n  The Senate gives the minority the power to lay down the gauntlet of \ncloture and filibuster. You cannot move unless you get 60 votes. Of \ncourse, we do not have them. But we are not powerless. The ability to \npush through those filibusters--even if it means some inconvenience for \nthe Senators--is our right and I salute our majority leader for telling \nthe other side, and more importantly the American people, we will use \nthat right to move the Nation forward.\n  So I wish to thank our majority leader for doing this. It is the \nright thing to do. Everyone is put on notice. A little inconvenience \nfor the Senators to make our country safe, to clean up the unethical \nswamp in Washington, it sure is worth it. I think the majority leader \nis absolutely correct. I hope the other side will not continue to \nobstruct. But if they do, we will get these things done because our \ncountry and the American people demand no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8732-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8732-S8733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to make one other point in \nmorning business and talk about, very briefly, on the events of the day \nyesterday. Yesterday was a very sad day for America, in two instances, \nwhen an ideological extreme group set back our country on immigration.\n  On immigration, we had lots of prattling, lots of scare tactics. As a \nresult, the immigration bill is paralyzed. That\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\nmeans something. It means that illegal immigrants will continue to flow \ninto America. The number is 12 million; in 5 years, it will be 20 \nmillion. We will have done nothing. It will mean our legal immigration \npolicies will be backward, and thousands of people who should be in \nthis country, because of their skills and because we need them, will \nnot be allowed to enter. We will lose competitive advantage. We hear it \nall the time, companies wanting to locate in America because they love \nour system but, because they can't get employees, going to Europe or \nAsia.\n\n  On the immigration bill, a great nation is able to deal with its \nproblems. A great nation leads and overcomes narrow, partisan, and \nsometimes nasty division to move forward. A great nation fails when it \nbecomes paralyzed. I hope, I pray that what happened yesterday on the \nimmigration bill is not portentous of the future. I hope and pray what \nhappened yesterday on the immigration bill does not portend that we \nwill be tied in a knot on every single issue of major import--\neducation, health care, energy, immigration--and not able to move \nforward.\n  The double whammy: Yesterday, the Supreme Court, a new majority--the \ntwo new members of the Supreme Court who had impressed upon us their \nfidelity to stare decisis, to the rule of law, judicial modesty--with \none stroke of the pen threw out decades of progress on civil rights in \na reading just about everyone who participated in Brown v. Board who is \nstill alive commented on and said that the reading flies in the face of \nBrown v. Board, despite the fact that the Chief Justice said by \nallowing segregated schools to continue, he was helping implement Brown \nv. Board. That is doublespeak, if there ever was. The Nation was set \nback again.\n  What is happening? What happened here on the Senate floor yesterday \nand what happened across the street at the Supreme Court indicates that \na narrow ideological minority is setting this country back, paralyzing \nthis country. We live in a vast, changing global world where we need to \nmove forward. We seem paralyzed because of a small ideological \nminority.\n  I hope the American people will understand what has happened. I hope \nthe American people will voice their protest. I hope the Supreme Court \nwill come to its senses and not continue on this path of rollback on \ncivil rights. I hope the Senate will come to its senses and come \ntogether on a fair immigration bill that deals with our Nation's \nproblems. I pray for the future of this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8733-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to address a few things this \nmorning, some in retrospect of what has been for all of us a pretty \nemotional couple of weeks of debate, and also looking forward to what \nis going to occur when we return after the July 4 work period.\n  The first thing I would like to point out is my admiration for our \nmajority leader for how he handled the situation on the immigration \nbill. I think it was an extraordinarily difficult situation for our \nmajority leader to have been in, and he did a great job with a very \ndifficult assignment. I think we should back up and remember the bill \nthat was put before us had not gone through debate. It was put together \nin a bipartisan way but removed from the committee process. In other \nwords, people from both sides of the aisle, including some pretty \nstrong members of the leadership on both sides of the aisle, got \ntogether and put together this extraordinarily complex bill, which the \nPresident himself wanted to see passed, and then it fell to our \nmajority leader to attempt to get the provisions of the bill through \nthe Senate. So we had a situation where there were members of the other \nparty involved in putting together the components of the bill, we had a \nPresident who was urging that the bill be passed, and then our majority \nleader was the individual upon whom it fell to try to make this happen, \nwith very little cooperation, quite frankly, from the other side.\n  So I would just like to express my admiration and support for the \nmajority leader for the way he handled himself during this process.\n  Also with respect to the immigration bill, I think there has been a \nlot of rhetoric that has flown back and forth over the last 24 hours or \nso about motivations of individuals and what caused people to vote one \nway or the other. I think some of this is unfortunate. I think some of \nthe people who have made some of the more extreme comments are going to \nbe looking back at them 4 or 5 years from now and perhaps be a little \nbit embarrassed. This was an enormously complex piece of legislation. \nThere were parts of the legislation which were very good, and hopefully \nwe can find a way to bring them into law at another time. But there \nwere parts in that legislation which needed to be fixed.\n  I, personally, as the Presiding Officer knows, attempted to get an \namendment through the Senate that, in my view, would have brought \nfairness to the issue of legalization and practicality--fairness in the \nsense that the proposed bill was going to legalize every individual, \nvirtually, who had come to the United States in violation of American \nlaws by the end of last year--and I felt strongly for a good bit of \ntime that those who came during a period of lax immigration laws and \nwho were able to put roots down into the community should be provided a \npath toward citizenship. I made this case during the campaign last \nyear, and by saying that last year, I was viewed to be sort of on the \nforward edge of where this debate was going to go. But this bill, by \nreaching out and including virtually everyone who had been here by the \nend of last year, inflamed the passions of a lot of people in this \ncountry who otherwise would support fair immigration reform.\n  At the same time, the amendment I offered also proposed to eliminate \nwhat is called the touchback provision, which would have eliminated--\nfor those people who had been here for 4 years and had put down roots--\nthe necessity for them to go back to their home country in order to \napply for a green card.\n  I think that approach was fair. I regret that the amendment didn't \npass. At the same time, I and a number of other people found it \nimpossible for us to vote for the bill as it was coming up with the \nprovision that was so much broader.\n  The bottom line on immigration now is there are laws on the books. We \nhave seen a lot of talk over the past day or so that immigration reform \nis dead. These comprehensive immigration reform packages have a way of \nfalling under their own weight because the issue itself is so complex. \nWhat we should be doing now, in the next year and a half or so, given \nthat there is an election, is to do everything we can to enforce the \nlaws that are on the books. One idea I like is the $4.4 billion \nrecommendation that was put into title I of this immigration bill that \njust failed that would go toward border security, and employer \ncertification could well be added to any appropriations bill, where the \nmeasure would be relevant and could help existing law.\n  So for those who are attempting to say that all immigration reform \nhas now skidded to a halt because a flawed bill was not passed by this \nbody, I say let's enforce the existing laws. There are a lot of laws on \nthe books. One of the greatest problems we have had is particularly in \nthe area of workers being hired by employers on a large scale who know \nthey are here without papers. In those sorts of areas, there are laws \non the books we need to enforce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8733-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8733-S8734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFIRMATION OF GENERAL LUTE\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, yesterday, this body confirmed General Lute \nof the U.S. Army to be a Deputy National Security Adviser to cover the \noperations that are ongoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. I voted against \nGeneral Lute.\n  I will explain why I voted against General Lute because I believe \nthere is a pretty important principle at stake\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\nwith respect to civil-military relations that I think has been ignored \nover the past 20 years or so. I have no problems with General Lute's \nqualifications. There was a letter from White House counsel on the \nissue of constitutionality, which indicated there is no constitutional \npreclusion from a uniformed officer serving as a political adviser to \nthe President. I found that legal opinion incomplete.\n  We should understand that the legal opinion came from the counsel to \nthe President. We could not exactly have expected that he would have \nsaid anything otherwise. But I find it incomplete in the sense that it \ndid not address the true dangers if we continue to do this as we have \nbeen over the past 20 years.\n  The danger to our system is this: The U.S. military is a decidedly \nnonpolitical organization. I grew up in the military. At the time I was \ngrowing up, my father would not even tell me how he voted because he \nbelieved it violated his duty in terms of being a nonpolitical arm of \nthe U.S. Government.\n  The difficulty, when a President brings an Active-Duty military \nofficer inside the room, in an area where they are giving political \nadvice--not military advice but political advice--unavoidably is that \nthis particular individual then becomes a part of a political \nadministration. If they keep the uniform on, when their tour is done \nand they go back into the military, they are inseparable from the \npolitical administration in which they served, particularly in the eyes \nof other military people.\n  So two things happen: One is you have a political entity inside the \nU.S. military that, in some ways, threatens open dialog inside the \nmilitary because now you have a former member of a particular \nadministration inside the uniformed circle.\n  Here is a good parallel. I was Assistant Secretary of Defense and \nthen I was Secretary of the Navy. Let's say we allow military people \nwho become Secretaries of the Navy to go back into uniform and compete \nfor promotion among other uniformed people. It is a very difficult \nthing in terms of how it affects the neutrality of the American \nmilitary, and also it creates, in many military people, the notion that \nthey have to become political in order to succeed. We don't want that.\n  I would have voted in opposition to the other individuals who were \nnamed by Senator Warner yesterday as people who have served in \nadministrations and then returned to the military, including Colin \nPowell, whom I respect personally; General Scowcroft, whom I admire \ngreatly; and, quite frankly, the sitting Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency today.\n  I believe any uniformed officer who agrees to serve as a policy \nadviser inside an administration, with political implications to that \njob, should agree to take the uniform off and not return to the active \nmilitary. I intend to pursue this over the coming years. This isn't \nrelated directly to General Lute. It is a principle that I think we \nneed to establish here in the Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8734-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8734-S8735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TROOP ROTATION\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, the third point I wish to make, looking \nforward, is that when we return, we are going to be looking at the \nDefense authorization bill. I am going to be introducing an amendment \nwhen this bill comes up that, in my view, speaks directly to the \nwelfare of our troops and their families. After more than 4 years of \ncombat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, we still have not developed \nthe type of operational policy that looks to the welfare of the people \nwho are having to serve again and again. We have allowed the strategy, \nsuch as it is--which is all over the place--to define the use of our \ntroops, and we have reached the point, as we work to resolve our \nsituation in Iraq and dramatically reduce our presence--I hope--where \nwe are burning out our troops.\n  The evidence is everywhere. We have a small group of people who have \nbeen carrying the load for this country. They have been going again and \nagain. We are violating the normal rotation policies that we took great \ncare to put in place over long years of experience. Traditionally, in \nthe U.S. military, on the active side, there is a 2-for-1 ratio. If you \nare gone for a year, you are back for 2 years. If you deploy at sea for \n6 months, you are back for a year. That is not downtime; that is well \ntime. When I say it is not downtime, that means they are not sitting \naround doing nothing when they are back. When people return from \ndeployment, they have to reacquaint themselves with their families and \ntake care of those sorts of things. They have to gear units back up, \nget the equipment, train, lock on, and go to different training areas. \nSo the 2 for 1 generally is split: a third gone, a third recuperating \nand getting ready, and a third getting ready to go.\n\n  What we have today in the ground forces of the active military is not \neven a 1 for 1. People are returning and immediately getting ready to \ngo back. We are seeing the wear and tear of this on our Armed Forces. \nThe West Point classes of 2000 and 2001 are the most recent ``canaries \nin the coal mine,'' if you want to look at what is happening to the \nActive Duty military because of these continuous deployments. The time \nhas not been made available to do other things when they return. The \nWest Point classes have a 5-year obligation before an individual can \nleave the military. The West Point classes of 2000 and 2001--the two \nmost recent classes--have an attrition rate that is five times as high \nas the attrition rates before the Iraq war. The West Point class of \n2000 had lost 54 percent of its members from active duty by the end of \nlast year. I don't know the number for today. The class of 2001, with \nan active obligation which ended as of last June--only last June--by \nthe end of last year, within 6 months, had lost 46 percent of its \nclass. You are seeing the same thing in the staff NCO ranks. We are \nstarting to see it in a way that I cannot recall since probably the \nlate 1970s, when the bottom fell out particularly of the U.S. Navy.\n  In the Guard and Reserve, the normal rotational cycle is 5 to 1. What \nwe are seeing now in many units is less than 3 to 1. So I am going to \nintroduce a bill that will basically say that on the active side, \nhowever long an individual has been deployed, they have to be allowed \nto stay home at least that long before you send them back. If you are \nGuard and Reserve, however long you have been deployed, you have to \nhave been at home at least three times that length before you are sent \nback because of the nature of the Guard and Reserve.\n  In my view, this amendment is an absolute floor; it is our absolute \nduty as fiduciaries of the well-being of the people who serve that we \ndon't let it go beyond that. As a point of reference again, in the Army \nright now, they have gone on 15-month tours with only 12 months at \nhome. Historically, if you were gone 15 months, you should have 30 \nmonths at home. This needs to be fixed. I hope the Senate will \noverwhelmingly support us.\n  There are two questions about this policy that have come up in my \ndiscussions on the Armed Services Committee. The first question from \nsome is, is it within the Constitution for the Congress to tell the \nCommander in Chief what the rotation cycle should look like? My answer \nis that it is clearly within the Constitution. Congress has the power \nto set these sorts of regulations. In fact, there is precedent. If you \nlook at the situation of the Korean War, where because of the emergency \nof the attack from North Korea, we were sending soldiers into Korea who \nwere not trained--they never fired a weapon before--because they had to \nfill the bill of going over there. The Congress stepped in and said you \ncannot send any military person overseas until they have been in the \nmilitary for 120 days. That was the Congress properly exercising its \nconstitutional prerogative in order to protect our troops. This is what \nwe are going to do.\n  The second issue that has come up is whether this is micromanagement. \nQuite frankly, when the leadership of the U.S. military is not stepping \nup and defending their own people, we have a duty to slow this thing \ndown. This war has been going on for more than 4 years. We have a lot \nof issues we are going to be discussing in this authorization bill that \nare designed to get a better policy that will reduce our footprint, \nthat will enable us to fight international terrorism around the world, \nthat will increase the stability of the region with proper diplomatic \nefforts and will allow us to address our strategic interests elsewhere.\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\n  But until that happens, we have to take care of the troops. This is \nthe bottom line, the floor. This isn't some grand scheme of trying to \npush an ideal troop rotation scenario. This is the bottom line we owe \nto the people who have been sent into harm's way.\n  I may be one of the few people in this body who has had a father \ndeploy, who has deployed, and who has had a son deployed. I think there \nare a lot of people in the country who are that way, who right now are \nlooking at their level of being sent into harm's way. They are looking \nfor somebody to put some logic into how their levels are being used. It \nis on us, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while the junior Senator from \nVirginia is here, I wish to commend him. I wish to say, first of all, \nhe is an exceptionally passionate and knowledgeable source of valuable \ninformation to us on the Armed Services Committee. The proposal he has \noutlined, which will be in the form of an amendment to the Department \nof Defense authorization bill, has exceptional common sense attached to \nit--that you don't deploy troops unless they are trained and unless \nthey have enough time to reevaluate, reequip, rearm, and retrain.\n  I thank the Senator for his contribution. I am certainly inclined to \nsupport his amendment. This Senator from Florida will have an amendment \nthat we have been trying for 7 years to pass to take care of the widows \nand orphans. Even President Lincoln, in his second inaugural address, \nsaid that one of the greatest obligations in war is to take care of the \nwidow and the orphan. The U.S. Government ought to plan as an expense \nof the cost of a war taking care not only of the veterans but of their \nwidows, widowers, and orphans.\n  What we have done in law is, where we provide for a survivor's \nbenefit plan that the military member pays for out of their check, that \nplan, in fact, is offset by the disability compensation that family \nmember gets from the Veterans' Administration. This Senator is going to \ncontinue this quest until we finally prevail to get that offset \nremoved.\n  Of course, the objection to it is it costs $9 billion over 10 years. \nBut is it an obligation of the Government to take care of the widow and \nthe orphan as a result of war? This Senator passionately and firmly \nfeels it is.\n  I wanted to lay that out as a marker, along with my congratulatory \ncomments to the Senator from Virginia for his wonderful service in the \nSenate, his insightful service as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, and his very commonsense approach to this DOD authorization \nbill and the amendment he will be offering.\n  I will yield to the Senator if he wishes to make any followup \ncomments. I wish to share with the Senate something that occurred in \nthe Appropriations Committee yesterday that is quite disturbing.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, if he will yield for 2 \nminutes. I very much appreciate my good friend's comments in support. \nIt means a lot to me that he has that kind of confidence in the \napproach I will be trying to take here.\n  Also, I am pretty familiar with how the survivor benefit program has \nbeen misused. My mother was a benefit of the survivor benefit program. \nI don't think there is a strong recognition up here that is a private \ninsurance program that is paid into and is separate from other \nbenefits. My father paid into that program more than $200 a month from \n1969 until his death in 1997. Then when my mother got the benefit, they \noffset it at that time, I believe, from a Social Security payment that \nhe also paid into.\n  There are inequities in how that program has been administered and \nhow it interacts with other areas of Federal law. I will be happy to \nexplore that with the Senator and see if we can't come up with some \nkind of solution.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I say to the Senator, Mr. President, that the \nyoung corporals and privates who are not returning home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, who leave widows and children who are paying today out of \ntheir own paycheck into that survivor's benefit plan, of which in that \ninsurance program their survivors are entitled, that, in fact, because \nof the current law of the offset, they don't get that which has already \nbeen paid for by the active-duty military member because of the \neligibility of the widow and the children under the indemnity \ncompensation through the Veterans' Administration. The current law \noffsets one against another.\n  What is so sad is that the survivors, the widows and children of \nthese young corporals and privates, are finding it very difficult to \nmake financial ends meet as a result of that offset.\n  This Senator is going to give the Senate an opportunity to change \nthat in 2 weeks when we are on the DOD bill. If the Senate responds as \nwe did last year and the year before in passing it, then we are going \nto have to insist when it gets down to a conference committee with the \nHouse it doesn't get stripped out like the House leadership last year \nand the year before did in stripping out what the Senate has passed.\n  I share that with my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8735-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8735-S8736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BREAKING THE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to tell a story that is \nquite disturbing that happened in the Appropriations Committee \nyesterday. The Appropriations Committee, as reported to this Senator, \nhad quite a row yesterday in the full committee in inserting a \nprovision that will call for seismic exploration for oil and gas in the \neastern Gulf of Mexico. It was such a row yesterday because it breaks \nthe agreement that was made on the floor of the Senate last year in \nwhich the two Senators from Florida, this Senator and my colleague \nSenator Martinez, had agreed to a plan by which there can be additional \noil drilling and gas drilling in a lease sale 181 that would not be \nwhat was sought--about 2 million acres--but it expanded 8.3 million \nacres in an expanded lease sale 181, but that kept it away from the \ncoast of Florida and away from the military mission line which is the \nboundary protecting the largest testing and training area for the \nUnited States military in the world.\n  Virtually all of the waters of the Gulf of Mexico off the State of \nFlorida are this testing and training area. It is where we test our \nsophisticated weapons systems. It is where we test newly developed \nweapons systems. It is where we test weapons systems that have to go \nhundreds of miles, all of which these systems employ live ordinance \nunder battlefield conditions in order to see that the equipment and the \nsystems and the ordinance are all going to work.\n  Over and over, we have had letters from the Secretary of Defense to \nthe Senate saying we cannot have oil and gas rigs on the surface in the \nGulf of Mexico in the area where we are doing all this testing and \ntraining.\n  One wonders why, in the last round of the base realignment and \nclosure, did the pilot training for the new FA-22 stealth fighter come \nto the Gulf of Mexico at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City. It is \nbecause that system now, in all pilot training, does dogfights at 1.5 \nmach. That is 1\\1/2\\ times the speed of sound. That is twice as much as \nthe systems we have now, the F-16 and the F-15, twice as much that they \ndo, the speed of air-to-air combat. As a result, they have to have so \nmuch wider area in which to have that turning radius as that weapons \nsystem is doing its practice in the dogfights shooting live ordinance.\n\n  Is it any wonder why, in the development of the new joint strike \nfighter, the F-35, that the F-35, once it is developed, all the pilot \ntraining for the Navy, for the Air Force, and for the Marines will take \nplace on the gulf coast and it will take place at Eglin Air Force Base. \nWhy? The same reason. We have that restricted airspace in the largest \ntesting and training area in the world, and now we have a breaking of \nthe agreement as a result of yesterday's Appropriations Committee \naction, a breaking of the agreement that we had last year when this \nSenator and my colleague from Florida agreed we would have the \nexpansion of lease sale 181 when it would not intrude into the military \nmission area.\n  Now the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, and the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Dorgan, want to propose\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\nseismic exploration and inventorying of oil almost all the way up to \nthe coast. Why do they want to do an inventory for oil unless they want \nto drill? This is exactly the situation that the oil industry will not \ngive up. They want to drill, drill, drill, and that has been part of \nour problem for five decades as we have gone through this drill, drill, \ndrill mentality without going to alternative energy sources. That is \nwhat has led us to the point we are today--so dependent on oil--and \neven to the point of now importing 60 percent of our daily consumption \nof oil is coming from places such as the Persian Gulf, Nigeria, and \nVenezuela, all very unstable parts of the world.\n  Back to the breaking of the agreement. It was broken with regard to \nwhat we agreed to last year, that it was over and done with. We were \ngoing to protect the military mission area. That was broken yesterday \nin the Appropriations Committee.\n  Another thing that was broken in the Appropriations Committee was the \nfact that in our agreement, the two Senators from Florida had clearly \ntried to protect a $57 billion a year tourist industry that depends on \npristine beaches. Our tourism economy depends on those beaches not \nhaving oil slicks slapping up onto those pristine white sands.\n  Naturally, the Senators from Florida are going to protect that \ninterest. People say: Oh, no, the spills that occur don't come from the \noil rigs out there, they come from tankers. But isn't it interesting \nthat we have so many photographs of oil rigs and oil slicks in the Gulf \nof Mexico as a result of Katrina raging across the Gulf of Mexico and \nultimately hitting Mississippi and Louisiana? We have pictures of oil \nrigs that are up-ended on the shore. We have pictures of pelicans, \nhundreds of pelicans that are dying, covered in oil slicks as a result \nof that storm causing the spills from those oil rigs. Now, we don't \nwant that in Florida. We want to protect our beaches.\n\n  It would be one thing if the geology showed there was a lot of oil \nand gas in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. But for the past 50 years, in \nthe exploratory wells that have been there, there have been dry holes. \nThe geology shows there is not that much oil and gas. Yet the oil \nindustry never gives up, regardless of the agreements that have been \nmade and were broken yesterday in the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nSo it leaves no choice--no choice to the Senators from Florida. Senator \nMartinez and this Senator will employ every available rule to us under \nthe Senate Rules Committee to block the progress of that Energy \nappropriations bill as it comes to the floor.\n  There were representations made yesterday to this Senator and to \nSenator Martinez that the leadership of the appropriations subcommittee \nwill, in fact, strip out that part of the bill when it comes to the \nfloor. I take those Senators at their word. If that is the case, we \nwill not have a big fight on the floor of the Senate, and we can \nproceed and go about appropriating the monies that we need in an energy \nand water appropriations bill--much needed funding for so many \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, it is with a realistic heart that I have to make this \nspeech today. So it comes to this. I will take the word of those \nSenators, and I will rely on their word that we won't have to engage in \nall kinds of parliamentary maneuvers. But if that be necessary, it will \nbe done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8736-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8736-S8737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FIRING OF U.S. ATTORNEYS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we have had an unfortunate event \noccur. The Senate and House Judiciary Committees have issued subpoenas \nto the President for internal personal communications with the \nPresident's own personal staff and documents related thereto in a \nmatter unrelated to a criminal investigation. A political inquiry is \nall this is about. Yesterday the President had to assert executive \nprivilege and refuse to produce a very certain, limited number of \ndocuments relating to the replacement of U.S. attorneys around the \ncountry.\n  I served as a U.S. attorney for 12 years. I know U.S. attorneys serve \nat the pleasure of the President. I know U.S. attorneys on a few \noccasions actually try cases and get involved in cases. I did pretty \noften. I tried some fairly big cases. Most U.S. attorneys in larger \noffices preside over the office and career assistant U.S. attorneys and \nFBI agents and so forth and investigate cases and prosecute them. That \nis the way it goes.\n  The reality is that they can be removed at any time by the President. \nIt is not a congressional function to determine whether or not a U.S. \nattorney is removed. The Congress is involved only in the confirmation \nof U.S. attorneys.\n  The President and Attorney General Gonzales did not handle the recent \nresignation of 8 U.S. Attorneys very well. I believe they thought they \ncould do it and not really have much of a reason for it, yet say they \nthought performance was not good. Maybe they simply wanted to replace \nthat attorney with someone else. But U.S. attorneys have friends in law \nenforcement. They have friends in the local community. They have \nSenators who recommend them and help them get confirmed. They have \nclout. It became a big brouhaha. There was a big dispute about it, and \nvarious accusations were made.\n  I was present for the hearings before the Judiciary Committee. \nFrankly, most of the accusations have been proven baseless. But in \nexplaining it all, the Attorney General and some of his staff did not \ndo a good job. They embarrassed the Department, frankly, and fed \ndemands for more and more and more to keep this story alive, to keep \nthis matter going. Now we are at the point where subpoenas have been \nissued.\n  The committee issued five subpoenas on June 13. Two of the subpoenas \nwere issued to the White House for documents to be produced on or \nbefore June 28, 2007. A third subpoena was issued by the House \nJudiciary Committee to Harriet Miers for both documents and testimony, \nfor a response by July 12. Harriet Miers was a lawyer for the \nPresident. She was White House Counsel. The fourth and fifth subpoenas \nwere issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee to Sara Taylor for \ndocuments and testimony respectively and called for a response on or \nbefore June 28 and testimony for a hearing on July 11.\n  This is an overreach legally. It is an overreach insofar as the \ntraditional comity that should exist between coequal branches of \nGovernment. Executive privilege is not a principle that should be \nlightly dismissed. It is a very real, legitimate principle that our \nGovernment has. What would we have next? Would we want to be \nsubpoenaing the law clerks for Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg and \nJustice Roberts of the Supreme Court to see what those staffers told \nthe judges before they rendered their ruling? What about Senators and \nour staffs? How about that?\n  This has not been a stonewalling by the administration on the U.S. \nattorneys issue. The Department of Justice has released or made \navailable for review approximately 8,500 pages of documents. Top \nofficials in the Department of Justice, including the Attorney General \nhimself, the Deputy Attorney General, Paul McNulty, the Attorney \nGeneral's former chief of staff, and many other officials have \ntestified at public hearings and submitted themselves for on-the-record \ninterviews to answer any questions. The President offered to go even \nfurther by providing Congress with additional documents, to make \navailable for interviews the President's former Counsel, Harriet Miers; \nKarl Rove, his political counselor; Deputy Counsel, Bill Kelly; former \nDirector of Political Affairs, Sara Taylor; Scott Jennings, Special \nAssistant to the President. All of those would be made available to be \ninquired of.\n  That was an effort by the executive branch to satisfy the curiosity \nof the legislative branch and to go as far and even further, maybe, in \nmy view, than required by law. That was a genuine, generous suggestion \nas to how to handle this conflict between the two branches, our desire \nto look in there and see everything that went on and pry open the lid \nand probe and fish a little bit and see what we find and a legitimate \nright of a President to have a\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\nstaff that responds to his or her demands and gives the President \nunvarnished advice, pointing out problems, honestly and openly, without \nany expectation it is going to be on the front page of the New York \nTimes the next day, for heaven's sake.\n\n  So I just want to say, I am sorry and disappointed our chairman, \nChairman Leahy, has utilized the power the committee gave him to decide \nwhether to issue a subpoena or not, to actually issue subpoenas.\n  So now what has happened? The President said: These subpoenas go too \nfar. Even so, I am not afraid to have my people talk. The President has \noffered that Harriet Miers come to the Hill and be interviewed by the \nJudiciary Committee. But in preserving the historic integrity and \nconfidentiality of a President and their own staff, the President does \nnot want to produce confidential communications made to him by his \nstaff. I think it would erode any President's legitimate prerogative, \nfor time immemorial, if Congress were able to do that.\n  I would suggest we in this Senate can understand that. Who of us \nwould want our chief of staff to be hauled in to some committee when \nthere is no suggestion of a criminal offense having occurred and then \nbeing cross-examined on everything our chiefs of staff told us? I just \nmet with my chief counsel, Cindy Hayden, and we talked about these \nissues. She is an excellent lawyer. We have recently met and talked \nabout the immigration bill that the Senate was debating.\n  Maybe the White House, which took a different view than mine on \nimmigration, would like to embarrass me by issuing subpoenas to see if \nthey could find out something in memos or documents or conversations we \nhad about the bill and the flawed legislative process that brought it \nto the floor.\n  The executive branch has the power of subpoena also. Would our \nMembers over here on the Senate Judiciary Committee be happy if the \nWhite House issued subpoenas to find out if any of our Members may have \ndelayed the confirmation process in order to impact the outcome of some \ncase that might be pending before a court of appeals at a given time in \na given State?\n  Would we want to have all that happen to us? If these are criminal \nthings, you get to do that. If they are not criminal things, comity, \nrespect between our branches would suggest that any leader have certain \nrights to have candid, confidential communications with their own staff \nabout matters of great importance to our Nation. The courts have it. \nCongress has it. The executive branch has it. There is case law that \nhas addressed this type of privilege. Executive privilege is not \nsomething that is made up; it is something that is very real.\n  Now, I am not one who would want to come in and predict how cases \nwould come out, but based on the openness the President has shown with \nregard to providing to the Congress his staff people for interviews, I \nam not sure there is a legal basis for this.\n  Yes, in the meantime, it will look good politically. Those who issued \nthe subpoenas--and are proud of themselves, knowing the President \nprobably will never be able to accept this and would have to resist and \nhave to object--can accuse him of hiding. They can accuse him of \nstonewalling. They can say he is in denial, that he will not cooperate \nwith the Congress, that he is operating in secrecy. These baseless \naccusations will just further fuel the charges people have made about \nthis good man who is trying to serve the country the best he can. I \ncertainly believe that.\n  So here we are. Chairman Leahy issued the subpoenas. Now the \nPresident has objected, which he has a perfect right to do. What \nhappens now? There are several options, one of which is to litigate. If \nthat path is chosen, a court will have decide it. It will go to the \ncourts, and there will be an argument whether there is a legitimate \nevoking of executive privilege.\n  I wish it had not happened. That is all I am saying. We, I believe, \nhave overreached in this instance. I cannot imagine we would want to \ndemand that the President's own lawyer, Harriet Miers, be required to \nproduce every memo she gave to the President and every conversation she \nhad about any matter in the White House unless it amounted, as I said, \nto some criminal offense, which nobody is suggesting has occurred here. \nIt is just not good policy, and we have to be bigger than short-term \npolitics in this Senate. We have to be bigger than that.\n  I want to say, in my best judgment, we should not have shoved it this \nfar. We have overreached. The President does have a legitimate claim of \nexecutive privilege. Over 8,500 documents and e-mails that went from \nthe White House to the Cabinet Department, the Department of Justice, \nhave been produced. It is only those conversations and communications \nbetween the President's closest advisers and the President himself \nwhich the White House feels should not be produced because of the \nhistorical implications of it for Presidents in the future. In this \ninstance, I think the President is within his rights.\n  My best judgment, based on what I know today, is that this is not \nlegitimate under our current law, and it is absolutely not justified \nunder our discretion as Members of Congress.

I think that was a real strong gesture of \nopenness, but that was promptly rejected because I think some in the \nCongress--Senate and House--would rather have a fight and try to make a \npolitical point than actually get to the truth of those matters.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we have had an unfortunate event \noccur. The Senate and House Judiciary Committees have issued subpoenas \nto the President for internal personal communications with the \nPresident's own personal staff and documents related thereto in a \nmatter unrelated to a criminal investigation. A political inquiry is \nall this is about. Yesterday the President had to assert executive \nprivilege and refuse to produce a very certain, limited number of \ndocuments relating to the replacement of U.S. attorneys around the \ncountry.\n  I served as a U.S. attorney for 12 years. I know U.S. attorneys serve \nat the pleasure of the President. I know U.S. attorneys on a few \noccasions actually try cases and get involved in cases. I did pretty \noften. I tried some fairly big cases. Most U.S. attorneys in larger \noffices preside over the office and career assistant U.S. attorneys and \nFBI agents and so forth and investigate cases and prosecute them. That \nis the way it goes.\n  The reality is that they can be removed at any time by the President. \nIt is not a congressional function to determine whether or not a U.S. \nattorney is removed. The Congress is involved only in the confirmation \nof U.S. attorneys.\n  The President and Attorney General Gonzales did not handle the recent \nresignation of 8 U.S. Attorneys very well. I believe they thought they \ncould do it and not really have much of a reason for it, yet say they \nthought performance was not good. Maybe they simply wanted to replace \nthat attorney with someone else. But U.S. attorneys have friends in law \nenforcement. They have friends in the local community. They have \nSenators who recommend them and help them get confirmed. They have \nclout. It became a big brouhaha. There was a big dispute about it, and \nvarious accusations were made.\n  I was present for the hearings before the Judiciary Committee. \nFrankly, most of the accusations have been proven baseless. But in \nexplaining it all, the Attorney General and some of his staff did not \ndo a good job. They embarrassed the Department, frankly, and fed \ndemands for more and more and more to keep this story alive, to keep \nthis matter going. Now we are at the point where subpoenas have been \nissued.\n  The committee issued five subpoenas on June 13. Two of the subpoenas \nwere issued to the White House for documents to be produced on or \nbefore June 28, 2007. A third subpoena was issued by the House \nJudiciary Committee to Harriet Miers for both documents and testimony, \nfor a response by July 12. Harriet Miers was a lawyer for the \nPresident. She was White House Counsel. The fourth and fifth subpoenas \nwere issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee to Sara Taylor for \ndocuments and testimony respectively and called for a response on or \nbefore June 28 and testimony for a hearing on July 11.\n  This is an overreach legally. It is an overreach insofar as the \ntraditional comity that should exist between coequal branches of \nGovernment. Executive privilege is not a principle that should be \nlightly dismissed. It is a very real, legitimate principle that our \nGovernment has. What would we have next? Would we want to be \nsubpoenaing the law clerks for Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg and \nJustice Roberts of the Supreme Court to see what those staffers told \nthe judges before they rendered their ruling? What about Senators and \nour staffs? How about that?\n  This has not been a stonewalling by the administration on the U.S. \nattorneys issue. The Department of Justice has released or made \navailable for review approximately 8,500 pages of documents. Top \nofficials in the Department of Justice, including the Attorney General \nhimself, the Deputy Attorney General, Paul McNulty, the Attorney \nGeneral's former chief of staff, and many other officials have \ntestified at public hearings and submitted themselves for on-the-record \ninterviews to answer any questions. The President offered to go even \nfurther by providing Congress with additional documents, to make \navailable for interviews the President's former Counsel, Harriet Miers; \nKarl Rove, his political counselor; Deputy Counsel, Bill Kelly; former \nDirector of Political Affairs, Sara Taylor; Scott Jennings, Special \nAssistant to the President. All of those would be made available to be \ninquired of.\n  That was an effort by the executive branch to satisfy the curiosity \nof the legislative branch and to go as far and even further, maybe, in \nmy view, than required by law. That was a genuine, generous suggestion \nas to how to handle this conflict between the two branches, our desire \nto look in there and see everything that went on and pry open the lid \nand probe and fish a little bit and see what we find and a legitimate \nright of a President to have a\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\nstaff that responds to his or her demands and gives the President \nunvarnished advice, pointing out problems, honestly and openly, without \nany expectation it is going to be on the front page of the New York \nTimes the next day, for heaven's sake.\n\n  So I just want to say, I am sorry and disappointed our chairman, \nChairman Leahy, has utilized the power the committee gave him to decide \nwhether to issue a subpoena or not, to actually issue subpoenas.\n  So now what has happened? The President said: These subpoenas go too \nfar. Even so, I am not afraid to have my people talk. The President has \noffered that Harriet Miers come to the Hill and be interviewed by the \nJudiciary Committee. But in preserving the historic integrity and \nconfidentiality of a President and their own staff, the President does \nnot want to produce confidential communications made to him by his \nstaff. I think it would erode any President's legitimate prerogative, \nfor time immemorial, if Congress were able to do that.\n  I would suggest we in this Senate can understand that. Who of us \nwould want our chief of staff to be hauled in to some committee when \nthere is no suggestion of a criminal offense having occurred and then \nbeing cross-examined on everything our chiefs of staff told us? I just \nmet with my chief counsel, Cindy Hayden, and we talked about these \nissues. She is an excellent lawyer. We have recently met and talked \nabout the immigration bill that the Senate was debating.\n  Maybe the White House, which took a different view than mine on \nimmigration, would like to embarrass me by issuing subpoenas to see if \nthey could find out something in memos or documents or conversations we \nhad about the bill and the flawed legislative process that brought it \nto the floor.\n  The executive branch has the power of subpoena also. Would our \nMembers over here on the Senate Judiciary Committee be happy if the \nWhite House issued subpoenas to find out if any of our Members may have \ndelayed the confirmation process in order to impact the outcome of some \ncase that might be pending before a court of appeals at a given time in \na given State?\n  Would we want to have all that happen to us? If these are criminal \nthings, you get to do that. If they are not criminal things, comity, \nrespect between our branches would suggest that any leader have certain \nrights to have candid, confidential communications with their own staff \nabout matters of great importance to our Nation. The courts have it. \nCongress has it. The executive branch has it. There is case law that \nhas addressed this type of privilege. Executive privilege is not \nsomething that is made up; it is something that is very real.\n  Now, I am not one who would want to come in and predict how cases \nwould come out, but based on the openness the President has shown with \nregard to providing to the Congress his staff people for interviews, I \nam not sure there is a legal basis for this.\n  Yes, in the meantime, it will look good politically. Those who issued \nthe subpoenas--and are proud of themselves, knowing the President \nprobably will never be able to accept this and would have to resist and \nhave to object--can accuse him of hiding. They can accuse him of \nstonewalling. They can say he is in denial, that he will not cooperate \nwith the Congress, that he is operating in secrecy. These baseless \naccusations will just further fuel the charges people have made about \nthis good man who is trying to serve the country the best he can. I \ncertainly believe that.\n  So here we are. Chairman Leahy issued the subpoenas. Now the \nPresident has objected, which he has a perfect right to do. What \nhappens now? There are several options, one of which is to litigate. If \nthat path is chosen, a court will have decide it. It will go to the \ncourts, and there will be an argument whether there is a legitimate \nevoking of executive privilege.\n  I wish it had not happened. That is all I am saying. We, I believe, \nhave overreached in this instance. I cannot imagine we would want to \ndemand that the President's own lawyer, Harriet Miers, be required to \nproduce every memo she gave to the President and every conversation she \nhad about any matter in the White House unless it amounted, as I said, \nto some criminal offense, which nobody is suggesting has occurred here. \nIt is just not good policy, and we have to be bigger than short-term \npolitics in this Senate. We have to be bigger than that.\n  I want to say, in my best judgment, we should not have shoved it this \nfar. We have overreached. The President does have a legitimate claim of \nexecutive privilege. Over 8,500 documents and e-mails that went from \nthe White House to the Cabinet Department, the Department of Justice, \nhave been produced. It is only those conversations and communications \nbetween the President's closest advisers and the President himself \nwhich the White House feels should not be produced because of the \nhistorical implications of it for Presidents in the future. In this \ninstance, I think the President is within his rights.\n  My best judgment, based on what I know today, is that this is not \nlegitimate under our current law, and it is absolutely not justified \nunder our discretion as Members of Congress. We ought to have more \nrespect for the other branch than to push this request beyond the \nlimits to the point we have today.\n  So, Madam President, I want to be on record to say that I understand \nwhy the President would object to making these disclosures of internal \ncommunications between the President and his own personal, closest \nstaff, after, of course, having produced communications between he and \nhis staff and the Department of Justice that have been produced and \nmaking those staff members available for private inquiry among the \nleadership of the Congress.

Madam President, this Sunday is the halfway mark of the \nyear 2007. It is also the 2-month mark since President Bush vetoed the \nsupplemental appropriations bill we sent to him which would have set a \nresponsible path to reduce our combat operations, save lives, and \nfinally change course in Iraq. President Bush called our bill a \n``recipe for chaos.''\n  Now that 2 months have passed, here is what has happened under the \nPresident's escalation plan. It is clearly chaos: 126 brave Americans \ndied in May alone, and more than 100 in June. This quarter has been the \ndeadliest in the entire war. Sectarian killings have not declined. \nYesterday, more than 20 Iraqis were beheaded. There is little evidence \nthe Iraqi Government will meet any of the political benchmarks they \nhave set for themselves. The surge was supposed to create the space for \nIraq's political leaders to make the difficult decisions to unite their \ncountry. That has not occurred.\n  I have said from the beginning that as long as President Bush remains \nobstinate and the Republicans in Congress continue to toe his line, \nthis tragic war will continue. There is no sign of President Bush \nawakening to the devastating reality of this intractable war. But this \nweek, there is new reason for optimism in that my Republican colleagues \nin the Senate are finally willing to join in calling for a new \ndirection.\n  A couple of days ago, on Tuesday, I congratulated the ranking member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Richard Lugar, for \ncourageously breaking ranks with President Bush and calling for the war \nto end. Senator Lugar said, among other things:\n\n       Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy will delay \n     policy adjustments that have a better chance of protecting \n     our vital interests over the long term.\n\n  I agree with those words.\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\n  The day after Senator Lugar's comments, another distinguished \nRepublican on the Foreign Relations Committee, George Voinovich, wrote \na letter to the President. In the letter, Senator Voinovich urged the \nPresident to wake up to the truth that so many of us already know: that \nthe war cannot be won militarily.\n  It can only be won politically. Yet another distinguished member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, then said he expects the \nnumber of Republican defections with the President to rise.\n  I am encouraged by what we are hearing now from Republican Senators, \neven though it is only a handful. But when you join these three \nSenators with Senators Smith and Hagel, we are up to five. We still \nhave 44 to go.\n  I said earlier this week that this could and should be a turning \npoint. After the recess, we will turn to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, which is our next chance to force the President to \nchange course.\n  But we are still a long way from reaching our goal. More Republicans \nare saying the right things, but now we badly need for them to put \ntheir words into action by voting the right way also.\n  The current handful of Republicans isn't enough. We would not be able \nto get any legislation passed without 60 votes, but we are getting \ncloser. We are not where we need to be yet.\n  In May, as I said, the President called our plan a ``recipe for \nchaos.'' Each day that goes by we sink further and further into the \nPresident's escalation, and it becomes even clearer that the best way \nto ensure chaos, death, devastation, and destruction is to stick with \nthe President's failed policy. Let's go with our plan, which is not \nchaos but stability and the saving of people's lives.\n  As we leave for the celebration of our Nation's birthday, the Fourth \nof July, I ask my colleagues to listen to the call of the American \npeople. Choose the path that honors our troops, makes our country safer \nat home, and stronger abroad.\n  When we return next week, let's get to work on a responsible new \ndirection that Americans demand and deserve and, in fact, is long \noverdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8738-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8738-S8739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, next Wednesday is July 4, Independence \nDay, the grand national celebration of our Nation's beginning. The \nSenate and the House of Representatives will be quiet, in recess so \nthat Members can join in Independence Day celebrations around the \ncountry with constituents, families, and friends.\n  On July 4, summer is approaching its zenith. The days are hot and \nsunny. Water in all forms lures children into the heat--in the country, \nshady streams offer relief; in urban areas, fountains or even fire \nhydrants answer the call, while across the country, swimming pools \noffer watery fun with an accompanying musical soundtrack of splashing \nand laughter. Even summer thunderstorms do their bit to cool things \ndown while displaying nature's power and majesty as the lightning \ncracks and the thunder booms.\n  Fourth of July celebrations are a wonderful time to glory in all that \nis good about the United States. Flags and fireworks, picnics and \nparades, mellow afternoons and martial music--everything about \nIndependence Day is grand. As we join together to remember the bravery \nthat led our Founding Fathers to draft the Declaration of Independence, \nthe long struggle to win our freedom, and the enlightened wisdom that \nresulted in our unique and wonderful Constitution, the love of our \nNation that is the true spirit of patriotism is renewed. Surrounded by \nthe happy faces of our diverse population enjoying their small town \nparades, music under the stars, family picnics and the grand finale of \nthe fireworks displays, we can be sure that our Founding Fathers chose \nwell when they gambled on a new nation in which ``all men are created \nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable \nRights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of \nHappiness.''\n  On Independence Day, when laughing children run with their sparklers \nto compete with the fireflies, we are also reminded of our own \nobligation to preserve for them all that is good about these United \nStates. In this, we may also look to the Declaration of Independence, \nwhich ends with ``a firm reliance on the protection of divine \nProvidence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes \nand our sacred Honor.''\n  For our Founding Fathers, this pledge was not mere rhetoric--their \nsignatures on the declaration that hot summer in 1776 put at risk their \nfamilies, their fortunes, their worldly possessions, and their lives. \nSome, like Edward Rutledge, age 26, were young men, with all of their \nlife's promise ahead of them. Others, like Benjamin Franklin, age 70, \nwere no longer so young, and the prospect of being hunted down for \ntreason could not have been very appealing. Still, he did not shirk \nfrom signing and has even been quoted as saying that ``We must all hang \ntogether, or assuredly we will all hang separately,'' his witty way of \nwarning the signers that any failure to remain united could result in \neach of them being tried and executed for treason. History has shown \nthat his warning was not needed.\n  Through the years of war, even as some of the signers lost their \nhomes or put their fortunes into the war effort, not one of them backed \ndown. For that, we may all be thankful.\n  Even as the years of war passed, the signers of the Declaration of \nIndependence continued to serve their new Nation. They served as \nambassadors for the new United States, as Presidents and Vice \nPresidents, as Cabinet members, and as a source of inspiration and \nindustry for the fledgling Nation into their old ages. It is fitting \nthat Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, third \nPresident of the United States, Vice President, Secretary of State, \nMinister to France, Governor of Virginia, colonial and State \nlegislator, founder of the University of Virginia, farmer and \nphilosopher, died at the age of 83 on the Fourth of July, 1826, on the \n50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. He \nworked and wrote prolifically until the very end of his life, always \nfor the betterment of the Nation.\n  On the same day, July 4, 1826, John Adams passed away at the age of \n91. President, Vice President, Member of the Continental Congress, \nfarmer, and philosopher, Adams remains the longest lived person ever \nelected to both of the highest offices in the United States. Until his \nrecord was broken by Ronald Reagan in 2001, Adams was the nation's \nlongest living President, at 90 years, 247 days. The record is \ncurrently held by former President Gerald Ford, who died December 26, \n2006, at 93 years, 165 days. Adams and Jefferson's correspondence \nduring their later years remains an invaluable historical record of the \nearly days of our Republic, and their respect for each other was \nunmatched. Even as he died, Adams is said to have breathed, ``Thomas \nJefferson survives,'' in what may have been his final earthly comfort \nknowing that his friend remained to watch over the young Nation.\n  Madam President, it is a great privilege to be able to call oneself a \ncitizen of these United States. It is my great privilege to serve the \nSenate and the people of West Virginia and the United States. I feel \nthat privilege every day but especially on the Fourth of July. I am \ninspired by our Founding Fathers and by the great documents that are \nthe Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Like Jefferson \nand Adams, I am inspired to continue serving the land that I love to \nthe very best of my abilities for the whole of my years.\n  Madam President, I close with a poem by Walter Taylor Field, entitled \n``Flag of the Free.''\n\n                            Flag of the Free\n\n     Look at the flag as it floats on high,\n     Streaming aloft in the clear, blue sky,\n     Rippling, leaping, tugging away,\n     Gay as the sunshine, bright as the day,\n     Throbbing with life, where the world may see--Flag of our \n           country, flag of the free!\n\n     What do we see in the flag on high,\n     That we bare our heads as it passes by,\n     That we thrill with pride, our hearts beat fast, And we cheer \n           and cheer as the flag goes past--The flag that waves \n           for you and me--Flag of our country, flag of the free?\n\n     We see in the flag a nation's might,\n     The pledge of a safeguard day and night, Of a watchful eye \n           and a powerful arm\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\n           That guard the nation's homes from harm.\n     Of a strong defense on land and sea--\n     Flag of our country, flag of the free!\n\n     We see in the flag a union grand,\n     A brotherhood of heart and hand,\n     A pledge of love and a stirring call\n     To live our lives for the good of us all--Helpful and just \n           and true to thee, Flag of our country, flag of the \n           free!\n\n     Flutter, dear flag, o'er the lands and seas!\n     Fling out your stars and your stripes to the breeze, Righting \n           all wrongs, dispelling all fear,\n     Guarding the land that we cherish so dear, And the God of our \n           fathers, abiding with thee, Will\n     bless you and trust you, O flag of the free!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8739-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IOWA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize a group of Iowans who distinguished themselves in their \nservice on behalf of the security of the United States. Troop C, 1-113 \nCavalry, of the Iowa Army National Guard, brought honor to itself and \nthe State of Iowa while serving in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nTroop C entered the Iraq theater of operations on October 30, 2005, and \ncompleted its mission on October 30, 2006.\n  Troop C, 1-113 Cavalry was based at Camp Ashraf in the Diyala \nProvince of Iraq. Diyala is one of the most contested provinces in \nIraq, and the mission of Troop C, 1-113 Cavalry was to provide \nperimeter defense at Camp Ashraf, reconnaissance and security patrols, \nimprovised explosive device clearance missions, and convoy escorts. \nTroop C missions were conducted in such contested cities as Baghdad, \nBaqubah, and Khalis, as well as anywhere else required. Dangerous does \nnot quite capture the situations that Troop C faced on a daily basis.\n  During this tour of duty, Troop C, 1-113 Cavalry conducted more than \n3,000 missions, drove in excess of 150,000 miles on treacherous Iraqi \nroads, sustained over 50 improvised explosive devices strikes, \ndiscovered more than 25 emplaced improvised explosive devices and \nprovided security while these devices were destroyed; and on a routine \nbasis conducted security missions to Ashraf's West Water Pump Station. \nTroop C put themselves in harm's way to ensure continual water supply \nto Ashraf and the surrounding villages. For its actions while \nperforming these missions, Troop C has earned to date eleven Purple \nHearts and nearly one-hundred combat action badges.\n  Battlefield success came at a price. SGT Dan L. Sesker made the \nultimate sacrifice, giving his life while conducting a convoy operation \nin Baghdad.\n  On May 29, 2006, members of Troop C arrived on scene immediately \nafter 4th Infantry Division Soldiers and a Columbia Broadcasting System \nnews crew were attacked while conducting Memorial Day interviews. The \nsoldiers of Troop C heroically took up the security mission and \nprovided first aid to the wounded Soldiers and news crew. The treatment \nprovided to the correspondent, Kimberly Dozier, saved her life.\n  Troop C, 1-113 Cavalry deserves the highest praise of this body and \nthe entire Nation. The courage, selfless sacrifice, and dedication to \ntheir mission displayed by Troop C exemplifies what is best in our \nbrave soldiers and I am very proud to call them fellow Iowans. It is to \nthe valor of those in Troop C and others like them past and present \nthat we Americans owe our freedom and security today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8739-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8739-S8740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SUPREME COURT DECISIONS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, over half a century ago, in Brown v. \nBoard of Education, a unanimous Supreme Court stuck down laws requiring \nracial segregation in our public schools. Yesterday's decision limiting \nvoluntary efforts to desegregate public schools is false to Brown's \npromise of equality by making it far more difficult for local school \nboards to bring students of different races together in the classroom.\n  The landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education called on us to \nhonor not only the requirements of the Constitution but also of our \nconsciences. America was made stronger as a result. Although the Brown \ndecision initially met with intense resistance in many parts of the \ncountry, it eventually came to be recognized as one of the Court's \nfinest hours.\n  Yesterday's decision, however, makes it far more difficult to achieve \nequal educational opportunity for children of all races. Brown was a \ngiant step in ending racially segregated public schools, but achieving \nintegration takes more than a court decision. It takes good will, \nvision, creativity, common sense, and a firm commitment to the goal of \neducating all children, regardless of race. Above all, it takes a \nrealistic assessment of local communities to determine what will work \nto bring students together.\n  That challenge is difficult to meet, because in many parts of the \nNation, neighborhoods continue to be highly segregated by race and \nnational origin. Without specific efforts by local school boards to \npromote diversity, public schools often reflect the same racial \nsegregation as the neighborhoods around them. As over 500 prominent \nsocial scientists who have studied residential segregation explained in \ntheir brief in the Seattle and Jefferson County, KY, cases, without \nvoluntary efforts, neighborhood schools cannot achieve the integration \nthat we as a society recognize is so important.\n  The benefits of integration, both for individual students and for \nsociety, are enormous. Children who participate in classes attended by \nstudents of many races enjoy greater parental involvement in public \nschools, and greater cross-cultural understanding. It helps close the \nracial gap in education by helping African-American children achieve \ngreater academic success. One of the Nation's leading conservative \njudges, Alexander Kozinski, described Seattle's integration plan as an \n``eminently sensible'' ``stirring of the melting pot,'' which helps \nchildren learn to interact as citizens of our common society. Without \nintegrated schools, children will not learn these important lessons. \nThat's a result we cannot afford.\n  Local school boards such as Jefferson County's have transcended the \nlegacy of Jim Crow segregation to achieve not only enhanced \nopportunities for students but greater cooperation, participation, and \ngenuine friendship between children of different races. We should honor \nthat achievement. We should also ensure that school districts such as \nJefferson County's, that do not want to return to the days of all-White \nand all-Black schools, receive the support and information needed to \ncontinue that success.\n  The Court's ruling undermines the important goal of racial \nintegration by ignoring the real world consequences of its decision. \nIronically, Chief Justice Roberts, who helped form the majority on this \ndecision, stated at his confirmation hearing that this was something he \nwould not do.\n  My first question to John Roberts at his confirmation hearing was \nabout Brown v. Board of Education. I asked whether he agreed that the \nCourt in Brown properly based its opinion on ``real world \nconsideration[s] . . . at the time of its decision.'' ``Certainly, \nSenator,'' he responded, ``you have to look at the discrimination in \nthe context in which it is occurring.''\n  Yet his plurality opinion in yesterday's decision ignores the context \nof Brown that Chief Justice Roberts said at his hearing was so \nimportant. In fact, Chief Justice Roberts would have gone even further \nthan a majority of the Court and argued to outlaw virtually any use of \nrace in voluntary efforts to integrate public schools.\n  The central tragedy in Brown was society's abandonment of African-\nAmerican children to second-class schools. Every child relegated to \nsuch schools is harmed. Chief Justice Roberts' opinion disregards that \nreality by defining the only harm in Brown as the consideration of race \nin assigning children to school. The harm to these children is not less \njust because their segregation is the result of housing patterns rather \nthan discriminatory laws. The cruel irony of the Chief Justice's view \nis that it would undermine Brown by ensuring that thousands of minority \nchildren would continue to attend segregated schools. Fortunately, a \nmajority of the Supreme Court understood that we cannot afford to \nignore the harm to students in segregated schools.\n  Despite professing moderation and promising to uphold precedent, the \nCourt's newest members have already voted to radically limit the Clean \nWater Act. They have argued that the\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency has no power to control air pollution, \nand overturned a 7-year-old precedent on a woman's right to choose. \nMore recently, they cut back on workers' ability to hold companies \nresponsible for pay discrimination, ignoring the intent of Congress by \nimposing unreasonably narrow deadlines for pay discrimination claims. \nBut their decision striking down voluntary integration is the most \nsweeping proof that they failed to be candid about their extreme views \nwhen they testified before the Senate in their confirmation hearings.\n  Fortunately, the views of the newest Justices, which would have made \nvoluntary integration almost impossible, were not shared by a majority \nof the Court. The majority recognized that local school boards have a \ncompelling interest in preventing de facto racial segregation in public \nschools, so long as they do so in a way that is narrowly tailored to \nmeet that interest. Although the majority wrongly concluded that the \ncarefully crafted programs in Seattle and Jefferson County, KY, were \nnot permissible, it made clear that local school districts still have \nthe ability to create racially inclusive public schools.\n  Congress is not powerless to address this important issue. We should \nsupport school districts that desire to achieve diversity in their \npublic schools within the limits of the Court's ruling. I plan to hold \nhearings in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on \nthe effects of the decisions. It is my hope that those hearings will \nshed new light on the best way to support schools that want to continue \nour national progress toward integration in public education.\n  The words of Brown ring as true today as they did half a century ago. \nOn May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court declared that ``education is perhaps \nthe most important function of state and local governments. . . . It is \nthe very foundation of good citizenship. . . . In these days, it is \ndoubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life \nif he is denied the opportunity of an education,'' and that opportunity \n``is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.''\n  These words could have been written today. It is up to us to \nrevitalize them for the years ahead. The promise of Brown will never be \nfulfilled until America opens opportunity to all, not just to some.\n  Brown showed that even against great odds, we can change America for \nthe better. We must renew our commitment to genuine educational \nequality for all children in America. Despite yesterday's decision, we \nmust not falter, now or ever. Separate can never be equal. We must \ncontinue the racial progress of the last 50 years. Only then will \nAmerica truly become one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty \nand justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8740-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CURRENCY REFORM AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ACCESS ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached \nletter from the American Council of Life Insurers be printed in the \nRecord, along with the materials I submitted for S. 1677, the Currency \nReform and Financial Markets Access Act of 2007.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            American Council on Life Insurers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2007.\n     Senator Christopher Dodd,\n     Senate Banking Committee, Dirksen Senate Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd: I am writing on behalf of ACLI member \n     companies to applaud the focus you have given to market \n     access in Title II of the Currency Reform Act and Market \n     Access Act of 2007. I commend your bipartisan efforts to \n     introduce legislation that recognizes the importance of true \n     and improved market access for all U.S. financial services \n     firms to China's markets.\n       A more effective, modern and efficient financial sector in \n     China is a prerequisite to successfully addressing a shift in \n     China's export-driven economic stance globally, as well as to \n     ameliorating issues that have complicated the U.S.-China \n     economic relationship, China's WTO implementation and the \n     trade imbalance.\n       For ACLI member companies, access to China's market cannot \n     be overstated. China is the world's 11th largest insurance \n     market by total premium volume (8th by life insurance), up \n     from 16th in 2000, with premium volumes of almost $68 billion \n     in 2006--life premiums accounted for the lion's share at $48 \n     billion, a near threefold increase since 2001. Although \n     ranked in the top ten globally, China's life market is under-\n     penetrated. As China's burgeoning middle class grows, incomes \n     grow, and consumptions patterns change, average yearly per \n     capita expenditures on life insurance will surge--predictions \n     are that China will rank among the world's largest life \n     insurance markets by 2020.\n       While China has come a long way in opening up its life \n     insurance market, in another arena, up until last year, there \n     was no formal supplementary retirement savings program in \n     China despite the fact that it began dismantling its ``cradle \n     to grave'' social safety net beginning in the 1980s. Pensions \n     are largely unfunded, under-funded or non-existent for scores \n     of citizens. China is only now beginning to appreciate the \n     critical role that enterprise annuities needs to play in \n     providing retirement security to Chinese households.\n       To address the pension gap, Chinese regulators started in \n     the spring of 2005 to establish an Enterprise Annuity Pension \n     System (EA)--as a second pillar individual account, defined \n     contribution retirement program (similar to our 401(k)). \n     Conservatively, our estimates indicate that within 10 years \n     the assets under management for this program should be close \n     to $100 billion. Within 25 years they should reach $1 \n     trillion. While a number of foreign firms have been licensed \n     to provide custodial, trustee, management, and related \n     services for pension assets, no American firm has been \n     licensed to underwrite pension products directly.\n       Participating in the type of growth noted above is \n     paramount for firms in worldwide life insurance and \n     retirement benefits leadership positions. It is equally \n     important for China's economic leadership, regulators and \n     industry to view our greater involvement and participation as \n     win-win for the economy, consumers, and capital markets \n     generally.\n       For these reasons, I look forward to working with you on \n     efforts such as this to shine light on market access issues \n     that can be addressed in China to improve opportunities for \n     ACLI companies to participate in the Chinese market.\n           Sincerely,\n     Frank Keating.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8740-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:59 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2829.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1746. A bill to provide for the recognition of certain Native \ncommunities and the settlement of certain claims under the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at the very beginning of the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act of 1971 there are a series of findings and \ndeclarations of congressional policy which explain the underpinnings of \nthis landmark legislation.\n  The first clause reads, ``There is an immediate need for a fair and \njust settlement of all claims by Natives and Native groups of Alaska, \nbased on aboriginal land claims.'' The second clause states, ``The \nsettlement should be accomplished rapidly, with certainty, in \nconformity with the real economic and social needs of Natives.''\n  Mr. President, 34, going on 35, years have passed since the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act became law and still the Native peoples of \nfive communities in Southeast Alaska--Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, \nTenakee and Wrangell--the five ``landless communities'' are still \nwaiting for their fair and just settlement.\n  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act awarded approximately $1 \nbillion and 44 million acres of land to Alaska Natives and provided for \nthe establishment of Native Corporations to receive and manage such \nfunds and lands. The beneficiaries of the settlement were issued stock \nin one of 13 regional Alaska Native corporations. Most beneficiaries \nalso had the option to enroll and receive stock in a village, group or \nurban corporation.\n  For reasons that still defy explanation the Native peoples of the \n``landless communities,'' were not permitted by the Alaska Native \nClaims Settlement Act to form village or urban corporations. These \ncommunities were excluded from this benefit even though they did not \ndiffer significantly from other communities in Southeast Alaska that \nwere permitted to form village or urban corporations under the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act. This finding was confirmed in a February \n1994 report submitted by the Secretary of the Interior at the direction \nof the Congress. That study was conducted by the Institute of Social \nand Economic Research at the University of Alaska.\n  The Native people of Southeast Alaska have recognized the injustice \nof this oversight for more than 34 years. An independent study issued \nmore than 12 years ago confirms that the grievance of the landless \ncommunities is legitimate. Legislation has been introduced in the past \nsessions of Congress to remedy this injustice. Hearings have been held \nand reports written. Yet legislation to right the wrong has inevitably \nstalled out. This December marks the 35th anniversary of Congress' \npromise to the Native peoples of Alaska, the promise of a rapid and \ncertain settlement. And still the landless communities of southeast \nAlaska are landless.\n  I am convinced that this cause is just, it is right, and it is about \ntime that the Native peoples of the five landless communities receive \nwhat has been denied them for going on 35 years.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would enable the Native \npeoples of the five ``landless communities'' to organize five ``urban \ncorporations,'' one for each unrecognized community. These newly formed \ncorporations would be offered and could accept the surface estate to \napproximately 23,000 acres of land. Sealaska Corporation, the regional \nAlaska Native Corporation for southeast Alaska would receive title to \nthe subsurface estate to the designated lands. The urban corporations \nwould each receive a lump sum payment to be used as start-up funds for \nthe newly established corporation. The Secretary of the Interior would \ndetermine other appropriate compensation to redress the inequities \nfaced by the unrecognized communities.\n  It is long past time that we return to the Native peoples of \nsoutheast Alaska a small slice of the aboriginal lands that were once \ntheirs alone. It is time that we open our minds and open our hearts to \ncorrecting this injustice which has gone on far too long and finally \ngive the Native peoples of southeast Alaska the rapid and certain \nsettlement for which they have been waiting.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1746\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Unrecognized Southeast \n     Alaska Native Communities Recognition and Compensation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\n       (1) In 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Act'') to recognize and settle the \n     aboriginal claims of Alaska Natives to the lands Alaska \n     Natives had used for traditional purposes.\n       (2) The Act awarded approximately $1,000,000,000 and \n     44,000,000 acres of land to Alaska Natives and provided for \n     the establishment of Native Corporations to receive and \n     manage such funds and lands.\n       (3) Pursuant to the Act, Alaska Natives have been enrolled \n     in one of 13 Regional Corporations.\n       (4) Most Alaska Natives reside in communities that are \n     eligible under the Act to form a Village or Urban Corporation \n     within the geographical area of a Regional Corporation.\n       (5) Village or Urban Corporations established under the Act \n     received cash and surface rights to the settlement land \n     described in paragraph (2) and the corresponding Regional \n     Corporation received cash and land which includes the \n     subsurface rights to the land of the Village or Urban \n     Corporation.\n       (6) The southeastern Alaska communities of Haines, \n     Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell are not listed \n     under the Act as communities eligible to form Village or \n     Urban Corporations, even though the population of such \n     villages comprises greater than 20 percent of the \n     shareholders of the Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska \n     and display historic, cultural, and traditional qualities of \n     Alaska Natives.\n       (7) The communities described in paragraph (6) have sought \n     full eligibility for lands and benefits under the Act for \n     more than three decades.\n       (8) In 1993, Congress directed the Secretary of the \n     Interior to prepare a report examining the reasons why the \n     communities listed in paragraph (6) had been denied \n     eligibility to form Village or Urban Corporations and receive \n     land and benefits pursuant to the Act.\n       (9) The report described in paragraph (8), published in \n     February, 1994, indicates that--\n       (A) the communities listed in paragraph (6) do not differ \n     significantly from the southeast Alaska communities that were \n     permitted to form Village or Urban Corporations under the \n     Act;\n       (B) such communities are similar to other communities that \n     are eligible to form Village or Urban Corporations under the \n     Act and receive lands and benefits under the Act--\n       (i) in actual number and percentage of Native Alaskan \n     population; and\n       (ii) with respect to the historic use and occupation of \n     land;\n       (C) each such community was involved in advocating the \n     settlement of the aboriginal claims of the community; and\n       (D) some of the communities appeared on early versions of \n     lists of Native Villages prepared before the date of the \n     enactment of the Act, but were not included as Native \n     Villages in the Act.\n       (10) The omissions described in paragraph (9) are not \n     clearly explained in any provision of the Act or the \n     legislative history of the Act.\n       (11) On the basis of the findings described in paragraphs \n     (1) through (10), Alaska Natives who were enrolled in the \n     five unlisted communities and their heirs have been \n     inadvertently and wrongly denied the cultural and financial \n     benefits of enrollment in Village or Urban Corporations \n     established pursuant to the Act.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to redress the \n     omission of the communities described in subsection (a)(6) \n     from eligibility by authorizing the Native people enrolled in \n     the communities--\n       (1) to form Urban Corporations for the communities of \n     Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell under \n     the Act; and\n       (2) to receive certain settlement lands and other \n     compensation pursuant to the Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ADDITIONAL NATIVE CORPORATIONS.\n\n       Section 16 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1615) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(e)(1) The Native residents of each of the Native \n     Villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and \n     Wrangell, Alaska, may organize as Urban Corporations.\n       ``(2) Nothing in this subsection shall affect any \n     entitlement to land of any Native Corporation previously \n     established pursuant to this Act or any other provision of \n     law.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. SHAREHOLDER ELIGIBILITY.\n\n       Section 8 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1607) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(d)(1) The Secretary of the Interior shall enroll to each \n     of the Urban Corporations for Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, \n     Tenakee, or Wrangell those individual Natives who enrolled \n     under this Act to the Native Villages of Haines, Ketchikan, \n     Petersburg, Tenakee, or Wrangell, respectively.\n       ``(2) Those Natives who are enrolled to an Urban \n     Corporation for Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, or \n     Wrangell pursuant to paragraph (1) and who were enrolled as \n     shareholders of the Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska \n     on or before March 30, 1973, shall receive 100 shares of \n     Settlement Common Stock in such Urban Corporation.\n       ``(3) A Native who has received shares of stock in the \n     Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska through inheritance \n     from a decedent Native who originally enrolled to the Native \n     Villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, or \n     Wrangell, which decedent Native was not a shareholder in a \n     Village or Urban Corporation, shall receive the identical \n     number of shares of Settlement Common Stock in the Urban \n     Corporation for Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, or \n     Wrangell as the number of shares inherited by that Native \n     from the decedent Native who would have been eligible to be \n     enrolled to such Urban Corporation.\n       ``(4) Nothing in this subsection shall affect entitlement \n     to land of any Regional Corporation pursuant to section 12(b) \n     or section 14(h)(8).''.\n\n     SEC. 5. DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS.\n\n       Section 7 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1606) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (j), by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new sentence: ``Native members of the Native \n     Villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and \n     Wrangell who become shareholders in an Urban Corporation for \n     such a community shall continue to be eligible to receive \n     distributions under this subsection as at-large shareholders \n     of the Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end thereof the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(s) No provision of or amendment made by the Unrecognized \n     Southeast Alaska Native Communities Recognition and \n     Compensation Act shall affect the ratio for determination of \n     revenue distribution among Native Corporations under this \n     section and the `1982 Section 7(i) Settlement Agreement' \n     among the Regional Corporations or among Village Corporations \n     under subsection (j).''.\n\n     SEC. 6. COMPENSATION.\n\n       The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following \n     new section:\n\n\n ``URBAN CORPORATIONS FOR HAINES, KETCHIKAN, PETERSBURG, TENAKEE, AND \n                                WRANGELL\n\n       ``Sec. 43.

A bill to regulate the judicial use of presidential signing \nstatements in the interpretation of Act of Congress; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr President, I seek recognition today to offer the \nPresidential Signing Statements Act of 2007. The purpose of this bill \nis to regulate the use of Presidential Signing Statements in the \ninterpretation of acts of Congress. This bill is similar in substance \nto the Presidential Signing Statements Act of 2006, which I introduced \non July 26, 2006. The Senate Judiciary Committee also held a hearing on \nthis topic on June 27, 2006.\n  I believe that this is necessary to protect our constitutional system \nof checks and balances. This bill achieves that goal in the following \nways.\n  First, it prevents the President from issuing a signing statement \nthat alters the meaning of a statute by instructing Federal and State \ncourts not to rely on Presidential signing statements in interpreting a \nstatute.\n  Second, it grants Congress the power to participate in any case where \nthe construction or constitutionality of any act of Congress is in \nquestion and a presidential signing statement for that act was issued \nby (i) allowing Congress to file an amicus brief and present oral \nargument in such a case; (ii) instructing that if Congress passes a \njoint resolution declaring its view of the correct interpretation of \nthe statute, the court must admit that resolution into the case record; \nand (iii) providing for expedited review in such a case.\n  Presidential signing statements are nothing new. Since the days of \nPresident James Monroe, Presidents have issued statements when signing \nbills. It is widely agreed that there are legitimate uses for signing \nstatements. For example, Presidents may use signing statements to \ninstruct executive branch officials how to administer a law. They may \nalso use them to explain to the public the likely effect of a law. And, \nthere may be a host of other legitimate uses.\n  However, the use of signing statements has risen dramatically in \nrecent years. When I introduced the Presidential Signing Statement bill \nlast year, I noted that as of June 26, 2006, President Bush had issued \n132 signing statements. Since then, he has issued an additional 17 \nstatements, for a total of 149 to date. In comparison, President \nClinton issued 105 signing statements during his two terms. Moreover, \nPresident Bush's signing statements often raise objections to several \nprovisions of a law. For example, a recent report by the Government \nAccountability Office released June 18, 2007, found that, for 11 \nappropriations acts for fiscal year 2006, President Bush issued signing \nstatements identifying constitutional concerns or objections to \n160 different provisions appearing in the acts. While the mere numbers \nmay not be significant, the reality is that the way the President has \nused those statements threatens to render the legislative process a \nvirtual nullity, making it completely unpredictable how certain laws \nwill be enforced.\n\n  The President cannot use a signing statement to rewrite the words of \na statute nor can he use a signing statement to selectively nullify \nthose provisions he does not like. This much is clear from our \nConstitution. The Constitution grants the President a specific, \nnarrowly defined role in enacting legislation. Article I, section 1 of \nthe Constitution vests ``all legislative powers . . . in a Congress.'' \nArticle I, section 7 of the Constitution provides that when a bill is \npresented to the President, he may either sign it or veto it with his \nobjections. He may also choose to do nothing, thus rendering a so-\ncalled pocket veto. The President, however, cannot veto part of bill, \nhe cannot veto certain provisions he does not like.\n  The Founders had good reason for constructing the legislative process \nas they did: by creating a bicameral legislature and then granting the \nPresident the veto power. According to The Records of the \nConstitutional Convention, the veto power was designed by our Framers \nto protect citizens from a particular Congress that might enact \noppressive legislation. However, the Framers did not want the veto \npower to be unchecked, and so, in article I, section 7, they balanced \nit by allowing Congress to override a veto by two-thirds vote.\n  As I stated when I introduced the Presidential Signing Statement bill \nlast year, this is a finely structured constitutional procedure that \ngoes straight to the heart of our system of check and balances. Any \naction by the President that circumvents this finely structured \nprocedure is an unconstitutional attempt to usurp legislative \nauthority. If the President is permitted to rewrite the bills that \nCongress passes and cherry pick which provisions he likes and does not \nlike, he subverts the constitutional process designed by our Framers.\n  The Supreme Court has affirmed that the constitutional process for \nenacting legislation must be safeguarded. As the Supreme Court \nexplained in INS v. Chahda, ``It emerges clearly that the prescription \nfor legislative action in article I, section 1 and 7 represents the \nFramers' decision that the legislative power of the Federal Government \nbe exercised in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively \nconsidered, procedure.''\n  So, while signing statements have been commonplace since our \ncountry's founding, we must make sure that they are not being used in \nan unconstitutional manner; a manner that seeks to rewrite legislation, \nand exercise line item vetoes.\n  As I have previously explained, President Bush has used signing \nstatements in ways that have raised some eyebrows. An example is the \nsigning statement accompanying Senator McCain's ``anti-torture \namendment'' to the Department of Defense Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, otherwise known as the ``McCain Amendment.'' In \nthat legislation, Congress voted by an overwhelming majority, 90 to 9, \nto ban all U.S. personnel from inflicting ``cruel, inhuman or \ndegrading'' treatment on any prisoner held anywhere by the United \nStates. President Bush, who had threatened to veto the legislation, \ninstead invited Senator McCain to the White House for a public \nreconciliation and declared they had a mutual goal: to make it clear to \nthe world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to \nthe international convention of torture.''\n  Now from that, you might conclude that by signing the McCain \namendment into law, President Bush and his administration has fully \ncommitted to not using torture. But you would be wrong. After the \npublic ceremony of signing the bill into law, the President issued a \nsigning statement saying his administration would construe the new law \n``in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the \nPresident to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in \nChief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the \njudicial power.'' This vague language may mean that, despite the \nenactment of the McCain Amendment, the administration may still be \npreserving a right to inflict torture on prisoners and to evade the \nInternational Convention Against Torture.\n\n  Now, the National Defense Authorization Bill, like the McCain \namendment, has a crucial provision regarding torture: it provides that \nthe Combatant Status Review Tribunals, CSRTs, in Guantanamo Bay ``may \nnot consider a [detainee's] statement that was obtained through methods \nthat amount to torture.'' See section 1023(4)(e). But\n\n[[Page S8745]]\n\nwho knows how this provision will be enforced if deemed inconsistent \nwith the unitary executive theory?\n  And, the McCain amendment is just the tip of the iceberg: On close \nexamination of the same signing statement, we see that President Bush \nhas declared the right to construe the entire Detainee Treatment Act \nand all provisions relating to detainees, in a manner consistent with \nthe unitary executive theory and with his powers as Commander and \nChief. This is extremely troublesome. Like the DTA, this bill has \ncrucial sections relating to detainees. Specifically, this bill \ncontains much-needed provisions that protect detainees' due process \nrights in CSRT procedures, including allowing detainees a right to \nlegal counsel, a right to compel and cross examine witnesses, and a \nright to have their status determined by a military judge. Should a \nsimilar signing statement be issued to S. 1547, that all sections \nrelated to detainees will be construed in a certain way, there is \nreally no way to know how these crucial provisions will be enforced.\n  We must ensure that such provisions, and for that matter, any and all \nprovisions in this bill, are not subject to revision by a Presidential \nsigning statement.\n  In addition to these examples, I have noted another instance in which \na questionable signing statement was issued, for the PATRIOT Act. We \npassed the PATRIOT Act after months of deliberation. We debated nearly \nevery provision, often redrafting and revising. Moreover, we worked \nvery closely with the President because we wanted to get it right. We \nwanted to make sure that we were passing legislation that the executive \nbranch would find workable. In fact, in many ways, the process was an \nexcellent example of the legislative branch and the executive branch \nworking together towards a common goal.\n  In the end, the bill that was passed by the Senate and the House \ncontained several oversight provisions intended to make sure the FBI \ndid not abuse the special terrorism-related powers to search homes and \nsecretly seize papers. It also required Justice Department officials to \nkeep closer track of how often the FBI uses the new powers and in what \ntype of situations.\n  The President signed the PATRIOT Act into law, but afterwards, he \nwrote a signing statement that said he could withhold any information \nfrom Congress provided in the oversight provisions if he decided that \ndisclosure would ``impair foreign relations, national security, the \ndeliberative process of the executive, or the performance of the \nexecutive's constitutional duties.''\n  As I noted last year, during the entire process of working with the \nPresident to draft the PATRIOT Act, he never asked the Congress to \ninclude this language in the act. At a hearing we held last June on \nsigning statements, I asked an executive branch official, Michelle \nBoardman from the Office of Legal Counsel, why the President did not \nask the Congress to put the signing statement language into the bill. \nShe simply didn't have an answer.\n  Given this backdrop, I believe this bill is necessary. As I noted \nwhen I introduced the Presidential Signing Statement bill last summer, \nthis bill does not seek to limit the President's power, and it does not \nseek to expand Congress's power. Rather, this bill simply seeks to \nsafeguard our Constitution.\n  This bill will provide courts with much-needed guidance on how \nlegislation should be interpreted. The recent GAO report on \nPresidential Signing Statements found that Federal courts cited or \nreferred to presidential signing statements in 137 different opinions \nreported from 1945 to May 2007. It also shows that the Supreme Court's \nreliance on presidential signing statements has been sporadic and \nunpredictable. In some cases, such as United States v. Lopez, 115 S.Ct. \n1624 at 1631, 1995, where the Court struck down the Gun-Free School \nZones Act, the Supreme Court has relied on Presidential signing \nstatements as a source of authority to interpret an act, while in other \ncases, such as the military tribunals case, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 \nS.Ct. 2749 (2006), Scalia dissenting, it has conspicuously declined to \ndo so. This inconsistency has the unfortunate result of rendering the \neffect of Presidential signing statements on Federal law unpredictable.\n  As I stated when I initially introduced the Presidential Signing \nStatements Act of 2006, it is well within Congress's power to resolve \njudicial disputes such as this by enacting rules of statutory \ninterpretation. In fact, the Department of Defense Authorization bill \nalready contains at least one ``rule of construction'' provision. See \nsection 845(e). This power flows from article 1, section 8, clause 18 \nof the Constitution, which gives Congress the power ``To make all laws \nwhich shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the \nforegoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in \nthe government of the United States, or in any department or officer \nthereof.'' Rules of statutory interpretation are ``necessary and \nproper'' to execute the legislative power.\n  Several scholars have agreed: Jefferson B. Fordham, a former dean of \nthe University of Pennsylvania Law School said, ``[I]t is within the \nlegislative power to lay down rules of interpretation for the future;'' \nMark Tushnet, a professor at Harvard Law School explained, ``In light \nof the obvious congressional power to prescribe a statute's terms, and \nso its meaning, congressional power to prescribe interpretive methods \nseems to me to follow;'' Michael Stokes Paulsen, an associate dean of \nthe University of Minnesota Law School noted, ``Congress is the master \nof its own statutes and can prescribe rules of interpretation governing \nits own statutes as surely as it may alter or amend the statutes \ndirectly.'' Finally, J. Sutherland, the author of the leading \nmultivolume treatise for the rules of statutory construction has said, \n``There should be no question that an interpretive clause operating \nprospectively is within legislative power.''\n  Furthermore, any legislation that sets out rules for interpreting an \nact makes legislation more clear and precise, which is exactly what we \naim to achieve here in Congress. Congress can and should exercise this \npower over the interpretation of Federal statutes in a systematic and \ncomprehensive manner.\n  Put simply, this bill seeks to implement measures that will safeguard \nthe constitutional structure of enacting legislation. In preserving \nthis structure, this bill reinforces the system of checks and balances \nand separation of powers set out in our Constitution, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COLEMAN (for himself, Mr. DeMint, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Sessions, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Chambliss, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Bond, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Thune, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n        Roberts, and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1748.

A bill to amend the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to \nprovide\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\nadequate protection to the rights of crime victims, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Crime Victims' Rights \nRules Act, which would continue the work started in The Scott Campbell, \nStephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime \nVictims' Rights Act.\n  The bill would make comprehensive procedural changes to the Federal \nRules of Criminal Procedure to protect crime victims' rights throughout \nthe federal criminal process, thereby guaranteeing that crime victims' \nrights will be fully respected in our federal courts.\n  As one of the Senate sponsors of the CVRA, I know that Congress \nintended the Act to bring dramatic changes to the way that the federal \ncourts treat crime victims. Fortunately, in the two-and-a-half years \nsince that legislation became law, positive strides have been made for \ncrime victims. For example, with funding provided by act, the National \nCrime Victims Law Institute has been able to support crime victims' \nlegal clinics around the country. I am also encouraged that court \ndecisions have recognized the importance of crime victims' rights in \nthe process.\n  But while progress has been made in implementing the CVRA, at least \none important step remains to be taken: The Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure must be comprehensively amended to recognize the rights of \ncrime victims throughout the process.\n  The Federal rules have been described as ``the playbook'' for Federal \njudges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys. Currently, the Federal \nrules make virtually no mention of crime victims. If crime victims are \nto fully integrated into the daily workings of our criminal justice \nprocess, then their role in that process must be fully protected in the \nfederal rules.\n  I am encouraged to see that the Federal courts have been taking some \nmodest steps toward protecting crime victims in the Federal rules. \nFederal district court judge Paul Cassell initiated the process by \nrecommending rule changes to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules. \nHis comprehensive set of useful proposals appeared in an excellent law \nreview article published in The Brigham Young University Law Review in \n2005. In recent months, the Advisory Committee has adopted a few of his \nproposals to implement some aspects of the CVRA. These changes are \nexpected to take effect next year.\n  These amendments are positive, but far more remains to be done. The \nAdvisory Committee's six proposed amendments, five changes to existing \nrules and one new rule, do little more than reiterate limited parts of \nthe statute. Crime victims have been treated unfairly in the Federal \ncriminal justice system for far too long to be left to rely on a \nhandful of minimal protections. To respect crime victims' rights fully \nin the process, it is necessary to take more decisive and comprehensive \naction to thoroughly amend the rules.\n  When Congress passed the CVRA in 2004, it promised that crime victims \nwould have rights throughout the criminal justice process. Of \nparticular importance, the CVRA guaranteed that crime victims would \nhave the right to be treated with ``fairness.'' My proposed amendments \nwould add to the Federal rules the changes needed to treat crime \nvictims fairly. These changes to the rules would provide vital \nprotections for crime victims without interfering with the rights of \ncriminal defendants or the need for Federal judges to manage their \ndockets effectively.\n  One example of the bill's changes is the amendment to Rule 50 to \nprotect the victims' right to a speedy trial. The bill would amend Rule \n50 to provide: ``The court shall assure that a victim's right to \nproceedings free from unreasonable delay is protected. A victim has the \nright to be heard regarding any motion to continue any proceeding. If \nthe court grants a motion to continue over the objection of a victim, \nthe court shall state its reasons in the record.''\n  It is hard for me to see how anyone could object to this procedural \nchange. The CVRA promised to crime victims the right ``to proceedings \nfree from unreasonable delay.'' The bill would place that right into \nthe Federal rules.\n  Another example of the kind of change that the bill would make is its \namendment of Rule 21 to protect crime victims' rights in transfer \ndecisions. In some situations, federal courts can transfer a criminal \ncase from one district to another. The bill would amend Rule 21 to \nprovide: ``The court shall not transfer any proceeding without giving \nany victim an opportunity to be heard. The court shall consider the \nviews of the victim in making any transfer decision.''\n  It is again hard to understand how anyone could object to the \nrequirement that a judge give a crime victim the chance to be heard \nbefore a case is transferred to a distant location. For example, the \nbill would have protected the right of the Oklahoma City bombing \nvictims to present to the trial judge their views on whether the trial \nshould have been transferred out of Oklahoma and, if so, to where.\n  The bill does not mandate any particular substantive result, leaving \nit to the trial judge to make the ultimate determination about whether \nto transfer a case. But the bill would change the process by which such \ndecisions are made, ensuring that victims are treated fairly by giving \nthem an opportunity to provide their views to the judge.\n  A further example of the changes in the bill is the amendment to Rule \n48 to protect the victim's right to be heard before a case is \ndismissed. The bill would provide: ``In deciding whether to grant the \ngovernment's motion to dismiss, the court shall consider the views of \nany victims.''\n  With this procedural change, the victim would have the opportunity to \npresent the court any reasons why a case should not be dismissed. This \nright is implicit in the CVRA's mandate that crime victims be treated \nwith fairness. It is hard to understand how a crime victim is treated \nwith fairness if the court dismisses a case without considering the \nvictim's position on the dismissal.\n  Indeed, the only case to have considered this issue reached exactly \nthis conclusion. As United States v. Heaton explains,\n\n       When the government files a motion to dismiss criminal \n     charges that involve a specific victim, the only way to \n     protect the victim's right to be treated fairly and with \n     respect for her dignity is to consider the victim's views on \n     the dismissal. It is hard to begin to understand how a victim \n     would be treated with fairness if the court acted \n     precipitously to approve dismissal of a case without even \n     troubling to consider the victim's views. To treat a person \n     with ``fairness'' is generally understood as treating them \n     ''justly'' and ``equitably.'' A victim is not treated justly \n     and equitably if her views are not even before the court. \n     Likewise, to grant the motion without knowing what the victim \n     thought would be a plain affront to the victim's dignity. \n     U.S. v. Heaton, 458 F. Supp. 2d 1271, 1272 (D. Utah 2006).\n\n  I agree with Heaton that the CVRA requires that crime victims have \nthe opportunity to submit their views to the court on any dismissal. \nThat is why this bill would place this right specifically into the \nfederal criminal rules.\n  One particularly important part of the bill is its change to Rule 17 \nto protect the confidential and personal records of crime victims. The \nAdvisory Committee itself proposed an amendment to Rule 17 to create \nspecific procedures for subpoenas directed at confidential and private \ninformation concerning crime victims.\n  This change was designed to prevent a recurrence of the problems that \nrecently occurred in the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case in Salt Lake \nCity. My colleagues may remember this case, which involved the \nabduction of a teenaged girl from her home. Fortunately, she was found \na year later and the suspected kidnapper apprehended. In the state \ncriminal proceedings that followed, defense attorneys subpoenaed \nconfidential school and medical records about Elizabeth. Because these \nsubpoenas went directly to Elizabeth's school and hospital, she was \nnever given the opportunity to object to them, and some confidential \ninformation was improperly turned over to defense counsel.\n  The Advisory Committee has recognized that this same ``end run'' \naround the victim could occur under the federal rules. It has therefore \nadopted a rule requiring notice to crime victims before their personal \nand confidential information is subpoenaed.\n  But this seeming protection has a catch: a defendant can avoid giving \nany notice to victim by arguing to a court, in an ex parte proceeding, \nthat exceptional circumstances exist.\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\n  This kind of ex parte procedure raises serious ethical concerns. In \nfact, the American Bar Association wrote to the Advisory Committee in \nFebruary urging it to make certain that crime victims receive notice \nand an opportunity to be heard before such subpoenas issue. As Robert \nJohnson, Chair of the ABA's Criminal Justice section explained, the \ncanons of judicial ethics forbid ex parte contacts with judges on \nsubstantive matters. Mr. Johnson went on to urge the Advisory Committee \nto give careful consideration of the ethical violations that might \noccur from ex parte subpoenas:\n\n       While the proposed amendment to Rule 17 is intended to \n     protect the interests of crime victims, the ABA urges the \n     Committee to carefully examine the proposal to determine if \n     the proposal regarding Rule 17 would be contrary to the \n     Court's responsibility under Canon 3(B)(7) in allowing ex \n     parte contact on a substantive matter. Even if the Committee \n     decides that it is not a substantive matter, the Committee \n     should consider whether the proposed rule would allow a \n     tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte communication \n     and the judge is required to promptly notify the other party \n     of the substance of the ex parte communication and allow an \n     opportunity to respond.\n\n  It seems that the Advisory Committee's proposed rule permitting ex \nparte subpoenas of personal and confidential information of crime \nvictims in some situations might run afoul of these ethical rules. \nAccordingly, under the bill, crime victims would enjoy an absolute \nright to notice before such information as psychiatric and medical \nrecords could be subpoenaed. This is the standard process that our \nadversary system of justice uses.\n  The CVRA promised crime victims that they would enjoy ``the right to \nbe treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and \nprivacy.'' My bill would respect victims' dignity and privacy by giving \nthem a court hearing before any of their confidential records could be \nturned over to an offender accused of victimizing them. This is not to \nsay that such information will never be disclosed to the defense. A \njudge will have to make the determination whether disclosure is \nappropriate. But the judge would make that determination only after \nhearing from the prosecutor, defense counsel and most important of all \nthe crime victim whose privacy rights are directly affected.\n\n  One of the most significant parts of the bill is its creation of a \nnew Rule 44.1, which would provide: ``When the interests of justice \nrequire, the court may appoint counsel for a victim to assist the \nvictim in exercising their rights as provided by law.''\n  This important change builds on existing Federal law. Title 28 \nalready permits the court in a criminal case to ``request an attorney \nto represent any person unable to afford counsel.'' For criminal cases \ninvolving child victims, Title 18 U.S.C. section 3509 allows the \nappointment of a guardian to represent the child's interests. Although \nthe statutes provide these rights, they have yet to be actually \nimplemented so that crime victims can actually take advantage of them.\n  I want to be clear that I am not proposing that all crime victims \nshould have counsel appointed for them. At the same time, though, I \nwould think all could agree that there are situations where a trial \ncourt ought, as a matter of discretion, to have the ability to appoint \nlegal counsel for a crime victim. For example, a crime victim might \npresent a novel or complex claim that the courts have not yet \nconsidered. Or a crime victim might suffer from physical or mental \ndisabilities as a result of the crime that would make it difficult for \nthe victim to be heard without the help of an advocate.\n  For many years, courts have had the ability to appoint counsel for \npotential defendants on a discretionary basis. My bill would allow that \nsame, well-recognized power to be used to appoint counsel for crime \nvictims.\n  One last section of the bill deserves special note because it \ndemonstrates the need for Congress to step into the rules process. The \nbill would amend Rule 32 to guarantee victims the right to speak at \nsentencing hearings.\n  This is a change from the more limited right that the Advisory \nCommittee has given victims the right ``to be reasonably heard.'' The \nAdvisory Committee's note to this provision seemingly suggests that \ncourts would not have to give all victims the right to speak at \nsentencing. This more limited right runs counter to the legislative \nhistory as to how the CVRA was to operate. While the CVRA gave crime \nvictims the right to be reasonably heard, it was the undisputed \nlegislative intent that victims would have the right to speak. I \nexplained on the Senate floor at the time the act was under \nconsideration that:\n\n       It is not the intent of the term ``reasonably'' in the \n     phrase ``to be reasonably heard'' to provide any excuse for \n     denying a victim the right to appear in person and directly \n     address the court. Indeed, the very purpose of this section \n     is to allow the victim to appear personally and directly \n     address the court.\n\n  My colleague Senator Feinstein remarked at that time that my \nunderstanding was her ``understanding as well.''\n  The Advisory Committee's action also contravenes at least two \npublished court decisions on this issue. In United States v. Kenna, \nJudge Kozinski wrote for the Ninth Circuit that the CVRA's legislative \nhistory reveals ``a clear congressional intent to give crime victims \nthe right to speak at proceedings covered by the CVRA.'' And in United \nStates v. Degenhardt, Judge Cassell reached the same conclusion writing \nfor the District of Utah.\n  My bill would provide the right of victims to speak at sentencing \nhearings. Of course, prosecutors, defense counsel, and defendants have \non enjoyed this right. Crime victims, too, deserve the opportunity to \nspeak to the court to ``allocute'' as this right is called and to make \nsure that the court and the defendant understand the crime's full harm.\n  I will not take the time here to go through all of the other \nprovisions of the bill. But I did want to highlight one important note \nabout the appropriateness of Congress acting to amend the rules to \nprotect crime victims. Congress enacted the CVRA in October 2004. In \nthe almost 3 years since then, I have waited patiently to give the \nfederal courts the first opportunity to review the need for rule \nchanges. At the same time, though, I have made clear my position, as \none of the cosponsors of the CVRA, that Congress expected significant \nreforms in the Federal rules. As I explained to my colleagues at that \ntime, the crime victims' community in this country was looking to the \nCVRA to serve as a model for the states and a formula for fully \nprotecting crime victims. It was because the CVRA was expected to have \nsuch a far-reaching impact that the crime victims' community was \nwilling to defer, at least temporarily, its efforts to pass a \nconstitutional amendment protecting victims' rights.\n  I made this point directly to the advisory committee in a letter I \nsent to Judge Levi on February 15 of this year. Thus, several months \nago, I placed the Advisory Committee on notice that, if it failed to \nact to fully protect crime victims, Congress might step into the \nbreach.\n  A few weeks ago, Judge Levi replied to my letter, and I greatly \nappreciate his comments and explanations. In his reply, he acknowledged \nthat many of the proposals were worthy of close attention. He \nindicated, however, that the Advisory Committee was going to delay \naction on them for some indefinite period of time. The reasons he gave \nfor the delay were to:\n\n       1. gather more information on precisely how the proposals \n     would operate in specific proceedings and what effects they \n     might have, 2. obtain empirical data substantiating the \n     existence and nature of any problem or problems that could be \n     addressed by rule, and 3. provide additional time for courts \n     to acquire experience under the CVRA and to develop case law \n     construing it.\n\n  Judge Levi also suggested that some of the proposed rule changes \nwould have created, in his view, new ``substantive rights'' for crime \nvictims that went beyond the CVRA.\n  Judge Levi's letter demonstrates why the Rules Enabling Act wisely \nleft the final decision on how to structure rules of evidence and \nprocedure to Congress. The letter refers to the need to ``gather more \ninformation'' and ``empirical data'' on crime victims'' issues before \nproceeding. While some might point out that the Advisory Committee has \nalready had more than 2\\1/2\\ years to collect such data, I can \nappreciate the difficulty that a court rules committee can have in \nassessing the scope of a national problem. Congress, however, is \nalready well-informed on the need for protecting crime victims' rights.\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\n Congress adopted the CVRA only after 8 years of legislative efforts \nand hearings on the Crime Victims Rights Amendment. This record leaves \nCongress well positioned to recognize the need for prompt and effective \naction to protect crime victims.\n  The letter also refers to the need for courts to develop case law \nconstruing the CVRA. The problem with this approach is that the \nanticipated case law may never develop. Most crime victims are not \ntrained in the nuances of the law and lack the means to retain legal \ncounsel. Victims are often indigent and are frequently emotionally and \nphysically harmed by the defendant's crime. They are then involuntarily \nforced into the middle of complicated and unfamiliar legal proceedings. \nTo expect that in these circumstances, crime victims will often be able \nto undertake the kind of sophisticated and pathbreaking litigation that \nwould be necessary to establish crime victims seems unreasonable. One \nof the main reasons for the CVRA was to change a legal culture that has \nbeen hostile to crime victims. To expect that this legal culture will \nsomehow, on a case-by-case basis, welcome crime victims is unlikely. \nIndeed, it is ironic that while waiting for case law to ``develop,'' \nthe Advisory Committee refused to add to the Federal rules a provision \nconfirming the existing discretionary right of trial judges to appoint \nlegal counsel for crime victims who need legal assistance on \ncomplicated issues.\n  The wait-for-caselaw approach is also troubling because it assumes \nthat Federal court litigation will serve sufficiently to clarify the \nrights of victims in the Federal system. But the Federal Rules of \nCriminal Procedure form the template for rules of criminal procedure in \nstates throughout the country. One of the main purposes of the CVRA was \nto create a model for protecting victims in the criminal justice \nsystem. Unless the text of the Federal rules themselves protects crime \nvictims, the states will not have a model they can look to in drafting \ntheir own rules to guarantee victims fair treatment.\n  The final reason given for deferring action on rules changes is that \nthe Advisory Committee thought that some of the changes might create \nnew substantive rights better left to Congress. It's a bit of an \nAlphonse-and-Gaston situation: Congress says ``after you'' to the \nAdvisory Committee, only to have the Advisory Committee say ``after \nyou.'' To avoid an impasse that leaves crime victims unprotected, \nobviously someone needs to take the lead. That is why I am today \nintroducing The Crime Victims' Rights Rules Act.\n  One last provision in the bill is also worth highlighting. The bill \nincludes a sense of the Congress provision that crime victims ought to \nbe represented on the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules.\n  This point was called to my attention by Professor Douglas Beloof, a \ndistinguished law professor at the Lewis and Clark College of Law and \nthe Director of the well-regarded National Crime Victims Law Institute. \nProfessor Beloof testified before the Advisory Committee in January.\n  He was surprised to discover at that time that, while the Justice \nDepartment, the defense bar, and judges are all represented on the \nCommittee, there is no representative for crime victims. Not only does \nthis leave crime victims organizations without a liaison for bringing \ninformation to the attention of the Committee, but, more important, it \ndeprives the Committee of the valuable perspective that such a \nrepresentative could bring on the rule change issues the Committee \nregularly considers.\n  With the passage of the CVRA, crime victims, no less then the Justice \nDepartment and the defense bar, became participants with recognized \nrights in the criminal justice process. They should, therefore, be \nrepresented directly on the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules.\n  When Congress passed the CVRA, it made a commitment to crime victims \nthat they would no longer be overlooked in the criminal justice \nprocess. Nowhere is that commitment better exemplified than in the \nCVRA's promise that victims will be given ``the right to be treated \nwith fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.'' \nUntil the rules governing criminal proceedings in our Federal courts \nfully protect crime victims, that important goal will not be achieved.\n  I urge my colleagues to carry forward the promises made in the Crime \nVictims Rights Act. Crime victims' rights must be respected throughout \nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Crime Victims' Rights \nRules Act would amend the rules to ensure that crime victims are no \nlonger overlooked in the federal criminal process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8748-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8748-S8749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 262--DESIGNATING JULY 2007 AS ``NATIONAL WATERMELON \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself and Mr. Isakson) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 262\n\n       Whereas watermelon production constitutes an important \n     sector of the agricultural industry of the United States;\n       Whereas, according to the January 2006 statistics compiled \n     by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the United \n     States Department of Agriculture, the United States produces \n     4,200,000,000 pounds of watermelon annually;\n       Whereas watermelon is grown in 49 States, is purchased and \n     consumed in all 50 States, and is exported to Canada;\n       Whereas evidence indicates that eating 2\\1/2\\ to 5 cups of \n     fruits and vegetables daily as part of a healthy diet will \n     improve health and protect against diseases such as cancer, \n     high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease;\n       Whereas proper diet and nutrition are important factors in \n     preventing diseases such as childhood obesity and diabetes;\n       Whereas watermelon has no fat or cholesterol and is an \n     excellent source of the vitamins A, B6, and C, fiber, and \n     potassium, which are vital to good health and disease \n     prevention;\n       Whereas watermelon is also an excellent source of lycopene;\n       Whereas lycopene, an antioxidant found only in a few red \n     plant foods, has been shown to reduce the risk of certain \n     cancers;\n       Whereas watermelon is a heart-healthy food that has \n     qualified for the heart-check mark from the American Heart \n     Association;\n       Whereas watermelon has been a nutritious summer favorite \n     from generation to generation; and\n       Whereas it is important to educate citizens of the United \n     States regarding the health benefits of watermelon and other \n     fruits and vegetables: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Watermelon \n     Month'';\n       (2) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, \n     and the people of the United States to observe the month with \n     appropriate programs and activities; and\n       (3) designates July 2007 as ``National Watermelon Month''.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nthat will recognize July 2007 as ``National Watermelon Month.'' \nWatermelon production is a vital part of our Nation's agricultural \nsector and this resolution recognizes that fact.\n  According to statistics released by the National Agricultural \nStatistics Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in January \n2006, the United States produces 4,200,000,000 pounds of watermelon \nannually. This amount of annual production is remarkable when you \nconsider the number of actual watermelons it represents. Watermelon \nvarieties range in size from 5 pounds to over 40 pounds, so the number \nproduced, consumed, and exported each year is truly amazing.\n  Research has shown that the inclusion of fruits and vegetables in our \ndiets is vitally important for a healthy lifestyle. Evidence indicates \nthat eating between 2\\1/2\\ and 5 cups of fruits and vegetables everyday \nwill improve health and protect against many of the diseases, \nespecially those influenced by diet, that afflict our Nation. \nWatermelon provides many of the vitamins, fiber and nutrients which \nhelp prevent many of these diseases. Watermelon is also a good source \nof lycopene, an antioxidant that has been shown to reduce the risk of \ncertain cancers. The health benefits associated with watermelon are so \noutstanding that the American Heart Association has certified \nwatermelon as a heart-healthy food, thereby qualifying it for the \nheart-check certification mark.\n  I cannot address this body without mentioning the importance of the \nwatermelon to my home State of Georgia. The University of Georgia \nCollege of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Center for \nAgribusiness and\n\n[[Page S8749]]\n\nEconomic Development recently released its 2006 Georgia Farm Gate Value \nReport. Watermelon ranked 16th among all Georgia commodities with a \nfarm gate value of a little over $111 million from almost 24,000 acres \nof watermelon. I am also proud to represent Cordele, Georgia, which is \nknown as the, ``Watermelon Capital of the World.''\n  Recognizing July as ``National Watermelon Month'' will provide the \nwatermelon industry with many avenues to not only market their product \nbut also educate the public about the health benefits associated with \nconsuming watermelon through different watermelon related programs and \nactivities. Watermelon enjoys a long history as one of our Nation's \nfavorite foods. As Mark Twain once said, ``When one has tasted \nwatermelon he knows what the angels eat.'' I encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in acknowledging the wisdom of Mark Twain by supporting this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/29/senate-section/article/S8749-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2001.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 197, S. 1610.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1610) to ensure national security while \n     promoting foreign investment and the creation and maintenance \n     of jobs, to reform the process by which such investments are \n     examined for any effect they may have on national security, \n     to establish the Committee on Foreign Investment in the \n     United States, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, section 721 of the Defense Production Act, \nalso known as the Exon-Florio amendment, Exon-Florio, established a \nstatutory framework for the U.S. Government to analyze foreign \nacquisitions, mergers, and takeovers of privately owned entities within \nthe United States to determine whether such transactions affect the \nnational security of the United States. The Foreign Investment and \nNational Security Act of 2007 amends section 721 for the purpose of \nstrengthening the process by which such transactions are reviewed and, \nwhen warranted, investigated for national security concerns. In \naddition, the act provides for a system of congressional notification \nso that Congress is able to conduct proper oversight of the national \nsecurity implications of foreign direct investment in the United States \nto ensure that it is beneficial and has no adverse impact on U.S. \nnational security.\n  Exon-Florio established a four-step process for examining a foreign \nacquisition: (1) voluntary notice by the companies; (2) a 30-day review \nto identify any national security concerns; (3) an optional 45-day \ninvestigation to determine whether identified concerns require more \nextensive mitigation efforts or a recommendation to the President for \npossible action; and (4) a Presidential decision to permit, suspend, or \nprohibit an acquisition in those instances where potential national \nsecurity concerns cannot be mitigated.\n  During the standard review period, CFIUS conducts a national security \nanalysis to determine whether any national security issues exist with a \nparticular transaction, and if so, whether those concerns can be \nmitigated. In practice, companies sometime ``pre-file'' with CFIUS, \nproviding information about the transaction in order to ensure that \nCFIUS has all necessary information during the formal review period. \nFurther, companies may withdraw from the formal review in order to \naddress concerns on the condition that they re-file promptly with CFIUS \nor abandon the transaction.\n  Therefore, while the vast majority of CFIUS transactions are approved \nby the end of the 30-day review, the total time devoted to transactions \nis sometimes longer. If national security concerns have not been \nresolved during the 30-day review, CFIUS can extend its review to a \nsecond stage 45-day investigation. At the end of a 45-day \ninvestigation, the transaction is sent to the President for a decision, \naccompanied by a CFIUS report and recommendation. Any transaction that \ngoes to the President must be reported to Congress. Transactions that \nenter investigation may also be terminated before reaching the \nPresident, with the companies voluntarily withdrawing and abandoning \nthe investment. Presidential decisions are also avoided in cases where \na mitigation agreement has been reached during the investigation period \nand the companies withdraw from investigation and immediately refile.\n  Mitigation agreements, which are contracts with CFIUS or CFIUS \nagencies entered into by the parties to the transaction, are an \nimportant element of the CFIUS review and investigation process. These \nagreements are intended to mitigate possible national security threats \nposed by a transaction short of requiring that the parties abandon the \ntransaction altogether. The Department of Defense, hereafter DOD, has \nfor many years used various types of mitigation agreements under \nexisting DOD authority and regulations such as the National Industrial \nSecurity Program Operating Manual, NISPOM, to address the impact of \nforeign ownership and control over companies that have classified \ncontracts with the Pentagon or intelligence agencies. In recent years, \nthe Departments of Justice and Homeland Security have also done so.\n  S. 1610 reinforces CFIUS's capacity to refuse, suspend, modify or \nreverse any transaction if a written notice of such transaction is not \nfiled with CFIUS or if there is an intentional material omission or \nfalsehood in connection with a completed CFIUS review or investigation, \nor an intentional material breach in any posttransaction mitigation \nagreement, and establishes a formal requirement that all filings with \nCFIUS must be complete and accurate to the best of the filing party's \nability. Thus, the committee establishes a\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\nclear signal that all violations of such notice certification should be \nconsidered in the context of title 18, section 1001, and all \nintentional breaches or misstatements could also lead to severe \nmodification or divestment of an acquisition of a previously reviewed \ntransaction at any time.\n  The bill also establishes a mechanism by which CFIUS can unilaterally \nreopen a transaction that had previously been approved. My expectation \nis that this authority will only be used in exceptional circumstances \nwhen no other remedies exist and where there has been an intentional \nbreach that affects national security. For that reason, the bill \nrequires important procedural safeguards to ensure that this authority \nis not used lightly--among other safeguards, it requires, for example, \nthat the decision to reopen a case is made at the same level of \nseniority as is required in the bill for the approval of transactions. \nThe bill makes clear that CFIUS can only reopen a transaction if these \nthreshold tests are met.\n  Of necessity, the reviews and investigations, which contain \nclassified evaluations of national security vulnerabilities as well as \nextensive proprietary business information, remain highly confidential. \nGiven this lack of transparency, there have been concerns over the \nyears about CFIUS's accountability to Congress and to the public, \nparticularly with regard to fundamental questions of whether CFIUS \npolicies are consistent with the statute, executive orders, and \nregulations that govern its operations and whether CFIUS policies are \napplied consistently from transaction to transaction.\n  CFIUS has explicit authority in the regulations to open a case in the \nevent that CFIUS discovers there has been a material misstatement or \nomission in the information provided by the parties to the transaction. \nCFIUS agencies also have all of the remedies that are normally \navailable under a contract in order to enforce the terms of the \nmitigation agreement. In addition, in a large number of CFIUS cases, \nand particularly those involving the Defense Department, CFIUS \napprovals can be effectively nullified simply by ending the federal \nagency's contracting relationship with the company. Defense-related \ncontracts are often a central element of CFIUS transactions, so the \nthreat of being denied a contract going forward ensures compliance with \nthe terms of mitigation agreements or other conditions agreed to by the \nforeign investor.\n  On October 6, 2005, under the leadership of then-Chairman Richard \nShelby, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs conducted \na hearing into the findings of the GAO report. Discussion between the \nGAO witnesses and Banking Committee members further highlighted \ndeficiencies in implementation of Exon-Florio and the level of \ndissatisfaction with the lack of communication between CFIUS and the \nappropriate oversight committees of Congress. That hearing was followed \non October 20, 2005, by another hearing that allowed the Banking \nCommittee to hear directly from many of the agencies that comprise \nCFIUS, including the Department of the Treasury, which has the lead \nrole in implementing Exon-Florio, as well as private sector \nrepresentatives.\n  In late January 2006 congressional offices became aware of the \nproposed acquisition of terminal operations at a number of U.S. \nmaritime ports by Dubai Ports World, hereafter DPW, an established port \noperator owned by the government of the Emirate of Dubai. Concern \nwithin Congress about a transaction that would transfer control of \nterminal operations to a company owned by a Persian Gulf emirate \nthrough whose financial system funds had been transferred to the \nterrorists who carried out the September 11, 2001, attacks upon the \nUnited States, and that had been a central conduit for nuclear weapons \ncomponents being smuggled to hostile regimes, provided further impetus \nfor review of the manner in which foreign transactions were being \nanalyzed by CFIUS.\n  That senior White House officials, and the Secretaries and Deputy \nSecretaries of the Departments of the Treasury and Homeland Security \nwere unaware of the Dubai Ports World transaction, combined with the \nfact this transaction was not subjected to a formal investigation in \nviolation of the Byrd amendment, compounded congressional concerns \nabout the nature of the underlying transaction.\n  In response to congressional criticism related to the DPW case in \n2006, CFIUS agencies pledged to address flaws in the CFIUS process \nidentified by Congress. There were 113 transactions filed with CFIUS in \n2006, up 74 percent from the previous year. Because companies seek \nCFIUS consideration voluntarily, this increase reflected greater \nsensitivity among foreign investors, which in turn may reflect a more \naggressive stance from CFIUS. CFIUS conducted seven second-stage \ninvestigations, the same number of investigations that had been \nconducted over the previous five-year period. There was also an \nincrease in the number of companies withdrawing from CFIUS reviews and \ninvestigations, which suggests a higher degree of scrutiny: either \ncompanies withdrew for the purpose of terminating the underlying \ntransaction or in order to restructure the transaction to address CFIUS \nconcerns.\n  The number of cases in which CFIUS approved transactions with \nconditions attached through mitigation agreements also increased. CFIUS \nhas also increased its Congressional outreach, notifying the \nCongressional leadership and committees of jurisdiction upon completion \nof CFIUS action on each transaction. Treasury also finally produced the \nlong-overdue quadrennial report on CFIUS-related issues as mandated by \nthe Defense Production Act of 1950.\n  In response to continued concerns regarding implementation of Exon-\nFlorio, on April 30, 2006, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs reported an original bill, S. 109-264, which made significant \namendments to Section 721 to strengthen the review and oversight \nprocess. Senate bill 109-264 passed the Senate on July 26, 2006. On the \nsame day the House passed its own reform legislation, H.R. 5337. No \nfurther action occurred on the bills prior to the adjournment of the \n109th Congress.\n  On February 28, 2007, The House once again passed legislation \namending section 721 to strengthen the foreign investment review \nprocess, H.R. 556--The National Foreign Investment Reform and \nStrengthened Transparency Act of 2007. On May 16, 2007, the Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs convened to consider \nand report an original bill--the Foreign Investment and National \nSecurity Act of 2007--Proposed by Chairman Christopher J. Dodd, working \nclosely with Ranking Member Richard Shelby and drawing upon the \nextensive work that members of the committee had undertaken on this \nsubject in the 109th Congress.\n  Let me offer a brief summary of the most important provisions of the \nbill.\n  The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007--\n  Establishes the membership of the Committee on Foreign Investment in \nthe United States, CFIUS, in statute;\n  Strengthens the role of the Director of National Intelligence, \nhereafter DNI, by making the DNI an ex-officio member of CFIUS and \nrequiring that the Director undertake a thorough analysis of the \ntransaction with respect to any national security implications, engage \nthe intelligence community, and report the DNI's findings to the \ncommittee within 20 days of the commencement of the CFIUS review. \nRequires the DNI to update CFIUS with any additional relevant \nintelligence information that becomes available during the course of a \nreview and/or investigation;\n  Mandates the designation of a lead agency or agencies for each \ncovered transaction, in addition to the Treasury Department, charged \nwith negotiating any mitigation agreement or other conditions to ensure \nthat national security is protected, and for follow-up compliance with \nthe terms of the agreement after the transaction has been approved by \nCFIUS;\n  Provides for the 30-day review of covered transactions by CFIUS to \ndetermine its effects on national security, and for sign-off at the \nassistant secretary-level, or above, that there is no threat to \nnational security by the proposed transaction;\n  Provides for the 45-day investigation of covered transactions that \nthreaten to impair national security, including transactions involving \nforeign government-owned companies and control of\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\ncritical infrastructure, and for sign-off at the Deputy Secretary level \nthat there is no threat to the national security by the proposed \ntransaction;\n  Provides for certain exceptions for the requirement that a state-\nowned entity automatically go to the investigation stage if the \nSecretary or Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, and the equivalent level \nofficial in the lead agency, determine after review of the transaction \nthat national security will not be impaired by the transaction;\n  Requires assessment of a country's compliance with U.S. and \nmultilateral counterterrorism, nonproliferation and export control \nregimes for acquisitions by stateowned companies in the investigation \nstage;\n  Provides authority to the President to suspend or prohibit a covered \ntransaction if there is credible evidence that such transaction \nthreatens to impair U.S. national security;\n  Provides authority to CFIUS, or the lead agencies acting on behalf of \nCFIUS, to negotiate, impose and enforce conditions necessary to \nmitigate any threat to national security related to a covered \ntransaction;\n  Adds to the list of factors that CFIUS should consider in the conduct \nof its reviews and investigation to include among other things \nconsideration of the potential impact of a transaction on critical \ninfrastructure, energy assets, or critical technologies;\n  Provides for written notice, to the Congress at the conclusion of the \nCFIUS process for both reviews and investigations, providing details \nabout the transaction, including written assurance that the transaction \ndoes not threaten to impair national security or that any initial \nconcerns have been mitigated through binding agreements between the \nparties and CFIUS, or the lead agency or agencies designated by the \nChairman of CFIUS;\n  Provides for detailed annual reports to Congress on the activities of \nCFIUS, including information concerning the transactions that have been \nreviewed or investigated during the previous 12 months;\n  Provides for an investigation by the Inspector General of the \nDepartment of Treasury to determine why the department failed to comply \nwith provisions of the Defense Production Act with respect to certain \nreporting requirements related to potential industrial espionage or \ncoordinated strategies by foreign parties with respect to U.S. critical \ntechnology by foreign parties; and\n  Provides for the issuance of regulations and guidance to carry out \nthe provisions of the Act.\n  Madam President, Ranking Member Richard Shelby and I believe that \nSenate passage of S. 1610 as amended by the Dodd/Shelby substitute \namendment, which is largely technical in nature, will not only \nimplement needed reforms and thereby strengthen national security, but \nalso provide more transparency and predictability to the CFIUS process \nthat is important to ensuring that the U.S. economy continues to \nbenefit from the fruits of foreign direct investment. We strongly urge \nour colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise in support of the Senate's \npassage of the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. \nThis important bill reforms the process through which the Committee on \nForeign Investment in the United States reviews foreign investment in \nour country. It establishes a process for reviewing foreign investment \ntransactions that thoroughly examines issues relating to national \nsecurity, involves clear lines of responsibility, and is flexible to \nmeet the demands of the market.\n  I appreciate the leadership and hard work of Chairman Dodd on this \nmatter.\n\n\n                        labor management rights\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I rise today to commend Chairman Dodd and \nRanking Member Shelby on their work regarding the Committee on Foreign \nInvestment in the United States, CFIUS.\n  Last year, a company called Dubai Ports World sought to purchase \nlabor management rights to several U.S. ports, a proposal that was \napproved by CFIUS. However, numerous Members of Congress, the media and \nthe American public quickly and loudly voiced concerns over the way in \nwhich the CFIUS process had occurred. Because of the enormous outcry, \nSenator Shelby, then Chairman of the Banking Committee, worked with \nthen-Ranking Member Senator Sarbanes, to make the CFIUS process more \ntransparent and much more effective.\n  I want to commend both Senators for their work on this legislation, \nand I believe that their hard work has produced legislation that will \nbolster American support for foreign investments.\n  Many different agencies within the Federal Government have the \nresponsibility to investigate foreign investment proposals before they \ncan be approved. Those agencies, including our intelligence community, \nhave a serious responsibility to ensure that each proposed foreign \ninvestment in our country will not jeopardize national security. It is \nmy understanding that currently, the Director of National Intelligence \nhas the authority to tap any of the intelligence agencies within our \nFederal Government to conduct analysis of technology transfers and \neconomic impacts of any foreign investment proposals. Senator Shelby, \nis that your understanding of the responsibilities held by the Director \nof National Intelligence?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator is correct. Currently the DNI can use \ndifferent intelligence agencies to conduct economic analysis, including \ntechnology transfers, to ensure that such foreign investment proposals \nwill not jeopardize our national security.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator. Madam President, the reason I bring \nup that concern is that I do not believe that such analyses are \noccurring, or that very little economic analysis is being conducted by \nour intelligence communities.\n  I am hopeful that this legislation crafted by Senators Shelby and \nDodd will pass the Senate quickly and that it can be signed into law, \nbecause America should be a country that welcomes foreign investment. \nHowever, we must be absolutely certain that any investment into our \ncountry will not have a negative economic impact or impair our national \nsecurity. I sincerely hope that the Director of National Intelligence \nwill participate fully in the CFIUS process and use all available \nresources to ensure that all foreign investment proposals receive very \nthorough and timely analysis to ensure congressional and public support \nfor increased investment in our country, while at the same time ensure \nour national security is not placed in jeopardy.\n  Again, I would like to commend the chair and ranking member of the \nSenate Banking Committee for their hard work and dedication to this \nlegislation and I will strongly support its passage.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a Dodd-Shelby \nsubstitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill, as \namended, be read the third time; further, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Banking Committee be discharged from the consideration of H.R. 556, \nand the Senate proceed to its consideration; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken, and the text of S. 1610, as amended, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwithout any intervening action or debate; that S. 1610 be placed back \non the calendar; that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
