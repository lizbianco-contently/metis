Mr. President, this morning we will resume consideration of \nS. 1639, the immigration legislation. As I said yesterday, cloture was \nfiled on the bill. Any germane first-degree amendments need to be filed \ntoday by 1 p.m.\n  Also, another reminder to Members about the briefing by Admiral \nMcConnell which will take place in S-407 and will run until 11:30 this \nmorning. I will say to everyone, we could have votes during that period \nof time. I announced that last night. That is very possible, that we \nwill have votes on this immigration bill. We are under postcloture \nrules. We are going to finish this legislation this week. And we very \nmuch appreciate the admiral coming down here, but, of course, he did \nnot know what our schedule would be. But others may be inconvenienced \nbecause there very well could be votes.\n  Let me say a couple of things before we get to immigration. I would \nnotify the two managers that I may have to have a short quorum call \nbecause there are some changes they are making on procedural matters. I \nthink we need a couple of minutes to get that straightened out.\n  I sought yesterday to move to S. 1, the ethics and lobbying reform \nbill. There was a reason the bill came first. From the first day, we \nknew that all progress would depend on renewing the peoples' faith in \nthe integrity of this institution, the Congress. This legislation which \npassed here in the Senate does just that: It prohibits lobbyists and \nthose who hire lobbyists from giving gifts to lawmakers and staff; it \nprevents corporations and lobbyists from paying for questionable travel \nfor Members and staff; it requires Senators to pay fair market value \nfor chartered flights, putting an end to abuses of corporate travel; \nslows the revolving door by extending the ban on lobbying by former \nMembers of Congress and senior staffers; prevents Senators from even \nnegotiating for a job as a lobbyist until their successor has been \nelected; puts an end to the pay-to-play schemes that became notorious \naround here; it shines the light of day on lobbying activities by \nvastly increasing disclosure requirements; requires the Senate disclose \nall earmarks--this is the first time ever. We passed the ethics and \nlobbying reform bill here with overwhelming support from Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. The House did the same thing.\n  Yesterday, I asked consent to send our legislation to conference. The \nRepublicans objected. I think it is interesting that on the same day \nthis objection took place preventing us from moving forward to complete \nthis legislation, there was yet another sign of how desperately needed \nthis reform is. Yesterday, Stephen Griles, President Bush's former \nInterior Deputy Secretary, the No. 2 in charge, was sent to prison and \nfined for his corruption. This sentence came after Griles admitted to \nobstructing the investigation of the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs. Now Mr. Griles will face justice for his contribution to \ndisintegrating the peoples' trust in their Government. But now we have \na chance to look forward, to stop the Jack Abramoffs, the\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nSafavians, the Neys and others and the Stephen Griles of the future \nbefore they have a chance to corrupt our system even more, to deliver \nto the American people a government as good and as honest as the people \nit represents.\n  I will come, before the day is out, and ask once again unanimous \nconsent to appoint conferees in this legislation. The eyes of the \ncountry are upon us as to what we are going to do with ethics reform \nand lobbying reform in this Congress. Are we going to be prevented from \ncompleting this legislation? The answer is up to the minority, the \nRepublicans.\n\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor to express appreciation to Richard \nLugar, the senior Senator from the State of Indiana, former chairman \nand current ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, for his \ncomments on the tragic war in Iraq.\n  I have said on previous occasions that Democrats are virtually \nunanimous in our opposition to the war and united in our efforts to \nchange course. But we face an obstinate President who refuses to hear \nthe call of the American people. We face a Republican minority that has \nlargely stood by his side as conditions in Iraq have deteriorated, and \nwe have more than 3,500 dead Americans. I understand those who are \nwounded are approaching 30,000, a third of them grievously wounded.\n  Opposing the President of one's own party, especially on a war, is no \nsmall thing. And now Senator George Voinovich, another key Republican \non the Foreign Relations Committee, has stepped forward along with \nSenator Lugar to question what is going on in Iraq. In a letter to \nPresident Bush, Senator Voinovich urges the President to finally wake \nup to the truth so many of us already know: This war cannot be won \nmilitarily, can only be won politically, diplomatically, and \neconomically. Senator John Warner said yesterday that he expects more \nRepublicans to join our call for a responsible change of course.\n  When this war finally ends--and we are in the fifth year of this war, \nand it will end--this last period of time where we have had Lugar, \nVoinovich, and Warner speak out about the present situation in Iraq \ncould be the turning point. This could be the moment when we break down \nthe aisle that separates the two parties on Iraq.\n  So I say to my Republican colleagues who continue to follow President \nBush's lead: Join with us. When I say ``us,'' we now have at least five \nRepublicans that I know of, and I would be happy to run through the \nnames: Hagel, Smith, Voinovich, Lugar, and Warner have already spoken \nout. Join with us. We can extricate our troops from the firing line of \nanother country's civil war. We can begin to rebuild our battered \nmilitary so they can focus on the real threats we face around the \nworld.\n  Remember what the National Council of Mayors did yesterday. They also \nsaid, and voted by a majority, the war should end as soon as possible.\n  The first step has been taken by my Republican colleagues. We need \nmore help. Now we need to put their brave words in action by working \ntogether to bring home our brave troops and deliver the responsible end \nto the war that the American people demand and deserve.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8524-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

I thank the distinguished majority leader. I have sought \nrecognition to comment on two subjects on the pending immigration bill.\n  First, it is my hope that my colleagues in the Senate will focus very \nclosely on the extraordinary problems the United States faces today by \nthe current status of our immigration laws and weigh very carefully, \nnotwithstanding any objections people may have to the pending bill, the \ncomparison of the bill with the status quo, what is in existence at the \npresent time. The ultimate decision on whether to vote for or against \nthe bill depends upon not what we would like to have, not what would be \nperfect, maybe not even what would meet the desires of the individual \nMembers, but a comparison between what bill finally emerges and the \nstatus quo, what is happening at the present time, because what we \nreally have in our immigration law is chaos and anarchy.\n  We struggled through legislation in the 109th Congress. It came \nthrough the Judiciary Committee, which I chaired in the 109th Congress, \npassed the Senate, and a different kind of a bill passed the House of \nRepresentatives. We could not go to conference, we did not resolve the \nissue, and it is back again this year. As I have said on a number of \noccasions on the floor, I think it probably would have been preferable \nto work through committee. I think at this juncture, you can strike the \n``probably.'' It would have been preferable to work through committee \nin regular order. Whenever we leave regular order, we get into trouble.\n  So we structured it differently. We structured it with a hard-working \ngroup of Senators, up to 12, sometimes a rotating group, and we came up \nwith a bill. We have been struggling with it on the Senate floor. We \nhave found objections on all sides. We have found objections on the \nright that it is amnesty, and we have found objections on the left that \nit does not satisfy humanitarian needs and provide for family \nreunification, but we continue to push ahead. But I think it is plain \nthat if the Senate does not come up with a bill, doing the best we can \nnow, the subject will be cut off for the indefinite future. Certainly \nit will not come back up this year when we have a very crowded agenda \non appropriations bills and patent reform and many other subjects. It \nis unlikely to come up next year in a Presidential and congressional \nelection year. Then we are looking at 2009, and we have no reason to \nexpect that the issue will be any easier in 2009 than it is today \nexcept that we would have lost more time.\n  We also ought to bear in mind that the Senate bill is not the final \nproduct. We will yet have a House bill, we will yet have conference, \nand we will yet have an opportunity to meet objections which are \npresently lodged against the bill.\n  Just a word of explanation. When I tear up, it is a result of \nchemotherapy; it is not a result of sadness on the current status of \nthe immigration bill.\n  There is unity of judgment in both the House and the Senate, and I \nthink broadly across America, that we need to reinstate the rule of \nlaw. We need to fix our broken borders. We need to have law enforcement \nagainst individuals who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. That is a \nvery major part of the pending bill. The current bill provides for an \nincreased Border Patrol from 12,000 to 18,000--6,000 new people.\n  It provides for additional fencing, although fencing was legislated \nin the 109th Congress. It provides for drones to fly overhead. It \nprovides for fencing to protect urban areas. While you can't build an \nimpenetrable fence of more than 2,000 miles above the border, we do \ncover a great deal of border protection. But no matter how secure the \nborder is, as long as there is a magnet so people can get jobs in the \nUnited States which are better than other places, immigrants will be \nattracted, illegal immigrants will be attracted. That is why we have \nstructured provisions in this bill to have foolproof identification so \nemployers will be able to know with certainty whether an individual is \na legal or an illegal immigrant. That being the case, if employers hire \nillegal immigrants knowing they are illegal immigrants because they are \nin a position to make that determination, it is fair to have sanctions, \nand for repeat offenders tougher\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\nsanctions, and for repeat offenders, confirmed recidivists, to have \njail time so we will provide the incentives of law enforcement on \nwhite-collar crime, which is very effective as a deterrent. I have seen \nthat from my own experience as a prosecuting attorney.\n  In this bill we have issues which are agreed upon by everyone to \nsecure our borders, to impose the rule of law, and to control illegal \nimmigration. But that is not the end of the issue on comprehensive \nlegislation. We have a guest worker program. In the midst of many \nobjections which I am receiving about the bill, I am also hearing a \ngreat deal from people who say we need to have immigrant workers, that \nthey are a vital part of our workforce. The landscapers have contacted \nme. The farmers have contacted me. Restauranteurs have contacted me. \nHotel associations have contacted me. The agriculture needs in \nCalifornia have been expressed repeatedly on the floor of this body. So \nwe do need the workers. The Chamber of Commerce and the other \norganizations are very forceful in articulating that need.\n  We have tried to balance it so we do not take away American jobs and \nso we are sensitive to the objections which the AFL-CIO has raised. We \nreduced the number of the guest worker program from 400,000 to 200,000. \nWe tried to take into consideration the H-1B workers so that we bring \nin people with advanced degrees and technical knowledge to help Silicon \nValley and other entities which are seeking more along that line. The \nbill is structured in a very sensitive way in that direction.\n  Then we have the 12 million undocumented immigrants. No one knows the \nexact number, but that is the number which we have utilized, a number \nwhich the Pew Foundation says is about right from their surveys. We \nhave a cry that we will be giving amnesty to these 12 million \nindividuals. We have done our best to structure a bill which requires \nthese undocumented immigrants to earn the right to the path of \ncitizenship. We have imposed fines. We have the requirement in the bill \nnow, through amendment, that they have to pay back taxes. We require \nthey learn English. We require the undocumented immigrants hold jobs \nfor a part of our society. We have a so-called touchback provision \nwhich I am not enthusiastic about. I have grave reservations about \npunitive measures which do not have some substantive meaning, but that \nconcession has been made to try to avoid the amnesty claim. We have \ngone about as far as we can go. Amnesty, like beauty, may be in the eye \nof the beholder.\n  One thing is plain: The 12 million undocumented immigrants are going \nto stay in the United States one way or another. They are going to stay \nhere unless we find a way to identify those who are criminals and who \ncould and should be deported, those who may be problems on terrorism. \nIt is agreed that you can't deport 12 million undocumented immigrants. \nBut if we can find a way to so-called ``bring them out of the \nshadows,'' we can identify those who ought to be deported in manageable \nnumbers.\n  Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff has accurately said \nthat the current situation, with 12 million undocumented immigrants, is \nsilent amnesty. So they are here, one way or another, silent amnesty or \namnesty. But one thing we could do if we move ahead with the \nlegislation is to avoid the anarchy which is here at the present time.\n  I urge my colleagues, in formulating their judgment on the next \ncritical cloture vote and on the issues of the point of order which \nwill be raised, both of which will require 60 votes, to consider very \ncarefully our best efforts at legislation which may be improved upon \neven more on the pending amendments, may be improved upon even more, \ncontrasting that with the current situation, the status quo, which is \ntotally objectionable.\n  I want to comment about one other subject, and that is the procedures \nwhich we are undertaking on this bill. We have come to an approach \nwhich, quite frankly, I would prefer not to have seen adopted. I would \nhave preferred to have proceeded as we did at the start of the \nconsideration of this bill before the majority leader took it off the \ncalendar, where we were entertaining amendments from all sides. When \nthe majority leader moved for cloture, I joined most of my colleagues \non this side of the aisle, on the Republican side, in voting against \ncloture so people could have an opportunity to offer their amendments \nand the minority would not be stifled. I think on some occasions in the \npast, there have been efforts to stifle the minority and not allow them \nto bring up amendments. I stood with my Republican colleagues in voting \nagainst cloture.\n  Then we spent hours on the floor of the Senate where the objectors--\nreally the obstructionists; well, let's call them objectors, I withdraw \nthe comment ``obstructionists''--were exercising their rights. It is \nbetter to use a more diplomatic language and to accord all colleagues \nthe full panoply of their rights. They were exercising their rights. \nBut we sat around here. As the manager of the bill, I have to sit on \nthe floor because something may happen; unlikely, but something may \nhappen. I sat around for hours again yesterday. I don't mind hard work, \nbut I do mind no work. But we sat around for hours on Thursday \nafternoon where the objectors wouldn't offer amendments, and they \nwouldn't allow anybody else to offer amendments. That is unacceptable, \njust unacceptable.\n\n  So I joined my colleagues, seven of us on the Republican side, and \nvoted for cloture to cut off debate, and it failed. Then understandably \nthe majority leader took the bill down. Now we have a very limited \nperiod of time, because we are about to embark on the 4th of July \nrecess. When we come back there is a full agenda. As I said earlier, if \nwe don't take the bill up now, it is not going to happen this year and \nprobably won't happen next year. When we look at 2009, the same kind of \nproblems we will face then, we face now, except they will be worse.\n  So a procedure has been structured now where we have 25 amendments. \nThat is going to be the full extent. Yesterday the distinguished junior \nSenator from Oklahoma said he wanted an opportunity to offer \namendments. I don't disagree with his philosophy, but in order to have \nhad that opportunity, they had to have been done when we first had the \nbill on the floor. If the bill is to be moved along, we are going to \nhave to proceed as we are now.\n  Our plan is to seek unanimous consent on these 25 amendments for a \nlimited period of time. We have the proponents of the amendments, and \nopponents, and they are prepared to take a limited time agreement. Now \nwe are equally divided. If Senators get down to business and get down \nto issues in an hour, you can debate the salient points. You probably \naren't going to change any minds, anyway, around here, but you can have \nthe debate in a pro forma way and get it done. But those time \nagreements will not proceed if there are objections to the time \nagreements, and we won't be able to have even limited debate.\n  The plan has been worked out. I don't like the plan, but it is the \nbest we can do. It is the least of the undesirable alternatives. As a \nmanager, I am going to move to table Democratic amendments, and Senator \nKennedy, as the manager, is going to move to table Republican \namendments. So if there is no agreement on this limited time, there \nwon't be any debate at all, and we are going to move right ahead for \nthe disposition of the bill. If someone seeks recognition to speak with \nthe managers controlling the floor, we will ask for unanimous consent \nthat the speaker agree that no amendment will be offered and that there \nwill be discussion only on the bill and for a limited period of time, a \nvery limited period of time.\n  That is not the way the Senate ordinarily does business. Ordinarily \nif there is a request for unanimous consent on a time agreement on a \npending amendment, if there is an objection, then there is no time \nlimit and people debate it at some length, or they may filibuster it. \nBut that is not going to happen on this bill at this time, because the \nday for amendments to be offered and regular order to be followed is \npast.\n  If we are to have a resolution of this issue, we are going to have to \nmove ahead under this constricted and constrained procedure which, \nagain, I don't like, but we are being forced to by the circumstances \nwhich we find ourselves in.\n  Just as we respect the rights of the objectors to raise the \nobjections they have, we have rights, too. The way we\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\nare proceeding is fully within the rules of the Senate. It is going to \nbe a rough ride. We are in trench warfare, and it is going to be tough. \nBut we are going to see the will of the Senate work one way or another. \nI hope, as I said earlier, my colleagues will, on the merits, take a \nclose look at a comparison between the legislation we will produce with \nthe unacceptable, unsatisfactory anarchy we have in immigration law \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate today must make a choice. We \ncan listen to the American people and support comprehensive immigration \nreform or we can ignore their voice and allow a dysfunctional \nimmigration system to continue, at serious risk to our national \nsecurity.\n  If we do not choose reform, we will perpetuate a system that allows \n500,000 illegal immigrants to enter the United States each year, forces \n12 million illegal immigrants to live in the shadows, and fosters a \nculture of fear and hatred against immigrants.\n  America demands change. Our bill provides the change the country \nneeds. Change is not easy. There is much to criticize in this bill, but \ncriticism is much easier than rolling up your sleeves and finding a \nsolution.\n  The American people are growing impatient for a solution. Yesterday, \nthe Washington Post reported that more than 1,000 bills have been \nintroduced in the last year by State legislators fed up with \ncongressional inaction.\n  States and cities are starting to step in and solve their immigration \nproblems in their own way, regardless of the national interest. We \ncannot let that happen.\n  We are the guardians of the national interest. The national interest \ndemands action on immigration. If you are for a national immigration \npolicy, a policy that is bipartisan in spirit and determined to \nsucceed, then support this bill.\n  This bill contains the toughest and most comprehensive crackdown on \nillegal immigration in our Nation's history. It enhances our national \nsecurity through tougher border protections. It ensures that criminals \ndo not enter this country or receive immigration benefits. It prevents \nundocumented workers from obtaining jobs, and cracks down on employers \nwho defy the law by hiring them.\n  This bill tackles the essential problem of providing the workers our \neconomy needs. It will allow businesses to recruit temporary immigrants \nas workers--workers who will return home--if American workers and legal \nimmigrants are not available to fill needed jobs.\n  This bill will allow families to plan for the future by tackling the \nplight of 12 million people hidden in the shadows of this country. We \nare giving undocumented immigrants a chance to earn legal status. \nPeople deserve this chance if they pay stiff fines, work for 8 years, \npay their taxes, learning English, and go to the back of the line to \nwait their turn.\n  The American dream is a story of immigrants. We now have an \nopportunity to write a new chapter in the story of the American dream--\nan opportunity to enact tough but fair measures that protect our \nnational security, restore the rule of law, and uphold our tradition as \na nation of immigrants.\n  I look forward to the coming debate. Let's go forward together and \nachieve genuine immigration reform.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator has 26 minutes, \nof which 15 has been dedicated to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want the Senator from Virginia to \nhave his full 15 minutes, and then, if it is agreeable, I will have \nwhat is left.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe Senator from Virginia, the Senator from California be recognized, \nand the remaining time on our side be allocated to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield, at this time, to \nthe Senator from California, and then follow her, if she so desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to just take a few minutes this \nmorning--I have spoken about this before--to address the motivations I \nhave behind the amendment I have offered and to express my hopes that \nour colleagues will support this amendment. I\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\nhave offered this amendment in the hopes of helping to save the vote on \nthis bill.\n  I am well aware there are a number of people in this body who would \nlike to see this bill go down the tubes. I do not share that sentiment. \nThere is a lot of good in this bill. We were given a briefing card \nyesterday, with which the Presiding Officer, I know, is also familiar, \nwhich outlines a lot of the positive aspects in this piece of \nlegislation. It will go a long way toward toughening border security. \nIt will, in a measurable way, toughen employer sanctions. It will \ncreate a program that, in my view, is a proper way to deal with the \nguest worker issue.\n  The difficulty I have with the present legislation, and the reason I \nhave offered my amendment, goes to the issue of legalization and the \nnotion of fairness in terms of how the laws of the United States are \napplied.\n  The second problem I have with this bill is the issue of \npracticality, when you look at what are called the touchback \nprovisions. We do have, by all estimates, between 12 million and 20 \nmillion people who are here without papers. We need to be able to say, \nopenly and honestly, the situation these people are in is a result of \nthe fact they are here in contradiction of American law.\n  The average American believes very strongly in the notion of fairness \nwhen it comes to how we enforce our laws. Of those 12 million to 20 \nmillion people, as I have said for more than a year, there are a \nsignificant number who have--during a period of lax immigration laws--\ncome to this country, become part of their community, put down roots, \nand deserve a path toward legalizing their status and toward \ncitizenship.\n  But to draw the line arbitrarily at the end of last year, to include \nevery single person--with a few exceptions--who was here in this \ncountry as of the end of last year, I think violates the notion of \nfairness among a lot of people in this country. It is one of the \nreasons we have had such a strong surge of resentment toward the \nlegislation as it now exists.\n  Under my proposal, those who have lived in the United States for at \nleast 4 years prior to the enactment of the bill can apply to legalize \ntheir status. I would like to point out that a year ago, people in this \nbody were agreeing to a 5-year residency requirement. This bill is more \ngenerous than the legislation a lot of people in this body and also \nimmigrants rights groups were supporting a year ago.\n  We then would move into objective measurable criteria which would \ndemonstrate that the people who were applying have actually put roots \ndown in their community through a work history, through payments of \nFederal and State income taxes, the knowledge of English, immediate \nfamily members in the United States. These are not all inclusive. They \nare the sorts of criteria which would help to advance the legalization \nprocess.\n  I believe this is fair. I believe people in this country--who \ntraditionally would be supporting fair immigration policies but who are \nworried about the legalization process in this bill--would come forward \nand support this bill. We need that support in this country if we \nactually are going to solve this problem and move forward.\n  The second part of this amendment goes to the practicality of the \npresent legislation. It strikes the bill's unrealistic touchback \nrequirement. For those who meet the test of having roots in their \ncommunity and move forward, it removes the requirement that they have \nto go back to their country of origin in order to apply for legal \nstatus.\n  We know the difficulty a lot of families would have if their \nprincipal breadwinner had to leave his or her employment, go back to \nManila, or wherever, file papers, leave their family here, and \ninterrupt their job. That is simply impracticable. In many ways, it is \na totally unnecessary obstacle.\n  So this amendment would reduce the scope of people who were allowed \nlegalization to those who have put down roots in their communities in a \nvery fair way that I think Americans will understand, but also would \nremove the unnecessary impediment of requiring people to go back to \ntheir country of origin.\n  I have heard loudly and clearly from not only Virginians but from \npeople across this country--when I have talked to people about this \nissue over the past couple of years--that this Congress should find a \nfair system that, on the one hand, protects American workers and, also, \nrespects the rule of law. This amendment is the fairest method I know \nto do so, and to do so realistically in order to truly reform our \nbroken immigration system.\n  I am hopeful this amendment will get support. If this amendment \nsucceeds, I am happy to support the final legislation. As I said, there \nare many good provisions in this legislation. But under the present \ncircumstances, I think there are many people in this body who have a \nvery difficult time, on the notions of fairness, with the widely \nembracing notion of all the people who are involved.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to have an opportunity to speak \non the bill. I know then Senator Hutchison will offer her amendment, \nand I will have an opportunity at that time, hopefully, to speak \nagainst the amendment.\n  Mr. President, there has been one inescapable truth in all of this. \nYear after year----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator from California----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I am sorry, I \ncannot hear you.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator from California yield \nfor a question?\n  How long does she expect to speak on the bill itself before talking \nabout the amendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. For the remainder of the time we have on this side, \nwhich is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.--18 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Isn't some of that \ntime Senator Webb's time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. He just spoke.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He concluded his remarks and left the \nremainder of the time he had taken.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. For the 14 years I have served on the Immigration \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, I have become more and more \nconvinced that what we have is a broken system. To me, the word \n``comprehensive'' means fixing a broken system. The system is broken in \nmany different directions.\n  In one direction, every year, year in, year out, 700,000 to 800,000 \npeople cross the border looking for hope, opportunity, work, or to \nreunite with family. They come into this country in an illegal status, \nand they disappear. There is a portion of our economy that welcomes \nimmigrant labor. They are able to find work. They are able to hide. \nThey are able to falsify documents.\n  I have personally gone to Alvarado Street in Los Angeles and seen \nwhere, in 20 minutes, you can obtain a green card, a driver's license, \na Social Security card. You cannot tell the difference between a real \nand a fraudulent document. The border is broken in that we cannot \nprotect it.\n\n  Secondly, it is estimated that 40 percent of the people here \nillegally are visa overstays. Some go back after awhile. Some never go \nback. What does this constitute? It constitutes a silent amnesty \nbecause these people exist in America. They are able to work in \nAmerica. Most are never found by authorities. Those who are found are \nsimilar to the Munoz family in San Diego.\n  A few weeks ago, a mother and a father were deported in the middle of \nthe night. They have three American children, the oldest of which is \n16. They own their home. They both work. They own their furniture. In \nthe middle of the night, Immigration Naturalization Service comes in, \npicks up the parents and deports them. This is an actual case--the \nhouse is gone, the furniture is gone, the three children are living \nwith an aunt in San Diego. Why? Because they could be found, or because \nperhaps somebody reported them, but they could be found. But the \ndominant number of people here illegally cannot be found.\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\n  What this bill tries to do is fix the broken border. We fix it with \ninfrastructure. We say this new infrastructure, whether it is UAVs or \nvehicle barriers or fencing, has to be in place before anything else is \ndone. The bill mandates $4.4 billion upfront in spending for border \nenforcement. This money will be used to carry out the enforcement \ntriggers. That is one part of the fix.\n  A second part of the fix----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. From what the Senator said, therefore, what we are doing \non the border is the most extensive border security in the history of \nthis country, No. 1; No. 2, with the--am I not correct on that, that \nthis will be the most extensive--extensive paid-for border security in \nthe history of this country? Am I correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nthere is no question about it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Secondly, if this legislation doesn't go through, we are \nnot going to have that provision; is that not correct as well?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nthat is absolutely true. We will have a continuation of what is, in \neffect, a silent amnesty.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All right. Thirdly, is the Senator saying this is not \nonly an issue on border security, but it is an issue with regard to \nnational security because we don't know who those people are and they \ndisappear into our country, and those who have spoken about national \nsecurity in this country have urged us to take this action?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is absolutely true. We have no idea who is in \nthis country and who comes into this country illegally. We have no idea \nwho is in this country overstaying their visas.\n  These are the 12 million people who remain unidentified. This is what \nwe are trying to do: First, fix the border as it has never been fixed \nbefore. Second, hire the additional Border Patrol, bringing the total \nnumber of agents up to 20,000. Third, fix interior enforcement. Fourth, \nprovide for employer verification documents. No more fraudulent \ndocuments. Everybody will have biometric documents to be able to prove \nthey are, in fact, who they are.\n  One of the big problems is in a category called OTMs, ``Other Than \nMexicans,'' coming across the border. Because it is so easy to come in, \nmore and more people from other countries are going to Mexico first and \ncoming up through that border, particularly countries from the Middle \nEast. This represents a serious national security issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could the Senator yield for 2 quick questions?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So we are talking about not only national security and \nborder security, but the Senator is also talking about worksite \nsecurity. We don't have any worksite security at the present time. That \nis the problem with the 1986 act. We hear a lot of talk about it, but \nthat is the problem.\n  Is the Senator telling us we will have the most extensive not only \nborder security but worksite security; and beyond that we are going to \nhave 1,000 inspectors to make sure the new security is going to work; \nand beyond that, for the first time, we are going to have a tamperproof \ncard that will finally give us the opportunity to get control of our \nimmigration system?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. \nThis bill has three huge chapters called titles that are devoted to \nenforcement. It is extraordinarily important, and it isn't going to get \ndone if this bill doesn't pass.\n  Now, in addition to that, it says--because there is no way to find \nand deport these individuals because they live in the shadows and \nbecause an overwhelming number of them live a life of hard work and \nwant to continue to work and want some hope and opportunity for their \nfamily--that if they go through an extensive process--not an easy \nprocess, not a process of amnesty in any way, shape or form--as a \nmatter of fact, they feel the process may be too tough because they \nmust go through an extensive period of paying fines. For one person, \nthe fines amount to $8,500 over the first 8 years. They must learn \nEnglish. They must show work documents. They must do this periodically. \nThey must pay taxes. They must show documents that they have paid \ntaxes. This is not a pushover by a long shot.\n  If they can comply with this, they receive something called a Z visa. \nThat Z visa eventually, between 8 and 13 years into the future, will \nenable them, after everyone now in the green card line--after that \ngreen card line is expunged--to get a green card. It is hard. There are \nmany hoops they will jump through. The fines are heavy. But they say \nthey will do it. The dominant majority say they will do it. That means \nthey will be documented. That means the national security problem will \nend.\n\n  Additionally, we are requiring US-VISIT to track people leaving our \ncountry so we will know if somebody who is here on a visa actually \nleaves the country when their visa expires. There is a penalty. If they \ncome back illegally, they will be held and do some jail time prior to \ndeportation.\n  The bottom line is this bill also incorporates two other bills. One \nis a bill that has been negotiated between farmers and growers and \norganizations representing farm labor, such as the United Farm Workers, \nover a substantial period of time. The reason for this portion of the \nbill is because agriculture in America is dominantly--perhaps 90 \npercent--undocumented illegal workers. The reason it is that way is \nbecause American workers will not do the job. I know that in California \nbecause we have tried over the years to get American workers to do \nthese jobs.\n  One day I went out to the Salinas Valley, and I watched row crops \nbeing picked. What I saw was the degree to which this is stooped labor \nin the hot Sun but with a skill. These people bring a skill. \nAgriculture workers have a skill: the way they pick, the way they sort, \nthe way they pack, the way they prune. If you watch them, you see they \ngo from crop to crop. They are not American citizens. They come from \nother countries. They are the labor that puts our food on the table in \nthe United States of America.\n  What this bill does is incorporate a closely negotiated bill called \nAgJOBS, which would allow these workers to become documented and, at \nthe end of 8 years, if they carry out their requirements to continue \ntheir agricultural work for an additional number of years, they are \nthen eligible to be first in this line for a green card.\n  The final part of the bill is the DREAM Act, which recognizes that \nchildren, for example, such as the three Munoz children, or other \nchildren who are brought here illegally and go to school and earn a \ndegree in college or serve in our military, can earn a green card.\n  So the bill is a compromise bill as well. People on the other side of \nthe aisle wanted certain things in this bill. People on our side of the \naisle wanted certain things in this bill. It was negotiated and the \nbill was put together. Is the bill a perfect bill? No. Is it a good \nbill? I absolutely believe that it is. I absolutely believe this Nation \nwill be better off with this bill. Will the Judiciary Committee have to \npractice oversight? We have Senator Kennedy, we have the Presiding \nOfficer, and members of the Judiciary Committee. I believe very \nstrongly what we should do is have bimonthly hearings, oversight \nhearings into the operation and mechanics of the bill, so that as the \nbill is carried out, if there are tweaks that need to be made, we can \nmake them.\n  But to fail, at this point in time, is to continue this situation \nwhere 12 million remain unidentified, where they pose a serious risk to \nnational security, where 700,000 to 800,000 people will enter our \ncountry illegally or overstay their visas over 10 years, with 7 million \nto 8 million additional people here in undocumented capacity, where 400 \nto 500 people die every year trying to cross the Mexican border, and \nwhere 4 million people will continue to wait for a green card. We take \nthese problems and we try to solve them in this bill.\n  Now, people who are opposed to the bill say: I don't like this. I am \ngoing to vote against the bill. I don't like that. I am going to vote \nagainst the bill. Yes, they can do that. Yes, they are entitled to do \nit, but know what you are doing when you do it. There will be no $4.4 \nbillion to enforce the border. There will be no additional Border \nPatrol.\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\nThere will be no electronic verification. There will be no biometric \ndocuments, and the flow and the silent amnesty will, in fact, continue.\n  This is our chance. We should not squander it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a further \nquestion?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Certainly. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I thank her for an excellent review of \nwhere we are. This is a continuing process.\n  The Senator mentioned earlier about the fines and the fees that are \ngoing to be charged to the population if they are going to be on the \ntrack. After all those who have waited in line gain entrance into the \nUnited States, they would be at least on the track toward a green card. \nThat amounts to $55 billion, is what it comes to?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is going to be used in terms of border security. \nThat will be used for border security, worksite security, the \ndevelopment of the biometric card; and $6 billion of that $55 billion \nis going to be used to help to assist States to offset any of the \nburdens they have in terms of health care and education--$6 billion is \ngoing into that.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that if this legislation does not go \nthrough, that $55 billion disappears and Americans are still going to \nwant to try and make some progress on that line and it is going to be \nthe taxpayer who is going to pick up the burden? Could the Senator \ncomment on that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to. Through the Chair to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, he is dead right. This is $55 billion where the \npeople affected by the bill pay for the costs. That is a big thing: $55 \nbillion will flow to do what needs to be done, whether it is the \nbiometric cards, whether it is the US-VISIT Program, whether it is the \ninfrastructure at the border, whether it is the 5,000 additional Border \nPatrol; whatever it is in the bill, the fines are very heavy in this \nbill. Many people--and a reason why much of the immigrant community has \nbecome concerned about the bill--is because of the size of the fines. \nNonetheless, we can make the argument that this bill will pay for \nitself, by and large. The fines are stiff to do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. Would the Senator \nalso agree with me that the initial bill, without some of the recent \namendments--we actually find out through CBO that immigrants add to the \neconomy, and their conclusion--this is the CBO, which is a governmental \nagency charged to review it--is actually those immigrants contribute \n$25 billion more than using over this period of time as well. I am \nwondering because there has been a lot of talk about whether immigrants \nadd to the country and our society through the payment of taxes. We \nhave the independent Congressional Budget Office which made that \njudgment which is included in the record.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me, in representing a State that has \nboth the wonderful opportunities of people who have worked and \ncontributed to that State, that it is an important contribution that \nthese workers provide for our society?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there is no question that that is the \ncase, certainly, in California. We have the largest number of \nundocumented immigrants, people estimated at between 2 million and 3 \nmillion. California is an expanding economy. When you get your gas \nfilled in your tank, when you are served a meal in a restaurant, when \nyou look at who is doing the dishes, the person who is changing the \nbeds in the hotel where you stay, who transports patients in the \nhospital, who does landscaping in the gardens, sweeping the streets, \npicking the crops, pruning the crops, working in the canning factories \nthat dot our State, you see people who are among those 2 million or 3 \nmillion people. No question about it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the majority leader has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand the other half hour is for the Senator from \nPennsylvania. The Senator from Pennsylvania intended to yield to the \nSenator from Texas. I think I can yield 15 minutes to her on his \nbehalf. I think the Senator can probably get more when Senator Specter \ngets back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes have been allocated to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to use 10 minutes. The \nSenator from California said she wanted to speak against my amendment. \nI would like to reserve 5 minutes of my time for after her argument, so \nI can close the discussion on my amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be allowed to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California no longer has \ntime.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, in that case, I am going to speak on \nmy amendment----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object, is the Chair saying I \nwill not be able to have time to speak against the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time between now and 11:30 has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I see. After 11:30, I would be able to speak against \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. After Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at some \npoint between 11:30 and the time we vote, I be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes after Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about probably the most \nimportant bill we are going to address maybe in my time in the Senate, \ncertainly in the last 25 years, and in the next 25 years, from a \ndomestic policy standpoint.\n  There are some good features of this bill. I think we have run into \nmany problems, one of which is it didn't go through committee, which I \nthink everybody agrees has caused there to be so many conflicts and \nrewrites, and when you adopt an amendment, it changes something else. \nThat should have been done in committee. Another is that this issue \nhits so close to so many people. So we see objections from all \ndifferent types of groups, Democrats and Republicans, business groups \nand labor groups. So it is something that I think now is on the radar \nscreen of the American people. It is something that I think is good \nthat we are discussing because I do believe it is Congress's \nresponsibility to fix this problem. It is a problem that was made in a \n1986 act of Congress when amnesty was granted and the law was not \nenforced. There was no guest worker program that was going forward, so \nwe had illegal behavior and there was a blind eye turned.\n  Now it is 20 years later, after 1986, and we find ourselves having to \ndeal with the inability to know who is in our country because we have \nnot enforced the laws and we have not had a workable program to provide \nthe jobs that would grow the economy of our country. So here we are, \ntrying to pass a bill that will fix the problems of the past but also \nto set a standard that says we are not going to have the going-forward \ncapability for someone to come into our country illegally and stay long \nenough that they will be able to become legal without applying through \nthe processes from their home country.\n  There are good parts of the bill. I give those who have worked so \nhard on this bill credit for significant border security increases, for \nan effort to end chain migration. In most countries in the world, the \nguest worker green card equivalent ratio is two-thirds workers, one-\nthird family. It is the opposite in America; it is two-thirds family, \none-third worker, which is why we have this crisis of needing more \nworkers but not having the capability to bring them in legally in a \nprocess that will work. So that effort was made in this bill, and it is \none of the important good points of the bill. So I recognize there are \ngood parts of the bill.\n  The problems in the bill must be fixed if we are going to do this \nright and deal with the people who are here illegally in a responsible \nand rational and pragmatic way but also set the\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\nstandard that we start now, and will be set through the future, that \nyou must apply from your home country to come into this country to work \nlegally. If we don't set that standard in the bill, we will have \nanother disaster 20 years from now that a future Congress will be \ntrying to fix.\n  My problem with the bill is the amnesty. Anyone who tries to say it \nis not amnesty is not being realistic. If you can come to this country, \nstay, never have to go home and go into the process of legalization and \ngoing into our Social Security program, which is allowed in the \nunderlying bill, that is amnesty. So I have an amendment going forward \nthat will try to take the amnesty out of this bill. That is one of the \nmajor things I think we can do to make this a bill that could be \nsupported. My amendment would provide that all adult work-\neligible illegal people in this country would have the ability to come \nforward, and they would have 1 year to do it, for a temporary permit \nwhile the processing is done on that person's background, and then a \ntemporary card would be given, after which a person would have 2 years \nto go back to their home country and apply and come in legally to get \nthat Z visa, or that ZA, which is the ag worker visa, legally in our \ncountry. It was important.\n\n  One of the things we did in my amendment that I think is so important \nis we treat every work-eligible adult the same way. Whether it is an ag \nworker, restaurant worker or someone working in a hotel, everyone would \nbe treated the same way if they are in the Z-1 category or ZA \ncategory--the workers we are trying to regularize would have the same \nrequirements.\n  Now, there will be an amendment later that will say just the heads of \nhouseholds would have to go home. That was my original thought. But \nthen how can I say the working spouse of a head of a household could \nstay here, but the head of household could not? So we set the 2-year \ntimeframe for the people who are adult, work-eligible people illegally \nin our country--we set 2 years after they have signed up for their \ntemporary permit for them to go home and get regularized, get that \nfinal stamp before they come back, and if they do have a homestead here \nwith children, they would have 2 years so that one spouse at a time \ncould go home. To me, that says we are setting the standard today. It \nwill be the standard that we ask people, if they want to have the \nprivilege of working in our country, to do; and we will ask people who \nwant the privilege 10 years from now and 25 years from now to do the \nsame, so that we send the major message, which was the problem we had \nthat created the crisis, that you cannot come to our country and stay \nillegally and eventually get regularized without ever having to apply, \naccording to the law from your home country. That is what my amendment \ndoes.\n  We do have a modification of the amendment as it applies to \nagricultural workers because we don't intend to change the sort of \ndifferent requirements for an ag worker to keep their ag worker visa \nthe same. We have modified our amendment so the basic requirements for \nagricultural workers, which is somewhat different from the restaurant \nworkers, would stay the same, but the ag workers would have the same \nrequirements that the restaurant worker has, and that is they would \nhave to go home within the 2-year period after they have signed up as \nillegal and apply from home, or have the ability, if the Secretary \ndesignates another consulate as able, to return home to the consulate \nto take that application that would be done. So we have the SAFE ID, \nwhich is going to be the basis of the worker verification system, which \nwill be a tamperproof ID that will have a picture and a biometric \nsignal that can be picked up easily by an employer. It will be an \nonline verification system so the employer can, with ease, determine \nthat the person working is eligible to work.\n  If we can do this and take the amnesty out of the bill, it is so very \nimportant that we set the standard now, so that everybody who wishes to \nhave the privilege to work in this great country will know what the \nrules are and will know that the rules are going to be enforced. That \nis the purpose of my amendment.\n  I believe if we can pass this amendment, it would add a major \ncomponent to this piece of legislation that would say not only are we \ngoing to have border security measures and this effort to end chain \nmigration, have the merit-based system, take care of the H-1Bs and \ntechnical workers we want to come in and to attract into our country, \nthat all these things would be done that are good.\n  But in addition, we are setting the standards today and into the \nfuture that if you want to work here, you come in through the system, \napplying from outside the country.\n  I hope my amendment will be able to be passed. Having the 2 years \nafter the first year would allow the process to work. Anyone who says \nwe cannot do the processing with all of the consulates that are \navailable in the countries, most of whom are going to be in Mexico or \nCentral or South America--and easily accessible--and also Canada, \nanyone who says we cannot do that over a 3-year period, I think, is \nraising a red herring.\n  I believe it is possible, if we are committed to doing it and \ncommitted to the laws of our country that would be adhered to by \neveryone who comes in.\n  We must know who is in our country. We must have a guest worker \nprogram going forward that will work and accommodate the economy that \ndoes need these work jobs that are not being filled.\n  I hope we can come to an agreement on this bill that we can all \nsupport and know that it is right for our country today and it will be \nright for our country 25 years from now and that future Congresses will \nnot look back and say: What were they thinking? Why didn't they do what \nwas right for our country? I hope we can do that, Mr. President.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to clarify where we are right \nnow. It is my understanding in the unanimous consent agreement with \nrespect to morning business that the next 15 minutes belongs to the \nRepublican side; that Senator DeMint has 10 minutes reserved of that \ntime, and then the remaining 5 minutes of that time can be accorded \nhowever the Republican side wishes to do; and that the majority leader \nis coming back on the floor at 11:30 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, 11:30.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me add for clarification, however, \nthat after 11:30 a.m., I have 5 minutes following Senator Feinstein to \ndiscuss as in morning business my amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may respond to the Senator, it is \nmy understanding that is correct; that following the majority leader, \nthen I will have 5 minutes to respond to Senator Hutchison and then she \nwill have 5 minutes to respond to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, as has been noted, I control 10 minutes of \nthe last 15 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Vitter be allowed to control the \ntime of the remaining 5 minutes on the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I think it would be a good idea that we \ncreate a national warning system to tell Americans when we decide we \nneed to do something, even if it is wrong. A few weeks ago, we decided \nwe needed to do something about immigration. A few of the Senators \nannounced on a Thursday that we had reached this delicate compromise \nand nothing could be changed from this bill. We all found out a few \ndays later that the bill had not been written yet, but over the weekend \none version was written, and by Monday, another version had been \nwritten. We were told we needed to vote on that bill by Friday.\n  This bill has been a moving target since it began. It is hard to tell \non any given day what is actually in the bill. We were able to convince \nour leadership to at least go to a second week. But when many of us \ncame down to offer our amendments, consistently there was objection to \nbringing up additional amendments. When finally the\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\noriginal bill came to its final day, there were three cloture votes \nthat failed. This bill was put down.\n  Now we have brought it back. We brought back a bill, just yesterday, \na new bill in which we have already found significant flaws the writers \ndidn't know were there. We have problems in the underlying bill, and \nyesterday we were all waiting down on the floor to get this new \namendment, this amendment that is almost as big as the original bill, \n373 pages. We were all waiting, and we received it later in the \nafternoon.\n  What actually happened was, when we asked that the amendment be read, \nwe had to recess the Senate and go finish writing the bill. But we \nfinally got the bill. It was warm from the copier, 373 pages, after a \ncouple of hours of delay.\n  When we asked that it be read so we would understand what was in it, \nwe finally got the majority leadership to agree we could have the night \nto review it, which we greatly appreciate.\n  Now we have come to the floor, got here at 10 today because we \nunderstood the majority leader was going to divide this amendment in \nthis grand clay-pigeon procedure to divide this amendment, only to find \nout the amendment is being changed, but it hasn't been written. We are \nwaiting on the floor again to get a new version of this amendment, but \nwe don't know what is going to be in it.\n  It is amazing that something so important that has been talked about \non the floor of the Senate, something we have to do, is continuously \nbeing revised and rewritten every day. Instead of stopping and getting \nthis amendment in some form we can work with, we continue to press the \nwhole process forward.\n  Some of us who are critics have been called obstructionists because \nwe don't think this process is fair or that the underlying bill is \nright for America. We have been called a lot of names, but we can't \neven get started with a fair process, and we can't start to fix it \nwith amendments if we don't even have it written yet. It is hard to \nknow what the amendments should even be if we don't see what is \nactually in the bill.\n\n  So here we are again. It is going to be offered sight unseen, just as \nyesterday, when not one Member of the Senate had read it when it was \noffered. We are going to get a new amendment, probably 400 pages today, \nthat not one Member of the Senate will have read, that we will be \nexpected to bring up and to vote on.\n  Mr. President, I wish to ask a couple unanimous consent requests. \nFirst, we need to stop this moving target and know what we are working \nwith. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order at this time to order \nthe yeas and nays on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, then maybe it would be fair to ask \nunanimous consent that after Senator Reid modifies the amendment, that \nthe modification be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is that a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DeMINT. That is a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Objection.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it is extraordinary that we are using \nSenate procedures to actually keep a 400-page amendment from being \nread.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the amendment is modified, when it \nis broken into these clay-pigeon pieces, that I be recognized to \nrequest the yeas and nays on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I am asking for votes. Let's not say later on that we are \ntrying to stop votes.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the bill, the pending amendment be temporarily set \naside and that all the filed amendments be called up en bloc and that \nthe Senate then return to the consideration of the Reid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, what I have done in these requests is to \nshow that there is no intent to let this body actually see what we are \nvoting on, which is incredible with such a complex bill; that we are \ngoing to bring up an amendment we haven't read, and when we ask that it \nbe read, that request is denied. When we ask for a vote on the \nunderlying amendment, that is denied. When we ask for the yeas and \nnays, which means you can't voice it, that means eventually we are \ngoing to get a vote on the amendment that will be offered today, that \nis denied.\n  I wish to make it clear that those of us who don't think this process \nis fair or that this bill is good for this country, that we have not \nwanted it to be voted on. But the intent is for these to be modified, \njust as they have been throughout this process. All these 26-some-odd \namendments will be modified minute by minute, hour by hour, so when we \ncome to vote on these amendments, nobody is actually going to know what \nis in them.\n  I heard Members say, it is like what we were talking about a couple \nweeks ago, but we found out this morning when we asked questions about \nthe new amendment that it isn't like what we were talking about a few \nweeks ago. In fact, there were important amendments that were passed \nthat we were told would be in this bill which have been eliminated by \nthe amendments that have been offered.\n  We can talk more about this as the process goes forward, but right \nnow I wish to reserve the remainder of my time and yield to Senator \nVitter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I truly find this process amazing. We have \nbeen told by the master crafters of this bill, who have developed this \ngrand compromise in a relatively small group, that this is a delicate \ncompromise and nothing can be allowed to upset it, certainly not \nallowing our amendments to reach the floor this week to be debated. So \nit has to stay exactly like it is.\n  For that reason, our amendments are being blocked en masse. But at \nthe same time, these crafters of the compromise are changing their bill \nevery half hour. It is a constantly moving target. Just a few days ago, \nwe were presented with a brandnew underlying bill that is 761 pages. In \naddition, yesterday we were given a huge amendment, really 26 \namendments put together, that is 373 pages. We had the audacity to ask \nthat we be allowed to read the amendment and understand it.\n  After making the clerk read the amendment out loud for some period, \nSenator Reid finally acknowledged that, yes, maybe it would be fair to \nlet us read the amendment. So we recessed for the night. Great. The \ntrouble is, that amendment is out the window. They are now working on a \nbrandnew version that they are trying to present soon. We have no idea \nwhat changes are being made to yesterday's amendment to make it today's \namendment. It is probably going to be over 373 pages. So our study last \nnight is basically for nought.\n  That process is not fair. It is patently unfair. We have the right to \nunderstand what is before the Senate. We have the right to read it. \nThat is exactly what Senator DeMint's unanimous consent requests all \nwent to. They were all shot down. They were all denied by the majority. \nI think it is a patently unfair process.\n\n  Let me ask this unanimous consent to at least allow us to digest this \nbrandnew mega amendment, and that is, when Senator Reid offers his \nmodified version of this amendment, which we expect will contain many \nchanges from yesterday, including serious and substantive changes, that \nwe have 5 hours as in morning business so that we are allowed to digest \nthe contents of this new amendment. That is the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, but \nbefore I do, I wish to respond. This is not a new bill, this so-called \n700 pages. These are amendments packaged together which are \nsubsequently divided. These are amendments which have been around for a \nsubstantial period of time. It is true some of them have been modified. \nSenator Hutchison is modifying her amendment. However, we\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\nhave had an opportunity to know that and see it and can speak to it. So \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming the remainder of my time, Mr. President, I \nthink this is amazing. We are going to be presented with a brandnew \nmega amendment fairly soon. It is going to be at least 373 pages, maybe \n400 pages, and we are not going to be allowed to read it before this \nSenate forges ahead debating and possibly voting on it.\n  I don't understand why we are not offered the opportunity to digest \nthis brandnew mega amendment. Senator Reid stood on this floor \nyesterday and acknowledged it was only right and only fair to give us \nan opportunity to digest his mega amendment yesterday. The problem is, \ncome this morning, that is out the window. There is a new mega \namendment. We have no idea what line has been changed, what paragraph \nhas been changed, what is new language, what is old language. We need a \nreasonable opportunity to independently digest that amendment, not \nsimply take other people's summaries and word for it when we are \npresented with this brandnew 400-page amendment.\n  I will be happy to yield to the majority leader on this point, \nreserving the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry, I was in a briefing with Admiral \nMcConnell. It is my understanding the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana said that minor changes have been made since he looked at the \nlegislation, which I assume he finished this morning sometime. He wants \nto take a look and see what changes have been made; is that right?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, yes, but to do that we have to read the \nwhole new mega amendment, I suggest to the majority leader. It is in \nthat vein and in that spirit that I offered the unanimous consent \nrequest, that once the new mega amendment is presented, once that \nhappens, we be in morning business for 5 hours so we may be allowed to \nread it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to that.\n  I would say to my friend, however, that we would be happy to have our \nstaff--they are relatively simple amendments, some with simple word \nchanges--that we would be happy to have our staff, with his staff, show \nwhat those changes are. There would be no need to read the whole bill. \nIf you read the whole bill, few changes have been made, and it would be \nvery apparent. So I am sure we can do that, and we can do that with \nlittle trouble.\n  It is my understanding, Mr. President, that the time for morning \nbusiness has ended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8532-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A parliamentary inquiry is not in order during \na quorum call.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue with the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving my right to object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, he can either object or not object.\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue with the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I remove my objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina thought they had 5 minutes left; is that \nright?\n  I would ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to speak, and this \nwould be for debate only. Following the using of 7 minutes, I will take \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to yield my time to other \nSenators. I will give 1 minute to Senator Vitter and 4 minutes to \nSenator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, with the majority leader on the floor, I \nwant to use my brief minute to follow up on my inquiries and \nfrustrations.\n  Very soon, we are going to be presented with a brandnew version of \nthis mega-amendment, 400 pages or whatever it is. I would like to be \nallowed some reasonable opportunity to independently study that mega-\namendment without having to depend on other people's summaries, and it \nis for that reason I made the unanimous consent request that we be in \nmorning business for 5 hours once that brandnew mega-amendment is \npresented.\n  With that explanation and background, given that the distinguished \nmajority leader recognized that right of ours yesterday, when we were \nallowed to read the old version of the amendment, I would like to make \nthat unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 1 minute.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object. I will use my own time in response \nto him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. So as not to use the time of the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. President, there have been a few changes made, but they \nare very minor. As I indicated to my friend, this is not a new mega-\namendment. This is the same amendment which was laid down last night, \nand people on both sides have had ample opportunity to read this. As I \nindicated, we would be happy to talk with him and/or his staff, with \nindividual Senators and/or their staff to indicate where the changes \nhave been made and what the purposes of those were. If that is not \nsufficient, I don't know how I can be more fair than that.\n\n  So I will now turn it over----\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No, but I just want to make sure it is still under the same \ntime agreement we had before. We add 30 seconds to the time we had \ngiven.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would suggest, through the Chair to the distinguished\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\nmajority leader, that I have a real problem with depending on basically \nthe other side's summary of these changes which are being made as we \nspeak. So I would propound a new unanimous consent request, that if we \nhave to do that, if that summary is lacking or inaccurate in any way, \nthat all subsequent votes and actions of the Senate which are agreed to \nhave no effect because we have depended on the other side's information \nand it could turn out to have been incomplete or inaccurate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, again using my time, I object to this, but \nlet me just say that it wasn't a hard piece of reasoning to come up \nwith to object to this.\n  The reason we are going through this process here is people--mostly \non the other side of the aisle because we on this side are satisfied \nwith the bill the way it was written, but mostly on the other side of \nthe aisle and some Democrats--said, OK, if you are going to do this, we \nwill do that. We are doing this to make people happy, so they have an \nopportunity to talk about this bill some more. This is a process.\n  I have really tried to be fair. I have not tried to take advantage of \nanyone. I have tried to be as candid with people who support the bill \nas those who oppose the bill, not trying to take advantage of them. The \nprocess here in the Senate wasn't invented yesterday; it has been going \non for 220 years. I am working my way through the rules, making sure we \nfollow every jot and tittle in these complicated rules, but they are \nnot that complicated. We simply want to work on an issue that is \nimportant to the American people--immigration.\n  I acknowledge, as has my friend, that the system of immigration in \nour country is broken. We need to try to fix it, and this is our way of \ntrying to fix it. Perfect? No. Good? Yes. The American people deserve \nour attention to this problem we have in our country. We have people of \ngood will, Democrats and Republicans, who are trying to do this.\n  We have this occasion, for once in recent memory, where we are \nworking with the President on this side trying to get this done. I have \nsaid publicly that I appreciate the President's advocacy on this issue. \nIf we are able to pass this bill, and I hope we can, it will be a shot \nin the arm for the system, the political system which has been so \ngenerous to our country for so many years, and I think people will look \nand say: You know, those people in Washington who are always yelling \nand screaming at each other were able to get something done.\n  The American people know that whatever we come up with here is not \ngoing to solve every problem with immigration, but they also know it \nwill solve many of the problems. The No. 1 problem it is going to solve \nthat the American people want solved is border security. This amendment \nhas $4.4 billion which will go directly to that border.\n  I am, by profession, a trial lawyer, and I know people have the \nability to be advocates, as my friend from Louisiana who is speaking--\nand I see on the floor today my friend from Alabama, whom I have told \npublicly and privately that I appreciate his advocacy. But my friend \nfrom Alabama is a lawyer, just as I am, and we should do everything we \ncan to present our case. Then, when the case is over, we walk out of \nthis shaking hands, as advocates, as Senators, and as friends. So I \nhave no resentment or ill-will toward anyone who is trying to move this \nlegislation in a way different than I am, but I think the time has come \nwhere we have to fish or cut bait, as they say.\n  I know we still have some speaking time--5 minutes has been \nallocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlabama is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know Senator Reid has assured people \nof what is in the bill, but he hasn't read what is in this amendment--\nneither has any Senator in this body, I suggest. Only a few staffers \nhave, and there have been tremendous errors made already in the \nprevious amendment they offered. And just to say there have been \nnothing but minor changes is not something I think Senators ought to \nrely on.\n  My good friend, Senator Reid, has always been courteous to me, but we \ndisagree on this issue. He said he wants to make people happy. How \nabout making the American people happy? They oppose this bill \noverwhelmingly, and yet the leadership here continues to use every \nparliamentary tactic that we have ever used, and new tactics never \nbefore used, to limit debate and move this bill to final passage. I \nobject to that.\n  I think about our former colleagues, Senator Paul Wellstone and \nSenator Helms. I wonder how they would feel if it was said: Well, this \nis unprecedented, we are going to eliminate debate, but I have talked \nto the leader on the other side, and we two leaders have just decided, \nsince it is bipartisan, we will do that.\n  Make no mistake about what is being done here, Mr. President. There \nis no dispute whatsoever. Amendments will not be allowed to be voted on \nthat the majority leader does not personally sign off on. The power to \ncontrol this process is in the majority leader's hands, and he has met \nwith a group of people who are interested in this legislation and they \nhave agreed to control this process. It has never been done like this \nbefore in the history of the Senate to eliminate these amendments. It \nis not right.\n  My colleagues, I urge you to understand this is an unprecedented \nstep. It is a step by which the leadership is creating a new tactic \nthat will eliminate the power, the ability of individual Senators to \noffer amendments and engage in debate.\n  This is a body of 100. Yes, we have leaders. They have significant \nauthority and we understand that. But that is a limited power and we \nhave always celebrated the great potential of this body that any one \nSenator can raise an objection, any one Senator can have an amendment \nvoted on.\n  I tried to offer amendments when the bill was up before. Time and \ntime again they were objected to. Other Senators objected. Why? Because \nthey were able to object to making those amendments pending. Then, when \ncloture is filed, they are not able to be voted on because they have \nnever been made pending, although they were filed.\n  This is not a small matter. I do not think our colleagues understand. \nI see Senator Specter here. He will stand by himself on an issue in \nwhich he believes. There are other Senators here who share those same \nindependent views. We do not need to go down this path. I think it is a \nbig mistake.\n  I would say this: The majority leader said the people want one thing, \nthey want border security. What do we know about this legislation? It \ndoes not give us border security. The Congressional Budget Office, our \nown analysis team, has looked at this bill and concluded in the next 20 \nyears we will have another 8.7 million people in our country illegally. \nIt will only reduce illegal immigration by 13 percent. That is what our \nown staff, under the majority leader's control, has told us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes remain to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I yield the final 2 minutes to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is the fundamental thing. I am \nflabbergasted and amazed our leaders keep telling us this bill is \nessential to have security. You have to have this amnesty. You have to \ngive up and we will have amnesty. In exchange for that, we will have a \nlegal system that will work in the future.\n  But it will not work. That is what they said in 1986. Senator \nGrassley noted on the floor, people in this body do not even say there \nwill not be another amnesty anymore, as they did in 1986, because they \nknow this bill will not create a legal system. There will be 8.7 \nmillion more people in our country illegally and the same group will be \nhere, asking for amnesty again. It is a failed system.\n  Let me add one thing. One thing I have learned in this debate, we can \nmake this immigration system lawful and we can make it work. We ought \nnot to be having a 13-percent reduction in illegality, as the \nCongressional Budget Office says. We can get to 90, 95 percent \nreduction of illegality. We can create a system of immigration that \nserves our national interests. It is within our power to do so. This \nbill will not do it. We must not go forward with it because it will not \nwork.\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1934, as Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I modify my amendment with the changes now \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment is so modified, I understand.\n  I now ask the amendment be divided as indicated at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right and the amendment \nis divided.\n  The amendment, as modified and divided, is as follows:\n\n  TITLE _--NONIMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES PREVIOUSLY IN UNLAWFUL \n                                 STATUS\n\n                      Subtitle A--Z Nonimmigrants\n\n     SEC. _00.

I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 1957 to Division I of Amendment No. 1934, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to \ndivision I.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1957 to division I to amendment No. 1934, \n     as modified.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       This section shall take effect one day after the date of \n     enactment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. REID. Let me say, very briefly----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I don't want it to go unanswered. This bill, as I mentioned \nearlier today, is different than what we did before--$4.4 billion goes \nto the border for security. It is totally different than the last bill.\n  Remember, we are at this point because we only got seven Republican \nvotes in the prior vote. Now we have worked together. I was told there \nwere a lot of people on the Republican side, if they had the \nopportunity to have more amendments, would vote with us. I am confident \nthat will happen. This has worked out extremely well.\n  I would say, our work on comprehensive immigration reform has been \npretty significant. Due to the man to my right, and Senator Leahy, who \nis not here, and Senator Kennedy, we have had 36 hearings on \nimmigration since 9/11. That is a lot of hearings. We have had 6 full \ndays of committee action. We have had 59 committee amendments. We have \nhad 21 days of Senate debate since 2006--21 days, not hours. We have \nhad 92 floor amendments. We have worked this thing hard. This is a bill \npeople should fully understand.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding there is now a unanimous \nconsent in effect that there will be 10 minutes of debate on the first \namendment, is that true, equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is not presently \nunder a time limit. However, the Senator from Texas is guaranteed 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. And the Senator from California also 5 minutes?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask I be granted 5 minutes, following the Senator \nfrom Texas, to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I object because the agreement was \nthat Senator Feinstein would speak before me, after which I would have \n5 minutes to respond. She would have 5 minutes, I would have 5 minutes \nto respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that arrangement?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Reserving the right to object, is it my understanding we \nwill be in morning business or on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are currently on the measure.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask I be included in the time.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the Senator require?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for 5 minutes under the same time \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. And for any purposes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, shall I proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I worked with the Senator from Texas, \nnow, 10 years up close. I do not like to oppose her amendment, but in \nthis case I believe I must. This is an issue we debated in many \nconversations during the process of drafting this legislation.\n  I was opposed to the touchback idea and I am skeptical about it now. \nHowever, in the spirit of compromise, we went forward with the \ntouchback that we have in the base bill, specifically in title VI. We \nincluded some important safeguards to make sure it is workable.\n  This amendment from the distinguished Senator from Texas actually \ndoes away with this by creating a touchback requirement before people \nget their full Z visa. What immigrant is going to show up and register \nfor a program if he has to take his chances on leaving the country and \ncoming back in before he gets some kind of immigration status? What \nimmigrant is going to report to deport?\n  I wager that many, if not most, will simply stay underground and try \nto keep their heads down for as long as possible. They have built lives \nhere, they have families, they own homes, and they have jobs they want \nto keep. Very few undocumented immigrants are going to show up for a \nprogram that offers no certainty they will actually be able to legalize \ntheir status.\n  What this amendment does is essentially front load the requirement \nthat makes the program unworkable from both an agency and an applicant \nperspective. Requiring consular officers to steal themselves for a \nflood of applications, 8 to 10 years down the line, is one thing. \nRequiring them to gear up for adjudication of this in-person \napplication in the next 2 years following registration is a very \ndifferent story.\n  I hope the body will defeat the amendment. Those of us--Senator Craig \nand I and others--who have worked on the AgJOBS program believe that \nthe agriculture jobs program is the way to go. It is negotiated by \nfarmers, by unions, by growers, and it has a specific requirement.\n  I know the Senator does not touch this specific requirement, but the \nmain problem with the amendment is requiring this touchback so soon, \nbefore people have acquired any kind of legal status. They register and \nthen in 2 years, they would have to go and perform this touchback.\n  We believe it strikes at the heart of the bill and urge a ``no'' \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I, like my colleague from California, \ndo not remember being on opposite sides on an issue such as this \nbefore. But she has brought up a key point that I think it is important \nfor us to address. She says, What immigrant is going to report to \ndeport? What she is asking is, what is the incentive of an illegal \nimmigrant to come forward and say they are illegal and they want to get \nright with the process to become legal? That is a very important \nquestion that many people in our country have asked. Who is going to do \nthat?\n  Here is the incentive. First, the secure ID that is provided in the \namendment allows exit and reentry. It is a tamperproof ID already, and \nit does allow the exit to finalize the Z, or Z-A status, and it allows \nthe reentry.\n  The secure card is issued first. It is temporary until it is \nfinalized because\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\nthe final point that is required is that you return home to apply. That \nis the standardization we must achieve if we are going to avoid the \namnesty that would say: Our laws mean nothing. If you come here \nillegally, eventually you will be able to be regularized without ever \ngoing home.\n  We want to change that whole impression that anyone might have by \nsaying we are going to start today with a process that will apply to \nevery work-eligible adult, and that is you get your secure ID and you \nhave 1 year to do it. Then you must finalize the process outside the \ncountry, as everyone will have to, going into the future.\n  The question is still there: So why wouldn't they stay here and be \nillegal? Why wouldn't they keep their families and their homes? Here is \nwhy. Because when the 3 years is up and the trigger is pulled, because \nthe border security measures have gone into effect--you have the 1 year \nfor people to come forward, say they are illegal, after which they will \nget their tamperproof card and they must have the ``go home'' provision \nthen stamped outside the country and they have 2 years to do it. You \nhave 3 years there.\n  After that 3 years, there is going to be an employer verification \nsystem that is going to work. So these people will not be able to go \nback to their jobs if they have not completed the process. That is the \nincentive. That is why they will report. That is why they will become \nlegal in the system, because with the employer verification that is a \nkey part of this bill, they will have to have that tamperproof ID \nstamped that they have been home to apply from outside the country \nbefore they come back in and become regularized and are job eligible.\n  This is going to be the key. The employer verification system will \nassure that they will not get jobs in this country without that visa \nthat is tamperproof and shows they have been home to do it. It can be \ndone because there is a 3-year period and there will be a constant \nprocess to get the people who are illegal working. They will be able to \ngo to the American consulate in their home country. The Secretary can \nallow exceptions to that for farm workers, if they cannot go home to a \nfaraway place.\n  This is the amendment that will take the amnesty out of this bill and \nsay: Today's standards will be enforced and they will be enforced \ntomorrow. With this amendment, we can take the amnesty out of this bill \nand we will have an employer verification system that will assure the \nincentive is there for people to come forward and know that the law \nwill be enforced.\n  If we do this, you will not be able to hear people say: There is \namnesty in this bill. If my amendment is not passed, then the amnesty \ntag that has been put on this bill will remain. It is the key issue in \nthe bill for the American people. It is the key issue for the \nregularization of the 12 million people who are here, and then we will \nhave a guest worker program for new people coming in in the future that \nwill also work with the border security that is established in this \nbill.\n  In my opinion, my amendment will make this bill a fully operational \nbill, because we will then have border security, a tamperproof ID, we \nwill deal with the 12 million, without amnesty but with a \nregularization process, and it will strengthen the bill for the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, because of the various activities here on \nthe floor, the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from \nLouisiana did not have an opportunity to speak on this amendment. I \nwould be happy to propound a unanimous consent request that they both \nbe allowed to speak for up to 5 minutes each for debate only.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. Either object or don't object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Parliamentary inquiry: Do I not have the right to reserve \nthe right to object? How many rules are we going to change?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The reservation of objection occurs only with \nthe suffrage of the Senate. There is no right to reserve the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. DeMINT. There are not many rights. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin).

Mr. President, we are now on division II, which is the \namendment offered by Senator Webb, as I understand it.\n  Mr. President, I would like to have everyone have the opportunity to \ndebate this amendment to their heart's content. What I would like to do \nis ask that we have an hour of time on this admendment equally divided \nbetween the proponents and opponents of this admendment, and the \ndebate, of course, would be on this amendment. So I ask unanimous \nconsent that there be an hour of debate on this amendment. As I have \nindicated, Mr. President, it would be for debate only on this \namendment. And I ask that because it is his amendment Senator Webb, \neven though he has had an opportunity earlier to speak, would be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes to start this debate of the 1 \nhour that I have proposed. So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to debate this amendment--it will be for debate only--that of \nthe half hour on the majority side, 10 minutes of that be for Senator \nWebb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving my right to object, I would like \nto ask that my full rights as a Senator be protected with a unanimous \nconsent request also.\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there an objection to my request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order is demanded.\n  Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Mr. VITTER. There is objection. I would like to propose an \nalternative unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the present proposal is inadequate, I \nwould be happy to yield for 1 minute to my friend from Louisiana, and I \nwill get the floor when he completes his statement.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Majority Leader.\n  As the majority leader knows, several of us have been continually \nfrustrated about our ability to exercise our rights on the floor of the \nSenate as duly elected officials. All of our amendments have been shut \nout. We have not had the opportunity to read this new mega-amendment. \nThe last vote occurred with one copy of that division being at the \ndesk, no copies being on the floor of the Senate.\n  I would like to protect my rights as an individual Senator and, \ntherefore, I would like to propose a modified UC request incorporating \nthe Senator's suggestions, but offering me 5 minutes within that 1-hour \nperiod for any purpose whatsoever.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the good faith of my friend, \nbut we cannot do that. I cannot do that. I would have to object to \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to give him whatever amount of time he \nwishes to debate this amendment. Of course, as he knows, it would be \nfor debate only. He could talk about anything he cared to, but it would \nbe for debate only--5 minutes, 10 minutes, whatever he feels \nappropriate, within reason, I would be happy to do that.\n  Mr. President, I say to everyone here----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--\n  Mr. REID. As I have said before, I want everyone to have the \nopportunity to speak. I nor the managers of this legislation are trying \nto stop people from talking. We have certain rules. They need to be \nfollowed, and that is what we are trying to do. So I repeat, I would \nhave no problem with my friend from Louisiana speaking for whatever \ntime he wishes, for debate only, on this amendment. I think that is a \nreasonable proposal. I would be happy to consider that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, does my friend from Louisiana--I thought I \nheard his voice. Oh, Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is the proposal--\n  Mr. REID. I may have the State wrong, but I had the voice right.\n  Mr. President, I would be happy to yield for a question to my \nfriend--for not a long question--a couple minutes, if he needs that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have a brief question. I thank the \nmajority leader for his courtesy. I had asked, in exchange for agreeing \nto a process that kept us from working this past weekend, that I would \nhave 2 hours in the debate today set aside. It is in the agreement. But \nI am hearing that people want to push that into the wee hours of the \nnight, if not into the morning.\n  I ask that I have a substantial portion of that before the afternoon \nis over. What is the status of that negotiation and discussion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what I would say to my friend--and I know he \nhas a lot to say; he has said a lot of things, and I am anxious to hear \nmore--but we would like to be able to dispose of some of these \namendments. I would consider if he would like to talk for an hour now--\nand then I would get the floor after he completes his statement--and it \nwould be for debate only. He can divide the time any way he wants. That \nis my proposal.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, here is what we are going to do. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Pennsylvania be recognized to \nmake a motion in relation to the Webb amendment.\n  Following that, I ask unanimous consent that when the vote is \ncompleted, Senator Sessions be recognized to speak in morning business \nuntil 2:30. He can allocate that time after the vote is concluded until \n2:30 any way he sees fit. So I ask unanimous consent. I think it is \nclear that the time we are spending in morning business be for debate \nonly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. The final thing: We understand the desire of the Senator \nfrom Alabama to be heard. He has, under the terms of the agreement that \nis already in effect, 2 hours of time. We ask that the time which is \ngoing to be used now be counted against the 2 hours he has under the \nprevious order before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. The only thing I left out is that at 2:30, when Senator \nSessions finishes his remarks, that I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friends, would it be permissible \nthat my friend from Virginia be recognized for 1 minute prior to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Before he makes his motion to table.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to ask if my rights on the Senate floor can also be protected in \nthat unanimous consent.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Sessions can do whatever he wants in relation to \nyou because it is for debate only, anyway.\n  Mr. VITTER. That is not really responding to my request. Again, \nreserving the right to object, I ask the distinguished majority leader \nwhether my rights as a Senator can also be protected in that unanimous \nconsent request regarding Senator Webb's time by allowing me 1 minute \non the floor for any purpose.\n  Mr. REID. It would have to be for debate only, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. VITTER. Then I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to table the Webb amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton) \nand the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, the process has \nnot been a pretty one to date. It has been particularly ugly in the \nlast few hours in that we had an amendment yesterday of nearly 400 \npages. The people who wrote it apparently found that they made numerous \nerrors which even they were not happy with. They filed another \namendment which our Senators don't have a copy of, I don't think even \nto this moment. At least an hour ago, Senator DeMint was asking for a \ncopy of the amendment so people could see it and actually read what is \nto be voted on. It is not good, on a matter that almost every American \nis watching, a matter that is important to our country, to stumble and \nbumble into this process, and part of the reason, as my good friend and \nformer chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Arlen Specter, said, it \nwould have been better probably had we gone through the committee \nprocess. When he was chairman of the committee, it did go through the \ncommittee process. It didn't do a lot of good, but at least it was \nlooked at in some of the areas that are inevitably fixed when we go \nthrough that kind of process. So I am worried about this process.\n  The procedure the majority leader has chosen, and he says he has \nsupport of some kind from the Republican leadership side--I assume he \ndoes--he has chosen to utilize a procedure never before used in this \nSenate. That procedure will allow the majority leader, Senator Reid, to \nhave the power to approve every amendment that will be offered to this \nlegislation. If it is not part of his clay pigeon, you are not in. If \nsome other amendment is offered and accepted, it is because he decided \nit is appropriate. He could well accept amendments that he knows are \ngoing to fail. He could well accept amendments that he doesn't mind \npassing. But he picks the amendments. That has never happened in the \nhistory of the Senate, never happened in this fashion before.\n  We must not allow that procedure to happen now. There will be \nopportunities for us, before this process is over, to execute votes \nthat will demonstrate we don't accept this process, and it should be a \nbig part of any Senator's vote as we go forward with this process.\n  Mr. President, I have to say to my colleagues, as I indicated to the \nmajority leader earlier, what would Paul Wellstone say, that great \nliberal advocate, a Senator who enjoyed standing alone, or Senator \nJesse Helms, that great conservative who enjoyed standing alone, both \ndoing what they believed was right, something we take great pride in as \nan institution.\n  We do not have a lot of power here, but if you don't agree to \nunanimous consent requests and you are consistent in your advocacy of \npositions you deeply believe in, you can get a vote. Under this \nprocedure you do not get a vote. I offered amendment after amendment \nbefore when this bill was before the Senate. As a result, the \nleadership on the other side objected. I could not get those amendments \npending, and that leaves us unable to get a final vote postcloture.\n  I am not exaggerating. It has never been done before. It allows the \nmajority leader, under the procedure that is being used today, to \ncompletely approve or disapprove of whether an amendment gets voted on. \nSo I object to that process. It is not right. We should not be doing \nit, and we shouldn't be doing it on a bill that is 750 pages with a \n300- or 400-page amendment that goes to some issues that are important \nto America.\n  Let me share with my colleagues my concerns about this legislation. I \nwill try to summarize it and go right to the point.\n  Senator Reid, the President, the President's Cabinet members, leaders \nof the coalition, this grand bargain group--I call them affectionately \nthe masters of the universe--they all tell us this bill is going to fix \nillegality, and if we don't vote for this legislation, somehow legality \nwill not happen. A group of us have written to the President asking him \nto utilize 13 special powers he already has under law that will \ndramatically reduce illegality in immigration. We have not heard from \nhim.\n  We could do additional legislation that would help enforcement. I \nbelieve that is so. But the bill will not stop illegal immigration and, \nin fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office, June 4, they \nrendered their report and\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\nthey concluded that instead of 10 million people coming into the \ncountry illegally as they project under current law, 8.7 million people \nwould be entering our country illegally.\n  What kind of legislation is this? We have been promised it is going \nto stop illegality and it only reduces illegality by 13 percent, a \nfundamental failure, a fundamental misrepresentation to the American \npeople about what this bill will do. It is shocking.\n  This chart shows that situation. The blue, according to the CBO score \nover 20 years, the blue shows that 10 million people would be coming \ninto our country at the current rate over the next 20 years. If we pass \nthe bill, the red will occur, 8.7 million people.\n  Every Senator ought to know what our own Congressional Budget Office \nhas reported. Every Senator who is aware of that cannot go home to \ntheir constituents and say: I voted for comprehensive immigration \nreform to make sure we create a legal system in the future. How can you \ndo that? This can't be done. It is an important issue.\n  The legislation would double legal immigration. I don't think that is \nwhat the American people want or expect. The blue represents current \nlaw. The red represents the new bill--and it could be more--and the \nnumber of legal permanent resident statuses, the green cards, will \ndouble in the next 20 years under this legislation.\n  I think most people thought we were going to do something to get \ncontrol of immigration and reduce illegality and reevaluate the numbers \nwho come. Certainly, they don't think we are doubling legal \nimmigration. We also know there are high costs involved. According to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, our study we got back a couple weeks \nago, in 10 years this legislation will cost the taxpayers of America in \nwelfare and social benefits $30 billion--this is their number; I didn't \nmake this up--$30 billion. They have been saying this is going to bring \nin more tax revenue, we are going to legalize people, and they are \ngoing to pay taxes. Wrong. It is not going to happen. It is not so. I \nwish it were so. I wish I could tell my colleagues that the numbers \nshow when this amnesty occurs, everybody is going to pay a lot of taxes \nand it will help balance our budget. Wrong. It is not going to happen \nthat way. It will cost $30 billion in the first 10 years, and our own \nCongressional Budget Office says it will be dramatically greater in the \nnext 10 years and increase as the years go by.\n\n  It is going to increase the cost to the Treasury and, in fact, let me \nshare with you what the highly regarded Heritage Foundation study \nfound. Robert Rector, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, the \narchitect of welfare reform for our country, has been alarmed at the \ncost of this bill. I am not talking about the cost of Border Patrol \nagents and barriers and those kinds of items. I am talking about the \ncost of providing all the social benefits we give to American citizens, \nto people who came into our country illegally, what it will cost in \nterms of tax credits, Medicaid, welfare, food stamps and the like. If \nthey are all made legal permanent residents, Z card holders, even the \ntemporary visas, they will be entitled to virtually all of these \nprograms.\n  According to Mr. Rector, over the lifetime retirement years of the 12 \nmillion who would be given amnesty under this provision, it will cost \nthe taxpayers of America--hold your hat--$2.6 trillion; over $2 \ntrillion. It is a stunning figure. It is a figure so large that we \nalmost can't comprehend it or think about it. But anybody who tells you \nthat somehow legalizing the people who are here illegally and providing \nthem with every benefit we provide to American citizens is somehow \ngoing to add revenue to our Treasury cannot be correct. CBO says no. \nThey say it will be even worse in the outyears. And the Heritage \nFoundation has calculated the outyears to be over $2 trillion. This is \na stunning figure.\n  I submit that by passing this law, we will provide a path to \ncitizenship for people, for even those people who broke into our \ncountry last December 31, running past the National Guard the President \ncalled out. If you could get past the National Guard last December, you \nwill be given amnesty under this bill and be placed on a full path to \nall these benefits and citizenship.\n  They have been saying we have to help people who have been here for \nyears and have children and deep roots. I am willing to discuss that \nsituation. I don't believe we can ask everybody to leave this country \nwho came here years ago, who have children and roots and are dug in. I \nam not prepared to ask them to leave--I really am not--and I have said \nthat publicly for some time. But Senator Webb just had an amendment \nthat said if you came here in the last 4 years after we had been \ntalking about this issue, after we have called out the National Guard \nand made clear we want to do something about it, you don't get on this \npath, you haven't been here long enough to entitle you to be given \namnesty. It was voted down by a substantial vote a few moments ago. His \namendment was tabled. It is no longer on the agenda. It will not become \nlaw. The current law, what is in the bill, provides amnesty to people \nwho came in last December.\n  I have talked about, and we have had hearings that I think \ndemonstrate with absolute clarity, this incredibly large flow of \nimmigration into America today is, in fact, depressing wages of \nAmerican workers. Oh, yesterday, we had this great union debate that we \nare going to eliminate the secret ballot so people will be forced into \nunions. My Democratic colleagues had charts showing wages haven't gone \nup in the last few years. And I am inclined to agree because that is \nwhat the experts told us on the immigration question. They told us that \nwages have not gone up--not because of some oppressive businessperson \nbut because we have allowed millions of people to come into our country \nto take jobs at lower wages that Americans ought to be paid to do. \nThose are just the facts.\n\n  Professor Borjas of Harvard, himself a Cuban immigrant, at the \nKennedy School--and I suggested Senator Kennedy perhaps should walk \nover there to Harvard from his Boston home and talk to Professor \nBorjas. Professor Borjas concludes that for people in this country \nwithout certain education levels, their wages from 1980 to 2000 have \nbeen depressed 8.2 percent.\n  Anecdotally, I would just note that when I left the Chamber here last \nFriday, there was a gentleman out here on the street--had gray hair and \na gray beard, with a little sign about jobs--and I talked to him. He \nsaid he was a master carpenter in Florida and he used to make as much \nas $75,000 a year--which is not too much money for a master carpenter, \nin my opinion--but he can hardly make a living today because of an \nincredible influx of cheap labor that has pulled down the value of his \nlabor.\n  When I raised this with Senator Kennedy last year in our debate, he \nsaid: Well, we are going to raise the minimum wage. Well, how much are \nwe going to raise it? We are going to raise it to $7 an hour. That is \nnot good enough. We want people to make $15 an hour, $20 an hour.\n  If you want to know why wages haven't gone up for working Americans, \nask Professor Borjas at Harvard; Professor Chiswick at the University \nof Chicago; Alan Tonelson, an expert; and one of the other professors \nwe had actually--I think he was with the Chamber of Commerce group, and \nhe admitted it. The Secretary of Treasury just recently admitted he was \nconcerned about the fact that wage earners were not keeping up with the \ngrowth in the economy. That is my opinion. If somebody wants to dispute \nit, so be it.\n  I don't think this legislation in any way provides for assimilation \nto the degree we would like to see it in accordance with our great \nAmerican heritage of assimilation.\n  So I think the fundamental issue in this entire debate, the issue \nthat goes to the heart of the question, is whether this Congress and \nthis President really intend to keep the promises they are making. \nIsn't that the real question? Because in 1986, they spun a beautiful \nsong: one-time amnesty, and we will have law enforcement next.\n  I ask: Does this bill do what the supporters claim it will? \nFundamentally, will it work? Will it secure the border? Senator Reid, \njust a few moments ago, said what the American people want--they want \nour borders secure. Well, will it do that? Will it enable us to enforce \nthe law in an effective, diligent, and consistent way that breeds \nrespect for law? Will it clearly reward right behavior and firmly \npenalize bad behavior? Will it encourage immigration by lawful means, a \nmeans that serves our\n\n[[Page S8575]]\n\nnational interest and not special interests, or will it continue to \nencourage illegal immigration? Are we just drifting through, once \nagain, a charade, a predictable cycle where every few decades amnesty \nis rewarded to lawbreakers and enforcement never follows? Would that \nnot be a tragedy?\n  This Senator has no intention and will not vote for and will oppose \nin every way he can--and others share this view--a bill that is going \nto be like 1986, that will fail again. When this cycle occurs again, as \nI predict it will if this legislation passes, those who ignore our laws \nwill be rewarded; those who dutifully comply will consider themselves \nto be chumps for going through that process.\n  In recent days, I have had three people who have entered our country \nlegally, done it correctly, come to me and tell me: Senator, stand in \nthere; we support you. We did it the right way. We don't appreciate \nthese people doing it differently.\n  There was a good article in the Montgomery Advertiser about a lady \nnamed Singh--I assume she is of Indian ancestry--who spent several \nyears, hired a good lawyer, spent $4,250, and eventually got her \ncitizenship, for which she was most proud. She was absolutely crystal \nclear that she did not appreciate it that other people came into our \ncountry illegally and would get the same privileges she got that she \nhad to work hard for doing it the correct way. I think there is a moral \norder here that we need to respect. Repeated amnesties erode a moral \napproach to the law of this country.\n  In the past 2 months, we have heard other Senators and the President \nmake promises that this is going to work. The political elite have all \nsaid to our top magazines and newspapers that they promise real \nenforcement will begin following the passage of this bill. They promise \nthis bill will decrease illegal immigration, it will secure the border, \nand reform our legal immigration system to better serve the national \ninterests. That is a great promise. If that is what this bill did, I \nwould be for it. In fact, I was quoted in the paper several times this \nspring when I heard the masters of the universe, our friends who tried \nto write this bill, promise those very principles. I said that those \nare principles that are getting close to something I can support. I am \nreally interested in it. But as I read it and studied it, I became more \nand more discouraged, and as independent critics and other experts \nexamined it, they indicated the same.\n  So will the promises be fulfilled? That is a question I would like to \ndiscuss today. Remember this: Even in 1986, President Reagan was the \nPresident, and he was a law-and-order man, and when the bill passed in \n1986, what did he emphasize? Did he emphasize the amnesty they granted? \nNo, because people were dubious about that. He emphasized the future \nlaw enforcement--and this is so familiar today--and he said:\n\n       It is high time we regained control of our borders, and \n     Senator Alan Simpson's bill will do this.\n\n  Well, President Reagan was wrong. We had 3 million people here \nillegally then. Now we are talking about providing amnesty to 12 \nmillion, maybe 20 million. It didn't work. Nobody had the Congressional \nBudget Office score at that time, our own Congressional Budget Office \nwhich tells us this bill won't work and we are going to have another \n8.7 million people enter our country in the next 20 years.\n  At least we have been warned this time. Why shouldn't that cause us \nto pause? Why shouldn't that cause us to give a decent respect to the \nopinions of our own constituents who strongly oppose the bill and have \ngreat doubts about it? Why don't we pull back, rethink it, and begin to \ndo what one of the pollsters suggested the American people are saying, \nwhich is take some smaller steps incrementally, emphasizing \nenforcement? That is what I would suggest we should do.\n\n  I would like to make this point. Even if President Bush--who has done \nsome things in recent years that are better than we have had done in a \nnumber of years but still isn't using all the powers of his office--\neven if he kept the promises he is making, he is not going to be in the \nWhite House after another 18 months. Somebody else is going to be \nthere. There will be a new Congress here. So the test is really going \nto be when these trigger events are met, and that will be in 2009 when \nwe will have a new President in office.\n  Now, let's think about this: Some of the Democratic candidates \nalready oppose the core components of the bill, such as the merit-based \nsystem, like Canada's. Governor Richardson and Senator Obama--if they \nwin the Presidency, are we going to assume they will fulfill the \npromises made by this administration? It won't be their priority.\n  Let us talk in a little more detail about this No. 1 issue which is \nso critical: Will we secure the border, and is this legislation going \nto help?\n  The bill proponents all make the same claims--that without this bill, \nthe border cannot be secured. But if we pass the bill, they say, we \nwill secure the border. Essentially, they are claiming that enforcement \ncan't be done unless we get amnesty and enforcement. They also claim to \nbe adding 18,000 Border Patrol officers, increasing the detention \nbedspace, and expanding fencing. Now, you have heard that said. Of \ncourse, I want to remind everyone we passed a law which already \nrequires that last year. In my view, that is not contingent on this \nbill being passed. And I will go into that in some detail.\n  In its first articulated principle about the immigration legislation, \nthe White House PowerPoint that was shown to Senators this spring--and \nthat was intriguing to those of us who have been concerned about \ncreating a lawful system of immigration--the PowerPoint promised ``to \nsecure U.S. borders'' and ``not to repeat the 1986 failure.''\n  Senator Kennedy, at the famous press conference just about a month \nago, said this:\n\n       The agreement we have reached is the best possible chance \n     we will have in years to secure our borders.\n\n  Best chance in years.\n\n       In this legislation, we are doubling the border patrol, we \n     are increasing detention space.\n\n  Senator McCain said this:\n\n       This legislation will finally accomplish the extraordinary \n     goal of security at our borders.\n\n  Another Senator:\n\n       I am delighted we are going to secure the border.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       It will make sure our borders become secure. We have had \n     broken borders in this country for 20 years. It is time to \n     get them fixed. This bill will do that.\n\n  Another:\n\n       What happens if we fail? Our borders continue to be broken \n     at a time when we need to secure our country.\n\n  That is what they all said. Oh, gosh. Well, let's talk about it. They \nsaid: Well, we started out in this legislation with 18,000 additional \nBorder Patrol officers; we will increase detention capacity to 27,500 \nbeds; and another one--this is former Governor Jed Bush and Ken \nMelman--``It doubles the border patrol and expands the border fence.'' \nThat is what they said in their May 31 Wall Street Journal Open Borders \neditorial. It doubles the Border Patrol and expands the border fence.\n  Maybe these people think this. All right. Let's see if we can get \nthis straight. Before we address whether this bill actually will secure \nthe border, it is important to clarify for the record that the bill \ndoes not require a doubling of the Border Patrol, it does not require \nmore bed space than required by current law, and it does not require \nmore fence than current law requires. If anybody doesn't agree with \nthat, come on down and show me that I am wrong. This is a promotion.\n  What about agents? The bill does not add 18,000 Border Patrol agents, \nSenators. When these statements were made, the trigger only required \nthat a total of 18,000 Border Patrol agents be hired.\n  Since then, Senator Judd Gregg got the number up to 20,000. I think \nwe have that. So we are close to that number now. We are close to \n18,000 now and are already on track to have that number hired by the \nend of 2008, so no more Border Patrol agents are required to be hired \nunder this bill's enforcement trigger than current law requires. Those \nof you who want to see enforcement are not being given anything on \nBorder Patrol officers.\n  What the bill does do for agents outside the trigger is add 6,000 to \nthe total authorized level by requiring 2,400 agents to be hired in \n2011, and again in\n\n[[Page S8576]]\n\n2012, and increasing the numbers that are supposed to be hired in 2008, \n2009, 2010, from 2,000 to 2,400 per year. In other words, we are \nalready projected to hire 2,000; they say we will add 2,400 a year.\n  Current law authorization only went through 2010 at 2,000 a year, so \nthis bill does increase the authorization by about 30 percent. But it \ncertainly does not require an actual doubling of the Border Patrol, and \na 30-percent increase is not in the trigger. The reason that is \nimportant is, if it is not required as part of the trigger that kicks \noff the amnesty and the permanent residence, then appropriators in the \nfuture are not likely to do it. I can give you a string of examples of \nus authorizing Border Patrol, authorizing fencing, and never coming up \nwith the money to fund it.\n  What about bedspace? What is inside the trigger? The claim the bill \nincreases the detention bedspace is factually false. The bill does \nnothing more than current law. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nAct of 2004 requires that 43,000 beds be in place by the end of this \nyear. In 2004 we require 43,000 bedspaces by the end of 2007. The \nenforcement trigger contained in this bill, though it improved a bit \nafter the Gregg amendment, still only requires 31,500 beds. It really \nweakens the number.\n  What about bedspace outside the trigger? Even with the bill's latest \nsection on bedspace found outside the trigger, which requires the \neventual addition of 20,000 beds, the bill still only gets to 38,000 \nbeds, still below current law. So that is a problem.\n  Let me mention the fencing. We hear so much about that. The claim \nthat the bill expands the border fence is also not true. The trigger \nrequires only the building of 370 miles of fencing. Listen to me now. \nThe trigger--the thing that was set up to make sure it happened, \nknowing how in the outyears things never get funded and seldom get \nfunded and are unlikely to get funded, we were trying to mandate that \nwith the trigger--it only requires 370 miles of fencing. Current law \nsince last year's enactment of the Secure Fence Act of 2006 requires \nthe construction of 700 miles of fencing along the southern border.\n  In a recent column published in the National Review, Deroy Murdock \nasked:\n\n       Americans who want secure borders wonder why the 700-mile \n     southern frontier fence Congress authorized last year, of \n     which only 12 miles have been built to date, stretches only \n     370 miles.\n\n  All I am saying to my colleagues is, we in the Senate have been \naround here a long time. We have heard how these things go, and we know \na song and dance when we see one. But if you read the bill carefully \nyou will conclude that the promises, though promises that sound so \ngood, are not reality. They were absolutely headed to a failure, just \nlike the Congressional Budget Office said, of almost as much illegality \nin immigration in the next 20 years as we had in the last 20 years--\nonly a 13-percent reduction. It is just not sufficient.\n  I see my colleague from Texas, Senator John Cornyn, one of our most \nable Members, who is exceedingly knowledgeable about this issue. He is \na member of the Judiciary Committee. Of course, he was a former \nattorney general in Texas and a member of the Texas Supreme Court. I \nvalue his judgment. Out of the time left to me, I will yield--how much \ntime would the Senator request? First, let me ask how much time is \nleft?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 40 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I almost hesitate to talk after those kind \ncomments from my colleague from Alabama. I am afraid anything I might \nsay would be a disappointment. But let me try.\n  This immigration bill is leaving all of us with a sense of deja vu. \nThat is the sense that we have been here before. Strangely, not much \nhas changed. Once again we see that this process ignores the request, \nthe stated desire of many of us, to have an open and transparent \ndebate, an opportunity to offer amendments and to have votes on those \namendments. As a matter of fact, I understand the condition upon which \nsome of us are even being allowed to speak now is that we just debate, \nand we not even be so presumptuous as to seek to offer a unanimous \nconsent request for amendments. This is a bizarre process.\n  As we have seen so far, we started off rather inauspiciously, where \nbecause of constraints being placed on Senators, denying them the \nrights they have--Senators, I thought, had--and the responsibility that \neach of us has on behalf of our constituents to try to improve this \nlegislation, to debate it--because we have been denied those basic \nrights of a United States Senator, we find ourselves in a strange \nposition now. We have motions to table being offered. I don't know \nwhether all 26 or so of the amendments contained in this so-called clay \npigeon device, this arcane procedural device used to usurp the \nauthority and the rights of Senators in order to railroad this bill \nthrough the floor--whether we are going to see all of these amendments \ntabled; in other words, without debate, without an up-or-down vote on \nthe amendments and with the American people scratching their heads \nand wondering what in the world is going on.\n\n  How much more out of touch can people inside the Capitol be than they \nare now? We continue to see a bizarre process going forward. Last night \nwe received a 373-page, so-called clay pigeon amendment. This is the \nbundle of the 26 amendments that had been preapproved, screened, \ncherry-picked by the select few behind closed doors. You know what. We \ngot that, the Members of the United States Senate and our staffs, after \na special interest group had already posted it on their Web site. That \nis right. U.S. Senators and their staffs got a copy of this 373-page \nmonstrosity, which nobody had a chance to read--we got it after a \nspecial interest group that had been participating in these closed-door \nnegotiations got it and put it on their Web site.\n  Today, we are told: No, that is a work in progress. We are not yet \nthrough. Today we get a new 400-page version of the same package of \namendments. I understand it is at the desk, but so far as I know, we \nhave not yet received a copy of it. We have not had time, obviously, to \nreview it and know what is in it. But that does not deter those \nproponents of this legislation on the floor who are going to keep \ncharging ahead, regardless of our request to actually read the \nlegislation, to understand what is in it, to offer amendments to \nimprove it and to debate its contents. That is what I thought I was \nelected to do on behalf of my constituents when I came to the Senate.\n  I have to tell you, I think this all bodes very poorly for the \nlikelihood that we are going to successfully accomplish true \nimmigration reform and border security as a result of this legislation. \nI think we are heading toward a cloture vote tomorrow where it is \nlooking increasingly like we are not going to be able to get the job \ndone. I think it is a product, in large part, of secret negotiations.\n  I have to correct my comments. I just got the 400-page monstrosity \nknown as the revised clay pigeon amendment. I look forward to reading \nit, hopefully, before the next vote is scheduled on the contents of \nthis monstrosity.\n  As I was saying, by secretly negotiating this legislation, skipping \nthe committee process, and then pushing it through the Senate without \npeople having an adequate time to read it, we risk passing legislation \nwhich clearly is not thought out and which Members have not had \nsufficient time to review or to study in any detail, particularly \nbecause the language keeps changing, it seems, almost daily. This may, \nin the end--and this is the most important part--it may, in the end, do \nmore harm than good.\n  For example, written into this legislation are provisions that will \ndirectly result in an increased likelihood that dangerous persons will \nget at least a probationary legal status that confers upon them a \nvariety of rights and privileges that I do not think, on further \nreflection, we would want these people to have. These problems could be \nfixed if we had a rational process of debate and offering amendments \nand an opportunity to vote on those amendments but, without committee\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\nreview, without ample time to have that kind of debate and vote on \namendments, there is really no hope to correct these flawed provisions.\n  I have spoken before about the type of amendments which I personally \nbelieve would improve this legislation. I want to talk about them. I \nunderstand I am constrained by an agreement that I not bring up these \namendments, so I am not going to do that now. I may do it later and see \nif attitudes have changed, but I do want to talk about six of the most \nimportant amendments which I believe could and should be added. These \nare only six of the amendments that I personally think would make this \nbill better. I know my colleagues have other good ideas on how to \nimprove this legislation.\n  We are going to be living with this legislation for many years to \ncome--decades. We find ourselves now, 20 years later, living with the \nconsequences of unenforceable legislation that was passed in 1986. So I \nthink greater care needs to be taken.\n  One amendment I would offer would prevent criminal aliens from \ngetting an enforcement holiday by authorizing them to delay, and even \npossibly avoid, deportation by filing frivolous applications for legal \nstatus as well as appeals from the denial. That is right. It would \nprevent them from getting virtual impunity, even though they filed a \nfrivolous application for legalization, as well as multiple appeals.\n  Another amendment I would offer would prohibit criminal aliens, \nincluding gang members and absconders, people who have defied lawful \ncourt orders and either have gone underground or have been deported and \nentered the country illegally--technically felons under the Immigration \nand Naturalization Act--my amendment would prohibit them from tying up \nthe process, gumming up the courts by appealing the denying of a \nrequest for a waiver of grounds for removal.\n  The court clogging that would ensue without these two provisions is \nalmost sure to cause extensive delay that will almost certainly \nincrease the costs associated with this bill and frustrate the intent \nof Congress trying to pass a truly workable system. This is not a \nhypothetical concern. As we debate this bill there is a lawsuit pending \nby people who have been deported from this country and therefore were \nnot eligible to receive the 1986 amnesty, but they have been litigating \ntheir request that the INS, and now the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, grant them a waiver from that part of the 1986 law that said \nthey were ineligible.\n  This litigation is still going on, 21 years after the 1986 amnesty \nwas passed. Don't you think we would like to learn from our mistakes? \nDon't you think we would like to try to fix those problems? Under this \nprocess, we are not given an opportunity to do that. My amendments \nwould prevent decades-long litigation and frivolous lawsuits from \noccurring with respect to the provisions of this bill.\n  Another amendment I would offer if given an opportunity would require \njudges to consider national security implications before issuing \nnationwide injunctions against immigration enforcement. That is an \nessential provision to protecting our Nation, something that this bill \nclaims to do but which it omits.\n  I would note that that provision passed in last year's immigration \nbill but yet was consciously omitted from this one. There is no good \nreason to weaken last year's bill in this regard.\n  Another amendment I would offer would limit the timeframe of any \nappeal from a denial of Z status to 2 years, so that any error is \npromptly corrected and so that court proceedings would not tend to drag \non endlessly, wasting tax dollars and logjamming our courts and \nallowing a person who has been determined not to be eligible for legal \nstatus to stay in the country indefinitely, under the guise of \nappealing their denial.\n  Another amendment I have would prevent those who have committed \nterrorists acts or provided material support to terrorism from \nqualifying for legalization under the ``good moral character standard'' \nunder this bill, something that seems to be inherently obvious to me. \nIt ought to be included. I am shocked it is not included.\n  I will give you one example. Last year, Mohammed El Shorbagi pled \nguilty to providing material support to the terrorist organization \nHamas. Hamas, by the way, is identified by our own State Department as \na terrorist organization, as well as by the European Union. This \nindividual's conviction did not specifically bar him from becoming a \nU.S. citizen because, under the law in effect, aiding an organization \nthat routinely fires rockets on innocent civilians, families, and \nneighborhoods; people who abduct innocent individuals; and those who \nhave most recently staged a violent coup in Gaza, does not in any way \naffect their good, moral character.\n  Don't you think the Senate, the world's greatest deliberative body, \nrepresentative of the 300 million people of the United States of \nAmerica, would want to fix this glaring omission in the underlying \nbill? Well, I have been told that, no, we are not interested in that \namendment. We have our cherry-picked set of preselected, prescreened, \npreordained, and no one else is going to be able to offer one. In fact, \nyou cannot even debate them, much less offer them and have a vote on \nthem.\n  I appreciate that some have finally recognized the significant flaws \nand security risks that are inherent in the bill as it is currently \nwritten. I would note, though, that it was not until late yesterday \nafternoon that some agreed that such a change was needed to improve \nenforcement and protect U.S. national security and included a version \nin the divided amendment.\n  Now, as I mentioned a moment ago, because the so-called clay pigeon \nthat includes 26 amendments is not yet--well, it was only a moment ago \nhanded to me, hot off the press, I have not yet had time to study that \nversion, I don't know whether the modified version that was sent to the \ndesk today changes it. But at least there appears to be some movement \ntoward closing that loophole.\n  But what other enforcement loopholes and flaws remain in the bill? I \nfear that under this expedited process, the train has left the station, \nand it is going to blow right through the middle of the Senate until we \npass something without proper consideration, and we are going to make \nmistakes. I think that is a bad idea.\n  During the previous debate, I introduced an amendment that would bar \ncriminals, felons, from ever being able to obtain Z status. While it \ndid not pass during the previous debate, I am still clueless as to why \nthat happened. I think now that people have had time to study it and to \nthink about it, hear from their constituents about it, more members \nwould be supportive of closing that loophole for felons. I have refiled \nthis. This is another amendment I have that I hope we will be able to \nvote on eventually. I hope the Senate does not consciously allow felons \nthe benefit of a pathway to legalization and American citizenship. I \ncannot imagine why in the world we would.\n  As I said, those are only six of the amendments that I think need to \nbe offered and added to this bill. Let me mention one other thing. I \nsee the Senator from Kentucky, who perhaps would like to add his \ncomments. Let me mention one other glaring loophole that I talked about \na little yesterday. This was a provision that requires a 24-hour \nbackground check for someone who applies for legal status. But failing \nthat, the default position is they get a probationary Z visa. In other \nwords, we put a provision in here that says: If the background check \ncan't be completed in 24 hours--and it can't, I promise you--that the \napplicant will be automatically granted legal status on a probationary \nbasis.\n  I am concerned particularly because what that does is not only gives \nthem an ability to obtain a probationary Z visa or legal status, the \nWhite House has said: Oh, don't worry about it. If we cannot get the \nbackground check done in 24 hours, and we find out they are \ndisqualified because they do not pass a background check, we will send \nsomeone out to pick them up. Do you know how many absconders there are \nin the United States who are under lawful orders of deportation and \nhave simply gone underground and the Department of Homeland Security, \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement has failed to pick them up and to \nexecute the lawful orders of our courts? There are 623,000 absconders \nwho meet that definition. Are we supposed to believe that people who \nfail the background check for this probationary Z visa are now going to \nbe picked up, when 623,000 people who\n\n[[Page S8578]]\n\nhave defied lawful court orders, who are on the lam, who have gone \nunderground and whom the Department of Homeland Security has failed to \npick up and deport, according to the lawful orders of a court, that now \nall of a sudden the policy has changed?\n  Trust us. Trust us. Well, I tell you what, the American people do not \ntrust the Federal Government, particularly in this area. I hesitate to \nsay it, but it is with good cause, based on hard experience, based on \noverpromising and underdelivering when it comes to our immigration \nprogram.\n  I support increasing legal immigration, looking at how to recruit the \nbest and the brightest and allowing them to come here, particularly if \nthey come to our universities and study at our world-class universities \nand stay, so we do not have to send them home and so they end up \ncompeting with us and taking jobs overseas.\n  I support comprehensive immigration reform. But I do not support \npromising the American people that, oh, yeah, trust us this time, we \nare serious, when there are such obvious flaws in the underlying \nlegislation, that we are being prohibited by this railroad of a process \nfrom being able to offer amendments, to get votes on those amendments, \nto be able to fix the underlying bill.\n  I can see why the American people would be skeptical, because I am \nskeptical. I am increasingly skeptical as a result of the way this \nprocess and this legislation has been handled.\n\n  My hope is that should this cloture vote fail tomorrow, which I \nthink, under the circumstances, looks increasingly likely, we will come \nback and reassess what we have done, or, moreover, what we have failed \nto do and try to be more serious, more deliberate, more conscious of \ntrying to actually deliver on our promises rather than continuing to \noverpromise and underdeliver on this great issue of national concern.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Bunning from Kentucky is here and desires to \nspeak on this legislation. I thank him for his comments previously and \nfor his clarity of thought on the issue.\n  How long does the Senator desire to speak?\n  Mr. BUNNING. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I said this before, but here we go again. \nThree weeks ago, a significant majority of the Senate rejected this \nflawed immigration bill and the flawed process that led to it. But now \nit is back.\n  One of the key reasons the bill failed the first time around was the \nflawed process or the lack of process that led to the bill. In the \nSenate, an idea normally takes months, if not years, to become a bill \nand pass. But instead of letting the bill develop through the \ndeliberative process, a few Senators and a few people from the \nadministration wrote the bill in secret.\n  They held no committee meetings, there were no hearings, there was no \ncommittee report. In fact, Senators did not even see the whole bill \nuntil several days into the debate. When those of us who were not part \nof the secret negotiations finally saw the bill, we found all kinds of \nproblems. But we were told the bill had to be finished by a certain \ndate. We were not even allowed an open debate on the floor.\n  So with a few days looming before the Fourth of July recess, a few \nnegotiators got back together and blessed another list of amendments to \nget votes. Apparently, they believe that 20 or more votes equals a full \ndebate. What a joke.\n  As if that were not bad enough, the majority leader is taking an \nunprecedented step to shut off the right of Senators to debate and \namend the bill. That is not the Senate. The process is not the only \nthing that is flawed around here; the bill itself is flawed.\n  In 1986--thank God I was not in Congress--Congress passed an amnesty \nbill that was promised to be the last of the amnesty bills. Here we are \n20 years later, and the problem is much worse, much, much worse. The \nbill is no better. Instead of punishing illegal immigrants and \nemployers who ignore the law, this bill is a get-out-of-jail-free pass. \nIt gives those who broke the law their own VIP line to a green card and \ncitizenship.\n  For this bill to work as promised, the Government would have to \nprocess at least 12 million illegal immigrants in a matter of months. \nIn short, the timeframe the Government would have to conduct these \nbackground checks, issue identification cards, and to build a system to \ncheck every employee in America to make sure they are legal, that is \nthe timeframe.\n  The Government would also have to implement new guest worker \nprograms, eliminate the green card backlog, overhaul the green card \nsystem, and start issuing new visitor visas. But I do not believe it \nwill work, and the American people certainly do not believe it will \nwork. I am not talking about the far left or the far right; I am \ntalking about middle America--middle America.\n  I am talking about the people who are stuck in the lines in passport \noffices, waiting on the Government, waiting for them so they can go on \na summer vacation. We are supposed to believe that the same Government \nthat cannot even get passports into the hands of their people is going \nto complete background checks on from 12 to 20 million illegal \nimmigrants, give them a secure ID card, check every employee in the \nUnited States to verify their work status, and secure the borders.\n  I don't think so. Unfortunately, this bill does not even secure the \nborders. The $4.4 billion included in the bill does not add any new \nborder security. It only funds the trigger requirements of the bill \nwhich do not even require implementation of existing laws such as \nbuilding the 700 miles of border fence and the 43,000 detention spaces.\n  There are other problems, too. The bill does not require background \nchecks to be completed of illegal immigrants getting amnesty before \nthey get their visas. The bill gives Social Security credits to illegal \naliens for work they did illegally. Illegal aliens with terrorist \nconnections can get amnesty, and they do not have to pay all their back \ntaxes or learn any English at least for 10 years. What a deal. The \nbottom line is the bill will not work.\n  It is much worse than the status quo. Any chance of fixing it is \nbeing erased by the handful of negotiators and the majority leader. \nInstead of trying to fix the bill, the majority leader is using \nunprecedented tactics to ensure only a few blessed amendments are \nconsidered. We all have amendments, such as the Senator from Texas. \nNone of them are going to be considered.\n  I will not support amnesty. I will not repeat the mistakes we made 20 \nyears ago. I will not be responsible for tens of millions more illegal \nimmigrants coming into this country waiting for the next amnesty. I \nwill not support this process or this bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for yielding me the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky. On \nthis question, this fundamental promise by our friends, whom I refer to \naffectionately as the masters of the universe, that we would secure the \nborder--what does our expert congressional arm say about it? What does \nthe Congressional Budget Office say about it? They say, no, it will \nnot. Senator Cornyn and Senator Bunning have pointed out a number of \nthings that are weaknesses with the bill. Will this weakness and other \nitems they talked about in the bill actually secure the border? \nAccording to CBO, the new Senate bill will only reduce the annual \nillegal immigration by 13 percent. Illegal inflow at the border will be \nreduced by approximately 25 percent, but that will be substantially \noffset by increased additional visa overstays, almost over a half \nmillion in the next 10 years. According to CBO, the net result will be \nonly a 1.3 million reduction in new illegal immigrants over the next 20 \nyears. Because we expect under current law 10 million to come over that \nperiod illegally--that is a lot--enactment would reduce that \nexpectation to 8.7 million new additional illegal immigrants by 2027. \nOut of 10 million, we have 8.7 million. I ask my colleagues, is that \nsecuring the border? Is that effecting a legal and lawful and effective \nimmigration system? I suggest it is not. There is no way you can say it \notherwise.\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\n  One of the key things of an effective immigration system is the US-\nVISIT exit system. That is not affected in this. I have talked about \nthat some, but I won't go back into that.\n  I see my colleague from Louisiana here, Senator Vitter. He is an \noutstanding lawyer who has spent a great deal of his time and energy \nstudying these 700 pages and trying to get the amendment of 370 or so \npages so he can study it and help decide what it will do. I see Senator \nVitter is here. I am pleased to yield to him 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama.\n  I want to briefly take the floor to lay out how enormously unfair \nthis process is. I am new to the Senate. Coming here, I had always \nheard, particularly coming from the House, about the fundamental aspect \nof the Senate being unlimited debate. I walked through the wrong door, \nbecause that is not the case, certainly not the case for me in terms of \nthis bill. It has been exactly the opposite from start to finish.\n  Why do I say that?\n  First, we are handed an 800-page bill, given very little time to \ndigest it. Then a few days later, in terms of this latest revisiting of \nimmigration reform, we are handed a 373-page mega-amendment and given \nno time to digest it. Then some of us demanded the time to digest it by \nnot agreeing to waive the reading of that 373-page amendment. Only \nbecause we did that, we were finally given the right to look at the \namendment overnight last night. Great. So we come back at 10 a.m. this \nmorning, after working with our staffs to wade through 373 pages of the \namendment, only to find out that mega-amendment is out the window. We \nhave a new modified version of the mega-amendment, which we have never \nseen before, which we were only given a copy of in the last hour. Now \nwe are trying to digest a new mega-amendment. Meanwhile, the procedure \nis rolling along.\n  Of course, the majority leader, through this unprecedented use of the \nso-called clay pigeon, has hand chosen the only amendments that \napparently will come up during this debate on the Senate floor. It is \nnot an accident that there are no Vitter amendments. I had \nplenty filed. None of them are on the list. The majority leader could \nhave chosen any list of amendments. He could have tried to make an \neffort to have a balanced list to include some amendments of folks such \nas me who have fundamental reservations with the bill. He did not. \nThere are no Vitter amendments. It is not a coincidence there are no \nSessions amendments. There are no DeMint amendments. There are no \nCornyn amendments, the person who began this process working with the \nworking group, developing the bill. It is not a coincidence there are \nno Elizabeth Dole amendments. All of us have been completely shut out \nin terms of the handpicked list of amendments.\n\n  Then we try to participate in the process again on the Senate floor. \nI try to be recognized several times to exercise my rights as a \nSenator. I am shut down again because the majority leader will only \nrecognize me for purposes that he decides, not me, for purposes that he \napproved of, not me. Basically, I am allowed to debate and nothing \nmore. I am not allowed to offer a motion. I am not allowed to do any of \nthat. It is coming to the point where I am wondering, even if he allows \nme to say anything, is he going to hand me a script and I will have to \nread from that?\n  This is not an open, fair process. This is not the Senate I heard \nabout, with unlimited debate and amendment. Yes, there are unlimited \namendments as long as they are approved, apparently, by the majority \nleader. None of them are my amendments. Yes, there is unlimited debate \nas long as you agree not to exercise any of your rights as a Senator. \nYou can talk only. You can't make a motion. You can't try to bring up \nyour amendments. You can't do any of that.\n  That process is fundamentally unfair. I hope many Senators who are \nstill considering how they will vote on cloture will focus on this \nprocess. The American people have said loudly and clearly this is an \nimportant issue to them. They have also said loudly and clearly, by any \npoll out there, that they absolutely disapprove of this bill by \nenormous numbers. For us to move ahead anyway is one thing. For us to \nmove ahead using this process, railroading me, railroading any strong \nopponent of the bill, is something else. It is patently disgraceful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  Let me say what I believe is not in dispute. The procedure Majority \nLeader Reid has chosen to utilize is a procedure never before utilized \nin the Senate. They say: You are just saying it is unfair. Everybody \nsays things are unfair.\n  The reason this is more than a question of fairness is because it is \na transfer, an arrogation of power to the leadership by which, for the \nfirst time in the history of the Senate, the majority leader will be \nable to approve or disapprove whether a Senator gets a vote on an \namendment. If one wanted to do that up until this time, since the \nfounding of our Republic, they stayed down here and didn't agree to \nunanimous consent requests. They stood their guns. It might not be \neasy, but one could get a vote. They could talk about what they wanted \nto talk about. But this process by which the leadership will select a \nlimited number of amendments, place them in this clay-pigeon maneuver \nand only those amendments get voted on and every other amendment is \nrejected, is unprecedented in the Senate.\n  I had a senior Member of the Senate come up to me with some alarm not \nlong ago this morning and say: You need to be able to get amendments.\n  I don't think we have thought this through. It is dawning on me how \nsignificant this is. I said earlier: What would Paul Wellstone say? \nWhat would Jesse Helms say? What would other Senators say, individual \nSenators who are proud of the ability--seldom used, perhaps--they could \nutilize to raise a point that they believe in, even if everybody else \ndisagrees. That is part of our heritage. It will be eroded if we go \nthrough this process.\n  I know my time is up. I appreciate the personal courtesies of the \nmajority leader. He has always been courteous to me. In this instance, \na bad decision has been made. Hopefully it will be rectified in some \nfashion one way or the other by denying cloture on the legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8579-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8579-S8599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT--Continued\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have this matter before us. We are going \nto do our very best to work through it. To remind everyone about this \nlegislation: This bill was taken up. We spent considerable days on the \nSenate floor. Prior to doing that, of course, we had a debate last year \nthat encompassed much of what we have talked about this year. In \naddition to that, though, during the time we pulled the bill from the \nfloor--this bill was pending here--of course, we brought that back with \nthe amendments that had passed.\n  In addition to that, with the concurrence of the President--because \nthe No. 1 complaint that folks on the other side had initially was \nthere was nothing that was going to take care of the border--$4.4 \nbillion is now in this matter that is now before the Senate, $4.4 \nbillion to strengthen the border. It does do that. Not only do we spend \nthe money, but we spend it well in this bill. There will be 370 miles \nof fencing that will be paid for--will not be just talked about--300 \nmiles of vehicle barriers that work extremely well, probably better \nthan the fences. It will now be possible to hire 20,000 new Border \nPatrol agents. The are 105 ground-based radar and camera towers. There \nwill be a facility with detention beds for people who violate these \nimmigration laws. There will be a place to put them.\n  It toughens employer sanctions by creating a mandatory employer \nverification system. It doubles criminal and civil penalties against \nemployers who hire unauthorized workers. Employers can be fined up to \n$5,000 per worker for the first offense, up to $75,000 per worker for \nsubsequent offenses, or they can serve jail time.\n\n[[Page S8580]]\n\nAlso, as it relates to employer sanctions, it strengthens document \nintegrity by requiring tamper-resistant biometric immigration \ndocuments.\n  And, yes, as the Republican Secretary of Commerce has said, and other \nadministration officials have said, this is not amnesty. In fact, what \nSecretary Gutierrez has said is that if we do not do something, there \nis silent amnesty. We are going to move past that.\n  If someone wants to be on a pathway to legalization, they have a job, \nthey pay taxes, they stay out of trouble, they learn English, they pay \npenalties and fines. They go to the back of the line, not to the front \nof the line.\n  This legislation, very importantly, includes AgJOBS and ends the \nexploitation of migrant farmworkers and provides them legal status.\n  The DREAM Act, which a number of individuals worked very hard on--but \nno one harder than my colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nDurbin--the DREAM Act is to legalize immigrant children brought by \ntheir parents to this country through no fault of their own and to \nallow them to go to college or join the military.\n  So this is a nice piece of legislation. It is a step in the right \ndirection. We have had 36 hearings since 9/11, 6 days of committee \naction, 59 committee amendments, 21 days of Senate debate, 92 Senate \nfloor amendments. We have been pretty thorough with this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my friend for a question, and I would, of \ncourse, regain the floor when he completes his question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, is it the Senator's understanding with \nthis legislation we will have virtually the strongest border in the \nhistory of the United States of America in the Southwest? Is that the \nSenator's understanding of the effect of this legislation?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely right. He has been \non the Judiciary Committee for decades in the Senate. He has been \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration for decades. He has watched \nwhat has gone on. We all recognize what happened in 1986 was not good. \nIt is my understanding the senior Senator from Massachusetts voted \nagainst that legislation.\n  This legislation will correct that. This legislation will put 4.4 \nbillion real dollars--not authorized--in direct funding. We got a \nsignoff from the President to do this. If we did nothing else, zero--\nfor those people who have concerns about this legislation--if we did \nnothing else other than do this to secure our border, they should vote \nfor this legislation. But there is much more in it. I have given a \nbrief review of the good things in this legislation. It is a good piece \nof legislation to correct the problem we have.\n  Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator agree with the Council of Economic \nAdvisers that said passing this legislation will mean there is $55 \nbillion--$55 billion--in fees and in fines that will be paid that will \nbe used to strengthen the border, to enforce worksite enforcement, to \nmake sure we are going to have a tamperproof card, which is essential \nfor any kind of immigration system; and that if this legislation does \nnot pass, that $55 billion is going to be paid for by the American \ntaxpayer? Does the Senator understand that is the implication of these \nvotes?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the people who are talking about the \nnegativity of this legislation I do not think understand how good it \nis. I have talked about the $4.4 billion. But to think about that: $55 \nbillion to go toward making our country safer--not our borders--our \ncountry safer, and it is not paid for by the taxpayers. It will be paid \nfor by the people who are seeking to change their status.\n  I think it is a tremendous improvement, a step forward. I think it is \nso important that the American people not hear all this ``some of us \nhave not been on the floor talking about this piece of legislation a \nlot.'' It seems the voices we hear are people who are talking about the \nprocess being unfair, that they have not had a right to be heard. Some \npeople complain, ``I thought the Senate was different than this.''\n  Mr. President, for my friends, some of whom are complaining who \nserved in the House of Representatives, this is a fair process. People \nin the Senate have a right to speak. We have rules that after so much \ntime, when 60 Senators say you talked enough, debate comes to an end. \nThat is where we are in this matter. We are at a point where tomorrow \nmorning cloture will be invoked on this bill. It would be so important \nthat we do that. It would make our country a better country. We need to \ndo this; otherwise, our borders remain porous, with no end in sight.\n  Mr. President, what is now before the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Division III of the amendment is \ncurrently before the body.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to in a minute.\n  Division III is an amendment offered by the senior Senator from the \nState of Missouri. If anyone wishes to speak on that, what I would like \nto do is ask--not like to do; I am going to do--I ask unanimous consent \nthat there be an hour of time, for debate only, on this amendment; that \nfollowing that time being used--it would be divided equally between the \ntwo managers--following that time being used, I would have the right to \nthe floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I say to the leader, I am going to make \nabout 5 minutes of remarks on it. I have not heard from many other \npeople. I think we could move things along without taking an hour. I do \nnot know if any of my colleagues on the floor wish to speak, but 20 \nminutes equally divided would--\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I withdraw my unanimous consent request. I \nappreciate the suggestion of my friend from Missouri. I think it is a \nconstructive one. I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that on the Bond \namendment there be 20 minutes equally divided, that this conversation \nduring this 20 minutes be for debate only, that the time be controlled \nby Senator Specter--I am sure he will give his time to Senator Bond--\nand Senator Kennedy on our side; and that following the using up of \nthat 20 minutes, I obtain the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving the right to object, as I consider the \nunanimous consent request, can I ask permission to pose two questions \nto the distinguished majority leader?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have the floor; is \nthat right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to my friend for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the majority leader. Two questions. One is on the \nsubstance of the bill. In particular, on the point you were making \nregarding funding for enforcement, are you aware of the CRS letter and \nreport which says that $4.4 billion, or at least much of it, can go to \nthe Z visa and the Y visa program, and that it is not clear at all that \nthe trigger provisions have to be met and that certification has to \nhappen before those funds can instead be used for the Z visa program \nversus enforcement?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in response to my friend's question, first \nof all, at least for the next 18 months, President Bush is our \nPresident. His Cabinet officers--two of whom have been heavily involved \nin this legislation, Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Gutierrez--have \nconfirmed that this money--anything the President has power over \nthrough his administration--this money will go to border security, the \nthings I have outlined earlier this afternoon: fencing, vehicle \nbarriers, 20,000 Border Patrol agents, 105 ground-based radar and \ncamera towers, detention beds--and a lot of detention beds, \nspecifically 31,000.\n  One of the problems we have had at the border is that as our valiant \nBorder Patrol agents grab these people coming across the border, they \nhave no place\n\n[[Page S8581]]\n\nto put them. They will now have 31,500--a pretty good holding facility. \nIt will alleviate many of the problems, many of the complaints that our \nown Border Patrol agents have.\n  So in response to my friend from Louisiana, the administration \nassured all of us this money will be used in a manner to make our \nborder more secure.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this June \n25, 2007, Congressional Research Service memorandum printed in the \nRecord because it certainly states clearly that the trigger does not \nhave to be fully met before these funds can go to the Z visa program.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2007.\n\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Honorable Jim DeMint\n     From: Blas Nunez-Neto, Analyst in Domestic Security, Domestic \n         Social Policy.\n     Subject: Trigger language in S. 1639.\n       This memorandum is in response to your request concerning \n     the trigger provisions in S. 1639, the Comprehensive \n     Immigration Reform Act. Specifically, you asked CRS to \n     analyze whether the $4.4 billion that would be authorized by \n     the bill to fund the trigger provisions could be used to fund \n     the processing of Y and Z visas. As such, this memorandum \n     will be restricted to a discussion of Sections 1 and 2 of S. \n     1639. If you have any questions concerning this memorandum, I \n     can be reached at 7-0622.\n     Section 1 of S. 1639\n       Section 1 of S. 1639 would establish certain requirements \n     that must be met by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \n     before the programs in Titles IV and VI of the Act ``that \n     grant legal status to any individual or that adjust the \n     current status of any individual who is unlawfully present in \n     the United States to that of an alien lawfully admitted for \n     permanent residence'' can be implemented.\n       The Act would make exceptions to this requirement for: the \n     probationary benefits conferred by Section 601(h); the \n     provisions of Subtitle C of Title IV (relating to non-\n     immigrant visa reform); and the admission of aliens under \n     Section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (as amended by S. 1639).\n       Prior to the implementation of the majority of the programs \n     in Titles IV and VI, the Secretary of DHS would be required \n     to certify in writing to Congress and the President that each \n     of the following measures (commonly referred to as \n     ``triggers'') are ``established, funded, and operational:''\n       DHS has ``established and demonstrated operational control \n     of 100 percent'' of the land border between the United States \n     and Mexico.\n       Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has hired, trained, and \n     deployed 20,000 United States Border Patrol (USBP) agents.\n       CBP has installed 300 miles of vehicle barriers, 370 miles \n     of fencing, 105 ground-based radar and camera towers, and \n     deployed 4 unmanned aerial vehicles to the border.\n       DHS is detaining all removable aliens apprehended crossing \n     the border illegally, except as specifically mandated by \n     federal or state law or humanitarian circumstances. \n     Additionally, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would \n     need to have the resources to maintain this practice, \n     including the ability to detain 31,500 aliens on a daily \n     basis.\n       DHS has established and is using secure, effective \n     identification tools to verify the identity of workers and \n     prevent unauthorized aliens from obtaining employment in the \n     United States. These tools should include the use of secure \n     documentation that contains photographs and biometric \n     information on the work-authorized aliens and comply with the \n     requirements established by the REAL-ID Act (P.L. 109-13, \n     Div. B). Additionally, DHS would be required to establish an \n     electronic employment eligibility verification system capable \n     of querying federal and state databases in order to provide \n     employers with a digital photograph of the alien's original \n     federal or state issued identity or work-authorization \n     documents.\n       DHS has received, is processing, and is adjudicating in a \n     timely manner applications for Z non-immigrant status under \n     title VI of this Act.\n       The Administration would be required to submit a report \n     within 90 days of the enactment of S. 1639, and every 90 days \n     thereafter until the trigger requirements are met, detailing \n     the progress made in funding and satisfying each of the \n     requirements outlined above. The Governmental Accountability \n     Office (GAO) would be required to submit a report within 30 \n     days of DHS' written certification that the trigger \n     provisions have been met concerning the accuracy of that \n     certification.\n     Section 2 of S. 1639\n       Section 2 would establish a new account within the DHS \n     appropriation known as the ``Immigration Security Account,'' \n     and would endow this account with a transfer $4.4 billion \n     from the Treasury's general fund. These funds would be \n     available for use by DHS for five years after the enactment \n     of S. 1639 in order to meet the trigger requirements outlined \n     above.\n       Section 2 further stipulates that, ``to the extent funds \n     are not exhausted'' in carrying out the trigger requirements, \n     they would be available to be used for any of the following \n     additional activities: fencing and infrastructure; towers; \n     detention beds; the employment eligibility verification \n     system, including funds relating to the State Records \n     Improvement Grant Program outlined in Section 306; \n     implementation of the programs authorized by titles IV and \n     VI; and, other federal border and interior enforcement \n     requirements to ensure the integrity of the programs \n     authorized by titles IV and VI.\n       This language appears to require DHS to expend the funds in \n     the Immigration Security Account to meet the trigger \n     requirements in Section I prior to funding the additional \n     activities outlined above. DHS would be given the authority \n     to transfer funds from the Immigration Security Account as \n     needed to fund the trigger requirements and the additional \n     purposes outlined above.\n       DHS would be required to submit an expenditure plan for the \n     Immigration Security Account funds to the Senate Committees \n     on Judiciary and Appropriations within 60 days of enactment, \n     and annually thereafter, identifying: one-time and ongoing \n     costs; the level of funding for each program, project, and \n     activity and whether that funding supplements an appropriated \n     program, project, and activity; the amount of funding \n     obligated in each fiscal year by program, project, and \n     activity; the milestones required for the completion of each \n     identified program, project, and activity; and how these \n     activities will further the goals and objectives of the Act.\n       Lastly, DHS would be required to notify the Senate \n     Committees on Judiciary and Appropriations 15 days prior to \n     the reprogramming of funds from their original allocation or \n     the transferring of funds out of the Immigration Security \n     Account.\n     Conclusion\n       In response to your question concerning whether the $4.4 \n     billion in funding appropriated under the Immigration \n     Security Account could be used to fund the processing of Y or \n     Z visas under Titles IV and VI of S. 1639, S. 1639 appears to \n     require that the trigger mechanisms be funded first. \n     Receiving, processing, and adjudicating applications for the \n     Z visa authorized by Title VI of the Act is one of the \n     trigger mechanisms outlined in Section I; this means that \n     funding from the Immigration Security Account could be used \n     for this purpose. Section 2(C) would allow DHS to expend any \n     funds remaining after the trigger mechanisms have been fully \n     funded on certain activities, including the implementation of \n     the programs authorized in Titles IV and VI of the Act. Thus, \n     it appears the funding for the Y visa (and other programs) \n     authorized by Title IV of the Act could only be made \n     available through the Immigration Security Account once the \n     trigger mechnisms had been met. However, S. 1639 does not \n     explicitly stipulate whether the certification required by \n     Section I would have to take place prior to funding being \n     made available for the additional purposes outlined in \n     Section 2(C).\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, does my friend have another question?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes. The second question for the majority leader is about \nprocedure. I think he understands my frustrations in terms of the \nprocedure we seem to be adopting. Does the distinguished majority \nleader see any opportunity between now and tomorrow's key cloture vote \nfor me and like-minded Senators to offer our amendments on the floor \nversus his handpicked amendments or to be recognized on the floor for \nreasons of our choosing versus merely being recognized for reasons of \nhis choosing?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are in the Senate. We have certain \nprocedures and rules. I have tried to make things as family friendly as \npossible; that is, Senate family friendly. I say to my friend, during \nthe early days of this legislation, amendments were offered by him and \nothers, some of which got votes, some did not. That is the way the \nSenate operates. We are now in a process to work toward in the morning \nwhen we have a cloture vote.\n  I think the process is very fair. The people who are managing this \nlegislation, directed by Senators Specter and Kennedy--two of the most \nsenior Members of our Senate--have been as fair as possible for our \ngetting where we are. There are amendments in this procedure we are \ngoing through by people who have never supported the bill and do not \nintend to support the bill. The amendments were arrived at in a way to \ntry to improve this bill. Will all amendments improve the bill? I guess \nthat is in the eye of the beholder.\n  I say to my friend, the procedure has been set here. I am sorry you \nare concerned about it. I, frankly, though, think we have been very \nfair. As a result of that, I would ask my friend if he has an objection \nto Senator Bond's suggestion, that we debate this amendment of his--\nthat is debate only--for 20 minutes equally divided.\n\n[[Page S8582]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, reserving, again, my right to object, I \nask unanimous consent to speak for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Is this for debate only?\n  Mr. VITTER. For debate only.\n  Mr. REID. I would have the floor as soon as the minute is up; is that \nright?\n  Mr. VITTER. That is correct.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Well, again, I take it from the distinguished majority leader that \nhis answer to my last question is no. Under this process, there will be \nno opportunity for me and like-minded Senators to offer our amendments. \nWe will only consider his 26 handpicked amendments. Again, he put \ntogether that list. He could have included some amendments of folks who \nhave serious problems with the bill. But there are no Vitter amendments \non the list. There are no Sessions amendments. There are no DeMint \namendments, no Cornyn amendments, no Dole amendments, no Bunning \namendments, and we could go on and on. Is that a fair process?\n\n  I also ask, is it a fair process for me to only be recognized on the \nfloor of the Senate during this momentous debate leading up to a \ncloture vote only for purposes of the majority leader's choosing and \nfor no purposes of my own choosing?\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. So the record is very clear, Harry Reid, the majority \nleader, did not pick the Republican amendments. The Republican \nleadership picked those amendments. Senator McConnell and I worked the \nprocess so that we would be back on the floor. It wasn't done by me; it \nwas done by us.\n  I would further say, these amendments, Republican amendments in this \nbill, were not picked by me; they were picked by the Republican \nleadership. I didn't stand over his shoulder. They chose what they \ndecided to do.\n  So I ask my friend if he has an objection to my request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes before yielding \nto the Senator from Missouri. I do so at this time before hearing from \nthe senior Senator from Missouri to comment about what the Senator from \nLouisiana has had to say.\n  When he objects to the procedure where he doesn't have an opportunity \nto offer amendments, I would remind the Senator from Louisiana and \neveryone else that there was a time when we were searching for \namendments. I refer specifically to the Thursday afternoon before the \nmajority leader took the bill down on the cloture vote. We sat around \nfor hours looking for amendments, and the people who objected to the \nbill would not offer amendments, nor would they let anybody else offer \namendments. That is why I supported cloture, first to protect the \nrights of the minority to offer amendments, but then when they would \nneither offer amendments nor let anyone else offer amendments, I voted \nfor cloture.\n  So when someone comes to the floor today and objects that they are \nnot being able to offer amendments, I remind them as to what happened \nand what precipitated this unusual procedure.\n  As I said earlier, candidly, I don't like this, but it is the lesser \nof the evils. We don't have any choice if we are going to exercise the \nwill of the Senate on this bill before the recess, because after the \n4th of July recess, the Senate is going to be very heavily engaged in \nappropriations bills and other matters.\n  Now I yield to the Senator from Missouri. How much time would the \nSenator like?\n  Mr. BOND. To the distinguished ranking member of the committee, I \nwould gratefully appreciate 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator has it.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank Senator Specter and the majority leader for giving \nme this time.\n  Mr. President, my part of the division of this amendment, simply \nstated, will cut the path to citizenship for illegal aliens.\n  I think most people will recognize that citizenship is the most \nprecious gift America can provide. There are many of us who believe it \nshould not serve as a reward to those who broke the law to enter or \nremain in this country. The path to citizenship is at the heart of the \namnesty criticism of this bill, which we are hearing very loudly in my \nState and across the Nation. I believe cutting this path cuts out the \nmost severe complaint against this bill.\n  I supported the Vitter amendment to strike the entire amnesty \nproposal for 12 million illegal aliens in the country, and that \namendment was rejected. Perhaps it was too broad. So my division of the \ncurrent amendment targets the most controversial aspect of the \nproposal: the award of citizenship to those 12 million illegal aliens \nwho essentially will stay here--maybe take a 1-day trip--enjoy the \nbenefits of residence, and then can become citizens without having to \ngo through the process everyone else seeking to become a citizen has to \ngo through, which is applying in their home country, and waiting for \ntheir time to arrive. Whatever we end up doing for those 12 million \nillegal aliens, it does not, in my view, require the further step of \ngranting citizenship.\n  Those 12 million illegal aliens came to this country to work--to \nwork--without expectation of becoming citizens. We ought to understand \nthat. They came here to work, not to become citizens. Now, more legal \naliens will come to this country on a temporary basis to work without \nthe expectation of citizenship. There is no need to grant these people \nthe gift of citizenship when they came here to meet their economic \nneeds. The bill, as we know, puts the 12 million illegal immigrants who \ncomply with its terms on the path to citizenship. Illegal immigrants \nwho pay a fine and pass a security check, learn English, touch back to \ntheir home country, and show employment can become legalized under the \nnew Z visa program.\n\n  After 8 years, formerly illegal immigrants, now legalized with Z \nvisas, may apply for legalized permanent residence, otherwise known as \na green card. As most of us already know, under existing law, once you \nhave had a green card for a certain number of years, you can apply for \nand receive citizenship.\n  My division simply will cut off that path, automatically invoked once \na green card is bestowed, by preventing those formerly illegal \nimmigrants with Z visas from obtaining green card status and therefore \ncitizenship.\n  Specifically, my portion of the amendment would strike the contents \nof section 602 on earned adjustment for Z status aliens, replacing it \nwith a prohibition on issuing an immigrant visa to Z nonimmigrants, \nwhich is currently in the bill, and a prohibition on adjusting a Z \nnonimmigrant to legalized permanent residency, or so-called green card \nholders.\n  This proposal of mine would not change any of the bill's requirements \nto obtain and keep a Z visa, such as a clean criminal record, \nprogressively better English competency, or continued employment. Nor \ndoes my proposal change any of the rights afforded to Z visa holders, \nincluding work, residency, and travel. Z visa holders would remain in \nthat status as long as they chose. Alternatively--and this is an \nalternative--Z visa holders could abandon their status, return to their \nhome country and, if they choose, pursue legalized permanent residency \nand citizenship from outside the country, as any other foreign citizen \ncould.\n  As I discussed above, I do personally support granting the rights I \nenumerated for Z visa holders. I supported the Vitter amendment to \nstrip all the Z program provisions. But the Senate had its vote on all \nof those provisions and we lost. This amendment is the next best thing.\n  Our immigration system is broken and must be fixed. I support a \nstrong emphasis on border security and enforcing the immigration laws, \nbut we should not hold border security hostage to amnesty. I voted \nbefore and\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\nwill continue to vote to appropriate more money for funding for border \nfencing, detention facilities, and border agents. I urge my fellow \nSenators to support those ways to strengthen and protect our country \nand our security, but reject rewarding illegal immigrants with \nundeserved citizenship.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In light of the comments which have been made as to the \ncost of this program, I think it is important to focus on the fact that \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has made a finding that new \nFederal revenue from taxes, penalties, and fees under the bipartisan \nimmigration bill will more than offset the costs of setting up any \nimmigration system and the costs of any Federal benefits temporary \nworkers, Z visa holders, and future legal immigrants under the bill \nwould receive. CBO estimates that increased revenue from taxes, \npenalties, and fines under the bill will offset any estimated increases \nof mandatory spending, such as emergency Medicaid, and produce a net \nfiscal surplus of $25.6 billion over 10 years. The surplus will be used \nto cover costs, including implementing the new program, and a \nsignificant portion of the costs of better securing our borders and \nimproving interior enforcement through additional Border Patrol and ICE \nagents.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this fact sheet be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Immigration Fact Check: CBO Report--The Rest of the Story\n\n        The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) finds \n     that new Federal revenue from taxes, penalties, and fees \n     under the bipartisan immigration bill will more than offset \n     the costs of setting up the new immigration system and the \n     costs of any Federal benefits temporry workers, Z visa \n     holders, and future legal immigrants under the bill would \n     receive.\n       CBO estimates increased revenue from taxes, penalties, and \n     fines under the bill will offset any estimated increases in \n     mandatory spending, such as emergency Medicaid, and produce a \n     net fiscal surplus of $25.6 billion over 10 years. This \n     surplus will be used to cover costs including: the costs of \n     implementing the new program; a significant portion of the \n     costs of better securing our borders and improving interior \n     enforcement through additional Border Patrol and ICE agents.\n       CBO concludes temporary workers, Z visa holders, and future \n     legal immigrants under the Senate bill will have a positive \n     financial impact on Social Security and Medicare.\n       The temporary worker and Z visa programs will be funded by \n     fees charged to participants, and will not be subsidized by \n     taxpayer dollars.\n       Z visa holders and temporary workers under the Senate bill \n     must pay income taxes and are not entitled to welfare, food \n     stamps, SSI, or non-emergency Medicaid.\n       CBO concludes that with border and interior enforcement \n     provisions, this immigration bill will have ``a relatively \n     small net effect on the federal budget balance over the next \n     two decades.''\n       The bill authorizes more than $40 billion in spending. \n     Assuming all of this spending is appropriated, the bill would \n     produce a net fiscal deficit. However, more than three-\n     quarters of this spending is for enhancements to border \n     security and interior enforcement. These enhancements will \n     benefit the country as a whole and reflect costs that \n     taxpayers currently bear. In addition, revenues generated by \n     new workers under the bill will still cover about half of \n     these enforcement costs.\n       The bill is an improvement over last year's Senate bill (S. \n     2611), which CBO estimated would have required a taxpayer \n     contribution of twice the magnitude estimated for this year's \n     bill.\n       CBO estimates the bill ``would reduce the net annual flow \n     of unauthorized immigrants by one-quarter'' but admits ``the \n     potential impact of the border security, employment \n     verification, and other enforcement measures on the flow of \n     unauthorized migrants is uncertain but could be large.''\n       For the first time, CBO has found that the enforcement \n     provisions of an immigration bill are robust enough to reduce \n     significantly illegal immigration.\n       CBO notes that, while previous attempts to cut illegal \n     immigration have been relatively unsuccessful, the bill \n     ``would authorize significant additional resources as well as \n     a comprehensive employment verification system to deter the \n     hiring of unauthorized workers.''\n       The report also notes that ``the implementation of the new \n     guest worker program and the provision of visas to the \n     currently unauthorized population could occur only if the \n     Secretary of DHS certifies'' that certain enforcement \n     measures are in place.\n\n\n          Background On The Bipartisan Immigration Reform Bill\n\n       The bill commits the most resources to border safety and \n     security in U.S. history.\n       Temporary worker and Z visas will not be issued until \n     meaningful benchmarks for border security and worksite \n     enforcement are met. These triggers include: increasing \n     border fencing, increasing vehicle barriers at the Southern \n     border, increasing the size of the Border Patrol, installing \n     ground-based radar and camera towers along the Southern \n     border, ensuring resources are available to maintain the \n     effective end of ``Catch and Release'' for every non-Mexican \n     apprehended at our border, establishing and putting in use a \n     reliable employment eligibility verification system.\n       The bill recognizes that enforcement alone will not work to \n     secure our border and meet the needs of the U.S. economy. The \n     temporary worker program will help immigration enforcement \n     officers control the border by creating a lawful and orderly \n     channel for foreign workers to fill jobs that Americans are \n     not doing.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have, as I understand, 10 minutes; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes of that to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, and I thank the Chair.\n  First, let me make a comment about the process here. On the other \nside of the aisle we have heard people stand up and try to use every \nprocedural obstacle they can to kill the bill. They want to kill the \nbill. What this Chamber ought to be about is trying to find solutions \nto those huge problems that face our country, whatever those problems \nmay be, including the issue of immigration.\n  They have said this process is somehow unfair. Well, when I look at \nhow much time this Chamber has spent dealing with the issue of \nimmigration, I think there has been ample time for people to talk about \nand debate this issue over the last 2 years. Since 9/11--since 9/11--\nthe Senate has had 36 hearings on the issue of immigration--36 \nhearings. Since 9/11, there have been 6 days of committee action with \nrespect to immigration. Since then, there have been 59 committee \namendments on immigration. Since then, there have been 21 days of \nSenate debate--21 days of Senate debate on immigration, and 92 Senate \nfloor amendments--92 Senate floor amendments.\n  So for those who want to use procedure to kill this bill, they are \nwrong in making the case that they have not been heard. There has been \nample time and opportunity to hear their arguments, and that has gone \non time and time again. It is time we in the Senate get down to \nbusiness and fix the problem of immigration for our country.\n  Secondly, this is a good bill. It may not be a perfect bill, but we \ncan't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This bill toughens \nborder security. It does it by making sure that the $4.4 billion is \nthere for border security, 370 miles of fencing, 300 miles of vehicle \nbarriers, 20,000 Border Patrol agents, and it goes on. It doubles \nemployer sanctions to make sure we can enforce our laws here in our \ncountry through a variety of different means, and it also makes sure \nthat we develop a realistic and tough solution to the 12 million \nundocumented workers who are here in America. Those who are part of a \n``round them up and deport them'' crowd are being unrealistic because \nof the costs involved and the difficulty in ultimately fixing the \nproblem we have. So we have come up with the right kind of solution \nthat punishes them, fines them, puts them to the back of the line, and \nallows them to come out of the shadows of this society and into the \nsunlight.\n  Finally, we can't forget the human values at stake in this debate on \nimmigration. In this picture we see Army SPC Alex Jimenez. He was \ndeployed for a second tour in Iraq. He has been missing in Iraq since \nMay 12. We have found some other of his personal belongings. But as he \nis in Iraq missing in action, his wife was being questioned\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\nby ICE in our country, in America, because her immigration status was \nundocumented. Now, is that the American way? Is that the American way, \nto have one of our soldiers missing in action in Iraq, with his wife \nconcerned about her immigration status here in the United States of \nAmerica?\n  What this demonstrates to me is we have a system of chaos and \ndisorder here in America. We need to fix the problem. This Chamber can \nfix the problem. I hope we will stand behind the solution we are \nbringing to the floor today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Chair would let me know when I have 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, maybe we could take a moment and look at those words \nthat are written in stone right above the Vice President's chair there: \ne pluribus unum, meaning one out of many. One out of many. That is the \ndesire, that is the hope, that is the dream of this country: one out of \nmany.\n  Many come from different traditions, backgrounds, and experience, but \nwe all are one country with one history and one destiny--not with the \nBond amendment, not with the Bond amendment.\n  The lines written at the Statue of Liberty are:\n\n       Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning \n     to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. \n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me. I lift my \n     lamp beside the golden door!\n\n  That is right, as long as those individuals are working and who will \nnever become citizens, who will never have that right to become a part \nof the American dream, and once you stop working, out of the country \nyou go. Better gather up all of your belongings, because you are going \nto be out of status, and out of status means you can be subject to \ndeportation.\n  You can imagine what that individual is going to say to their \nemployer when the employer says: Sure, you have worked 40 hours. You \nwork 50 hours, 60 hours, and bring your wife in and make sure she works \novertime this week as well; otherwise, you are out of status. You are \nout of here.\n  That is what the Bond amendment would do to Americans. One America \nthat has rights and privileges, and to a second group in America they \nsay: Once we wring out of you the last bit of sweat that you can give \nto some employer, you are finished, you are out of status, you are \ndeportable.\n  That isn't what this country is about. Maybe we don't like the fact \nthat people are not satisfied with the regime we have given or \nrecommended in this legislation that says: You go to the back of the \nline. You came here because you wanted to work, because you wanted to \nprovide for your family; you came here, and you are at church on the \nweekends; and you came here and your son or daughter is serving in Iraq \nor Afghanistan. But we say: OK, you go to the end of the line, pay a \nfee, learn English, and you have to demonstrate that you are working \nand you are going to become a good American. That isn't good enough for \nsome.\n  Well, Mr. President, this creates the two Americas, which I think all \nof us understand is not what this Nation is about. That is the result \nof the Bond amendment, and I think it would be a major step backward. \nWe can imagine the resentment and hostility that will seethe and grow \nwith generations that come with their families when they see them \nexploited. Talk about a danger and social dynamite in our society, this \namendment will breed that. We don't need that or want it, Mr. \nPresident. We should not have it. I hope the amendment is not accepted.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield that time to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my colleague from Massachusetts made a very \npowerful statement on behalf of those who came here, but he kind of \nforgot an important distinction. There are those who come here legally \nand those who come here illegally. We are talking about the illegals. \nWith the argument so forcefully and persuasively made by my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, if you took that argument to its end result, then \nthere should not be immigration laws. We should not have a process for \ngoing for citizenship because anybody who wanted to come in could.\n  We have changed those laws. We have provided laws, and the people we \nare talking about have come here illegally to work. If they wanted to \nbecome citizens, there is a process. If they join the military, I \nstrongly believe they should become citizens.\n  But if they come illegally just to work, then they have not earned \ncitizenship like all of the others do, like my ancestors and the \nancestors of almost every Member of this body. We are all immigrants, \nbut we did not come here illegally and expect to get citizenship. \nTherefore, Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues, if you believe \nthere is a difference between people who come legally and people who \ncome illegally, to support the Bond division or proposal, vote against \nthe motion to table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have broken borders. The 1986 act had \nno enforcement mechanism, and that was under a Republican \nadministration. We are not bringing that up. We have 12\\1/2\\ million \nimmigrants. You can say we are going to ship them back, and it will \ntake $250 billion and 25 years to be able to do it. Buses will stretch \nfrom Los Angeles to New York and back again. Are we going to do that? \nNo, we are going to take another route and just exploit them and not do \nwhat is in this legislation, which makes them pay a fine and \ndemonstrate that they are going to work hard and learn English and \nprovide for their family and give something back to America, like they \ndo when their sons and daughters serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. You \nwill be able to stay here under the Bond amendment, but you are going \nto work for an employer. When you get tired of working, we are going to \nreport to the INS that you are out of status, and out you are going to \ngo, lock, stock, and barrel. It will be just sweat labor here.\n  We are going to have two Americas. You may not like our solution, but \nit is preferable to this alternative, which will create a permanent \nunderclass. I think it would be a mistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Is all time expired?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friends, Senators Vitter and DeMint and \nSessions, have asked a number of questions during the day, and they are \nvalid questions, but I feel it is appropriate to respond. The way I \nwill respond now is with a letter I wrote in response to the letter \nthey wrote to me a few days ago. This letter is dated June 25:\n\n       Dear Senators Cornyn, Vitter, Dole, Sessions and DeMint: \n     Thank you for writing to me earlier today about my effort to \n     bring the comprehensive immigration reform bill back to the \n     Senate floor.\n       As you know, the Senate was unable to complete action on \n     the immigration bill earlier this month because a handful of \n     Senators, including several of you, objected to my repeated \n     efforts to call up further amendments to the bill. Following \n     the unsuccessful cloture vote on June 7, a group of Senators, \n     including Minority Leader McConnell, Republican Conference \n     Chairman Kyl and Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Specter, \n     came to see me with a request that I bring the immigration \n     bill back before the Senate under a procedure under which a \n     large number of additional amendments could become pending to \n     the bill.\n       The so-called ``clay pigeon'' procedure is unusual, and I \n     would not have considered employing it in this instance \n     without the full support of Senator McConnell. It seems to me \n     appropriate for the two leaders to work together to overcome \n     the tactics of a small number of Senators in order to allow \n     the full Senate to debate an important national issue like \n     immigration. The White House made clear that it also favors \n     such a procedure, since the immigration bill is one of the \n     President's top priorities.\n       I respectfully disagree with your assertion that I intend \n     to ``shut off the debate'' and that the procedure in question \n     will ``silence amendments instead of facilitate their \n     debate.'' On the contrary, I am working to facilitate debate \n     on more than twenty additional amendments to the bill. In \n     contrast, several of you objected when I tried to call up as \n     few as five amendments during the earlier debate. The \n     American people can see clearly who wants to debate \n     immigration reform and who wants to shut off that debate.\n       Moreover, your claim that the Senate will only debate \n     amendments which I ``hand select'' is plainly untrue. The \n     dozen or so Republican amendments that will become pending to \n     the bill have been selected by the Republican leadership, not \n     by me.\n       In sum, I appreciate the concerns expressed in your letter \n     but consider them misplaced. Senator McConnell and I have \n     worked together in good faith to ensure a full, open and \n     productive debate on a bill of overriding national importance \n     that is supported by many Republicans and endorsed by \n     President Bush.\n\n  I signed it, Senator Reid.\n  Mr. President, what is the matter now before this body?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Division IV is now pending.\n  Mr. REID. What I would like to do, Mr. President--this is the Dodd \namendment--I would like to ask, as I did with the prior amendments that \nhave come up today, I ask unanimous consent for debate only; that we \nstart with 1 hour, equally divided, to debate this amendment, and then \nfollowing that, I would be recognized to do whatever I felt \nappropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. There is objection. And I would like to ask the majority \nleader's----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Louisiana is not recognized. I have not \ngiven up the floor.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader, please.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator from Louisiana objected; \nis that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator from Louisiana object?\n  Mr. VITTER. I am reserving my right to object, and I was trying to \ngain recognition, and I believe I did gain recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is acknowledged but not \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Then I ask that the record be read with regard to whether \nI was recognized or not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a misstatement that the Senator was \nrecognized. There is a unanimous consent request pending.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ask my friend to object, if he cares \nto, and then I would be happy to enter into a dialog with the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. There is objection. I would like to enter into that \ndialog on two points.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I would be happy at this time \nto yield to my friend from Louisiana for 2 minutes for the purpose of a \nquestion, and then I, of course, would have the floor following the \ntermination of those 2 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the majority leader, and simply two points, \nquickly.\n  First, with regard to the statement the majority leader just made and \nthe letter he read, let me end the debate. Let me stipulate for the \nrecord that Senator McConnell is not being railroaded and President \nBush is not being railroaded. I am being railroaded and my allies on \nthe floor of the Senate are being railroaded. So we will end that \ndebate and stipulate that for the record.\n  Second, with regard to your last unanimous consent request, I would \nlove to agree to it if it can be modified so that my rights on the \nfloor of the Senate are also preserved--specifically so that I can be \nrecognized for 2 minutes for any purpose.\n  Mr. REID. I could not agree to that, Mr. President, so I would \ncertainly object to that.\n  Now, we had in the last amendment that was laid down, I thought, a \nvery sensible debate. People were able to offer their opinions as to \nthe merits. In fact, it was a good debate. Senator Bond was advocating \nhis position, and Senator Kennedy and others were advocating against \nthat. My question to the Senate now is, Could we have the same \nprocedure? I have suggested 1 hour equally divided, which would be for \ndebate only, and following that period of time, I would be recognized.\n  I ask, Mr. President, unanimous consent that request be back before \nthe Senate at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. There is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry. Oh, there you are. I would be happy to yield \nfor a question from my friend from South Carolina for up to 2 minutes, \nand then I would get the floor back.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the leader. I would just ask that I have the \nopportunity, as you did, to read the letter that I wrote, along with a \nnumber of other Members, in response to your response to us. It is just \na few paragraphs. I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed to put in \nthe Record our particular response to what you read.\n  Mr. REID. Go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you.\n\n       Dear Senator Reid:\n       Thank you for your response to our letter regarding your \n     unprecedented efforts to bring the immigration bill back to \n     the Senate floor after it was rejected three times by the \n     full Senate. We are writing to address several of the issues \n     you raised.\n       First, you said the Senate was not allowed to complete its \n     earlier debate on this bill because some of us objected to \n     your calling up further amendments. This is untrue. You \n     repeatedly objected to Republican amendments being offered \n     and insisted on selecting our amendments for us and for the \n     entire Senate. Consequently, we objected to all amendments \n     until we could get a full and fair debate. We did not believe \n     you had the right to hand-pick amendments then, and we do not \n     believe you have that right now.\n       Second, you said the abuse of Senate rules during this \n     debate is justified because it allows you to ``overcome the \n     tactics of a small number of Senators.'' This is also untrue. \n     We hope you realize that over 60 Senators voted against \n     cutting off debate because they opposed the substance of the \n     bill and the process you used to debate it. This is not a \n     small group.\n\n[[Page S8586]]\n\n       In addition, your unprecedented abuse of the rules and \n     precedents of the Senate will negatively impact every Senator \n     by fundamentally reducing their rights to debate and to offer \n     amendments in the future. We believe you understand our \n     concern because just two years ago you said, ``the Senate \n     should not become like the House of Representatives, where \n     the majority manipulates the rules to accommodate its \n     momentary needs.'' If you go forward with this plan, history \n     will show that your decision not only impacted the ever-\n     growing number of Senators who oppose this immigration bill, \n     but hundreds of Senators in the years to come who wish to \n     make their voices heard.\n       Third, you repeatedly defended this process for debate by \n     blaming the Senate Republican leadership and the President \n     himself. While their cooperation may give you comfort, it \n     does not justify your actions. As Senate Majority Leader, \n     only you can execute this abusive practice. Only you can set \n     up a process that guarantees consideration of a hand-selected \n     group of amendments to buy support for a bill while at the \n     same time blocking all other amendments. You may want \n     Americans to believe this is a Republican bill, but your \n     willingness to use your office to force it through the Senate \n     shows precisely how much you support it and the extent you \n     are willing to go to pass it.\n       We respectfully ask you to reconsider your plan to force \n     this bill through the Senate. The American people do not \n     support this legislation and they do not support the heavy-\n     handed tactics being used to pass it.\n\n  That is signed by Senators Vitter, DeMint, Sessions, Elizabeth Dole, \nand I think several others on another page.\n  I thank the majority leader for allowing us to read the letter.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the letter I wrote, along with Senator DeMint's--\nthat both appear in the Record, Senator DeMint's first, with mine \nfollowing that.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25. 2007.\n     Re: Unprecedented floor procedure will harm the United States \n         Senate as an institution, and will diminish the \n         senatorial powers of each individual member.\n\n     Majority Leader Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Majority Leader Reid: We write to express serious concern \n     regarding the potential use of an unprecedented procedure to \n     place the Senate immigration bill's floor amendment process \n     under your sole control. Our understanding is that you are \n     considering the introduction of a specially crafted amendment \n     with 20 or more carefully selected parts, known as a ``clay-\n     pigeon'' amendment. By exercising your priority right of \n     recognition, you can divide the amendment into its parts and \n     fill all available amendment slots with issues that you hand \n     select. All Senators who have amendments to the bill that \n     were not selected will be completely shut out of the floor \n     amendment process.\n       Because you have priority right of recognition over all \n     other Senators, you are the only member that can use a \n     ``clay-pigeon'' amendment to limit the rights of the other 99 \n     members in this body. To our knowledge, all previous uses of \n     a ``clay-pigeon'' amendment have been to preserve the rights \n     of minority members who sought votes on amendments the \n     majority wanted to block.\n       Your use of the ``clay pigeon'' to shut of the debate and \n     amendment process will be the first time in history this \n     procedure has been used to silence amendments instead of \n     facilitate their debate. Undoubtedly, such a procedure would \n     significantly undermine the U.S. Senate's reputation as the \n     greatest deliberative body on earth. We ask you to announce \n     publicly that you will not allow such a procedure to be \n     invoked on this critically important legislation.\n       This immigration legislation is critically important to the \n     American people. The public is becoming increasingly aware of \n     a number of serious problems with the bill, and, like all \n     legislation, this bill would only benefit from the sunlight \n     of a free, open, and transparent amendment process. Without a \n     fair, open, and robust debate to improve this bill, the \n     public's confidence in Congress will continue to erode.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Cornyn.\n     David Vitter.\n     Elizabeth Dole.\n     Jeff Sessions.\n     Jim DeMint.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2007.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     Hon. Elizabeth Dole,\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Hon. Jim DeMint,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cornyn, Vitter, Dole, Sessions and DeMint: \n     Thank you for writing to me earlier today about my efforts to \n     bring the comprehensive immigration reform bill back to the \n     Senate floor.\n       As you know, the Senate was unable to complete action on \n     the immigration bill earlier this month because a handful of \n     Senators, including several of you, objected to my repeated \n     efforts to call up further amendments to the bill. Following \n     the unsuccessful cloture vote on June 7, a group of Senators \n     including Minority Leader McConnell, Republican Conference \n     Chairman Kyl and Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Specter, \n     came to see me with a request that I bring the immigration \n     bill back before the Senate under a procedure under which a \n     large number of additional amendments could become pending to \n     the bill.\n       The so-called ``clay pigeon'' procedure is unusual, and I \n     would not have considered employing it in this instance \n     without the full support of Senator McConnell. It seems to me \n     appropriate for the two leaders to work together to overcome \n     the tactics of a small number of Senators in order to allow \n     the full Senate to debate an important national issue like \n     immigration. The White House made clear that it also favors \n     such a procedure, since the immigration bill is one of \n     President Bush's top priorities.\n       I respectfully disagree with your assertion that I intend \n     to ``shut off the debate'' and that the procedure in question \n     will ``silence amendments instead of facilitate their \n     debate.'' On the contrary, I am working to facilitate debate \n     on more than twenty additional amendments to the bill. In \n     contrast, several of you objected when I tried to call up as \n     few as five amendments during the earlier debate. The \n     American people can see clearly who wants to debate \n     immigration reform and who wants to shut off that debate.\n       Moreover, your claim that the Senate will only debate \n     amendments which I ``hand select'' is plainly untrue. The \n     dozen or so Republican amendments that will become pending to \n     the bill have been selected by the Republican leadership, not \n     by me.\n       In sum, I appreciate the concerns expressed in your letter \n     but consider them misplaced. Senator McConnell and I have \n     worked together in good faith to ensure a full, open and \n     productive debate on a bill of overriding national importance \n     that is supported by many Republicans and endorsed by \n     President Bush.\n           Sincerely,\n     Harry Reid.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                    Senate Steering Committee,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: Thank you for your response to our \n     letter regarding your unprecedented efforts to bring the \n     immigration bill back to the Senate floor after it was \n     rejected three times by the full Senate. We are writing to \n     address several of the issues you raised.\n       First, you said the Senate was not allowed to complete its \n     earlier debate on this bill because some of us objected to \n     your calling up further amendments.

Mr. President, I will say that his letter makes our \nargument. Of course there were more than 60 who voted against \nproceeding on that legislation. That is precisely why we are back on \nthis legislation, because a significant number of those 60 came to me \nand Senator McConnell and said that we need to bring this bill back and \nwe need to have amendments heard. So I think the letters speak for \nthemselves.\n  Finally, let me say this. Would the Senator from Louisiana or South \nCarolina--I asked for 1 hour--would they agree to 30 minutes equally \ndivided on this amendment, for debate only?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving my right to object, if I can inquire of the \ndistinguished majority leader and explain to him, through the Chair, \nthat my objection does not rest on the time period; it rests on my \nrights on the Senate floor being shut down.\n  So I would again ask if the unanimous consent request can be modified \nto allow me to exercise my rights on the Senate floor--specifically, to \nhave a mere 5 minutes on the Senate floor to be recognized for purposes \nof my choosing, not merely for purposes of the majority leader's \nchoosing?\n  Mr. REID. So is there objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the leader so modify his request?\n  Mr. REID. No, I would not do that.\n  Mr. VITTER. Regrettably, I must continue my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, my objection to the request comes from the fact that \nwe are here as a result of the Republican leadership coming to me. And \nI am glad to be here, but we are here because, as everyone will recall \nin the first go-round, we had seven votes from the minority. We needed \nmore than that. Everyone realized that. And in an effort to do that, we \nhave these amendments which have been brought before this body. It is a \nfair process.\n  I just think my friends from South Carolina and Alabama and Louisiana \nhave made their point, and I think we have made our point, also. This \nis a process which we are trying to move. Why are we trying to move it? \nBecause immigration is in need of fixing.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from Arizona wishes \nto ask me a question, and I will be happy to yield to my friend for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have a question for the majority leader. Do \nI understand that currently the pending business before the Senate--or \nwill be pending--is a motion to table the Dodd amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend that we have really no alternative. That \nis the process we are in. So the answer is, I would think there would \nbe a motion to table made if we can't resolve this debate issue.\n  Mr. KYL. Also, just for the purpose of propounding a unanimous \nconsent request, Mr. President, my thought would be, given the fact we \nare about to vote on an amendment, it would help the body, obviously, \nto have a brief explanation of that amendment. I wonder if the body \nwould agree to give the Senator from Connecticut 5 minutes to explain \nhis amendment, for 5 minutes on this side, for me or----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona does not have the \nfloor and cannot make that request.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy, Mr. President, because of the suggestion \nof my friend from Arizona, to make a unanimous consent request, so that \npeople better understand this amendment, that the Senator from \nConnecticut be recognized for 5 minutes, the Senator from Arizona be \nrecognized for 5 minutes, and then following that, the Senator from \nPennsylvania would be recognized for purposes of making a motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving my right to object, may I ask if that can be \namended to allow the Senator from Louisiana 30 seconds--30 seconds--to \ngain the floor for purposes of my own choosing rather than the majority \nleader's choosing?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. REID. Is there an objection to the request I made?\n  Mr. VITTER. Regrettably, because I am being shut down, I will \ncontinue my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n         Vote on Division IV of Amendment No. 1934, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to table the Dodd amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

What I have tried to do----\n  Mr. VITTER. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield for a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. REID. No, I do not. I yield to my friend for a question, if it is \nshort. Does my friend have a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes. I would like to ask the leader if what happened, \nwhere apparently we withdrew one of the subamendments, takes unanimous \nconsent or any consent?\n  Mr. REID. No, it does not take consent.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would like to ask for clarification from the \nParliamentarian and what the effect is on that amendment?\n  Mr. REID. I would direct a question to the Chair. It is my \nunderstanding that I have the right to withdraw that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does have a right to withdraw \ndivision V.\n  Mr. VITTER. Thank you for the opportunity to ask the question.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, during the time that we were in the well \nduring the last amendment, I was told by my friend from New Jersey that \nhe had a question he wanted to ask me. We want to move on. I certainly \nwill try to get a time agreement on it. We haven't been too successful \non that in the past. I would be happy to yield to my friend\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\nfrom New Jersey for a question if, in fact, he still has one.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the majority leader yielding for a \nquestion. My question to the majority leader is----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, can we have order? These amendments are \nimportant and the Members deserve to hear the Senator.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. My question to the majority leader is: Is it his \nunderstanding that the next amendment that is up in the divisions is \nthe Menendez-Obama-Feingold amendment that would, in essence, give the \nright to U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents the ability to be \nable to claim their family under the new point system that is \nenvisioned under the bill, where that point system would, in fact, \nallow for up to 10 points, out of a 100-point score, to be subscribed \non the basis of----\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: Regular \norder.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. With an understanding that in doing so it does not \nguarantee a family member ultimately being able to achieve a visa but \nwould, in fact, give them a fighting chance under the 100-point system \nto at least have the ability----\n  Mr. VITTER. Regular order. The Senator is not asking a question.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. And would also give them the wherewithal at least to \nhave a fighting chance to come in under our visa system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey must ask a \nquestion.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I was asking a question, Madam President. I am asking \nthe majority leader for his understanding.\n  Mr. REID. I understand the question. I will respond to it right now. \nHe started it, if you read the Record, he asked me if I understand what \nhis amendment does. I do understand what it does.\n  A brief summary, Madam President. This legislation comes up with a \npoint system. The point system----\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, regular order. The Senator is not \nresponding to a question, he is making a statement; he is engaging in \ndebate.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I have a right to make a statement. Back to where I was \nbefore I was so rudely interrupted.\n  Madam President, I understand the question. In this legislation which \nhas been worked on, as I have indicated, 36 hearings, 6 days of \ncommittee action, 59 committee amendments, 21 days of Senate debate, 92 \nfloor amendments, one of the questions a number of us had and have is: \nWhat does it do for family reunification? And no one has spoken out \nmore on that issue than the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez.\n  The question he asked me is about the amendment. Now a point system \nhas been set up where the process has been used over these many months \ncoming up with this legislation to give various points to different \nparts of the immigration process.\n  Now, what my friend from New Jersey and others feel would be \nappropriate is that out of a 100-point system, 10 points would be \nallocated to someone for family reunification. I understand the \namendment. There is more to it than that, but that is a synopsis. That \nis what the amendment does. It recognizes the importance in America of \nfamily. It recognizes the importance in immigration of family.\n  Madam President, I move to table the pending amendment. I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.

I would ask the Chair how much time he has under \nthe order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I had a conversation during the vote with \nthe Senator from Alabama. I ask him at this time, would this be an \nappropriate time for him to use the 47 minutes or any part thereof?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will be pleased to use 30 minutes \nnow, and will reserve the remainder of my time, if I could.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alabama be allowed to speak, for debate purposes only, for the \nnext 30 minutes, and that following that, I be recognized to obtain the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we are in the process of dealing with \na very important issue. A number of our colleagues--in some ways \ndismissive, I think, of the concerns of the American public--refer it \nto as an emotional issue. I think it is more than an emotional issue. I \nthink it is a serious issue that requires our serious concern. It \nrequires that this great Senate, on a matter of tremendous importance \nto our Nation and to our constituents, do it correctly.\n  I love my colleagues who met to try to write this bill. I believe \ntheir hearts were correct. But they are not law enforcement officers. \nThey have not investigated and prosecuted cases. They apparently were \ninundated with information and ideas, and so forth, from special \ninterest groups and others.\n  I have said I wish the American people had been in the room. I wish \nthe head of our Border Patrol association had been in the room or \nperhaps the chief of Border Patrol during President Reagan's tenure or \nthe chief of Border Patrol during former President Bush's tenure. All \nof those people, including the current chairman of the association of \nretired Border Patrol officers, have criticized this bill in the most \nsevere manner, saying it is a slap in the face to people who followed \nthe law, saying it will not work, saying the 24-hour name check is not \ngoing to work at all, and will not provide security to our country, \nthat it will actually be a benefit to terrorists. I am not saying this; \nthey said this. It would be a benefit to terrorists. One called it the \n``Terrorist Relief Act,'' or something to that effect.\n  What I want to tell my colleagues is, the professionals who deal with \nthese issues absolutely oppose this legislation. Now, we can dismiss \nthat. Maybe you talk to somebody from some news outlet or talk to \nsomebody from some business group or some activist organization, and \nmaybe you have a different view. But the people who enforce the laws \nevery day oppose this legislation.\n\n[[Page S8589]]\n\nThey do not believe it will work. I suggest it will be demoralizing to \nthem.\n  Our own Congressional Budget Office has analyzed the legislation. We \nhave them for our use. We rely on that organization. It operates under \nthe Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the majority leader here, \nand all of us. It is a bipartisan group. But the Congressional Budget \nOffice has analyzed our current law and concluded that if current law \nis not changed, we will have 10 million more illegal immigrants in our \ncountry in the next 20 years. We have 12 million now, maybe 20 million. \nBut we would have 10 million more under current law. They say if this \nlegislation were to be passed, we would have some reduction of \nillegality at the border--not much--but we would have an increase in \nvisa overstays because we have so many temporary guest worker programs \ngoing on, and the net result would be that this Nation would only have \na reduction of 13 percent in the illegal flow of immigrants into our \ncountry. Indeed, there would be 8.9 million more persons illegally in \nour country 20 years from now than today.\n  Now, what does that say about my good and well-intentioned colleagues \nwho are trying to tell us all that the thing is going to work, that if \nyou do not pass this amnesty, if you do not give these benefits to \npeople who came here illegally, then you will not get enforcement?\n  Well, we are not getting enforcement, everyone. The bill does not \nprovide enforcement--not in any significant way that would allow us to \nproceed effectively.\n  We had hearings in our committees that dealt with the question of the \nimpact of large numbers of foreign workers on the wages of American \nworkers. It is not, I think, subject to dispute. At the current rate we \nare going, at the current rate of immigration, legal and illegal, wages \nof lower income Americans are being adversely affected. Professor \nBorjas at Harvard, who has written a most authoritative technical book \non immigration at the Kennedy School, has said it has brought down the \nwage of low-income workers 8 percent. That is a lot. That is a lot, an \n8-percent decline in wages. In many areas, it could be even greater \nthan that, I suspect. It is pretty understandable that it would happen. \nIf you bring in more cotton in this country, if you bring in more \ncotton, you will have a lower price for cotton. If you bring in corn, \nyou will have a lower price for corn. If you bring in large amounts of \nlabor, it will pull down the value of a working man's hourly wage. So I \nam concerned about that.\n\n  My colleagues have said a number of times that by getting this--Madam \nPresident, there is a little bit of a buzz.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So we have a number of questions that cause us concern. \nI talked about wages. Let me mention the rule of law.\n  Our Nation is founded on law. Edmund Burke, when he talked about \nreconciliation between the Colonies and the King, asked that there not \nbe a war against the Colonies. He said: They follow us in law. He even \nsaid: I understand the Colonies have more copies of Blackstone's \nCommentaries on the law than they have in England.\n  We have always been a nation of laws. It is our strength. We should \nnot create a system that will not restore that law, even at our \nborders; otherwise, we are going to have a difficult situation.\n  Under this bill, we carefully looked at the number. I don't think \nanyone will dispute it. The level of legal immigration will double--\ndouble the amount of legal immigration. That is a number I don't think \nmost Americans understand. I think they are worried about the current \nlevel, which is at about the highest this Nation has ever had--highest \nby far in real numbers we have ever had--and it is going to double, \nwithout any reduction in illegal immigration. So this is a bargain, a \ngrand bargain we should not take. If we do, I think we will regret it \nbecause the American people are not going to be happy with us.\n  By the way, the polls continue to show that our constituents \noverwhelmingly oppose this legislation. A decent respect for our own \nconstituents, even if we might think them wrong, on an issue of this \nimportance where they are so decidedly hostile to this legislation \nsuggests we ought to slow down and listen to them and talk with them \nabout what their concerns are and make sure when we go back home and \ncampaign and seek reelection, we can look them in the eye and say: I \nheard your concern, and I fixed that concern, or I believe the \nlegislation answers your concern.\n  But here we have a completely new bill that has been plopped down on \nthe Senate floor, first with over 700 pages, and then I guess last \nnight there was a 370-page amendment, and that had so many errors in it \nthat even the sponsors themselves have plopped down another amendment \nof 403 pages. They want to vote that through right away. I don't think \nthat is what we owe our constituents.\n  They say: Well, we have had 2 years of debate, and all that. We had a \nbill last year that was quite different from this one. It had some \nthings in it better than this one. I thought this year's bill was going \nto be better, and said it was better several times, but it actually--as \nI have studied it, I am not sure it is any better. It is weaker in a \nnumber of different areas. For sure, it is weaker in a number of \ndifferent areas. So that is a matter we should consider as we go \nforward with this legislation. I think we ought to give careful \nattention to what we are doing.\n  I want to address one more very important matter that very fine \nSenators have raised. They have suggested one of the best things that \nis going to be happening with this legislation is everybody will be \ngiven an identification, and the Nation will be safer for that. \nTherefore, even if the bill is not perfect and has lots of problems, \nlet's vote for it anyway because it has that in it. Let me share some \nthoughts with my colleagues on that issue.\n  Michael Cutler, who is a retired INS--Immigration and Naturalization \nService--senior agent, participated in a press conference last Thursday \nat the National Press Club. It focused on the grave threat to national \nsecurity the immigration bill represents. He also authored an op-ed in \nthe Washington Times last Friday entitled ``Immigration Bill a No Go.'' \nThis is an experienced INS agent. He focused on the security question \nin the bill: Does it make us safer? This is what he said. I doubt our \ngood friends who met in secret and wrote this bill asked his opinion, \nbut this is what he says after reading it:\n\n       If a person--\n\n  Let me quote:\n\n     If a person lies about his or her identity and has never been \n     fingerprinted in our country, what will enable the \n     bureaucrats at the USCIS--\n\n  That is who will be checking his 24-hour background----\n\n     the bureaucrats at USCIS to know that person's true identity? \n     If the adjudicators simply make a fictitious identity through \n     a computerized database, they will simply find the name has \n     no known connection to any criminal or terrorist watch list.\n       What is the value of that? Remember, we are talking about a \n     false name. There is absolutely no way this program would \n     have even a shred of integrity and the identity documents \n     that would be given these millions of illegal aliens would \n     enable every one of them to receive a driver's license, \n     Social Security card, and other such official identity \n     documents in a false name. Undoubtedly, terrorists would be \n     among those applying to participate in this ill-conceived \n     program. They would then be able to open bank accounts and \n     obtain credit cards in that false name. Finally, these cards \n     would enable these aliens to board airlines and trains even \n     if their true names appear on all of the various terrorist \n     watch lists and no-fly lists. That is why I have come to \n     refer to this legislation as the ``Terrorist Assistance and \n     Facilitation Act of 2007.''\n\n  Do you get it? Unless you already happen to be fingerprinted and you \ncome here and you are a known terrorist and you give a false name with \nsome false electric bill, they will give you this temporary visa and \nyou get an ID then. Before, if you are illegal, you would have a hard \ntime getting a bank account or a Social Security card or a driver's \nlicense. Now, you are given one. You can travel all over the country \nwith no problems. That is what he is saying. So in many ways, it is \ngoing to facilitate a dangerous situation.\n\n  How about this gentleman, Mr. Kris Kobach, a former Department of \nJustice attorney under Attorney General Ashcroft, who specialized in \nthe Department of Justice in terrorism and immigration issues and who \nhas spoken out often and is a college professor\n\n[[Page S8590]]\n\nnow. He agrees with Mr. Cutler. He posted an article on the Heritage \nFoundation Web site titled ``The Senate Immigration Bill: A National \nSecurity Nightmare.'' He says:\n\n       The bill will make it easier for alien terrorists who \n     operate in the United States by allowing them to create \n     fraudulent identities with ease. Supporters of the Senate's \n     comprehensive immigration reform bill have revived it under \n     the guise of national security. However, the new public \n     relations campaign is a farce. The bill offers alien \n     terrorists new pathways to obtain legal status, which will \n     make it easier for them to carry out deadly attacks against \n     American citizens. The top priority in this bill is extending \n     amnesty as quickly and as easily as possible to as many \n     illegal aliens as possible. The cost of doing so is to \n     jeopardize national security.\n\n  That is Mr. Kris Kobach who has testified before Congress a number of \ntimes, former Assistant Attorney General specializing in immigration \nand national security issues.\n  So I urge my colleagues to look at this bill because we don't need to \npass a piece of legislation that we can't defend to our constituents, \nthat we cannot tell our constituents with confidence it will make them \nsafer. It will reduce illegality dramatically at the border 13 percent; \n80, 90, 95 percent is the goal we should have to reduce illegality, and \nthat should be the beginning point. We can get there. We don't need to \npass a piece of legislation that is going to double the legal flow, not \nreduce the illegal flow, and end up having the wages of Americans \nfurther diminished by this incredibly large flow of low-skilled, low-\nwage workers. We don't need to further erode the morale of our Border \nPatrol officers and erode American confidence in the rule of law.\n  Those are my thoughts. I hope we will give this serious consideration \nas we make our judgment tomorrow about whether we should proceed. If we \ndon't proceed tomorrow, that is not the end. Of course, we are going to \nconsider this bill and this issue--continue to consider it. Polling \ndata suggests the American people, what they want us to do, is to take \nincremental steps focusing on enforcement.\n  Why don't we just do that? We might could get that done. That would \nbe what I suggest.\n  Also, one more time, I urge my colleagues to give the most serious \nconsideration to the procedure by which we are moving forward with this \nlegislation. People have said it is unfair. I think it is unfair, but \nit is more than unfair. It is a historic departure from the traditions \nof the Senate. The leader of this Senate is arrogating to himself the \nability to approve every single amendment that is voted on. No \namendment can be voted on the leader does not approve. That is the way \nthis clay pigeon has been set up. That has never been done before. Any \nSenators willing to come down here and battle and hold out and not give \nup can get his amendments up and voted on. I think it is a matter that \nmost of us haven't fully comprehended yet. I think Senators who are \nproud of the great ability of individual Senators, when they feel \nstrongly about an issue--it doesn't happen often--but they can stand up \nand make sure their amendments get voted on, and they have an \nopportunity to speak.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama has about 27 minutes in the time \nthat has been ordered; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 28 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I am also of the understanding, having spoken to the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, that Senator \nSessions is at this time willing to give him part of the time he has \nbeen allocated for debate only on this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Iowa be recognized for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will yield up to 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, Madam President.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand this would be time allotted to me. The \nSenator does still have his entitlement to speak on his amendment when \nthat appropriate time comes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the Senator from Iowa is going \nto take 10 minutes of the time of the Senator from Alabama for debate, \nand if we have an opportunity to debate his amendment, of course, he \ncan speak on it.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, if this is a unanimous \nconsent request, I have comments to make in opposition to the amendment \nof the Senator from Iowa and would like to be afforded an opportunity \nto do so. So if the agreement is to afford time to one side, but the \nother side won't get an opportunity to speak, then I will object to \nthat. I hope we can work something out where I would get at least 5 \nminutes. The Senator from Iowa should have time to debate his \namendment, but I want time to respond.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I can handle the issue dealing with the \nSenator from Iowa because that is simply time the Senator from Alabama \nis giving him. As to the amendment itself, I know how strongly the \nSenator from Arizona feels on this amendment. He has explained that to \nme. He knows what we have been going through trying to get people the \nopportunity to speak. The only thing I can do now is ask unanimous \nconsent that the time of the Senator from Alabama, which is 10 minutes, \nbe allocated to the Senator from Iowa for debate only, leaving the \nSenator from Alabama, at a subsequent time, 17 or 18 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, under the circumstances \nand the nature of the amendment, I am prepared to yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Iowa from the balance of my time.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is very fair. I thank the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  I propound a unanimous consent request that the Senator from Iowa be \nrecognized for 5 minutes from the time given to the Senator from \nAlabama and 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona for debate only.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No, I object, Madam President. If the Senator is going \nto be speaking on his amendment, it is not mine. I don't like his \namendment. I am going to give him 5 minutes out of courtesy. I am \ndisappointed that the Senator from Arizona would not be able to \nrespond.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I don't care if I speak. Let's forget all this. I can \nspeak some other time. I would like to say why I ought to have debate \non my amendment. If I don't talk about the substance of the amendment, \ncan I talk about why I ought to be able to bring up the amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from Iowa looks at me. The majority leader \nwon't allow you to speak. I was trying to give you 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would you mind if I said why I ought to be able to \nbring my amendment up?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Iowa, I have been trying all day to \nallow people to speak to their heart's content. I have had objections. \nAt this time, I have no objection to you speaking for a reasonable \nperiod of time and the Senator from Arizona speaking for a reasonable \nperiod of time. You can talk about your amendment, and he can talk \nabout why he doesn't like your amendment. Forget about the Senator from \nAlabama. He reserved his 28 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Iowa be recognized for \nup to 10 minutes for debate only, and following his remarks, I ask that \nthe Senator from Arizona be recognized for up to 10 minutes for debate \nonly and following their remarks, that I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 10 minutes and then the \nSenator from Arizona for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you. I am not going to talk about the substance \nof my amendment. I want to remind people before the amendment comes up \nthat, No. 1, I was promised by the Senator from Pennsylvania and, in \nturn, his talking to the Senator from Massachusetts, that I would have \nan opportunity to offer an amendment. Now I\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\nhave that opportunity to offer the amendment, so that promise has been \nkept. I have tried to clear it with my Republican colleagues who have \nbeen objecting all afternoon so that they would not object to my \nefforts to offer and debate my amendment. So I hope you realize it \ndoesn't do much good to make a promise for me to offer my amendment if \nI don't have an opportunity to debate the amendment. That is the first \npoint.\n\n  The second point is that I should not even be here having to offer \nthis amendment. If you go back to that Thursday afternoon in April when \nthere were rump sessions in S. 219, I was invited by some of the people \nto the rump session who were working on this compromise--to come in and \noffer a compromise on Social Security identification, employer \nidentification, or verification. I went to that meeting and sat there \nfor a long time and explained a compromise. I had no objections to the \ncompromise at that particular time, but 3 weeks later, the document \ncomes out and it is not the compromise I had presented, which I assumed \nwas agreed to. That doesn't surprise me because going back to January \nor February, Senator Kyl had met with me and some other people, because \nthis is in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee--we have \njurisdiction over IRS and over the Social Security system--saying that \nthey were very strongly in favor of having something that went way \nbeyond protecting the privacy of Internal Revenue tax records and \nSocial Security information and were hellbent on going down a route of \ngiving the Department of Homeland Security any sort of information they \nwant, not within the tradition of protecting the privacy of income tax \nrecords.\n  So that is why my amendment is being offered, because I am going back \nto that compromise which I presented to the committee in the rump \nsession back in April which I thought was OK. I find out now that it is \nnot. That is why I am going to offer my amendment.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Seven minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to speak generally about the \nlegislation before us.\n  There is some concern that I have expressed--not so much on the floor \nbut in other public comments I made--that I am one of about 22 or 23 \nMembers of the Senate who were here in 1986 when we passed amnesty, as \nis in this bill as well. I was one of those Senators who voted for \namnesty at that particular time. At that particular time, we had maybe \n1 million to 3 million people cross the border illegally and who were \nhere illegally. We all thought--and there have been plenty of \nreferences to statements made in the Congressional Record 20 years \nago--that if we were to adopt amnesty, it would settle this problem \nonce and for all, do it once and for all. You know, I believed that. \nBut do you know what I found out maybe 5 or 10 years ago? When you \nreward illegality, you get more of it. Now the guesstimate is that we \nhave 12 million people here illegally. They are not illegal people, but \nthey came here illegally.\n  I think I have an obligation to consider the votes I made before and, \nif they are wrong, not make that mistake again. You know, it is a \nlittle like the chaos you would have if you didn't respect and enforce \nred lights and stop signs. You would have chaos at intersections and \naccidents. Wherever you don't enforce the rule of law, those are the \nthings that happen. You need social cohesion, and social cohesion comes \nfrom respect for the rule of law in our country.\n  So it seems to me that, as we go down this road, what we ought to do \nis concentrate on legal immigration, the reforms we are bringing to the \nH-1B program, the reforms we are bringing in the way of a temporary \nworker program. People would rather come here legally rather than \nillegally, I believe. I know it is not very satisfying to people to \nhear that we have 12 million people in the underground. The point is \nthat if people could come here legally to work, they would soon, one by \none, by attrition, replace people who are here illegally, I believe.\n  I am not one who wants to make that mistake again. That is why I am \nweighing very heavily the issue of what we do with amnesty or what \nother people who don't like the word ``amnesty'' would say is earned \ncitizenship, guest worker program, those sorts of things that are \ncovering up really what we are doing.\n  I say if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it is a \nduck. If it looks like amnesty, it is amnesty. That is the bottom line. \nWe ought to learn the lesson that in 1986 it didn't work. I don't think \nit will work now. I am 73 years old, so obviously I am not going to be \nhere 20 years from now when we have another immigration bill. But I \nshould not make that problem so that a successor of mine has to deal \nwith 25 million people being here illegally as opposed to the 12 \nmillion now or the 1 to 3 million before.\n  I yield the floor and whatever time I didn't use I will retain or \nwhatever is done with the surplus.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't you just yield it back?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is to be recognized at this point for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, may I be notified after 5 minutes so I might \nyield time to Senator Kennedy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nIowa. He was absolutely assured by people on our side that he would be \nallowed to bring up an amendment, and I am glad we have been able to do \nthat. He certainly should be afforded that right.\n  With that said, however, I can't match his opposition to the bill \nwith his amendment. If you want to assure that the bill will not work, \nthen adopt the Grassley amendment. It substitutes the existing title \nIII in the bill, which is a very good title to ensure employee \nverification, with a potpourri of provisions that, frankly, look a lot \nlike the status quo and will not ensure that employees are adequately \nchecked to ensure they are entitled to be employed.\n  For example, the Grassley amendment provides that none of the current \nemployees are checked. In other words, the only people who have to be \nchecked are future employees, so all the people working today, \nincluding all the illegal immigrants working today, don't have to be \nchecked under the Grassley amendment.\n  Secondly, amazingly, the only way to physically verify that the \nperson seeking the job is, in fact, the person with the identity \nentitled to be employed is with a photograph. Nobody is proposing that \nwe fingerprint people to get jobs, and that leaves the photograph as \nthe best identity document. The bill provides that either a passport \nwith a photograph or a driver's license with a photograph be the \ndocument. You have to verify that the person standing in front of you \nis the person to whom the document has been issued and the rightful \nowner of the Social Security number he has given you.\n  The Grassley amendment does not require that a photograph be used in \nthe identification process. This is one of the first things that was \nrecommended by the 9/11 Commission, to have a secure document with a \nphotograph with which you can confirm identity.\n  Third, and this is amazing, and I honestly don't understand why this \nwould be in the Senator's amendment, but it gives foreign temporary \nworkers the right to file legal complaints against employers who hire \nAmerican workers instead--basically, to file a discrimination complaint \nbased upon the fact that they were not hired.\n  Current law does not permit temporary workers to file these \ncomplaints. The basic bill would not allow workers to file these \ncomplaints. But the amendment does this by eliminating current laws \nthat prohibit temporary workers from filing a discrimination claim \nbased on immigration status.\n  Next, one of the key things we did after 9/11 was to ensure that \nGovernment agencies could share information with each other. When we \ndetermined the best way to ensure people are legally eligible to work, \nwe quickly understood that we had to have sharing of information from \nthe Social Security Administration, from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, even, in some cases, from the Internal Revenue Service. \nUnless these agencies are able to\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\nshare the information with each other when we access the databases, we \nare not going to know for sure whether the individual is entitled to be \nemployed. What the amendment provides is that after 5 years, the \ninformation-sharing provisions are sunsetted.\n  None of these are really calculated to ensure that we can have a good \nemployee verification system. They undercut that system and, as a \nresult, they would weaken our ability to ensure employee eligibility to \nwork.\n  Finally, in some cases, we have employers who are violating IRS rules \nbecause they don't report income. The underlying bill allows the IRS to \nidentify those employers and go after them. This is one of the things \nthe American people are upset with today, that we are not going after \nemployers who are violating the law, who commit tax violations in \nhiring unlawful workers. The underlying bill allows us to do that. The \namendment doesn't allow us to do that, and I don't understand why.\n  The bottom line is that title III of the underlying bill is a very \ngood, strong provision supported on a bipartisan basis to ensure that \nwe can verify the eligibility of workers to be employed.\n  Title III, unfortunately, is weakened dramatically by this Grassley \namendment which would in all the five ways I indicated undercut our \nability to verify employment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona has explained \nthe technical provisions of this legislation very well, but I want to \nunderscore a very important difference. And that is how each system \nwill treat their workers.\n  If there is some glitch in the system, under the legislation before \nus, under the existing law, the worker should be able to continue to \nwork and can continue to work until ultimately there is a determination \nby a court that the worker should not be confirmed. The decision being \nappealed is called a nonconfirmation. If there is a glitch in the \nsystem--and we understand there are going to be a number of glitches in \nthe system, but this was a provision that we took a considerable amount \nof time to make sure that workers who are going to be caught up in the \nsystem, if there is a glitch in the system, they will still be able to \ncontinue to work until there is a real indication of trouble. They will \ncontinue to work, unlike the proposal of the Senator from Iowa.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Iowa says that if there is found to \nbe some glitch in the system, they will have a legal case, but they \nwill have to demonstrate--this is the test: that the government's \nconduct has either been negligent, reckless, willful, or malicious. The \nemployee will have to demonstrate one of those qualities, which means \nthey have to go out and get a lawyer. They will be let go, and they \nwill have to go out and get a lawyer and go through the whole legal \nprocess in order to recover some damages. There is a large difference.\n  I believe the underlying provisions which have been included--this is \nit, and I agree this is one of the most important provisions in the \nlegislation. We want employer enforcement. That has to be a part of it. \nTough borders that are going to be enforced and legality in the \nworkplace, and the only way we are going to have legality in the \nworkplace and also protection for the workers is the underlying bill.\n  The bill requires SSA to begin issuing only fraud-resistant, tamper-\nresistant, wear-resistant Social Security cards within 2 years. This \nwill help prevent counterfeiting and identity theft by undocumented \nworkers. The Grassley amendment has no comparable provision. It only \nrequires that the worker give an employer a Social Security number \nrather than presenting an actual card.\n  If we are serious, and I think all of us in this body, are serious, \nabout dealing with the undocumented, we have to have tough worksite \nenforcement, and we are also going to have to have tamper-proof cards. \nI think this moves us in that direction in a very positive and \nimportant way.\n  As I say, most importantly, at a time that we are going to go into \nthis transition, how are the workers going to be treated, and really \nthere is a dramatic difference between how those workers are going to \nbe treated under the proposal we put forward under the existing bill \nand under the Grassley amendment.\n  For these reasons, I hope his amendment will not be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa retains 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have 3 minutes left, I have been told. \nFirst of all, I think the Senator from Massachusetts was doing a good \njob reading from a letter Secretary Chertoff sent to me. I sent back a \nrebuttal letter, and I would like to provide the letter for the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts to read. It is a point-by-point rebuttal of what is \nwrong with Secretary Chertoff's analysis of my amendment.\n  One of the criticisms that Senator Kyl gave against my amendment is \nwe are not going to force employers to look through 160 million workers \nto find illegal workers. Let's look at the basic legislation. The \nlegislation legalizes people who are here already illegally. So if they \nare illegally working, and this bill legalizes them, don't you see how \nridiculous it is that we are going to tell people to go out and find \npeople who are here illegally when the bill has already legalized them?\n  The second point is that we eliminate the requirement of a photograph \nfor identification. My amendment requires every U.S. citizen to present \na passport or driver's license and every noncitizen to present a legal \npermanent resident card or work authorization card. Each of these \ndocuments is required to contain an individual's photograph.\n  Moreover, my amendment requires workers to submit their passport \nnumber, driver's license number, or employment authorization number in \naddition to their Social Security number through the employment \nverification system. Without that information, there is no guarantee \nthat Homeland Security will be able to contact the issuing agencies or \ndetermine which document was issued. This is the very same problem that \nhas prevented Homeland Security from utilizing Social Security \nAdministration data in the past.\n  My amendment further requires the Social Security Administration, the \nState Department, and the State departments of motor vehicles to \nestablish a reliable and secure method to allow the Department of \nHomeland Security to verify the identity document of each issuing \nagency.\n  On another point Senator Kyl made saying it eliminates after 5 years \nthe information sharing among Government departments, which is critical \nto making this work, a sunset is standard practice when we compromise \nthe protection for the individual taxpayer, that the taxpayer's income \ntax information will be private so that, like President Johnson and \nPresident Nixon, it cannot be used to violate your privacy for \npolitical reasons. That is why that law was passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nseveral letters regarding this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2007.\n     Hon. Michael Chertoff,\n     U.S. Department of Homeland Security,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are again disappointed that you have \n     written another erroneous and misleading letter regarding our \n     amendment to Title III of the immigration bill. However, we \n     appreciate the opportunity to explain why our amendment \n     provides a more cost effective and administratively feasible \n     employment verification system.\n       (1) Your letter states that ``employers have no independent \n     obligation to resolve no-match problems . . . (DHS) could \n     only ask employers to resolve no-match problems.'' This \n     statement reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of our \n     amendment. Our amendment establishes criteria to determine \n     mandatory participation in the employment verification system \n     with respect to current workers. Current workers identified \n     by DHS would be verified through the employment verification \n     system in exactly the same manner as newly hired workers.\n       The purpose of an employment verification system is to \n     prevent unauthorized workers from using fraudulent Social \n     Security numbers (SSN) or misusing legitimate SSNs to obtain \n     employment in the United States. This goal is accomplished by \n     comparing the name and SSN submitted by the worker to the \n     records maintained by the Social Security Administration. \n     Regardless of whether\n\n[[Page S8593]]\n\n     this comparison occurs when a worker is hired, or when a \n     worker's W-2 is processed, the result is the same.\n       Our amendment requires every employer to verify every newly \n     hired worker through the employment verification system. \n     According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, more than 60 \n     million workers would be verified each year through this \n     process. In addition, under current tax law, every employer \n     must submit an annual W-2 for every worker. According to \n     Social Security Administration data, more than 160 million \n     workers will be verified each year through this process.\n       Requiring every employer to verify every worker through the \n     employment verification system would merely duplicate the \n     results of verifying every worker through the W-2 process. If \n     the names and SSNs match in one case, there is no reason to \n     believe they won't match in the other case. In order to avoid \n     needless duplication, our amendment allows DHS to obtain data \n     through the W-2 process and thereby identify every worker \n     using a fraudulent SSN, or misusing a legitimate SSN. The \n     employers of these workers would be required to utilize \n     the employment verification system to verify each of these \n     workers.\n       (2) Your letter states that under the version of Title III \n     supported by DHS ``we will be relying on electronic \n     verification . . . [to prevent] . . . illegal employment. \n     Your amendment does not require equivalent security \n     measures.'' This statement reflects a fundamental \n     misunderstanding of our amendment. Our amendment requires \n     workers to submit their Passport number, driver's license \n     number, or employment authorization number (as applicable \n     based on citizenship status) in addition to their Social \n     Security number through the employment verification system. \n     It further requires SSA, the State Department, and state DMV \n     agencies to establish a reliable and secure method to allow \n     DHS to verify the identity documents issued by each agency. \n     Thus, DHS will be able to determine when identity documents \n     are fraudulent or when more than one person is using the same \n     legitimate document.\n       Our amendment differs from the approach envisioned in the \n     version of Title III being supported by DHS. The approach \n     being advocated by DHS would require employers to verify the \n     photo on every identity document presented by every employee \n     at the time of hiring. This represents an unnecessary and \n     overly burdensome requirement for workers and employers. Our \n     amendment would allow DHS to generate a tentative \n     nonconfirmation whenever the identification number does not \n     match agency records, or when the same number appears \n     multiple times. In such cases, the employee would be required \n     to resolve the tentative non-confirmation with the issuing \n     agency.\n       (3) Your letter states ``The need for no-match information \n     . . . will not disappear in five years.'' Our amendment \n     provides DHS with the ability to independently verify SSNs, \n     state driver's license numbers, and U.S. Passport numbers. \n     There is no reason to believe continued access to SSA no-\n     match data will be necessary once DHS has fully implemented \n     the employment verification system. However, should continued \n     access be needed, we would fully support an extension of the \n     5-year limitation, provided DHS meets its obligation to \n     protect and properly use this confidential taxpayer data.\n       (4) Your letter states that we ``. . . misunderstand the \n     current bill . . .'' There is no misunderstanding on our \n     part. The current version of Title III supported by DHS \n     states ``An employer may not terminate an individual's \n     employment solely because that individual has been issued a \n     further action notice . . . [ or] . . . reduce salary, \n     bonuses, or other compensation . . .'' The comments in our \n     previous letter referred to individuals who are issued a \n     ``final nonconfirmation,'' not a further action notice. \n     Moreover, your letter states ``. . . the current bill allows \n     workers to earn a living while they appeal what they believe \n     to be erroneous eligibility determinations.'' This statement \n     is true only with respect to a further action notice. The \n     current version of Title III supported by DHS does not \n     require employers to pay workers who appeal a final \n     nonconfirmation. In contrast, our amendment protects workers \n     throughout the entire appeals process.\n       (5) Your letter states we oppose the requirement that \n     employers resolve no match letters ``. . . because the \n     letters are not sent to every single employer.'' That is not \n     correct. We oppose the no-match requirement because it is \n     ineffective and unenforceable. DHS would have no knowledge of \n     who received a no-match letter. Moreover, employers could \n     continue to rely on the current flawed I-9 process to \n     ``resolve'' their no-match letters. Our amendment would allow \n     DHS to readily identify every single employer with a no-\n     match, and target those with the biggest problem for worksite \n     enforcement or accelerated participation in the employment \n     verification system.\n       Thank you for providing us with the opportunity to explain \n     our amendment. We stand ready to work with you to create a \n     more effective and feasible verification system.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Grassley.\n     Max Baucus.\n     Barack Obama.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Department of Homeland Security,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2007.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I received your June 20, 2007 letter \n     regarding my concerns that your amendment to the immigration \n     reform legislation represents a serious step backward in our \n     worksite enforcement effort. I must respectfully disagree \n     with your statement that your amendment ``would improve Title \n     III.'' On the contrary, reading your response to my letter \n     underscores my initial concerns, for the following reasons:\n       (1) Your letter acknowledges that under the Grassley-\n     Baucus-Obama amendment, employers need not use the Electronic \n     Employment Verification System (EEVS) to find out whether \n     their existing employees are working legally except ``when \n     there is evidence to suspect unlawful employment.'' Under \n     your amendment, employers have no independent obligation to \n     resolve no match problems, and the Department of Homeland \n     Security (DHS) could only ask employers to resolve no-match \n     problems if DHS already had enough information to begin an \n     investigation. But if DHS has enough information to begin an \n     investigation, it should not ask employers for their help, \n     The value of verification is that it generates evidence of \n     unlawful behavior. It is odd to say that DHS must have \n     evidence of potential wrongdoing before utilizing the best \n     means of uncovering this wrongdoing in the first place.\n       DHS has no intention of asking employers to act as police. \n     The EEVS is a convenient nondiscriminatory but powerful tool \n     that will bring violations to DHS's attention without \n     imposing heavy burdens on employers. We should not impose \n     arbitrary limits on its use.\n       (2) As you observe, the current bill requires that only \n     secure licenses and identification cards be accepted after \n     2013. In the meantime, we will be relying on electronic \n     verification as the principal means of identifying identity \n     fraud and preventing illegal employment. Your amendment does \n     not require equivalent security measures. In view of the \n     widespread industry specializing in production of fake \n     documents, I believe that your amendment keeps us and \n     innocent employers vulnerable to such documents and weakens \n     the protections against identity theft.\n       (3) We all agree that DHS should have access to the ``no-\n     match'' information that both the current bill and your \n     amendment allow. Our difference arises from the fact that the \n     Grassley-Baucus-Obama amendment arbitrarily cuts off that \n     access after five years. As you will recall, our recent \n     enforcement efforts have shown that fake IDs and made-up \n     Social Security numbers are rampant in many industries. The \n     need for ``no-match'' information to combat such fraud win \n     not disappear in five years.\n       We should not exempt employers from enforcement of \n     immigration laws because we fear that they may refuse to \n     comply with tax law. I am confident that the vast majority of \n     employers want to follow the law. Indeed, our enforcement \n     system rests on the expectation that individuals--employers \n     and employees alike--will obey the law. For those few who may \n     flout the law, however, the tight response is more \n     enforcement, not less.\n       (4) I believe your letter misunderstands the current bill \n     in one important respect. The current Title III would not \n     allow employers to cut off pay to workers who seek \n     administrative review of their further action notices. In \n     fact, Title III expressly prohibits businesses from doing so, \n     or from taking other adverse actions against an employee who \n     received such a notice.\n       I am pleased to correct this misunderstanding.\n       I am also surprised that you appear to prefer a system \n     requiring that a worker who receives a nonconfirmation notice \n     be fired first, and that he pursue his administrative and \n     judicial appeal while unemployed, with the distant prospect \n     of getting back lost wages. By contrast, the current bill \n     allows workers to earn a living while they appeal what they \n     believe to be erroneous eligibility determinations.\n       (5) We agree that the Grassley-Baucus-Obama amendment does \n     not require employers to act on the no-match notices they \n     receive. You argue that the law should not require employers \n     to resolve no-match letters because the letters are not sent \n     to every single employer. But the letters are sent to the \n     employers with the biggest no-match problems. And your \n     alternative proposed solution is far less effective. Your \n     amendment proposes that all of the no-match data be sent to \n     DHS, which would then have to repeat everything that the \n     Social Security Administration has already done to locate and \n     send notices to employers whose employees may be violating \n     the law.\n       In sum, I committed to inform the bill managers if I became \n     concerned about an amendment that would threaten the \n     enforceability and/or workability of the underlying bill A \n     good enforcement program benefits the vast majority of law \n     abiding employers by ensuring that they are not competitively \n     disadvantaged by the unscrupulous few. Unfortunately, I \n     continue to believe that your amendment will perpetuate the \n     kinds of obstacles that have burdened effective enforcement \n     of immigration law at the worksite since 1986.\n       I appreciate your genuine concern about this matter and \n     please know that I am always glad to meet and discuss these \n     concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Chertoff.\n\n[[Page S8594]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael Chertoff,\n     Department of Homeland Security,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are extremely disappointed that your \n     June 19th letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter contained a \n     number of erroneous and misleading allegations regarding our \n     amendment to Title III.\n       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:\n       ``(1) Job Security for Criminal Aliens . . . existing \n     workers are never checked out . . .''\n       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:\n       The pending immigration bill requires all employers to run \n     all existing workers through the verification system within \n     three years. This is an onerous and unnecessary requirement \n     given the fact that these workers are already subject to the \n     annual wage reporting (no-match) process. Our amendment would \n     require employers to run existing workers through the system \n     only when there is evidence to suspect unlawful employment. \n     To accomplish this goal, DHS would be given access to Social \n     Security and IRS data to identify all mismatched, duplicate, \n     deceased, minor children, or non-work SSNs.\n       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:\n       ``(2) Loophole for Fake Documents . . . present any \n     driver's license . . . not required to . . . provide a second \n     document . . . eliminate grant program . . .''\n       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:\n       The pending immigration bill says state driver's licenses \n     and ID cards that are not REAL ID compliant will no longer be \n     accepted beginning in 2013. The language also gives the \n     Secretary of DHS the authority to modify state driver's \n     licenses and ID cards prior to the implementation of REAL ID. \n     Finally, it authorizes--but does not fund--grants to States \n     for REAL ID. Congress can only fund REAL ID though the \n     appropriations process. Our amendment avoids imposing an \n     arbitrary deadline and allows the continued use of state \n     driver's licenses and ID cards (subject to new verification \n     procedures with the state DMVs) in recognition of the fact \n     that final implementation of REAL ID remains in doubt.\n       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:\n       ``(3) Arbitrary End to Information Sharing . . . cuts off \n     all information sharing after five years . . .''\n       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:\n       The pending immigration bill provides DHS with access to \n     Social Security and IRS data. Our amendment would sunset \n     these provisions after five years, subject to a future \n     extension, as is standard practice when allowing access to \n     private taxpayer data for the first time for a new purpose. \n     Moreover, the long-term value of SSA and IRS data for \n     immigration enforcement is highly suspect. Once employers \n     realize their W-2s will be used against them, they may simply \n     stop filing suspect W-2s.\n       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:\n       ``(4) Punishing the Enforcers Instead of the Violators . . \n     . individuals . . . can seek compensation . . . even if the \n     initial error was caused by the individual and not the \n     government . . . ''\n       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:\n       The pending immigration bill prohibits employers from \n     firing workers for as long as DHS wants to review a worker's \n     appeal of a final nonconfirmation notice. This would force \n     employers to keep workers on their books, but allow them not \n     to be paid, while the government attempts to find and correct \n     the mistakes in its databases. This will put legal workers in \n     a financial bind while providing no incentive for DHS to \n     improve the system. Under our amendment, illegal workers who \n     receive a final nonconfirmation notice would be immediately \n     fired. But, legal workers who are erroneously fired could \n     recover lost wages, if they did not cause the error, and the \n     government was at fault.\n       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:\n       ``(5) Ignoring the Government's Best Evidence of Illegal \n     Workers . . . Grassley-Baucus-Obama . . . would not . . . \n     require employers to resolve no-match letters''\n       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:\n       The pending immigration bill requires employers to retain \n     SSA no-match letters and document steps taken to resolve \n     them. But, SSA sends no-match letters only when there are \n     more than 10 employees whose names and numbers do not \n     match, and the total number of no-matches exceeds 0.5 \n     percent of total employees. Thus, an employer with 11 no-\n     matches and 2,199 employees would get a letter, but an \n     employer with 11 no-matches and 2,200 employees would not. \n     No-match letters are completely at the discretion of SSA. \n     SSA does not inform DSH which employers receive a no-match \n     letter. Under our amendment, DHS is granted access to all \n     no-match data. They can use this data to identify \n     employers for worksite enforcement or to require early \n     participation in the verification system with respect to \n     new or existing employees.\n       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:\n       ``(6) No Improvement to IRS Authority... Grassley-Baucus-\n     Obama drops all of these important provisions ...''\n       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:\n       The pending immigration bill would increase IRS penalties \n     for filing incorrect information returns and authorizes--but \n     does not fund--additional IRS personnel to investigate \n     incorrect returns. This is a poorly concealed effort to \n     recruit IRS personnel to do the job DHS is supposed to do: \n     enforce our immigration laws.\n       We strongly support creating an effective, mandatory \n     employment verification system for all employers to verify \n     the legal status of their workers. But the design, \n     implementation, and oversight of the system as proposed in \n     the pending immigration bill are flawed in several respects.\n       Our amendment would improve Title III by (1) protecting \n     U.S. citizens and legal workers from errors in the system; \n     (2) protecting the states from excessive federal intrusion; \n     (3) protecting the rights of all legal workers; (4) \n     protecting the privacy of all Americans; and (5) improving \n     our ability to prevent unauthorized employment while \n     minimizing the burden on workers and employers.\n       We hope that your future correspondence to the Hill will \n     acknowledge these much needed improvements and avoid the \n     erroneous and misleading allegations contained in your \n     previous letter.\n       Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Grassley.\n     Max Baucus.\n     Barack Obama.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Department of Homeland Security,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2007.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I promised at the start of this \n     process that I would tell you if the bill you were \n     shepherding became so unworkable or unenforceable that it \n     threatened to worsen our current illegal worker problem. In \n     general, the Senate has avoided workability and \n     enforceability pitfalls, but for the first time I must write \n     to you to express concern about a proposed amendment that \n     would be a serious step backwards in our enforcement effort.\n       Enforcing the law means more than border enforcement. We \n     have to shut off the job magnet that pulls illegal aliens \n     into our country. The current bill's Title III wi11 do just \n     that. It creates a much stronger, more effective worksite \n     enforcement system than the one that exists today. This \n     system will stop illegal aliens from getting hired, and it \n     will punish employers who make illegal workers part of their \n     business model. By contrast, the Grassley-Baucus-Obama \n     Amendment will significantly weaken the current Title III, \n     with the result that illegal workers wil1 still be drawn \n     across our borders by the lure of easy employment.\n       These are just some of the specific examples of \n     deficiencies in the Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment that will \n     lead to a lack of enforceable worksite enforcement:\n       (1) Job Security for Criminal Aliens--Current Title III \n     requires mandatory verification of all existing workers. \n     Under the Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment, existing workers \n     are never checked. So serious criminals, and other aliens who \n     are not eligible for legal status, would be able to hide in \n     their existing jobs indefinitely, without ever having to \n     prove that they are authorized to work in this country.\n       (2) Loophole for Fake Documents--Current Title III requires \n     that new hires show a secure identification card to keep \n     their jobs. Under the Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment, in \n     contrast, most new hires will be able to present any driver's \n     license, whether or not it meets federal standards for secure \n     documents. And unlike the current Title III, individuals \n     presenting a non-secure license will not be required by the \n     Amendment to provide a second document to establish that they \n     are authorized to work in the United States. Finally, the \n     Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment eliminates a grant program to \n     reimburse States for the costs of improving license \n     security. The result will be to continue a flourishing \n     market for fake documents and identity theft.\n       (3) Arbitrary End to Information Sharing--The best way to \n     catch unscrupulous employers who do not verify their \n     employees is to compare Social Security records to the \n     records of the EEVS. Current Title III allows DHS to do so. \n     But the Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment cuts off all \n     information sharing after five years. Grassley-Baucus-Obama \n     tells unscrupulous employers that, after five years, when the \n     government agencies stop talking to each other, they can \n     return to ``business as usual,'' employing unauthorized \n     workers.\n       (4) Punishing the Enforcers Instead of the Violators--Many \n     Americans want tough financial sanctions and strict liability \n     on employers who hire illegal workers. So far as I am aware, \n     none of them want to impose sanctions and no-fault liability \n     on immigration enforcers. But that is precisely what the \n     Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment would do. Under the Grassley-\n     Baucus-Obama Amendment, any individual who wins his judicial \n     appeal against the government's determination of his \n     employment eligibility can seek compensation for lost wages--\n     even if the initial error was caused by the individual and \n     not the government. Moreover, in a poorly concealed effort to \n     make DHS avoid tough enforcement, the Grassley-Baucus-Obama \n     Amendment actually proposes that any award come from DHS's \n     enforcement budget. This would actually make the enforcement \n     climate worse than it was after the 1986 law.\n       (5) Ignoring the Government's Best Evidence of Illegal \n     Workers--Every year, SSA sends out millions of ``no-match \n     letters'', indicating that an individual's name and social \n     security number do not match. These letters are a powerful \n     indicator that the individual may not be work-authorized. The \n     current bill gives DHS authority to require that employers \n     take action to resolve ``no-match letters.'' Grassley-Baucus-\n     Obama would not.\n\n[[Page S8595]]\n\n     It would encourage employers to continue to turn a blind eye \n     to evidence that their workers may be illegal.\n       (6) No Improvement in IRS Authority--Nothing worries an \n     unscrupulous businessman more than the prospect of a tax \n     audit. The IRS has great investigative skills; it also has \n     authority to punish immigration violators who file incorrect \n     information about their employees, but this authority does \n     not have the deterrent effect it should because the current \n     fines are so low. Title III fixes this problem by raising the \n     fines and creating a dedicated Criminal Investigation Office \n     to investigate tax violations related to immigration \n     violations. Grassley-Baucus-Obama drops all of these \n     important provisions.\n       Title III is the foundation of comprehensive reform. We \n     will not reform our immigration system. nor will we shut off \n     the stream of illegal immigrants pouring across our border, \n     without addressing the force that draws them here in the \n     first place. We need better documents and stronger tools to \n     uncover identity fraud. The current version of Title III \n     gives us these tools; by contrast the Grassley-Baucus-Obama \n     Amendment eliminates needed tools and allows unscrupulous \n     businesses to continue to freely hire illegal workers.\n       Finally, weak enforcement is bad for business. Legitimate \n     businesses that comply with the law will be undercut by \n     competitors who disobey that law if enforcement is lacking. I \n     ask that you help to defeat the Grassley-Baucus-Obama \n     Amendment, not just to help our enforcers but to give a fair \n     shake to those who want to obey the law.\n       In the end, the Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment \n     unfortunately fuels public skepticism about whether \n     enforcement will work or political forces will frustrate \n     serious efforts to bring employers into compliance with the \n     law. I reject that view. We must enforce the law, and with \n     your help we will. I urge you to join with me in opposing the \n     Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Chertoff.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Isn't it true that the Finance Committee estimated that \nunder these systems, there were going to be a certain number of \nmistakes that were going to be made?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, we presented that to you that day in April----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is exactly right. It is significant numbers, in the \nhundreds of thousands, as I remember. It is in the hundreds of \nthousands of mistakes that are going to be made as they set this up. I \nam just wondering about the protection of those workers. In our bill, \nwe provide that those individuals should be protected because they can \nkeep their jobs while they appeal a nonconfirmation. I am wondering if \nthe Senator will relate to us how he thinks----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Iowa has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute yielded by the \nSenator from Arizona. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nIowa have an additional minute to respond, and then I will take my last \nminute.\n  Mr. REID. For debate only.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the only response I can give to the \nSenator from Massachusetts is that we have worked very hard in the \nFinance Committee to make sure that private income tax information and \nprivate Social Security information is protected. It seems to me that \nis basic to a system of taxation that is voluntary compliance.\n  We have made some compromises of that, some use of that under very \nstrict guidelines in the past. We presented it to the Senator's \ncommittee on this bill the same as we have in the past. The 5-year \nsunset is one example. Certain penalties for misuse of the information \nis another one.\n  It seems to me that is very basic if we are going to have confidence \nin our tax system and protect the privacy of the individual taxpayer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  Three quick things. The amendment of the Senator from Iowa eliminates \nboth the requirement of an employee to show an official identification \ncard with a photo in State or Federal databases and the DHS-run photo \nmatch system that is the ultimate protection against document fraud in \nthe workplace. You have to be able to do that match.\n  Second, the Senator from Iowa says why would we want to check workers \nafter we have made them legal? Well, the whole point is to be sure we \ndon't have anyone continuing to work here illegally.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of organizations that oppose the Grassley amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The following organizations are publicly opposing the \n     amendments listed below.\n\n\n                                Grassley\n\n     American Farm Bureau Federation\n     Compete America\n     Information Technology Industry Council\n     TechNet\n     Essential Worker Immigration Coalition\n     Alabama Employers for Immigration Reform\n     Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform\n     Colorado Employers for Immigration Reform\n     Federation of Employers and Workers of America\n     Florida Employers for Immigration and Visa Reform\n     Nevada Employers for Immigration Reform\n     New York Employers for Immigration Reform\n     Oklahoma Employers for Immigration Reform\n     Texans for Sensible Immigration Policy\n     Texas Employers for Immigration Reform\n     Tennessee Employers for Immigration Reform\n     American Health Care Association\n     American Hotel & Lodging Association\n     American Nursery & Landscape Association\n     American Subcontractors Association\n     Associated General Contractors\n     California Landscape Contractors Association\n     Federation of Employers & Workers of America\n     Florida Transportation Builders Association\n     Golf Course Superintendents Association of America\n     International Franchise Association\n     National Chicken Council\n     National Club Association\n     National Restaurant Association\n     Outdoor Amusement Business Association, Inc,\n     PLANET\n     Society of American Florists\n     US Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                                 Baucus\n\n     American Farm Bureau Federation\n     Coalition for a Secure Drivers License\n     Essential Worker Immigration Coalition\n     Alabama Employers for Immigration Reform\n     American Health Care Association\n     American Hotel & Lodging Association\n     American Nursery & Landscape Association\n     American Subcontractors Association\n     Associated General Contractors\n     California Landscape Contractors Association\n     Federation of Employers & Workers of America\n     Florida Employers for Visa and Immigration Reform\n     Florida Transportation Builders Association\n     Georgia Employers for Immigration Reform\n     Golf Course Superintendents Association of America\n     International Franchise Association\n     National Chicken Council\n     National Club Association\n     National Restaurant Association\n     Outdoor Amusement Business Association, Inc.\n     PLANET\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as one of the managers of the bill, I \nwill speak very briefly, and then I will move to table the Baucus \namendment; and after conferring with the majority leader, it is my \nunderstanding that we are going to proceed without further debate to \nmove to table two additional amendments this evening. All efforts to \nreach some reasonable time agreements have proven to be of no avail.\n  I think it is worth stating again that when those object that they \nare not able to offer their amendments, we had time before the bill was \ntaken down a week ago Thursday for people to offer amendments and the \nobjectors did not offer amendments or even allow others to offer \namendments. So they have had their opportunity, which has fomented the \ncurrent situation.\n  I wish to respond briefly to the distinguished Senator from Iowa, who \nmade a comment that the Senator from Pennsylvania had not kept a \npromise.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I said you would have to have debate in order to keep \nyour promise or it doesn't mean anything.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, I am not going to ask the record be read back. If \nthe Senator from Iowa said I did not keep\n\n[[Page S8596]]\n\na promise, I am glad to hear that. I don't make promises, I follow \nprocedures. The Senator from Iowa wanted an amendment and he got an \namendment, but I didn't make any promises. And if I made a promise, I \ncertainly don't break promises.\n  When an amendment is offered and you seek a time agreement around \nhere, you have to have unanimous consent to get a time agreement. If \nyou don't have unanimous consent, somebody gets the floor and can \nfilibuster and can talk forever and the majority leader was not going \nto put this body in a position to have someone get the floor and talk \nforever. So that the Senator from Pennsylvania doesn't control \nunanimous consent agreements.\n  The Senator from Iowa and I have worked together now for 27 years \nplus. We came to the Senate on the same day. Regrettably, he had an \nedge in seniority because he had been in the House. They didn't base it \non State size. We have had no disagreements up till now, and I am glad \nto see we don't have a disagreement now.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We don't.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would add one addendum, Mr. President, and that is \nthat I have to differ with him when he says he will not be around here \n20 years from now. He is only 73 and Strom said he is a young fella.\n\n\n        Vote on Division VII of Amendment No. 1934, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Baucus amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield for a clarification?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know this is not debatable, I understand \nthat, but we are going to move to table Baucus, Grassley, and Domenici. \nI ask unanimous consent that the first vote be the standard time; the \nnext two votes be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving my right to object, if I could simply make a \nclarification about a statement that has been made.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to \ntable.\n  Well, first, we have a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table has been made. Is there a \nsufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) and \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDIENT OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Madam President, as I indicated earlier, I am going to move \nto table the--oh, we can't do that. We are stuck on this amendment. Why \ndon't we agree to the amendment now and move on to something else?\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the distinguished junior Senator from \nOklahoma has indicated he wants to speak for up to 10 minutes as in \nmorning business. I ask unanimous consent that he be so recognized and \nthat I be recognized following his 10 minutes. I have explained to the \nSenator from Oklahoma, and he understands, this is for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I appreciate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada allowing me the time. I think it is really important for us \nto ask ourselves what the test is before us today in the Senate.\n\n  As many of you know, I spent the last 2 weeks recuperating from a \nsurgical illness, and I got to see--from a perspective of watching \ntelevision on all the different channels, reading all the different \npapers--there was a recurring theme that I noticed that came through \nfrom all across this country. It did not matter what part of the \ncountry. It did not matter who was saying it, no matter whether they \ntend to lean liberal or they tend to lean conservative. That theme is \nthis: We have failed to instill the confidence in the American people \nin the Congress that we are about doing what is in the best long-term \ninterest of our country.\n  It is not about being against immigration or for immigration. It is \nnot about being against an ethnic group or for an ethnic group. It is \nnot about being liberal. It is not about being conservative. It is \nabout the worry that the American people have for this concept called \nliberty. They are worried about that concept right now. They are \nworried about whether we have the mettle to stand up to the test, to \nput us back on a road that will give them the confidence that what we \ndo will be done in the best interests of them and their children. There \nis worry that the thing that gives us liberty, which is the rule of \nlaw, is somehow now being tinkered with in a way that undermines their \nconfidence and security in what this American dream is all about.\n  So we have had a very interesting experience today, but it is really \nnot about the immigration bill. It is about something much greater that \nwe should be paying attention to. It is about the right to govern with \nthe confidence the people of this country give us and the \nresponsibility that comes with us to have the integrity to do that in a \nway which builds that confidence, which rebuilds the strength, rebuilds \nthe positive attitude, rebuilds the ``I can do'' America has been known \nfor.\n  I asked for this time to speak not as a Republican but as a citizen \nof this country with children and grandchildren, like everybody else \nout there who wants the best for our country. We can debate about the \ndetails.\n  I had this wonderful experience about a year ago traveling with \nmembers of the opposite party to China. We met with students at Chinese \nHarvard. What we found was 95 percent of the things we agree on, we \nwere solid in our bond.\n  The very thing that makes this country great is what Democrats and \nRepublicans agree on: the idea of the rule of law; the idea of freedom; \nthe idea that we have a Constitution that has to be supported, \nnurtured, and maintained. The only way that happens is if we rebuild \nthe confidence of the American people in our abilities to do that.\n  We are in the midst of a debate on immigration that is a very wildly \nmoving, emotional issue for all sides. But it should be a signal to us \nthat when it is this wildly emotional and wildly divided, it should \ntemper our thoughts to\n\n[[Page S8597]]\n\nsay the most important thing is not to finish the bill, the most \nimportant thing is to reestablish credibility in what we do for the \nAmerican people.\n  I happen to believe if we do the right things that the American \npeople in their gut know are right, ultimately, we will go from the 17-\npercent approval rating the country has of this body today back to \nwhere we should be--a healthy, vibrant confidence that the people who \nare elected to represent them in the Senate will, in fact, have the \nconfidence of the American people to do and carry out this wonderful, \ncreative experiment our Founders started over 200 years ago.\n  My question for the body and my challenge to the body is that we have \na greater problem than immigration. The problem is the test: Do we meet \nthe test that is before us of regaining the confidence of the American \npeople? I think that is the biggest test we have today. I think all 100 \nof us need to redouble our efforts to assure that No. 1, we listen; No. \n2, the Constitution is our guide; that the oath we took said nothing \nabout Republican, said nothing about Democrat, said nothing about an \nindividual State, but said we have an oath to uphold the Constitution \nof these United States without regard to party, without regard to \nlocale.\n  So I would beg my fellow Senators, over the next few weeks, as we go \non break in a week and we come back here, that the No. 1 goal that \nought to be in front of us is, how do we change that approval rating? \nHow do we restore the fact that we are listening, that we are hearing, \nthat our action is based on what we know to be right, what we know to \nbe good, and what we know is in the best interests long term for our \ncountry?\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the legislation.\n\n\n Amendment No. 1978 to Division VII of Amendment No. 1934, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1978 to division VII of amendment No. \n     1934, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       This section shall take effect one day after the date of \n     enactment.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I think all of us understand we have \nhad a very full day today of voting on this legislation, the \nComprehensive Immigration Reform Act. After more than 30 days of \nhearings since 9/11, after the 6 days of markup in our Judiciary \nCommittee on the legislation that we addressed last year, which is very \nsimilar to the underlying legislation that is before us; after now some \n23 days of debate on the legislation, both last year and now; after the \nconsideration of more than 70 different amendments--70 different \namendments--there is an awareness and understanding by the Members of \nthis body about the substance of this legislation and, hopefully, a \nrecognition of its importance.\n  We are sent here to legislate--not just to make speeches and to \nsubmit amendments but to legislate in our national interests, and we \nhave a national challenge. We have a national challenge. I think \neveryone as Members of this body understands it. Certainly we receive \nthe phone calls, the wires, the e-mails, and the rest. After it is all \nsaid and done, I think the people in our respective States and the \npeople of this country are expecting us to exercise the best judgment \nabout this legislation. They are not asking us to put our finger to the \nwind and say, from which way is the wind blowing the strongest and from \nwhat direction, but to try and take some initial steps--and they are \ninitial but very important and fundamental steps--that can make a \ndifference in terms of our national and border security.\n  (Mr. CASEY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The American people are expecting action in this body. \nTomorrow, in the morning, it will certainly be an extremely important \nand perhaps decisive vote about whether we are going to complete our \nresponsibility, or whether we are not. I have respect for those who \nhave expressed reservations and observations. But my commitment and \nview is stronger than when we first started this legislation. The \nimportance of this legislation, I think,--I find it more persuasive \nthan the day it was initially introduced, developed, and shaped over \nthe period of the last years.\n  We all have been faced with this legislation more closely over this \ndebate and the debates we have had in recent days. We know, as we have \nheard frequently, and as I have said and many others have said, we have \na national security issue and a problem. We can, as a nation, no longer \nafford to have, effectively, almost an open border in the Southwest. We \nalso know, because in our committee we have listened to those who \nunderstand this issue, when they say we need to have secure borders, \nthey also understand that with the strong kind of magnet attraction the \nAmerican economy has, there is going to be leakage on that border. No \nmatter how high we build walls or how many radars or air drones we have \nthere or how many border guards we have, there is going to be leakage, \nunless we provide at least some opportunities for those who have some \nskills that in the United States we find we are unable to get filled in \nterms of the American workforce.\n  There has to be at least some opportunity for those individuals to \ncome to the United States. Those of us who support this legislation \nbelieve in legality. We believe in national security, but we believe in \nlegality. What we have today is lawlessness. We have lawlessness on the \nborder, approaching the border, after the border, and in too many \nshops, plants, and factories around our country, including in my own \nState, in which we find the undocumented exploited, and they continue \nto be exploited. That is happening today.\n  We have to ask: Do we have something that is going to be basically \nserious about the border? Are we going to have a way for us to be able \nto say, OK, there are certain skills that we need here in terms of the \nAmerican economy--those may be high skills, but in many circumstances \nit is going to be low skills, according to the Department of Labor. \nThis legislation approaches that issue. We may say we would like to \nhave it skewed this way or that, to some degree, but the fundamentals \nare essential in terms of the legality on our borders, in terms of \nnational security, and also with regard to worksite enforcement.\n  As one who has, along with others, been involved in these debates \nabout immigration reform, unless you are going to have a tamperproof \ncard, you might as well forget it. We have learned that lesson in the \n1986 act and in the 1992 act and earlier periods of time. The idea that \nsomehow tomorrow we are not going to be willing to continue this \nprocess and end this process without the assurances that we are going \nto end up with a tamperproof card is going to mean that the challenges \nwe are facing on this issue at this time are going to be multiplied \nmany times over, many times over. That is a fact.\n  Some people are troubled by the way that has been fashioned in this \nlegislation. I think there is a strong and persuasive case we can make. \nWe will have an additional opportunity with the Schumer amendment and, \nhopefully, with passage of cloture tomorrow. So we have those elements \nthat are law enforcement at the border, respectful law, by coming into \nthe United States and respecting our laws and our immigration laws, law \nenforcement at the worksite, and respect for the laws in that period of \ntime. To say to those individuals who have come that--their motivations \nfor coming here, by and large, are the values which Americans respect \nand admire, such as hard work. Sure, there may be some individuals who \nhave gamed the system out there. But there can be no denial when any of \nus look at this situation and examine it and when you look at \nparticularly the faces and meet the individuals, as\n\n[[Page S8598]]\n\nwe all have, and we have had the issue spoken to so well by many of our \ncolleagues, this is a population that is interested in hard work. That \nis a value Americans admire. They also admire the fact that these are \nfamilies who work hard and care about the members of their family.\n  Mr. President, $40 billion a year is sent back to Central and South \nAmerica by the primarily undocumented workers in the United States. \nThis is where individuals are making $10,000 to $12,000 a year. So they \ncare about their families. They are not coming in on their own to try \nto game the system. The statistics are there. I think those figures \nspeak for themselves in terms of their willingness to work hard, care \nabout their families and, as we all know, this community, this \nconstituency--they are men and women of faith and belief, strong \nindividuals of faith and belief.\n  On another occasion, we would say those are American values that we \nadmire, and so many of them want to be part of the American dream and \nmake America better. They reflect it by urging their sons and daughters \nto go into the service--thousands of them being in the service of our \ncountry in Afghanistan and Iraq. Many of them have lost their lives in \nthe service of this country. So many of these families--as I listened \nto the mayor of Los Angeles today talk about a number of mothers he had \nmet who lost their children in Iraq--the particular one he referred to \nhad been undocumented and their son had been lost. In any event, that \nis the general sense of their desire and willingness, similar to other \nimmigrants who came at other times.\n\n  So what is their great violation? The violation is that they have \nviolated our immigration laws. That is serious. What is on the other \nside of those barriers? The magnet of the American economy. The magnet \nof the American economy has drawn these individuals like moths to a \nflame. Sure, it is all there because they have violated our laws, but \nthey work hard and they care for their families. They are men and women \nof faith, with an extraordinary record of looking after their \ngrandparents, and they have a great desire to be part of the American \ndream. They have violated laws and they should have a penalty. We \nlooked around and looked around, those of us, Republicans and \nDemocrats, at what should be the penalty. Should they get a penalty? \nThe $5,000 processing fee can vary. We can put a requirement in about \nlearning English. In Boston, MA, it is not that the undocumented don't \nwant to learn English; it is a 3-year wait. Courses in English cost \nfrom $2,000 to $3,000 in my part of the world. I look forward to the \nAlexander amendment--the Senator from Tennessee. He wants to at least \nprovide greater access to individuals to learn English. We are for \nthat. There are requirements that they have to learn English. They have \nto demonstrate they have worked here and that they paid their taxes and \nthey have to demonstrate that they are good Americans and that they are \nlearning English. We have those requirements. Before they can even \nthink about moving on the pathway to a green card, they have to wait in \nline for the 8 years to clear up.\n  Then, according to a merit system, over the next 5 years, they will \nbe able to hopefully get on the path for a green card and then wait \nanother 5 years to become a citizen--8 years, 5 years, and 5 more \nyears. That is 18 years for some of those individuals, plus the \npenalties and fines--for people who want to be a part of the American \ndream.\n  This has, as others have spoken to, very important provisions in here \nabout the ag jobs. I remember going through the Southwest in the early \n1960s when I arrived in the Senate. Americans were involved in the \nBracero Program, which, outside of slavery, was the greatest \nexploitation of humanity. Perhaps we could talk about some of the \nincidents in terms of the Native Americans certainly. But this was a \nsanctioned program that continued for years and years with the \nexploitation and abuse of people.\n  That was the beginning of the rise of the farmworker movement and the \nextraordinary tensions that existed between the farmworkers and the \nagricultural interests. It took a long period of time. Finally, they \ngot together to try to have a program which both of them agreed with, \nwhich is the AgJOBS bill, to make a difference to 800,000 or 900,000 \npeople who are some of the hardest working people in America. Then \nthere's the DREAM Act. There is some responsibility in the areas of \neducation. We know of the difficulty so many have in completing high \nschool. It is true in the Latino community. This kind of opportunity--\nif they are the sons of people who came here undocumented, these \nchildren didn't know about it, but if they work hard and complete \nschool, they have the opportunity to serve this country and they can \nget on a pathway for citizenship, or if they are otherwise eligible and \nthe State approves, they can also continue in education.\n  So there are, I know, strong views about these different provisions; \nbut, quite frankly, I think it is a compelling story that demands and \nrequires action. If we fail this opportunity, we know we are going to \nmiss this opportunity for some time. It is getting late into the season \nnow, July and August we will be out and in September is the \nappropriations time. We will move into a highly politicized period of \ntime, and we will move into a Presidential campaign. So we will miss an \nincredible opportunity.\n  I hope the Senate is going to be responsible tomorrow. We know if we \nfail, those individuals are all going to be out there; the numbers are \ngoing to increase, exploitation will increase, and we are going to have \nthe silent amnesty that others have referred to. That is the real \nalternative. I don't say that because I believe the failure to act is \nbad, and it is going to get worse, although I believe it will. It is \nthat if we can take this action and make this downpayment, we can \ncontinue to work on this issue as the House does. That will take time. \nWe can obviously work with those who are interested in it and try to \nmake adjustments and changes and try to strengthen and improve it. That \nis the way the legislative process works. Hopefully, we will be able to \ncome to the period where we can all feel the final product is the best \njudgment we have had on this bill. That is the optimum, and it seems to \nme this is an exceedingly important opportunity we should not miss.\n  Finally, I again thank our leaders for giving us a chance to come \nback to this issue. We know it has been a complicated and difficult \none. As I have said repeatedly, immigration and civil rights are the \nhot-button issues. We have had complex issues in our HELP Committee \ndealing with biologics, an enormously complex and difficult issue. We \ncame together and passed that legislation. We had issues dealing with \ninformation technology, privacy, grants, and we came together and took \naction. Our committee has been dealing with the general cost of \neducation and loan programs, and we were able to, Republicans and \nDemocrats, cut some $18 billion from the lenders and return $17 billion \nto the students. We came together, Republicans and Democrats, and have \nbeen able to get reauthorization of the Food and Drug Administration. \nWe look forward to continuing with mental health parity and other \nissues. But it is the issues of immigration and civil rights that are \nthe hot-button issues, and they get the juices flowing.\n  I hope tonight people will stand back and think through the \nsignificance of this vote tomorrow. It is going to be a matter of \nenormous importance to our country. It is going to have enormous \nimportance in terms of quality of life for millions of people. We are \ngoing to make the decision whether they are going to continue to live \nin fear or whether they are going to be able to come out of that \ndarkness into the sunshine and be part of this country. If we don't \nact, we all know what is going to be happening in local communities all \nacross the country and the increasing backwash that is going to arise \nthat is going to make other matters much more difficult for us to \ncontinue to make progress on.\n  I look forward to tomorrow, and I hope all our Members will exercise \ntheir best judgment. We will have an opportunity to move ahead and \ncomplete this legislation and then hopefully we will continue the \nprogress we made in the Senate so we can work with those who have \ndiffering views in the House and in the Senate and ultimately get \nlegislation that is worthy of the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support for the\n\n[[Page S8599]]\n\nBaucus-Tester-Collins-Leahy amendment to strip the references to the \nproblematic REAL ID program from the underlying immigration bill. We \nmay agree or disagree about the merits of the actual REAL ID program, \nbut as hearings in the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs Committee have shown, REAL ID is far from being \nready for prime time.\n  While the Department of Homeland Security has not even released final \nregulations directing the States on REAL ID implementation, REAL ID \nlicenses are rapidly becoming a de facto national ID card, since you \nwill need one to enter courthouses, airports, Federal buildings, and--\nif this bill passes--workplaces all across the country. With roughly \n260 million drivers in this country, I do not see how we could have the \nmassive national databases required by REAL ID and this immigration \nbill up and running by the 2013 deadline set in this bill. Moreover, \nREAL ID raises multiple constitutional issues whose legal challenges \ncould delay final implementation for years.\n  In addition to numerous privacy and civil liberties concerns, REAL ID \nis a massive drivers' tax that could cost Americans taxpayers more than \n$23 billion. Opposition spans the political spectrum, from the right to \nthe left, and a large number of States have expressed concerns about \nthe mandates of the REAL ID Act by enacting bills and resolutions that \noppose REAL ID. Georgia, Washington, Oklahoma, Montana, South Carolina, \nMaine, and New Hampshire have gone so far as to pass binding \nlegislation that says they intend to refuse to comply with REAL ID. The \nNational Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors \nAssociation have expressed serious reservations about the costs imposed \non the States--and the structure of the poorly drafted grant program in \nthe underlying bill. The Center for Democracy and Technology and the \nACLU have expressed serious concerns about the lack of privacy and \ncivil liberties protections within the REAL ID program. The reaction to \nthe unfunded mandates and lack of privacy standards in the REAL ID Act \nis a good example of what happens when the Federal Government imposes a \nunilaterally devised and ill-considered mandate rather than working to \nmeet goals through cooperation, bipartisanship, and partnership.\n  For any new immigration measures to be effective, they must be well \ndesigned. Forcing employers, employees, and the States to use this \ntroublesome national ID card will slow down the hiring process, stifle \ncommerce, and not serve as an effective strategy. In addition, the \nStates have already told us that they will not all have their new \nlicense programs up and running by the 2013 deadline called for in this \nbill. On top of that, I have gone through this bill several times, and \nI have found money for border fences, money for surveillance \ntechnologies, money for border patrol agents, and money for detention \nfacilities, but I cannot find any hard money that actually goes into \nREAL ID implementation. So doing away with this poorly drafted grant \nprogram will not take $1 away from the $4.4 billion in enforcement \nmoney contained in this bill.\n  As a result, I do not believe that we should jeopardize the future \nsuccess of the immigration reforms sought in this bill by tying REAL ID \ntoo closely to it. Instead of mandating REAL ID licenses for employment \nverification, I think we should support the Baucus-Tester-Collins-Leahy \namendment to strip REAL ID from this bill and put together a workable \nemployment verification system that does not needlessly burden every \nlegal job seeker in this country with the onerous and problematic \nrequirements of REAL ID.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nindulgence. I appreciate very much the opportunity to speak to the \nissue before the Senate today.\n  The debate over immigration has been a contentious one. Soon we are \ngoing to come to that moment of truth when we all have the opportunity \nto cast a vote either for or against the so-called ``grand bargain'' \nthat is before the Senate. Most of us are going to make that vote \nformed by our own experiences, formed by our conscience, formed by our \nconstituents, and like so many others in this Chamber, those are all \nfactors that come into play and influence the way that I view this very \nimportant and serious issue.\n  In fact, to speak to some of the experiences I have had, it was not \ntoo long ago I was in a supermarket in my home State of South Dakota in \nSioux Falls. I was approached by someone who was working there who had \nasked me to help with a problem. It turns out he was in this country, \nand his wife had been here illegally. They had a child here. The child, \ntherefore, is a citizen. His wife determined that she wanted to be \nlegal. So she left this country and went back home and decided to come \nhere through a legal mechanism. That was a year ago. For the past year, \nshe has been trying to come back to this country legally. I have been \nworking with her. They have to first get an immigrant waiver and then \nultimately go through the process where she can come into this country \nand come legally.\n  I make that point because I believe it is very relevant to the debate \nwe are having on the floor of the Senate. If this woman who wanted to \ndo the right thing and decided to go back because she wanted to come \ninto the United States of America legally--she didn't want to be here \nillegally--had just stayed here, under this bill, she could become \nlegalized. What does that say to all the people such as her who are \ntrying to follow the laws, who are trying to play by the rules we have \ncreated?\n  That is one episode, one example, as I look at this debate and think \nabout the consequences for those who have played by the rules, those \nwho follow our laws, those who observe the rule of law in America, how \nit forms the way I view this issue.\n  We have been told throughout this debate that this is the best \ncompromise\n\n[[Page S8600]]\n\nthat can be achieved and, after all, isn't compromise the essence of \nwhat the Senate is all about, is coming to a consensus after a long \ndebate? The difference with this grand bargain is that the die was cast \nlong before the debate began. The process whereby this bill came to the \nfloor bypassed the regular order, and its outcome has been ordained by \nthe grand bargainers to prevent amendments that might actually improve \nthe bill from becoming part of the solution to America's broken \nimmigration system.\n  Opposing the underlying bill or proposing amendments to improve it \nhas led to labels such as anti-immigrant or nativist or xenophobic. I \nam none of the above. It is not anti-immigrant to be for the rule of \nlaw. It is not nativist to be for enforcing America's laws. And it is \nnot xenophobic to believe that those who come to America should come \nhere legally.\n  America has a long tradition as a welcoming nation. I am a product of \nthat tradition. In 1906, two Norwegian brothers named Nicolai and \nMatthew Gjelsvik came to America from Norway. The only English they \nknew were the words ``apple pie'' and ``coffee,'' which evidently they \nlearned on the way over.\n  When they arrived at Ellis Island, the immigration officials \ndetermined that their given name would be too difficult to spell and \npronounce for people in this country so they asked them to change it. \nG-j-e-l-s-v-i-k was how they spelled it. They picked the name of the \nfarm where they worked near Bergin, Norway, which was called the Thune \nFarm. So Nicolai Gjelsvik became Nick Thune, my grandfather.\n  Then, as now, there was a great demand in America's economy for \nworkers. They went to work on the transcontinental railroad doing hard \nmanual labor. they learned English and made enough to start a small \nmerchandising company which subsequently became a hardware store that \nto this day bears their name. They came here for the opportunity that \nAmerica offered--the opportunity to succeed and the opportunity to \nfail.\n  Their story has been duplicated millions and millions of times over \nand continues today. Millions and millions of Americans came here from \nother places, but they came here legally. I support them and the \nmillions more who are still to come. You see, you can be pro-\nimmigration and pro rule of law. The two are not mutually exclusive. \nUnfortunately, the bill before the Senate violates that bedrock \nAmerican distinction of the rule of law. Under this bill, somewhere \nbetween 12 and 20 million illegal immigrants will be immediately \nlegalized.\n\n  Ironically, it is that very rule of law that serves as a magnet that \nattracts people to America. The reason America's economy is the most \nprosperous in the world is its foundation is in the rule of law. \nConcepts such as legal certainty, private property rights, and an \nindependent judiciary provide the framework for the most successful \neconomy in the history of civilization. It doesn't happen by \nhappenstance. It happens because the rule of law is an inviolable \nprinciple of American democracy.\n  The solution to America's broken immigration system is really quite \nsimple: Enforce the laws in the workplace and enforce the laws at the \nborder. Sacrificing America's most basic foundational principle in the \ninterest of a short-term fix betrays the belief of the millions who are \nhere legally and the millions more to come that America is different \nbecause here the rule of law matters.\n  President Ronald Reagan once said that a nation that ``can't control \nits own borders can't control its destiny.'' We are a country, we are a \nnation. We need the strong border security measures in this bill, and \nwe need the strong workplace verification measures in this bill, but \nthe immediate legalization of 12 million people is a bridge too far.\n  It contradicts one of the great ideals of our democracy and sends \nwrong and conflicting signals to those who are here currently and those \nwho will come in the future. The demand for workers in America can be \nmet when those here illegally go back and return through legal channels \nor when they are replaced by those who wait to come legally. This bill \nis the wrong solution, and I believe and I hope that the Senate will \nreject it.\n  We can get a good immigration bill, a solid immigration bill that \nsecures the border, that deals with the issue of workplace \nverification, and it sends the right message to those who are waiting \nto come to America that America is a nation, a welcoming nation, a \nnation that is pro-immigration, but a nation that fundamentally \nrespects its great tradition as a nation that is based upon the rule of \nlaw.\n  I hope my colleagues, as they consider how they will vote tomorrow on \nthese important votes, will think about the importance of that \ntradition of the rule of law, the importance of the message we send to \nthose who have observed our laws, such as the lady I mentioned whose \nhusband is in Sioux Falls, SD, and she hopes to come back to our great \ncountry and to our State. She made a fundamental decision that she was \ngoing to play by the rules, she was going to follow the laws. There are \nso many like her. What we want to do is send a message that people like \nher are welcome here, people who follow our laws. We don't want to \nreward those who come here illegally. I believe on a most basic level \nthat is what the legislation before the Senate does.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on these important votes \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8600-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8600-S8601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, despite the fact that we are fast \napproaching the 6-year anniversary since the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, it is painfully clear that we have a lot of work to do to \nprotect this Nation from further terrorist attacks. The threats are \nreal, they are growing, and when Democrats took control of the Congress \nat the start of this year, we said we would implement the unanimous \nrecommendation of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. That matter passed \nthis body by a big vote. That is where we said we should implement into \nlaw the 9/11 Commission recommendations. Democrats voted for that, and \nRepublicans voted for it. It was one of the first bills we passed at \nthe start of this session of Congress. The House passed its version of \nthe bill on January 9. The Senate passed our bill on March 13. The \nHouse bill was 299 to 128; ours was 60 to 38.\n  As my colleagues know, Democrats and Republicans who serve on the \nHouse and Senate committees with jurisdiction over this bill have \nworked tirelessly to resolve the differences on these two bills. I \nmyself have spoken to Chairman Lieberman, I don't think it is an \nexaggeration to say a dozen times. The American people expect us to \nfinish this work quickly, and that is why we believe we need to take \nthe next procedural step as part of our regular order, which is to \nappoint conferees to finish these negotiations.\n  When this bill is signed into law, it will make America more secure. \nIt will improve the screening of maritime cargo so that Americans can \nbe assured we are doing all we can to prevent the smuggling of weapons \ninto this country, including nuclear weapons. It will improve the \ncongressional oversight of intelligence to ensure we are building the \nbest capabilities possible to stop terrorist attacks. It will improve \ninformation sharing and communications interoperability among first \nresponders so that they can work swiftly to prevent terrorist attacks. \nIt will ensure that transportation and mass-transit structures are \nhardened against terrorist attacks.\n  This legislation wasn't something a couple of Senators dreamed up. It \nwas the recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, chaired by \nGovernor Kean and cochaired by Congressman Hamilton, a Republican and a \nDemocrat. This is what we are doing. We are long past when we should \nhave done this. We need to do this.\n  I make the following request, Mr. President: I ask unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S8601]]\n\nthat the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 1 and that the Senate \nthen proceed to its consideration; that all after the enacting clause \nbe stricken and the text of S.4, as passed by the Senate on March 13, \n2007, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the \nSenate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with the above occurring \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nleadership has been continuing to consult with our colleagues who are \nworking on this legislation, and I have the impression, from talking to \nMembers who are involved, that they have done a lot of good work and \nperhaps have made some progress that will lead to being able to get a \nconference and act on it. They have been discussing some very \nsignificant issues.\n  One of the problems that I recall is that this legislation went well \nbeyond what was just in the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and that \nis a major part of the problem. There was some other language that was \nof great concern and could lead this bill to be vetoed by the \nPresident, but he does not want to veto it, and we want to get a bill \nthat we can agree on that can become law. We all want to strengthen our \nhomeland security, but, as quite often is the case in the Congress--the \nHouse or the Senate or the both of us--we put language in these bills \nthat is problematic and, in my opinion and others, counterproductive. \nSo we don't want to get to a point where we can't get an agreement or \nget a bill signed into law and have to start back at square one.\n  I wish to emphasize that the impression of the leadership--and that \nis whom I am speaking for here--is that they are working and making \nprogress, and we hope they will continue to do that and get a good, \nproductive, and bipartisan agreement.\n  At this point, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I, of course, am very disappointed my Republican colleague \nhas chosen to object to this request on moving forward on the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations bill. The minority stated yesterday that \nthey had a problem with the bill. We agreed to take that out of the \nbill. I don't know how much more we can do.\n  It appears to me there are forces within the Republican Senate that \nsimply don't want this bill enacted. This is really too bad. As my \nfriend--and we have worked together on this Senate floor, my friend, \nthe junior Senator from Mississippi, we have worked on this floor \ntogether for many years. When he was the majority leader, we worked \ntogether in detail on so many different issues, so this is not directed \ntoward him. But I do say that there have been procedural roadblocks \nthrown up in front of virtually everything we have tried to do in the \nSenate this year. I was hoping we could reconsider this obstructionism \nwhen it comes to moving legislation that would make America more \nsecure. Every day we wait on this is another day for the terrorists. \nFor example, I talked about cargo screening. Other countries do it, but \nwe don't.\n  These phantom issues which are blocking this bill do not exist. This \nis a bill which the managers, Senator Lieberman and others, have worked \nout. We could go to conference and do this bill in one-half hour, an \nhour. And this is a real conference where conferees would sit down, \nthere would be open debate, public debate, there is nothing to jam this \nthrough. This is the way we should do things.\n  The 9/11 victims' families have organizations, and these family \nrepresentatives are calling for all parties to move this forward, and \nwe are listening to them. This bill needs to pass. We are willing to be \nflexible. We have shown that. I would hope my Republican colleagues and \nthe administration will demonstrate what they do not like about this \nbill, and what they do not like about it, tell us. This bill is \nimportant. It is important for me and my family, every Senator here and \ntheir families, everybody in this country, and every day we don't do \nsomething is a day lost.\n\n  I can assure my Republican colleague that Senator Lieberman, our lead \nconferee, as well as the rest of our conferees will continue to work in \na bipartisan manner, as they have to date. So I am very disappointed \nthe Republicans are still objecting to moving the process forward on \nthis bill. I say to my colleagues and to all Americans that I will be \nback on the floor again and again until our Republican friends allow us \nto move forward.\n  I do say, Mr. President, that it is a real shame we can't get this \ndone before the Fourth of July recess. I am not exaggerating when I say \nthis bill needs to be done. I think, without going into any \nconfidential information, this bill should pass. We should do it as \nsoon as we can. I urge my friend to speak to whomever needs to be \nspoken to on the other side to reconsider their objection.\n  Tomorrow, let us move this bill. It is Thursday. We could complete \nthis before we go home, and it would be a day of celebration for all \nAmerica that we are implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8601-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8601-S8602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1585\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that I \nwould like to make, and I will do that right now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 189, H.R. 1585, the Department of Defense \nAuthorization Act, on Monday, July 9, following the period of morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, it is my \nunderstanding the Senate bill is not yet available. I think the bill \nwill be filed at some point soon so that Members can review it, but at \nthis time, until Members see the legislation, I will object, and maybe \nwe can revisit this when the bill is reported. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could ask the indulgence of the majority leader \nbriefly.\n  With regard to the effort on the homeland security, 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations, I think the concerns we have on this legislation were \nmade very clear, laid out in the Congressional Record when the \nlegislation was being considered. We want homeland security in America, \nbut we also want to make sure the money we provide and what we \nauthorize is done in a responsible and appropriate way. There is the \npossibility of gorging the system without getting a lot of results.\n  I have flown to the different ports in this country and looked at \nport security and all the intermodal activities and the security that \ngoes on there. More is being done than maybe some people realize. But \nalso there were some labor provisions in this legislation that clearly \nneeded to be worked out in order for this legislation to make it \nthrough the process.\n  But I agree, hopefully we can get something worked out here where \nthis legislation could perhaps get into conference and get it done \nbefore we leave for the Fourth of July. The conferees know where the \nproblems are; if they would meet and get those problems worked out, \nthen I think probably this legislation could be cleared.\n  I just wanted to respond to the majority leader's concern. I \nunderstand how he feels and what he is trying to do, but I did want to \nput those comments and those thoughts on the record.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say this: The labor provisions about \nwhich the distinguished Senator talked, we have agreed to take care of \nthose. Everybody knows that. Maybe my friend doesn't, but we certainly \nhave conveyed this to the minority in great detail. I would simply say, \nif it is not this, then what is it? We have agreed to handle the labor \nsituation in this bill. The Speaker and I have agreed, and I don't know \nwhat other assurance anyone could give.\n  This is really stunning to me, that on the Defense authorization bill \nI am\n\n[[Page S8602]]\n\ngoing to have to file cloture--Defense authorization bill--a motion to \nproceed to it. We have already filed--I don't know the exact number, I \nlose track of it, but 12 to 14 motions, clotures on motions to proceed, \nfar more than were done in the last Congress just in this little period \nof time we have been here. Why? Because everything we move to, there is \nan objection.\n  Keep in mind what this is. It is the Defense authorization bill, a \nbill we have to pass to take care of our troops in Iraq, in \nAfghanistan, in Korea, in Germany, and troops here at home. It is for \ntraining. It has a pay raise in it. It is a good piece of legislation \nworked on by Senator Warner and Senator Levin. It is a bipartisan bill, \nand I just think everyone who is listening to these proceedings, \nwherever they might be, should understand the Republicans are objecting \nto going to the bill to fund our troops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8602-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on July 4, the Nation will celebrate the \n41st anniversary of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, landmark \nlegislation that has guaranteed the public's ``right to know'' for \ngenerations of Americans. Regrettably, the Senate will mark this very \nimportant anniversary without having passed the Openness Promotes \nEffectiveness in Our National Government Act, the OPEN Government Act, \nS. 849, comprehensive legislation that Senator Cornyn and I introduced \nearlier this year to strengthen and reinvigorate FOIA for all \nAmericans.\n  Responsive government and transparent decisionmaking are bedrock \nAmerican values. FOIA honors and helps translate those values into \npractice, and the OPEN Government Act will help FOIA work better in \nserving the public's interest.\n  The Judiciary Committee favorably reported this bipartisan \nlegislation in April. But a Republican hold is delaying consideration \nof this important FOIA reform bill. The Senate Republican leadership \nhas also ignored requests to debate this bill on the Senate floor, \nneedlessly stalling these long-overdue, bipartisan reforms to \nstrengthen FOIA.\n  For more than four decades, FOIA's timeless values of openness and \ntransparency in government have ensured access to Government \ninformation. Just this week, we witnessed the great value of FOIA in \nshedding light on a controversial policy within the Office of the Vice \nPresident regarding the handling of classified information, with news \nreports that a FOIA request to the Justice Department first revealed \nthat the Attorney General may have delayed a review into the legality \nof this troubling policy.\n  Although FOIA remains an indispensable tool in shedding light on bad \npolicies and Government abuses, this open Government law is being \nhampered by excessive delays and lax FOIA compliance. Today, Americans \nwho seek information under FOIA remain less likely to obtain it than \nduring any other time in FOIA's 40-plus year history. According to the \nNational Security Archive, an independent research institute, the \noldest outstanding FOIA requests date back to 1989, before the collapse \nof the Soviet Union.\n  Moreover, more than a year after the President's FOIA Executive order \nto\n\n[[Page S8603]]\n\nimprove agency FOIA performance, FOIA backlogs are at an alltime high. \nAccording to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office, \nFederal agencies had 43 percent more FOIA requests pending and \noutstanding in 2006 than in 2002. In addition, the percentage of FOIA \nrequestors who obtained at least some of the information that they \nrequested from the Government declined by 31 percent in 2006, according \nto a study by the Coalition of Journalists for Open Government.\n  As the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade, the OPEN \nGovernment Act would help to reverse these troubling trends and to \nrestore the public's trust in their Government. In so doing, this bill \nis a fitting tribute to FOIA and a wise investment in our American \ndemocracy.\n  The OPEN Government Act promotes and enhances public disclosure of \nGovernment information under FOIA by helping Americans to obtain timely \nresponses to their FOIA requests. This bill also improves transparency \nin the Federal Government's FOIA process by restoring meaningful \ndeadlines for agency action under FOIA; imposing real consequences on \nFederal agencies for missing FOIA's 20-day statutory deadline; \nclarifying that FOIA applies to Government records held by outside \nprivate contractors; establishing a FOIA hotline service for all \nFederal agencies; and creating a FOIA Ombudsman to provide FOIA \nrequestors and Federal agencies with a meaningful alternative to costly \nlitigation.\n  Let me also be clear about what this bill does not do. This bill does \nnot harm or impede in any way the Government's ability to withhold or \nprotect classified information. Classified, national security and \nhomeland security-related information are all expressly exempt from \nFOIA's disclosure mandate, and this bill does nothing to alter these \nimportant exemptions. Senator Cornyn and I have also offered an \namendment to this bill that would preserve the right of Federal \nagencies to assert these and other FOIA exemptions, even if agencies \nmiss the 20-day statutory deadline under FOIA.\n  The OPEN Government Act is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 13 \nSenators, including the bill's lead Republican cosponsor, Senator \nCornyn. This bill is also endorsed by more than 115 business, public \ninterest, and news organizations from across the political and \nideological spectrum, including \nthe American Library Association, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, OpenTheGovernment.org, Public Citizen, \nthe Republican Liberty Caucus, the Sunshine in Government Initiative, \nand the Vermont Press Association. I thank all of the cosponsors of \nthis bill for their commitment to open government. I also thank the \nmany organizations that have endorsed the OPEN Government Act for their \nsupport of this legislation.\n  The OPEN Government Act is a good-government bill that Democrats and \nRepublicans alike can and should work together to enact. If there are \nlegitimate concerns with this bill, those concerns should be openly \ndebated and the Senate should promptly pass this legislation.\n  Senator Cornyn and I both know that open government is not a \nDemocratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an American issue. It is \nin this bipartisan spirit that I urge the Senate to promptly consider \nthe OPEN Government Act and that I encourage all Senators to support \nthis important FOIA reform legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \nbill's supporters following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

SENATOR CRAIG THOMAS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it has been said that we all have a birth \ndate\n\n[[Page S8604]]\n\nand a death date, with a dash in between. It is what we do with our \ndash that counts.\n  Senator Craig Thomas made his count. He was a dedicated public \nservant, a vigorous advocate, a compassionate leader, a marine, a proud \npatriot. To the citizens of his beloved Wyoming and to his colleagues \nin the Senate, he was a cherished friend.\n  Although my State and his are miles apart, with vastly different \ngeography and history, I am struck by the similarities in the character \nof our people. Both the rugged Maine Yankee and the tough Wyoming \ncowboy are steadfast and modest. Both are determined, committed to \ndoing what is right rather than what is easy. An old cowboy proverb \nsays, ``The best way out of a tight spot is to go straight through \nit,'' and Craig Thomas always faced challenges head-on. I have no doubt \nthat he would have been just as at home on the deck of a lobster boat \nas he was on horseback, riding the range.\n  As a Senator representing a large rural State, I deeply appreciate \nCraig's devotion to preserving and enhancing a way of life that is such \na vital part of the American spirit. His tireless work on such issues \nas agriculture, Indian affairs, natural resources, rural health care, \nand educational opportunity will help ensure a better future for people \nin small communities throughout our nation.\n  The courage and integrity with which he led his life were evident \nuntil the very end. Although stricken with a terrible disease, Craig \nalways put his Nation and his State first. There was no time for self-\npity or regret while there was still work to be done. He stayed in the \nsaddle.\n  Craig was a public man, but, first and foremost, he was a loving \nhusband, a devoted father, and a proud grandfather. In this time of \nsorrow, I know that his wonderful family finds strength in his \nhonorable legacy. Senator Craig Thomas filled his dash with service, \ncourage, and commitment, with life and love. May his memory inspire us \nall to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8604-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On April 12, 2007, in Crothersville, IN, Coleman King and Garrett \nGray beat a man to death for allegedly making a sexual proposition to \none of them. As the two young men were returning to Gray's house from \nan errand that day, they picked up 35-year-old Aaron Hall. The two men \ntold police that Hall had propositioned King; in retaliation, King and \nGray began to beat Hall. The two men allegedly struck Hall until his \neyes were swollen shut and he was spitting blood. They then carted him \noff to a ditch, continued to beat him and left him for dead. The two \nmen drove back to the ditch with a shotgun later that day in order to \nmake sure Hall was dead, but found him instead several days later dead \nin a nearby field, where he had apparently crawled.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8604-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM BOWMAN\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to a legend of \nthe U.S. Air Force Academy's athletic department, Mr. Jim Bowman. After \ndedicating 49 years of service over six decades to the Air Force \nAcademy, Mr. Bowman, the associate athletics director for recruiting \nand support, will retire at the end of July 2007.\n  Mr. Bowman excelled on the football field at Michigan's Charlevoix \nHigh School. Following graduation, Mr. Bowman brought his on-the-field \ntenacity to the University of Michigan, where he played 3 years for the \nWolverines, lettering at center his senior year. After graduation in \n1956, Bowman joined the Air Force and completed pilot training in 1957 \nand also attended B-47 transition school.\n  In 1958, Lieutenant Bowman arrived at the Air Force Academy as junior \nvarsity football coach. He led the junior varsity team for a total of 5 \nyears and the freshman team for 11 years. In addition to his coaching \nduties, Mr. Bowman also began serving as the Academy's associate \nathletic director for admissions. However, after the 1975 season, when \nthe Academy added 10 Varsity women's teams in addition to the 17 \nexisting men's teams, Bowman stepped down from coaching to devote his \nfull-time duties to recruiting support.\n  At the Air Force Academy, Bowman served on a coaching staff that led \nthe Falcons to 17 postseason bowl games and 16 Commander-in-Chief's \nTrophies, as the top service academy football team. Since arriving at \nthe Academy, Bowman has seen every class graduate, totaling 38,797 \ncadets to date, has overseen the appointment of an estimated 14,000 \nrecruited athletes, and administered 49 admission cycles. Through this \nperiod, Mr. Bowman worked with 16 superintendents, 22 commandants of \ncadets, 8 deans of faculty, 8 athletic directors, 10 directors of \nadmissions, and 120 assistant football coaches. His extensive \nexperience in all phases of intercollegiate athletics has contributed \nimmensely to the development of the Air Force Academy's athletic \nprograms. Mr. Bowman is an honorary member of the Academy Association \nof Graduates and a lifetime member of the American Football Coaches \nAssociation. In 2001, Bowman was inducted into the Colorado Springs \nSports Hall of Fame as part of the 1958 Cotton Bowl team.\n  Jim Bowman's retirement from the Academy marks the end of an era in \nAir Force Academy athletics. His 49 years of dedication to Falcon \nathletes, our future Air Force officers, and the Academy is simply \nunparalleled. Although his service at the Academy will be missed, I \nknow Mr. Bowman will continue to serve his country in whatever future \nendeavors he chooses to pursue.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Jim Bowman's hard \nwork and commitment to the U.S. Air Force Academy, the Air Force, and \nour country. While Mr. Bowman described his service to the Academy as \n``a privilege and an honor,'' it is our Nation that is indebted to Jim \nBowman for his positive influence in helping to shape the characters of \nso many of our future military leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8604-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING CHARLES J.

Mr President, today I honor an exceptional small \nbusiness from my home State of Maine that is striving to employ more \nMainers and revive tourism in one of Maine's hidden natural treasures. \nThe New England Outdoors Center of Millinocket is a multifaceted \necotourism and recreational sports business and a wonderful example of \nentrepreneurial spirit in Maine. Local residents of the Millinocket \nregion and tourists, who come from far and wide to see Maine's splendor \nand beauty, enjoy the Outdoors Center's diversity of services. In \naddition, the Center's owner, Matt Polstein, is working to add a resort \nto his business which would bring additional jobs to the Katahdin \nregion.\n  The New England Outdoors Center is an all-season facility that \nconsists of a snowmobile business, the River Drivers restaurant, and a \nwhite water rafting enterprise. The Outdoors Center provides a gateway \nto Baxter State Park and the spectacular Mount Katahdin, the \nAppalachian Trail's northern terminus. The Center has won numerous \ncommendations throughout its decades of operation, including a Maine \nTourism award. It is a member of the Katahdin Area Chamber of Commerce, \nthe Maine Tourism Association, the Maine Snowmobile Association, and \nmany other groups. Matt Polstein and the New England Outdoors Center's \nendeavors greatly benefit the local economy, which has recently been \nsuffering due to a slump in visitors to Baxter State Park.\n  In light of this decline in tourism, Matt Polstein's vision of \nbuilding the new Ktaadn Resorts on Hammond Ridge is particularly \ncritical in bringing people back to the Katahdin region and to all of \nMaine. Mr. Polstein's $65 million proposal evidences his commitment and \ndetermination to create new jobs for Mainers and to contribute to the \ngrowth of Millinocket's regional economy. The plan has garnered the \nsupport of the Millinocket community and its leaders, as well as the \nunanimous endorsement of Maine's Land Use Regulation Commission, which \noversees the state's planning and zoning for plantations, townships, \nand unorganized areas without local governance. This forward-thinking \nproposal for a new resort is one of the largest resort proposals in \nMaine's Unorganized Territory history--a true victory for all involved. \nConscious of the environment, Mr. Polstein is seeking to grow crops and \nlivestock for use at the resort and in the community. The new Ktaadn \nResorts will be an extraordinary feat when finished, complete with a \nstate-of-the-art conference center, a lodge, rental cabins, and \nrestaurants. The Resort is expected to create at least 100 new jobs and \nto shed light on Millinocket as a hub of tourism in Maine and New \nEngland.\n  It is vital that we respect our natural surroundings, and Matt \nPolstein's proposal does just that. It is a bright example of the kind \nof intelligent planning that benefits Maine's economy while protecting \nthe State's natural environment. Mount Katahdin is a shining example of \nwhat makes Maine beautiful, and Mr. Polstein's dedication to the \nimprovement of his community exemplifies what makes Maine people so \nspecial. I commend Matt Polstein for his public service as a city \ncouncillor in Millinocket, his current business ventures that provide \naccommodations and services to tourists year-round, and for his smart \nand bright entrepreneurial savvy with the future Ktaadn Resorts. I wish \nMr. Polstein and everyone at the New England Outdoors Center continued \nprosperity, and a successful completion to the Ktaadn Resorts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8605-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       KEAN UNIVERSITY CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \nKean University Cougars baseball team's dramatic victory in the 2007 \nNCAA Division III National Championships. Bringing joy to the more than \n13,000 Kean University students and all of the Cougar fans in Union, \nNJ, Kean University capped off their impressive season with a thrilling \n5-to-4 victory in the 10th inning of the championship game. The victory \nushered in the Cougars' first baseball championship title and was the \nculmination of an inspiring undefeated run through the postseason.\n  Throughout the season the team played with courage and determination. \nBoasting a roster with 28 New Jerseyans, the Cougars finished in first \nplace in the New Jersey Athletic Conference, NJAC, with an impressive \nrecord of 15 wins and only 3 losses, best in the conference. Although \nthe Cougars fell to the College of New Jersey in the conference \nchampionships, the team recovered quickly and finished the season with \nan overall record of 43 wins and 8 losses and the national \nchampionship.\n  Championship baseball requires strong leadership, and under coach \nNeil Ioviero, the Cougars played team baseball that allowed them to \nrealize their full potential. With the help of assistant coaches Jamie \nIoviero, Lewis France, Jack Nagy, Francisco Romero, and Frank Beckhorn, \nthe coaching staff created a winning environment and offered the \nguidance that allowed the Cougars to excel on the field.\n  The entire Cougars squad played with heart and the championship was \ntruly a team effort. I would like to congratulate and commend all of \nthe players on the Kean University 2007 Division III Championship Team: \nMaikel De La Rosa, Ryan Clark, Joseph Augustine, Mike Shymanski, Keith \nKwiatek, Aaron Richard, Joseph D'Andrea, Eric Ammirata, Perry Schatzow, \nChris Carrano, Thomas Paglione, Brandon Aich, Mike Manganiello, Kevin \nO'Neill, Kyle Murphy, Andrew Cupido, Colin Feneis, Matt Donaghue, Derek \nGianakas, Mark Blevins, Dan Mattonelli, Matt Grinkevich, Joe Rizzo, Tim \nLowe, Daniel Zeffiro, Joe Bartlinski, Matt Merrigan, Nick Nolan and \nNick Cesare.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the State of New Jersey I am honored to \ncongratulate the Cougars for their NCAA Division III Championship \nseason. They played hard and displayed an admirable commitment to \ncompetition and sportsmanship that instills a sense of pride in the \nstudents of Kean University, the team's fans, and the people of my \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8605-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8605-S8606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO VIC ATIYEH\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, there is a word Senators \ntraditionally use when referring to one of our male colleagues on the \nfloor of the Senate. That word is ``gentleman.'' It is a word that you \ndon't hear often in today's society, as many consider it too old-\nfashioned. I disagree. Calling someone a gentleman is one of the \nhighest compliments one can give.\n  I pay tribute to the career and accomplishments of a truly \noutstanding gentleman--the former Governor of Oregon Vic Atiyeh. Anyone \ninvolved in the Oregon political arena over the past several decades, \nRepublican or Democrat, will tell you about Vic Atiyeh's kind and \ncourteous nature, his personal integrity, and his civility in a \nbusiness that is all too often uncivil.\n  On Wednesday, July 18, 2007, Oregonians will gather at the Portland \nInternational Airport to officially dedicate the international \nconcourse as the ``Governor Victor G. Atiyeh International Concourse.'' \nThis is an outstanding and truly fitting honor. During his eight years \nas Oregon's Governor, Vic Atiyeh implemented policies that transformed \nOregon into a hub for international commerce. Long before the term \n``global economy'' was part of our lexicon, Vic understood the \nimportance of opening Oregon's doors to international commerce, \ntourism, and cultural exchange programs.\n\n[[Page S8606]]\n\n  Vic Atiyeh's leadership in transforming Oregon's economy was critical \nas his swearing-in came just as Oregon entered an economic nosedive the \nlikes of which unseen since the Great Depression.\n  How bad was the situation? His first year in office, Governor Atiyeh \ncalled a special legislative session to deal with a $242 million \nbudgetary shortfall. Just as he and the legislature agreed on a package \nof budget cuts, they were presented with new estimates increasing the \nshortfall by nearly $100 million. Several months later, the deficit \njumped again by another $100 million.\n  Tough and unpleasant decisions had to be made. Vic Atiyeh rolled up \nhis sleeves and made them. One of Oregon's most respected journalists, \nBrent Walth, wrote:\n\n       Quietly, diligently, without whining or badgering or a \n     single ``I told you so,'' Atiyeh demonstrated how to manage a \n     state through a crisis.\n\n  As a tribute to Vic's leadership, and the wisdom of Oregonians, in \nthe darkest days of the recession he was reelected Governor by one of \nthe largest margins in our State's history.\n  I can't help but think that at the naming of the international \nconcourse, Vic Atiyeh will be thinking of his parents. Both Vic's \nfather and mother were immigrants from the Middle East. They made their \nway first to Ellis Island, and then on to Oregon where in 1900 they \nstarted a family-owned carpet business--a business that continues to \nthrive today. I also know that Vic will be thinking about his wonderful \nwife Delores, who from the beginning has helped Vic to remember his \npriorities as a public servant, dedicated father, and husband.\n  A few years ago I invited a small contingent of Oregon leaders to \njoin me for a breakfast to discuss issues important to our State. Vic \ncalled to say he would like to attend, but had a prior engagement: \nattending his granddaughter's soccer game. I assured Vic that I agreed, \nhe was making exactly the right decision.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to call Vic Atiyeh my friend, and I am \ndelighted the International Concourse at Portland International Airport \nwill soon bear his name. While I will be here in Washington at the \nSenate on July 18, my thoughts and best wishes will be with one of \nOregon's truly great gentlemen--Governor Vic Atiyeh.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8606-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ANNIVERSARY OF HURRICANE AUDREY\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, June 27, 2007, marks the 50th \nanniversary of Hurricane Audrey, which ravaged Cameron Parish in \nsouthwest Louisiana. It was the deadliest storm our Nation had ever \nexperienced until Hurricane Katrina came ashore in 2005.\n  Hurricane Audrey was a hurricane like no one had ever seen before in \nsouth Louisiana. Some residents rode out the fierce category 4 storm in \nthe Cameron Parish Courthouse, where a memorial service was held today. \nMore than 400 lives were lost--men, women and children.\n  Don Kingery describes the wrath of Hurricane Audrey in today's Lake \nCharles American Press:\n\n       Cameron Parish residents swam, clung, gasped and prayed. \n     Those who reached cheniers--ridges slightly higher than the \n     surrounding marshes found fear-crazed water moccasins and \n     wild marsh animals snapping and striking at each other and at \n     humans.\n\n  But the people of Cameron Parish and southwest Louisiana are \nresilient. We rebuilt our homes, our schools, our churches, our \ncommunities.\n  In September 2005, Hurricane Rita, the third worst hurricane our \nnation has ever seen, struck this same coast. Once again, the people of \nCameron have shown unbelievable resilience--again, returning to their \nhomes and rebuilding, literally, from the ground up. The Cameron \nCourthouse again managed to survive a devastating hurricane and truly \nbecame a symbol of strength and hope for the Parish. Every Cameron \nresident who suffered through Rita is linked by family and community to \nAudrey's survivors and victims.\n  Today is an opportunity to look back and remember Audrey and the \nlives lost, but also to look forward to a better, more vibrant \ncommunity in the years ahead. At the Cameron Courthouse today, \nsurvivors shared with the younger generation their many vivid stories. \nWe will take these stories and lessons from Audrey, learn from them and \ngrow from them.\n  Today, I want the Senate to recognize the National Guard, Civil Air \nPatrol and American Red Cross, all of which worked so bravely 50 years \nago in the wake of Hurricane Audrey, helping to bring Cameron Parish \nback to its feet.\n  I would also like to recognize BG Robert LeBlanc, who spoke at the \nmemorial service in Cameron today.

Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a friend and \ndistinguished North Dakotan, Francis Cree, who passed away on June 15 \nat the age of 86.\n  Francis Cree was a highly respected Ojibwe elder of the Turtle \nMountain Band of Chippewa of North Dakota. He was the official pipe \ncarrier for the tribe, a position of honor and leadership. He led the \ntribe as chairman in the 1960s and served several terms on tribal \ncouncil. Francis spent countless hours teaching young people about \nOjibwe culture and traditions. He was also a singer, a crafter and \nartist, a spiritual leader, a carver of pipes, and a keeper of the \nceremonial drum for the Dunseith community. On November 8, 2001, we had \nthe honor here in the Senate of being led in opening prayer by Francis. \nIt was indeed a proud day for Francis and his family.\n  Francis was married to Rose Cree, herself a well-known artist who \nmade beautiful willow baskets, several of which were featured at the \nSmithsonian's Festival of American Folk Life on The Mall here in our \nNation's Capital. The Crees collaborated on these baskets. Both \ncollected the materials, while Francis made the frames from ash, and \nRose wove the willows. In 2002, Francis and Rose received the National \nEndowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship, which recognizes \nthe significant contributions of American folk artists.\n  Francis was a kind, humble, and generous man. He gave selflessly and \nnever expected or wanted anything in return. Francis and Rose raised 14 \nchildren and opened their hearts and home to many more. They were also \nproud grandparents to more than 100 grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren and many, many great-great grandchildren. Each and every \none of them is a reflection of Francis's caring and endearing spirit.\n  Mr. President, this is a tremendous loss for the Cree family, but it \nis also an incredible loss to North Dakota and the Nation. Francis's \nlife and the legacy he leaves behind is truly an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8606-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8606-S8607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING J. CLEVELAND CADY\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ncontributions of a New Yorker with North Dakota ties--J. Cleveland \nCady.\n  A few weeks ago while reading the New York Times, I happened across \nan article that referenced Mr. Cady's contributions to Manhattan's \narchitecture. Mr. Cady was a prominent architect in New York during the \nlate 1800s. He designed the American Museum of Natural History as well \nas the original Metropolitan Opera House. He also designed a \nsignificant portion of a fairly notable institution we know today as \nYale University.\n  This article caught my eye because of a special connection between \nMr. Cady and the State of North Dakota.\n  Early in the last century, a young North Dakotan named William Langer \nwas attending a concert during his time at Columbia University when he \nnoticed a beautiful woman sitting below him on the orchestra level. \nAccording to the William Langer Papers\n\n[[Page S8607]]\n\ncollected at the University of North Dakota, Mr. Langer was fond of \nrecalling how he managed to have the woman's date called away on a \nphantom phone call. Seizing his opportunity, Mr. Langer approached the \nyoung lady and struck up a conversation. They began a long courtship \nshortly thereafter before marrying in 1918.\n  That woman was Lydia Cady, the daughter of J. Cleveland Cady.\n  Sadly, Mr. Cady died just 1 year after his daughter's wedding.\n  However, as the New York Times piece indicates, Mr. Cady's momentous \narchitectural contributions continue to shape the landscape of New York \nCity today.\n  In much the same way, his son-in-law's achievements played a key role \nin shaping the North Dakota of today. ``Wild Bill'' Langer was a \nlarger-than-life figure in North Dakota politics for nearly half a \ncentury. Mr. Langer was elected attorney general of North Dakota in \n1916. He went on to be elected Governor of North Dakota in 1932 and \nagain in 1936. He then represented North Dakota in the U.S. Senate from \n1941 to 1959, holding the seat I am now privileged to hold. In the \nSenate, Bill Langer was a champion for a range of issues that remain \nimportant to North Dakota today, including rural electrification, \nagriculture, and health care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times \narticle on Mr. Cady's architecture be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 18, 2007]\n\n                           J. Cleveland Cady\n\n       On a morning in March when pedestrians were sliding around \n     on the ice in front of the American Museum of Natural \n     History, hard hats were walking along wooden planks 120 feet \n     overhead installing blue metal scaffolds around a tiled tower \n     that resembled an upside-down ice cream cone with one scoop \n     on top. A vast scrim was stretched tightly down to the \n     ground; behind it a three-year restoration of the building's \n     facade would take place--dentistry on a grand scale. The \n     goal? To preserve the robust and magnificent neo-Romanesque \n     building designed by J. Cleveland Cady of Cady, Berg & See in \n     the 1890s.\n\n\n                                 Eagles\n\n       Fernando Fuentes, a foreman for the restoration company, \n     stood on the sidewalk in his green hard hat. A former \n     accountant, he began working high up on the sides of New York \n     buildings 30 years ago. ``I didn't want to wear a tie \n     anymore,'' he said. ``I wanted to get outdoors. The first \n     time I looked down from the 60th floor of a building I went \n     `uh-oh' but I got used to it. Now I love it. You see for \n     miles. Sometimes eagles have flown around us while we worked. \n     We restored the tallest and most beautiful buildings in New \n     York--the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center.''\n\n\n                                  Cady\n\n       Cady, who was influenced by the great H.H. Richardson, \n     designed the original Metropolitan Opera House in 1883. He \n     built hospitals, churches, houses and college buildings (15 \n     at Yale alone) but today he is pretty much forgotten. Even in \n     the natural history museum where everything from limpet to \n     triceratops is labeled, the name of J. Cleveland Cady is \n     nowhere to be seen.\n\n\n                                 Memory\n\n       The Church of the Covenant, a modest building, stands at \n     310 East 42nd Street. Inside the church, a graceful \n     Romanesque arch curves above the altar, and cast-iron columns \n     support screens of white flowers. In a hall by the front door \n     is a photograph of Cady, framed in dark wood. Cady, who died \n     in 1919, taught Sunday school in the church for 58 years. \n     Across from the portrait that is--finally--a plaque devoted \n     to Cady, even though it is turning black with age. ``In \n     loving memory of J. Cleveland Cady,'' it says.\n\n\n                       Outside the Museum--April\n\n       Mr. Fuentes pokes his finger into a crack between two large \n     blocks of pink granite: ``we're going to point up all the \n     stone.'' Men in yellow hard hats are loading chunks of stone \n     into blue wheelbarrows and dumping them into an open truck \n     the color of ketchup. ``This place is beautiful,'' says Mr. \n     Fuentes. ``One day years from now I'll drive by and I'll say, \n     `I worked there.'

A bill to promote employment of individuals with severe \ndisabilities through Federal Government contracting and procurement \nprocesses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I rise for the purpose of \nintroducing important legislation for the moral and fiscal posture of \nour great Nation: the Employer Work Incentive Act for Individuals with \nSevere Disabilities of 2007.\n  While there are obvious differences of opinion on the state of the \nU.S. economy, the U.S. workforce is experiencing relatively low \nunemployment rates. The average hourly wage and payroll employment \nlevels are at an all-time high. As our economy has experienced a slow \nand steady rise, there is one sector of the population who has been \nleft behind.\n  The unemployment rate for the severely disabled is higher than it has \never been. Despite previous efforts to increase employment \nopportunities for this population, the rate of unemployment has risen \nto 70 percent, that means increasing the amount of citizens relying on \nSocial Security disability insurance.\n  In 1982, the amount of payments distributed through Social Security \ndisability insurance was $15.8 billion. In 2004, that number climbed to \n$80.6 billion. According to a forecast by the Social Security trustees, \nthe old age and survivors insurance trust fund will last until 2044, \nwhile the disability trust fund will be exhausted in 2029.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act was enacted in 1990 as a means of \nleveling the playing field for citizens with disabilities. And while it \nhas provided necessary reforms in employment practices, this \nlegislation has had little to no effect on the rate of unemployment \nexperienced by individuals with severe disabilities.\n  Even government-run programs such as the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act or \nRandolph Shepard Act, have done little to improve this high \nunemployment rate. As our brave men and women serving in uniform in \nIraq and Afghanistan return, this problem will be compounded. Many of \nour troops have been disabled in the cause of protecting this country, \nand it is incumbent upon us to ensure that there are opportunities for \nthem in the workforce so that they can regain a semblance of their \nlives back.\n  It is time for a change in the way we think about employing \nindividuals with severe disabilities. The goal should be to create job \nopportunities for the severely disabled in the national workforce, not \njust in government operated programs.\n  The Employer Work Incentive Act for Individuals with Severe \nDisabilities, a bipartisan bill authored by Senator Kennedy and myself, \ncreates these opportunities while reducing dependence on Social \nSecurity disability insurance. This legislation gives government \ncontract procurement advantages to those companies who employ \nsignificant percentages of individuals with disabilities in their \nworkforce.\n  Our goal is to employ at least 1 percent of individuals with severe \ndisabilities, or 94,000 people. In doing this, we have the opportunity \nto save approximately $45 billion in Social Security disability \ninsurance over the next 10 years.\n  I know firsthand how important individuals with severe disabilities \nare to our workforce. In my home State of Kansas, persons like my good \nfriend, Pat Terick, play an important role in local business. His \nagency, the Cerebral Palsy Research Foundation of Kansas, has long \nadvocated the importance of creating job opportunities for the severely \ndisabled. This advocacy group, located in Wichita, is dedicated to \nshowing companies the advantages of hiring individuals with \ndisabilities. Our bill will be a powerful incentive for businesses to \nenhance their workforce.\n  I would like to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership in helping \nto craft this bipartisan legislation. Special thanks to my longtime \nfriend and to a great Kansan and American, Senator Bob Dole, cochair of \nthe One Percent Coalition. With Bob's remarkable devotion to disability \nadvocacy, it comes as no surprise that he is leading the effort to \nincrease job opportunities for those individuals with severe \ndisabilities.\n  It is time for a change in the way we think about employing \nindividuals with severe disabilities. We must create job opportunities \nfor the severely disabled in the national workforce, not just in \ngovernment-operated programs. With the support of my colleagues, this \nlegislation will do just that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we take one more giant step to open \nthe workplace doors wider for people with disabilities. The joining of \nbusinesses, consumers, and the Congress is powerful--and we will pass \nthis bill. I thank Senator Roberts for his vision and leadership on \nthis legislation.\n  In the winter of 1999, President Clinton signed the last bill of the \nmillennium into law at the FDR Memorial--it was the ``Ticket to Work'' \nAct.\n  Hundreds of disabled people managed through the snow to get to the \nmemorial that day, in hopes of finally being of part of our Nation's \ngreat economy.\n  That law has made a big difference in giving disabled workers access \nto health care by allowing them to work and buy Medicaid--but securing \nactual employment has been a much harder challenge.\n  Many of the nation's ``return to work'' programs are outdated and do \nnot engage employers to hire disabled workers to the fullest extent \npossible.\n  This legislation will expand opportunities for disabled workers and \nreward employers who are willing to do the right thing: by paying \ndisabled workers a decent salary; by providing and contributing to the \ncost of their health care insurance; and by placing workers in an \nenvironment where they can work alongside their non-disabled friends \nand neighbors.\n  ADA has led to enormous societal change. It has fundamentally altered \nhow our society views disability, and that change will be its most \nlasting and significant contribution.\n  But the ADA was also intended to address the very real barriers to \npeople with disabilities looking for a job, a house, an education, and \neven a bus ride--and we still have a lot of work to do to meet that \npromise.\n  This legislation is one positive step forward as we continue to fight \nfor more opportunities for disabled people to go to work and contribute \nto their communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \n        Carper, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Levin, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 1709. A bill to amend the National Underground Railroad Network to \nFreedom Act of 1998 to provide additional staff and oversight of funds \nto carry out the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my good \nfriend and colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, the \nUnderground Railroad Network Reauthorization Act of 2007. The original \nact, signed into law in 1998, has increased public awareness of the \nUnderground Railroad, a cornerstone in African-American heritage and \nhistory, with sites and programs in 28 States and the\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\nDistrict of Columbia. This is the only national program dedicated to \nthe preservation, interpretation and dissemination of underground \nrailroad history. I am pleased that we are joined in this effort by \nSenators Alexander, Carper, Cardin, Cochran, Kennedy, Kerry, Levin and \nObama.\n  Throughout this Nation there are sites in the underground railroad \nnetwork that, while still standing, have suffered structural damage. \nThere are also many sites that no longer house a physical structure, \nbut still are important to recognize. A good example is the Thomas \nGarrett House, located in Wilmington in my home State of Delaware. The \nGarrett House was the last station on the Underground Railroad before \nthe slaves reached freedom in Pennsylvania. It has been estimated that \nGarrett, a well known Quaker, helped more than 2,000 runaway slaves \nescape from the Southern States. The legislation being introduced today \nwill not only help pay to repair damaged structures, but also to \neducate the general public about those sites that are no longer in \nexistence, like the Thomas Garrett House.\n  The underground railroad network is a special part of American \nhistory that we cannot afford to let slip away. This legislation will \npreserve these invaluable memorials and educational resources by \nraising the authorization level from $500,000 to $2.5 million. We must \nmove now to ensure that the brave acts of these individuals are \npreserved for future generations to observe and honor.\n  A companion bill has already been introduced in the House by \nRepresentatives, H.R. 1239, by Representative Alcee L. Hastings and my \nfriend and colleague from Delaware, Representative Mike Castle. I hope \nboth Chambers move quickly to preserve this precious history.\n  It is my honor to ask my colleagues here in the Senate to join me \ntoday in supporting this bill so that this part of our Nation's past \nwill not be forgotten.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 1711. A bill to target cocaine kingpins and address sentencing \ndisparity between crack and powder cocaine; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 20 years ago, I helped write the law that \nestablished the current Federal cocaine sentencing scheme. Under this \nlaw, it takes 100 times more powder cocaine than crack cocaine to \ntrigger the 5- and 10-year mandatory minimum sentences. And mere \npossession of five grams of crack, the weight of about two sugar cubes, \ngets you the same 5-year mandatory minimum penalty as trafficking 500 \ngrams of the powder form of cocaine, which is equivalent to about a 1 \npound bag of sugar.\n  The facts that informed our decision at the time have proved to be \nwrong, making the underlying cocaine sentencing structure we created \nunfounded and unfair. It is time to change the law to reflect this new \nunderstanding. That is why, today, I am introducing the Drug Sentencing \nReform & Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007, which eliminates this \nunjustified disparity in Federal cocaine sentencing policy.\n  Back in 1986, when we wrote the law that established the current \nsentencing structure, crack was hitting our streets and communities \nlike a storm. I remember one headline that I think summed it up. It \nread ``New York City Being Swamped by `Crack'; Authorities Say They Are \nAlmost Powerless to Halt Cocaine.'' That summer was called ``the summer \nof crack,'' and we were inundated with horror stories about how this \nnew form of smokeable cocaine was ravaging communities. We were told \nthat crack was instantly addictive, prompting the expression, ``Once on \ncrack, you never go back.'' We heard that it caused users to go on \nviolent rampages, was more harmful to babies than powder cocaine when \nused by mothers during pregnancy, and would lead to the disintegration \nof inner-city communities.\n  And in Congress, there was a feeling of desperation that summer, a \nsense that we had to give law enforcement the power they needed to save \nneighborhoods being ravaged by this drug.\n  More than a dozen bills were introduced to increase the penalties for \nthis form of cocaine, but because we knew so little about it, the \nproposals were all over the map. They ranged from the Reagan \nadministration's proposal of a 20-to-1 sentencing disparity between \ncrack and powder cocaine to a 1000-to-1 disparity proposed by Senator \nLawton Chiles. I joined Senators Byrd and Dole in leading the effort to \nenact the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which established the current \n100-to-1 disparity.\n  Our intentions were good, but as further scientific and sociological \nstudy has shown, we got it wrong.\n  We now know that these initial assumptions about crack and powder \ncocaine, which are just two forms of the same drug, simply were not \ntrue. Scientific evidence shows that crack does not have unique, \ninherent properties that make it instantly addictive. According to the \nJournal of the American Medical Association, ``cocaine in any form \nproduces the same physiological and subjective effects.'' We also have \nlearned that the dire predictions about a generation of ``crack \nbabies'' whose mothers used crack during pregnancy have not proven \ntrue. The negative effects of prenatal exposure to crack cocaine and \npowder cocaine are identical. Furthermore, data that the U.S. \nSentencing Commission has collected show that crack users rarely commit \nacts of violence. Almost all crack-related violence is associated with \ntrafficking, not with someone on a so-called crack-induced rampage.\n  Looking back over more than 20 years, it is also clear that the harsh \ncrack penalties have had a disproportionate impact on the African \nAmerican community. Eighty-two percent of those convicted of crack \noffenses at the Federal level are African American, fueling the notion \nthat the Federal cocaine sentencing scheme is unfair.\n  There is widespread recognition that the current cocaine sentencing \nscheme is out of date and out of touch with reality. There are others \nhere in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, who feel the current \ncocaine sentencing policy is unfounded. Like me, Senators Sessions and \nHatch have introduced legislation to reduce the disparity and I want to \ncongratulate them for their hard work and dedication to this issue.\n  As a matter of fact, when President Bush was asked about the longer \nsentences for crack cocaine, he said that the disparity, and I am \nquoting the President here, ``ought to be addressed by making sure the \npowder cocaine and crack cocaine penalties are the same. I don't \nbelieve we ought to be discriminatory.''\n  A slew of commentators, Federal judges, Federal prosecutors, doctors, \nacademics, social scientists, civil rights leaders, clergy, and others \nhave spoken out about the unwarranted disparity between crack and \npowder cocaine sentences.\n  And just last month, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a bipartisan \npanel comprised in large part of Federal judges who preside over \ncocaine cases, issued a report stating that the current Federal cocaine \nsentencing scheme ``continues to come under almost universal criticism \nfrom representatives of the Judiciary, criminal justice practitioners, \nacademics, and community interest groups.''\n  This is not the first time the Sentencing Commission has urged \nreform. In 1995, the Commission recommended eliminating the crack/\npowder sentencing disparity. Congress rejected this proposal. As \nscientific understanding of cocaine evolved, the Commisson urged \nCongress three more times to address this problem. Yet Congress did not \nact. We are long overdue in heeding the call for reform.\n  The Sentencing Cmission has provided us with a roadmap. In its most \nrecent report, the Commission ``unanimously and strongly urge[d]'' \nCongress to: 1. Act swiftly to increase the threshold quantities of \ncrack necessary to trigger the 5- and 10-year mandatory minimum \nsentences, so that Federal resources are focused on major drug \ntraffickers as intended in the original 1986 legislation; and 2. repeal \nthe mandatory minimum penalty sentence for simple possession of crack, \nthe only controlled substance for which there is a mandatory minimum \nfor a first time offense of simple possession. The Sentencing \nCommission also unanimously rejected any effort to increase the \npenalties for powder since there is no evidence to justify any such \nupward adjustment.\n  My bill implements all of these recommendations.\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\n  Specifically, my bill will eliminate the current 100-to-1 disparity \nby increasing the 5-year mandatory minimum threshold quantity for crack \ncocaine to 500 grams, from 5 grams, and the 10-year threshold quantity \nto 5,000 grams, from 50 grams, while maintaining the current statutory \nmandatory minimum threshold quantities for powder cocaine. It will also \neliminate the current 5-year mandatory minimum penalty for simple \npossession of crack cocaine, the only mandatory minimum sentence for \nsimple possession of a drug by a first time offender.\n  It also increases penalties for major drug traffickers and provides \nadditional resources for the Federal agencies that investigate and \nprosecute drug offenses. Furthermore, because I have always believed \nthat the best approach to fighting crime is a holistic one that \nincorporates enforcement, prevention, and treatment, my bill authorizes \nfunds for prison- and jail-based drug treatment programs.\n  My bill both remedies the historic injustice in the current cocaine \nsentencing laws and focuses Federal resources on, and increases \npenalties for, the big fish, the major drug traffickers and kingpins \nwho drive the drug trade. Unlike Federal powder cocaine offenders, over \nhalf of Federal crack offenders are low-level street dealers who could \nand should be prosecuted at the State level. States are better equipped \nto handle these small-time dealers and users, and under my bill, these \noffenders would still be punished, without expending precious Federal \nresources.\n  Drug use is a serious problem, and I have long supported strong \nantidrug legislation. But in addition to being tough, our drug laws \nshould be rational and fair. My bill achieves the right balance. We \nhave talked about the need to address this cocaine sentencing disparity \nfor long enough. It is time to act. I hope that my colleagues will join \nwith me to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 1712. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve \nnewborn screening activities, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nScreening for Health of Infants and Newborns Act, also known as the \nSHINE Act. This legislation is critical for the health of newborns and \nchildren because we know that public education and early detection are \ntwo of the greatest weapons we have in the battle against early \nchildhood disorders.\n  Each year in our Nation, at least 4 million newborns are screened for \nsevere disorders, with 5,000 newborns diagnosed as a result. Although \nthese numbers may seem small, these disorders are often life \nthreatening and can cause serious mental and physical disabilities if \nleft untreated. Early detection by newborn screening can lessen these \nillnesses, or completely prevent progression of many of these disorders \nif medical intervention can be started early enough.\n  I am proud to say that New York has been a leader in newborn \nscreening since 1960 when Dr. Robert Guthrie developed the first \nnewborn screening test. Since then, more than 10 million babies have \nbeen tested. In 2004, New York expanded their newborn screening program \nfrom 11 conditions to encompass 44 conditions. These improvements were \nthe result of a concerted effort by State officials and parent advocacy \ngroups like the Save Babies through Screening Foundation and Hunter's \nHope Foundation. They share a common goal, that every child born with a \ntreatable disease should receive early diagnosis and lifesaving \ntreatment so that they can grow up as healthy as possible. Today, we \nwant to ensure that the great strides made by New York can be a model \nfor all States and that New York can continue to make advancements that \nwill benefit the children of New York and around the Nation.\n  Newborn screening experts suggest States should test for minimum of \n29 treatable core conditions. However, as of today, some States only \nscreen for seven conditions. Every child should have access to tests \nthat may prevent them from a life threatening disease. This bill \nestablishes grant programs so that States can increase their capacity \nto screen for all the core conditions. Grant funds are also available \nfor States like New York to expand newborn screening panels above and \nbeyond the core conditions by developing additional newborn screening \ntests.\n  We should expect equity within newborn screening so that it does not \nmatter where your baby is born. This legislation will establish \nrecommended guidelines for States for newborn screening tests, \nreporting, and data standards. By tracking the prevalence of diseases \nidentified by newborn screening within States, we will be able to meet \nthese goals and improve the long-term health of our children.\n  I hear from many parents how frightening it is to have a sick child \nand to not have a diagnosis. Many parents spend years trying to find \nout what is wrong with their child and feel helpless. This legislation \nwill insure that current information on newborn screening is available \nand accessible to health providers and parents. The SHINE Act will \nprovide interactive formats through the Maternal Child Health Bureau of \nthe Health Services and Resources Administration so that parents and \nproviders can ask questions and receive answers about newborn screening \ntest, diagnosis, follow-up and treatment.\n  Early treatment can prevent negative and irreversible health outcomes \nfor affected newborns. We should be doing all we can to give every \nchild born in our country the opportunity for a happy and healthy life.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nsupport.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                                Hunter's Hope,\n\n                                  Orchard Park, NY, June 25, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: on behalf of the Hunter's Hope \n     Foundation, I respectively submit this letter as our full and \n     complete support for the bill titled ``Screening for the \n     Health of Infants and Newborns (SHINE Act)''.\n       The Hunter's Hope Foundation was established in 1997 by Pro \n     Football Hall of Fame member and former Buffalo Bills \n     Quarterback, Jim Kelly, and his wife, Jill, after their \n     infant son, Hunter, was diagnosed with Krabbe (Crab a) \n     Leukodystrophy, an inherited, fatal, nervous system disease.\n       The Foundation's mission is to: increase public awareness \n     of Krabbe disease and other leukodystrophies, support those \n     afflicted and their families, identify new treatments, and \n     ultimately find a cure.\n       Since 1997, Cord Blood Transplant (CBT) has become a viable \n     treatment for Krabbe disease as well as a few other \n     leukodystrophies. But, CBT is only effective if the child is \n     treated before the disease inflicts irreversible damage to \n     the brain and nervous system. There are many other treatable \n     diseases that if not treated early will cause irreversible \n     damage. And, the number of such diseases continues to \n     increase with advancements in science and technology. We must \n     establish an infrastructure in our country that not only \n     addresses the immediate need, but also creates a system for \n     expansion. The SHINE Act will accomplish this.\n       Hunter passed away August 5, 2005. Like thousands of other \n     children, if he had been screened at birth, he may be living \n     a healthy life today. Please help these children and their \n     families and pass this bill. We implore you to expedite the \n     passing and implementing of this bill. With each day that \n     passes, children are suffering and dying needlessly.\n       Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jacque Waggoner,\n     Board of Directors, Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Save Babies Through Screening,\n\n\n                                             Foundation, Inc.,\n\n                                     Scarsdale, NY, June 25, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n      U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: I am writing on behalf of the Save \n     Babies Through Screening Foundation to show our support for \n     the Screening for Health of Infants and NEwborns (SHINE Act). \n     As you know, our organization's mission is to improve the \n     lives of babies by working to prevent disabilities and early \n     death resulting from disorders detectable through newborn \n     screening. Our organization was founded in 1998 and is the \n     only organization solely dedicated to raising awareness in \n     regard to newborn screening.\n       We believe that this bill will greatly enhance the \n     expansion of newborn screening throughout the United States \n     and will save the lives of thousands of babies--our tiniest \n     citizens. Additionally, this will spare Parents the agonizing \n     pain of watching their children suffer as I can attest to \n     firsthand. With the great expansion of newborn screening, \n     children will be able to live healthy and productive lives.\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\n       We thank you for your vision and hard work. Nobody should \n     suffer the loss or impairment of a child when there are tests \n     and treatment available and this bill will put an end to \n     future suffering. Please feel free to contact me if we can be \n     of any assistance.\n           Regards,\n                                                  Jill Levy-Fisch,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     FOD Family Support Group,\n\n                                        Okemos, MI, June 26, 2007.\n       To Whom It May Concern: As Founder and Director of an \n     international Family Support Group for rare metabolic \n     disorders called Fatty Oxidation Disorders (many of which can \n     be screened for at birth, as well as many other metabolic \n     disorders), I strongly endorse the Screening for Health of \n     Infants and Newborns Act (SHINE Act of 2007) that Senator \n     Clinton originally introduced on February 15, 2007. It would \n     greatly enhance the lives of many families in our country.\n       My family, and many others in our Group, has experienced \n     the tragedy of not having the awareness/education of, \n     screening for, and short- and long-term followup treatment \n     for an FOD. Our daughter, Kristen, died suddenly at the age \n     of 21 months. Fortunately, by the time our 2nd child was \n     born, we had become aware of these rare disorders and had \n     Kevin tested at birth--he is now a healthy, active, and soon-\n     to-be college graduate. If it wasn't for the newborn \n     screening and follow-up treatment for MCAD, Kevin would have \n     died when he had his 1st illness at 6 months of age.\n       I wholeheartedly endorse all parts of the bill that will \n     help educate and create awareness of these many disorders \n     (and more in the future) for families and professionals \n     across our country. Many aspects of the bill mirror our \n     Group's foundation and mission--to create awareness about \n     FODs, to educate the public, to network and support FOD \n     families and professionals around the world, to provide \n     ongoing education and information about metabolic disorders, \n     to inform families and the public of new developments in \n     screening, diagnosis, research and treatment (I also endorse \n     assisting in covering formulas, drugs, supplements etc), and \n     to advocate expanded universal and comprehensive newborn \n     screening and long-term follow-up treatment for FODs and \n     other related metabolic disorders.\n       Please pass this bill for the benefit of many infants and \n     families!\n           Take Care,\n                                                    Deb Lee Gould,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 25, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: We are pleased to write this letter \n     of support for the Screening for Health of Infants and \n     Newborns Act of 2007. We commend you for your leadership in \n     calling for a uniform and comprehensive national approach to \n     screening newborns for the full panel of core conditions \n     recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and \n     endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. If diagnosed \n     early, these disorders, including metabolic and hearing \n     deficiency, can be managed or treated to prevent severe \n     consequences.\n       As a hospital which provides a wide array of services to \n     children with special health care needs, we know how \n     important early detection and treatment of conditions can be. \n     We were particularly pleased to see the provisions of this \n     legislation which provide for a Central Clearinghouse of \n     current educational and family support information, critical \n     to assuring a national standard of care.\n       According to the latest March of Dimes Newborn Screening \n     Report Card, nearly two-thirds of all babies born in the \n     United States this year will be screened for more than 20 \n     life-threatening disorders. However, disparities in state \n     newborn screening programs mean some babies will die or \n     develop brain damage or other severe complications from these \n     disorders because they are not identified in time for \n     effective treatment.\n       At present, the United States lacks consistent national \n     guidelines for newborn screening, and each state decides how \n     many and which screening tests are required for every baby. \n     As a result, only 9 percent of all babies are screened for \n     all of the 29 recommended conditions. Clearly it is a wise \n     investment to take full advantage of the information \n     available to detect treatable conditions in children.\n       We commend you for your leadership on this most important \n     issue and look forward to working with you and your \n     colleagues to secure passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Larry Levine,\n       President.\n     Judith Wiener Goodhue,\n       Vice Chair, Board of Trustees, Chair, Government Relations \n     Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               March of Dimes,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of more than 3 million \n     volunteers and 1400 staff members of the March of Dimes, I am \n     writing to thank you for introducing the ``Screening for \n     Health of Infants and Newborns Act'' or the ``SHINE Act.'' We \n     understand the purpose of this legislation would be to \n     authorize grant programs to support state efforts to expand \n     the number of conditions for which newborns are screened and \n     to improve dissemination of educational resources to \n     healthcare professionals and the public.\n       As you may know, the March of Dimes president served on the \n     steering committee that developed the American College of \n     Medical Genetics recommendation that every baby born in the \n     United States be screened for a `core' set of twenty-nine \n     treatable disorders, including certain metabolic conditions \n     and hearing deficiency. The March of Dimes has endorsed this \n     recommendation because early detection and treatment of these \n     disorders can avert lifelong disabilities (including mental \n     retardation), other serious illnesses and even death. Parents \n     are often unaware that the number and quality of newborn \n     screening varies from state to state and while newborns are \n     regularly screened and treated for debilitating conditions in \n     some states, in others, screening may not be required and \n     conditions may go undiagnosed and untreated.\n       Federal guidance and incentives for states to improve their \n     newborn screening programs are sorely needed and the ``SHINE \n     Act'' will go a long way to enhancing the capacity of states \n     to expand their programs and to provide much needed \n     educational materials to families via the internet.\n       We at the March of Dimes are sincerely grateful for your \n     leadership on this issue and we look forward to working with \n     you and others Members of Congress to expand federal support \n     for newborn screening.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Marina L. Weiss,\n\n                            Senior Vice President, Public Policy &\n     Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American College of\n\n\n                                             Medical Genetics,\n\n                                      Bethesda, MD, June 27, 2007.\n     Re Screening for Health of Infants and Newborns (SHINE) Act.\n\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: I am writing in reference to the \n     SHINE Act, a bill that your office will introduce into the \n     Senate imminently to ensure the health and quality of life of \n     all newborns in the United States by providing resources to \n     further improve the capacity and quality of newborn screening \n     programs. The American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG), \n     which represents approximately 1400 medical geneticists who \n     comprise the workforce that cares for these patients and \n     their families, as well as houses the National Coordinating \n     Center for the Regional Genetic and Newborn Screening \n     Services Collaboratives, appreciates that you have \n     acknowledged our ongoing roles in the development of newborn \n     screening programs in the United States. ACMG is fully \n     supportive of the bill and recognizes the importance of each \n     of the areas it addresses. Newborn screening programs have \n     always represented a unique partnership between public health \n     and private healthcare and as such, they require a high \n     degree of coordination, collaboration and communication, as \n     recognized by this bill. Likewise, surveillance and data \n     collection are pivotal to harnessing new developments in the \n     areas of diagnostics and therapeutics.\n       We are pleased that you have recognized this important \n     public health program and have sought positive activities to \n     improve it. If there is anything we can do to further the \n     goals of this legislation, please feel free to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael S. Watson,\n        Executive Director.\n     Judith L. Benkendorf,\n       Project Manager.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1714. A bill to establish a multiagency nationwide campaign to \neducate small business concerns about health insurance options \navailable to children; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in the coming weeks, the Finance Committee \nwill meet to consider legislation to reauthorize the vitally important \nState Children's Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP. The legislation that \ncomes through committee will represent this Congress's first \nopportunity to make a loud and clear statement regarding the importance \nof children's health as a national priority.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I am focused on one goal: to \ninsure each and everyone of the 11 million kids under the age of 21 who \nare uninsured today, while making sure that no other kids slip through \nthe cracks. The first bill I introduced in this Congress, S. 95, the \nKids Come First Act, would accomplish just that.\n  Because the Bush administration and previous Republican Congresses \nhave played fast and loose with our Nation's finances, today we face an \nenormous budget deficit. The unfortunate reality is that we may not be \nable to accomplish all of the goals set forth in Kids\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\nCome First. But the Democratic Congress is committed to doing \neverything in our power to expand health coverage to children this \nyear.\n  Much of our efforts will be focused on S-CHIP reauthorization. But \nthere are additional steps we can take to begin to address this \nproblem. The Small Business Children's Health Education Act, which I am \nintroducing today with Senator Snowe, represents one of those steps.\n  In February of 2007, the Urban Institute reported that among those \neligible for the State Children's Health Insurance Program, children \nwhose families are self-employed or who work for small business \nconcerns are far less likely to be enrolled. Specifically, one out of \nevery four eligible children with parents who work for a small business \nor who are self-employed are not enrolled. This statistic compares with \njust 1 out of every 10 eligible children whose parents work for a large \nfirm.\n  We need to do a better job of informing and educating America's small \nbusiness owners and employees of the options that may be available for \ncovering uninsured children. To that effect, the Small Business \nChildren's Health Education Act creates an intergovernmental task \nforce, consisting of the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the \nSecretary of Labor and the Secretary of Treasury, to conduct a campaign \nto enroll kids of small business employees who are eligible for S-CHIP \nand Medicaid but are not currently enrolled. To educate America's small \nbusinesses on the availability of S-CHIP and Medicaid, the task force \nis authorized to make use of the Small Business Administration's \nbusiness partners, including the Service Corps of Retired Executives, \nthe Small Business Development Centers, Certified Development \nCompanies, and Women's Business Centers, and is authorized to enter \ninto memoranda of understanding with chambers of commerce across the \ncountry.\n  Additionally, the Small Business Administration is directed to post \nS-CHIP and Medicaid eligibility criteria and enrollment information on \nits website, and to report back to the Senate and House Committees on \nSmall Business regarding the status and successes of the task force's \nefforts to enroll eligible kids.\n  If you believe that we should be doing everything in our power to get \nevery kid in this country insured, then this proposal is a no-brainer. \nIt is estimated that 6 million of the 9 million uninsured children \nliving in the United States are currently eligible for S-CHIP and \nMedicaid. These are kids who already meet the criteria for coverage, we \njust need to get the word to their parents and to their parents' \nemployers that they are eligible. Ultimately, this is about priorities. \nI believe that the richest country on earth should not rest until all \nof our children are as safe and as healthy as they can possibly be. I \nthank Senator Snowe for our longstanding partnership on issues critical \nto America's small business owners, and for her work on this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1714\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate discriminatory copayment rates for outpatient psychiatric \nservices under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare Mental \nHealth Copayment Equity Act of 2007. I am pleased to be joined again \nthis year by my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry. Since the \n107th Congress, Senator Kerry has worked tirelessly with me to address \nthe problem of mental health care parity. Today, we unite yet again to \nachieve equality between mental and physical health services under \nMedicare.\n  Mental illness ranks as the second leading reason that Americans lose \nhealthy years of life to premature death or disability. The occurrence \nof mental illness among older adults is widespread, with nearly one in \nfive Americans aged 55 and older experiencing specific disorders that \nare not a part of normal aging. In fact, older Americans have the \nhighest rate of suicide in the country, and their risk increases with \nage, and is further exacerbated by impediments to treatment.\n  It is critical to note that while Medicare is often viewed as health \ninsurance for people over age 65, it also provides care for those with \nsevere disabilities. In fact, mental disorders are the single most \nfrequent cause of disability, affecting more than one out of four \nMedicare beneficiaries. So the problem of access to mental health \ntreatment is a pressing one for Medicare.\n  The good news is that, today, there are increasingly effective \ntreatments for mental illness. The majority of people with mental \ndisorders who receive proper treatment can lead productive lives.\n  Yet Medicare pays far less for critical mental health services needed \nby these beneficiaries than it does for medical treatment for physical \ndisabilities. Medicare beneficiaries typically pay 20 percent of the \ncost of covered outpatient services, including doctor's visits, and \nMedicare pays the remaining 80 percent. However, this does not apply to \noutpatient mental health services; here Medicare law imposes a special \nlimitation, which requires patients to pay a much higher copayment of \n50 percent.\n  Let me give an example of the current disparity in copayments. If a \nMedicare patient sees a doctor in an office for treatment of cancer, \nheart disease, or the flu, the patient must pay 20 percent of the fee \nfor the visit. Yet if a Medicare patient sees a psychiatrist, \npsychologist, social worker, or other professional in an office for \ntreatment of depression, schizophrenia, or any other type of mental \nillness, the patient must pay 50 percent of the fee. That impedes \ncritically-needed treatment, creating disability and resulting in lives \nneedlessly lost.\n  Our bill will eliminate the barrier to access which the present \ndiscriminatory copayment imposes, by phasing out the disparate payment \npolicy over a 6-year period. This will lower the copayment rate for \nmental health services from the current 50 percent to the standard 20 \npercent. This means that, in 2013, patients seeking outpatient \ntreatment for mental illness will pay the same 20 percent copayment \nthat is required of Medicare patients today who receive outpatient \ntreatment for other illnesses. Our bill creates ``copayment equity'' \nfor Medicare mental health services. It is time to end the distinction \nbetween physical and mental disorders under Medicare.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Kerry and myself in \nsupporting the Medicare Mental Health Copayment Equity Act of 2007 for \nequal treatment of mental health services under Medicare.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nSnowe in once again introducing the Medicare Mental Health Copayment \nEquity Act of 2007. This legislation will establish mental health care \nparity in the Medicare Program.\n  Medicare currently requires patients to pay a 20 percent copayment \nfor all Part B services except mental health care services, for which \npatients are assessed a 50 percent copayment. Thus, under the current \nsystem, if a Medicare patient sees an endocrinologist for diabetes \ntreatment, an oncologist for cancer treatment, a cardiologist for heart \ndisease treatment or an internist for treatment of the flu, the \ncopayment is 20 percent of the cost of the visit. If, however, a \nMedicare patient visits a psychiatrist for treatment of mental illness, \nthe copayment is 50 percent of the cost of the visit. This disparity in \noutpatient copayment represents blatant discrimination against Medicare \nbeneficiaries with mental illness.\n  The prevalence of mental illness in older adults is considerable. \nAccording to the U.S. Surgeon General, 20 percent of older adults in \nthe community and 40 percent of older adults in primary care settings \nexperience symptoms of depression, while as many as one out of every \ntwo residents in nursing homes are at risk of depression. The elderly \nhave the highest rate of suicide in the U.S., and there is a clear \ncorrelation between major depression and suicide: 60 to 75 percent of \nsuicides among patients 75 and older have diagnosable depression. In \naddition to our seniors, hundreds of thousands of nonelderly disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries become Medicare-eligible by virtue of severe and \npersistent mental disorders. To subject the mentally disabled to \ndiscriminatory costs in coverage for the very conditions for which they \nbecame Medicare eligible is illogical and unfair.\n  There is ample evidence that mental illness can be treated. \nUnfortunately, among the general population, those in need for \ntreatment often do not seek it because they are ashamed of their \ncondition. Among our Medicare population, the mentally ill face a \ndouble burden: not only must they overcome the stigma about their \nillness, but once they seek treatment they must pay one-half of the \ncost of care out of their own pocket. The Medicare Mental Health \nCopayment Equity Act will provide for the reduction of the coinsurance \nrate for outpatient mental health services over a 6-year period. By \napplying the same 20 percent copayment rate to mental health services \nto which all other outpatient services are subjected, the Medicare \nMental Health Copayment Equity Act will bring parity to the Medicare \nProgram and improve access to care for our senior and disabled \nbeneficiaries who are living with mental illness.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE:\n  S. 1716. A bill to amend the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, \nKatrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007, to \nstrike a requirement relating to forage producers; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that seeks \nto fix a potentially devastating mistake in the U.S. Troop Readiness, \nVeterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability \nAppropriations Act of 2007, Public Law No. 110-28.\n  In May 2007, Congress passed H.R. 2206, which included much-needed \ndisaster assistance for our Nation's farmers and ranchers. After much \ndelay, it is critical that those producers impacted by natural \ndisasters receive the assistance they need and deserve.\n  Over the past few years, drought conditions and other natural \ndisasters have financially strained tens of thousands of agriculture \nproducers across the country. Congress has responded to the needs of \nAmerica's producers by enacting emergency disaster assistance for our \nfarm and ranch families.\n  However, it has been brought to my attention that many livestock \nproducers will likely be ineligible for assistance due to an unintended \ntechnicality. Congress clearly intended disaster assistance to be \navailable to those producers most impacted by years of devastating \nweather conditions. This assistance includes livestock producer \neligibility for Livestock Indemnity Payments and Livestock Compensation \nProgram without participation in the Non-Insured Crop Disaster \nAssistance program, NAP, or Federal crop insurance pilot program as a \nprerequisite.\n  However, it is my understanding that the Department of Agriculture \nwill interpret section 9012 of Public Law 110-28 as Congress intending \nthat all livestock producers must have NAP or pilot crop insurance \ncoverage in order to be eligible for disaster payments. If disaster \nbenefits are limited to only\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\nthose livestock producers with NAP or crop insurance coverage, the vast \nmajority of livestock producers in drought-stricken regions will be \nineligible for disaster assistance.\n  Only a small percentage of producers participated in the NAP program, \nwhich only paid $1 to $2 per acre. As a result, few grazing producers \nbought policies. It is not good policy to exclude producers from \ndisaster assistance who chose not to participate in what many consider \nan ineffective program.\n  My legislation would strike section 9012 of Public Law 110-28, and \nensure that those producers in need of assistance receive assistance in \na timely manner.\n  It is my belief that both the Senate and the House of Representatives \nshould pass my bill to ensure that livestock producers are able to \nqualify for the disaster assistance that President Bush signed into law \nearlier this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Obama, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n        Cardin, Mr. Levin, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1717. A bill to reqire the Secretary of Agriculture, acting \nthrough the Deputy Chief of State and Private Forestry organization, to \nprovide loans to eligible units of local government to finance \npurchases of authorized equipment to monitor, remove, dispose of, and \nreplace infested trees that are located on land under the jurisdiction \nof the eligible units of local government and within the borders of \nquarantine areas infested by the emerald ash borer, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the bipartisan \nEmerald Ash Borer Municipality Assistance Act of 2007, a bill designed \nto help local units of government manage the costs of combating this \npernicious invasive pest species.\n  Although some of my colleagues in the Senate may not have heard of \nthe Emerald Ash Borer, it is a destructive pest that poses a \nsignificant threat to our forests and urban and residential landscapes.\n  Some of my colleagues are all too familiar with the destructive power \nof EAB because of the speed with which it can move from State to State \nand the extensive damage it can cause to a State's ash tree population. \nBefore this species was discovered in Illinois, I had been following \nits deadly march across the Midwest and had discussed the dangers of \nEAB with my colleagues from Michigan and Indiana.\n  The emerald-green beetle was most likely brought to North America in \nsolid wood packing material from Asia about 10 years ago. Our new flat \nworld means that in addition to improved global communications and more \nforeign trade and foreign travel, we are also witnessing the \ninternational movement of bugs like this beetle.\n  The beetle was first discovered in Michigan in 2002. Since then, the \nbeetle has killed 20 million of the State's more than 700 million ash \ntrees. Since then, the beetle has been found in Indiana, Ohio, and \nMaryland. The tiny beetle kills with astonishing speed. During the \nmating season, the ash borer lays its larva under the bark of the ash \ntrees. When they hatch, hundreds of these beetles feed on the inner \nbark of the ash tree, disrupting the tree's ability to transport water \nand nutrients through the tree.\n  Within 2 to 3 years of introduction, the beetles will destroy a host \nash tree and spread. Each beetle has a half mile flying range, widening \nthe beetle's infestation every year in expanding concentric circles. \nThe beetle is also spread artificially and often unknowingly by campers \nand others who transport ash firewood and thus introduce the beetle to \nnew environments.\n  Managing this deadly beetle is a significant challenge. At an average \ncost of $500 per tree removal and a couple of hundred dollars to \nreplant a tree to maintain forest and urban canopies, this bug presents \na serious economic impact on our communities. Additional costs are \nincurred for equipment, marshalling yards, and survey activities.\n  While the Federal Government administers a national EAB program \nthrough USDA-APHIS, many of the costs of managing EAB are borne by \nmunicipalities and homeowners. For example, the city of Woodridge, IL, \na town of 30,000, is home to 8,000 public trees, 25 percent of which \nare ash. If the Emerald Ash Borer were to infest the public-owned ash \ntrees of Woodridge, the cost of removing and replanting Woodridge's \ntrees would be about $1.8 million.\n  One of the missing pieces in the Federal Emerald Ash Borer, EAB, \nProgram is a mechanism to help municipalities defray the costs of \nperforming EAB prevention duties normally performed by the Federal \nGovernment. These costs include managing the EAB population by \nsurveying trees, removing infested trees, and replacing removed trees. \nThe expenses associated with these activities include purchasing bucket \ntrucks, tub grinders, and replacement trees and renting or leasing \nspace for marshalling yards.\n  The legislation would create a low-interest revolving loan fund for \ncommunities for the purchase of capital equipment and replacement trees \nwithin quarantine areas. Communities would have a 20-year window to \nrepay the loan. In addition, the bill would allow states to contract \nwith local units of government to perform EAB duties.\n  Ash trees are among the most commonly found trees in our forests and \nurban canopies. Wisconsin is home to more than 700 million of them. \nThey make up 20 percent of the tree population of beautiful Madison, \nWI. The beetle threatens billions of ash trees in North America. Losing \nour ash trees would incur costs that are difficult to measure. \nHomeowners deeply love their trees and value the shade and aesthetic \nbeauty they add. Ash trees are a part of our wildlife habitat and \ndiverse environment.\n  In my State of Illinois, the beetle has been found in multiple \nlocations, in several parts of both Kane County and Cook County. \nExperts say that unchecked, this beetle could threaten ash trees \nnationwide on a scale equal to the Dutch Elm Disease, which destroyed \nmore than half of the elm trees in the northern United States.\n  It is a problem of significant magnitude and I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in this effort to control and eradicate the Emerald Ash \nBorer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1717\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to require \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to determine the price of all milk used \nfor manufactured purposes, which shall be classified as Class II milk, \nby using the national average cost of production, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, agriculture is Pennsylvania's No. 1 \nindustry. According to 2004 U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, \nstatistics, the market value of all agriculture production in PA was \napproximately $7,026,739,000. Further, dairy is the number one sector \nof our agriculture industry. In 2005, Pennsylvania dairy farmers \nproduced 10.5 billion pounds of milk from 558,000 cows on approximately \n9,000 dairy farms. In 2004, milk production in PA contributed about \n$1,770,912,000 to the economy.\n  I have consistently fought for Pennsylvania's dairy producers since \ntaking office in 1981. Last year, I fought to ensure the viability of \nthe dairy industry by ensuring that the Senate Budget Committee opposed \nthe administration's fiscal year 2007 proposals that would have been \ndetrimental to our Nation's dairy farmers. I, along with 16 other \nSenators, wrote a letter on March 8, 2006, to the Senate Budget \nCommittee urging rejection of the proposed budget cuts and tax \nincreases on America's dairy farmers that included: 1. reducing the \nvalue of the price support program; 2. cutting Milk Income Loss \nContract, MILC, payments by 5 percent; and 3. taxing every dairy farmer \nin America 3 cents per hundredweight, cwt., on all production. We were \nsuccessful in this fight to protect Pennsylvania's, and the Nation's, \ndairy producers.\n  Also, I, along with five other Senators, requested that the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, review the Chicago Mercantile \nExchange, CME, cash cheese market because the price of cheese is \nstrongly correlated to the price of milk. The GAO is expected to have a \nfinal report in the near future. This report will help us set \nlegislative priorities by giving us a better understanding of the CME \ncheese market and its relation to the price of milk.\n  Even though milk production in Pennsylvania had a market value of \n$1,770,912,000 in 2004, dairy farmers across PA and the Nation \nexperienced decreased prices of milk from November of 2005 until early \nthis year. Our dairy producers should not be receiving decreased milk \nprices, especially with the increased costs of production, such as \nfuel, feed, and fertilizer.\n  These unpredictable fluctuations in the price of milk paid to our \ndairy farmers place an undue financial burden on our producers, which \nin turn negatively impact our rural communities. As a result, I worked \nhard with Senators Santorum, Chambliss, Kohl, and Leahy to extend the \nMilk Income Loss Contract, MILC, program until September of 2007. The \nMILC program was created as part of the 2002 farm bill to provide \nsupplemental payments to dairy farmers when the market price falls \nbelow a statutory trigger. This program has provided timely and crucial \npayments to producers, particularly when prices were low in 2002, 2003, \nand 2006. Although milk prices are expected to be above the statutory \ntrigger price of $16.94 through 2007, we need to ensure a more stable \nmilk pricing system.\n  The 2007 farm bill creates an opportunity to address the current \nvolatile milk pricing system. While many legislative measures have been \nproposed, it is essential that any program address costs of production, \nensure market and price transparency, and provide a safety-net for our \nproducers. Additionally, we need to provide dairy producers with tools \nto help them should milk prices fall below sustainable levels, such as \na voluntary revenue insurance program.\n  I, along with Senator Bob Casey, have worked with our constituents to \npropose two dairy legislative proposals to ensure that we continue to \ndiscuss America's milk pricing system and the need for change in the \n2007 farm bill. I have met with dairy producers from across the \nCommonwealth and there is a broad consensus that the unpredictable milk \npricing system needs to be addressed. The hard part is coming to a \nconsensus on how to reform the system. Although these two legislative \nproposals may not be perfect, they provide ideas on assuring an \nequitable milk price for our dairy producers.\n  The first bill that we are introducing is the Federal Milk Marketing \nImprovement Act of 2007. This legislation would reduce the number of \nclasses of milk from four to two with the intent of simplifying the \npricing of milk. The bill would require the Secretary of Agriculture to \ndetermine the price of all milk used for manufacturing purposes, which \nwill be classified as Class II milk, by using the national average cost \nof production. This price would then be the basis formula for \ncalculating the price of Class I milk, which is fluid milk. Although \ncosts of production can vary drastically farm by farm, this legislation \nwould ensure that dairy farmers receive a fair price for their milk \nbased on a national average cost of production figure.\n\n  Costs of production for dairy farmers all across America have \nincreased, not\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\njust in one region. Fuel, feed, and fertilizer costs have more than \ndoubled. Only recently has the price of milk paid to farmers reached \nhigher than the MILC program trigger price of $16.94 per cwt. With the \nprice of milk above this target price, no payments to farmers will be \nmade, even though input costs have more than doubled. Addressing costs \nof production is necessary to ensure that our family dairy farmers \nsurvive.\n  The second bill that we have introduced aims to promote growth and \nopportunity for the dairy industry. This bill would change the current \nMILC program to a Milk Target Price Program and would link payments to \ndairy farmers on Class III milk. The program would pay farmers when the \nprice of Class III falls below $12.00 per hundredweight. This trigger \nprice would be adjusted by a feed adjustment factor to reflect the feed \ncost of producing 100 pounds of milk. The USDA would determine this \nfactor based on a feed price index using a baseline period of calendar \nyears 2001 through 2005.\n  Further, the second bill would require the mandatory reporting of \ndairy commodities by requiring that dairy prices be reported on a daily \nand weekly basis. The current system is not mandatory and it is \nestimated that dairy farmers lost $6.4 million due to a Federal \nreporting error by the USDA over the past nine months. Along with 10 \nother Senators, I sent a letter to USDA Secretary Mike Johanns on May \n9, 2007, requesting an explanation on how this misreporting occurred. \nThis bill aims to close any loops in current law and assure proper \nauditing, data verification, and enforcement of reporting in order to \nensure a transparent dairy market.\n  Finally, the second bill would provide authorization for a Federal \ndairy education loan forgiveness program. This would allow students at \nhigher education institutions across America who focus on agriculture \nfor a 2- or 4-year degree and become a full-time owner of a farm to \nbecome eligible to have their Federal student loans forgiven. This is \naimed to ensure that there is a younger generation of farmers to work \nthe lands across the fields in America.\n  Both of these bills aim to help our family dairy farms who deserve a \nfair price for their milk. I am committed to Pennsylvania's dairy \nfarmers and will continue to work with my Pennsylvania colleague, \nSenator Casey, and all my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to ensure our \ndairy farmers are not left behind. As more ideas and solutions are \nproposed, I will consider each and every one. Debate is important to \nfinding a solution to any problem.\n  Farmers and rural America are the backbone of our great country. \nEvery day, they work the fields, milk the cows, herd the cattle, and \npick the produce. I myself grew up in rural Kansas and at the age of \n14, I worked for Clyde Mills, father of my close friend and high school \nclassmate Steve, driving a tractor in the wheat fields, providing \nlessons on the difficulties of working on a farm.\n  Agriculture is crucial to Pennsylvania and to the entire nation. We \nneed to ensure that the next farm bill provides all our fanners with \nthe assistance they need to overcome hardships, as well as providing \nour rural communities the financial and technical assistance they need \nto assure a vibrant and stable rural economy.

Mr. President, just about a year ago, Senator Smith and I \ncame down to the floor of the Senate to take a few moments to talk \nabout the Oregon State University baseball team, which had just won its \nfirst College World Series national championship out in Omaha, NE.\n  I can't tell you how happy I am to be standing here on the floor of \nthe Senate 1 year later to applaud the team's defense of that title.\n  This is a tough, determined baseball team. When most folks counted \nthem out, they didn't give up. After finishing 6th in the Pac-10, they \nsqueaked their way into the post-season and never looked back.\n  On the road and at home, the Oregon State squad was virtually \nunstoppable, winning their last 10 games. In fact, the team trailed in \njust one of the 45 innings it played in Omaha and it was the first team \nto ever win 4 College World Series games by 6 or more runs.\n  The Beavers are the first back-to-back champions since Louisiana \nState University accomplished the feat back in 1996-97 and the first \n``cold-weather'' state repeat champions ever.\n  It is a proud day for the players and coaches on the Oregon State \nteam. It is a proud day for the University. And it is a proud day for \nall Oregonians.\n  Today, with Senator Smith as my cosponsor, I have therefore submitted \na resolution commending the Oregon State University baseball team for \nwinning the 2007 College World Series.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

When he finishes, we would adjourn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what is \nthe plan for debate time in the morning prior to the cloture vote? I \nhave been involved in the debate and would like to be involved in \nhaving some opportunity to speak in the morning prior to the vote, if \nthat would be appropriate.\n  Mr. REID. I would say through the Chair, the time is equally divided \nbetween Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter. Whatever time the Senator \nwould request, I am sure one of those Senators might yield him time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How does that happen when they both agree on this bill?\n  Mr. REID. As I understand it, it is automatic, an hour before \ncloture.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They both agreed. That is the problem. Is there any \ntime set aside for the opposition?\n  Mr. REID. I think the Senator raises a valid point there. It is for \nthe proponents of the resolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent out of Senator Specter's time and \nSenator Kennedy's time, you have 10 minutes. How is that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That will be fine.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if we wait, we are going to check to see if \ntime has been allocated yet.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what I had requested is that the Senator \nfrom Alabama would be recognized for 10 minutes; five minutes would \ncome from the time of Senator Kennedy, 5 minutes from that of Senator \nSpecter, and I would further say the last 20 minutes of the debate \nwouldn't count against any of this time. The first 10 minutes would be \nfor Senator McConnell, if he so chooses and, if I so choose, I would \nhave the last 10 minutes, right before the vote. That is additional \ntime. That doesn't count against the time we have allocated here \nearlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is it now appropriate that I utilize a \nfew of the minutes I have remaining--I am not going to use them all--\nbefore we adjourn? Is that what we agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 28 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 28 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this has been a very important day, a \nday that was pretty contentious. The procedural mechanism that the \nMajority Leader had invoked to control the debate in the Senate had its \nwheels come off today. The plan by the group, the grand bargainers and \nthe leadership, was to push through a controlled series of 27 or so \namendments today. The plan was to vote on this controlled group of hand \npicked amendments, mostly by motions to table, today. Had they voted on \nall of these amendments today we would have heard claims about the full \nand fair amendment process that had taken place this week--even though \nit was all just a show--no amendment would have gotten a vote unless \nthe Majority Leader had approved it. My amendments, Senator Cornyn's \namendments, and amendments by Senators Dole, Vitter, Coburn, and DeMint \nwould not have gotten votes.\n  Well, the Baucus amendment was part of their plan but a surprise \nhappened, it was not tabled. As a result, that amendment remained alive \nand the majority leader had the plan that had been so carefully \nconstructed, almost to the degree of the Normandy invasion, come to a \nhalt. So we are now no longer voting and debating tonight. But we will \nbe getting ready for a key vote in the morning. So I would say to \nanyone who might be listening, tomorrow morning is a very important \nvote. I believe a number of Senators who voted yesterday to move \nforward on this bill, some of the 64 who did, may not be for the \nlegislation tomorrow.\n  I firmly believe that as the legislation and debate has gone along \nthis week, more people have seen the fatal flaws that are in the \nlegislation. I think we are going to see an erosion of the support \ntomorrow. I would say to my colleagues, let's end this tomorrow. Let's \nhave this bill come down tomorrow. Let's not invoke cloture. Let's not \ncontinue to move forward on this bill because the legislation cannot be \nfixed in its present form.\n  I have had some people ask me, Jeff, why can't you compromise on this \nlegislation? Why can't a compromise be reached? Well, I would just say \nthat if you are trying to fix a leaky bucket, you can't compromise to \nfix the bucket by fixing four holes in the bucket and leaving six more \nholes in the bucket. Under that compromise, all of the water is still \ngoing to leak out.\n  The problem with the immigration bill currently before the Senate, \nand I have seen this problem repeatedly in the immigration realm, is \nthat when we come up with provisions and concepts that would actually \nwork, ones that would restore lawfulness to the immigration system, we \npull back, we compromise too much. In my own mind, it has been like \ntrying to jump across a 10-foot cavern, but only jumping 9 feet. You \nstill fall to the bottom. You do not get across, you do not achieve \nyour goal.\n  Until we complete some of the currently inadequate enforcement \nprovisions, until we draft a bill that will create a legal system that \nwill actually work, compromising about this or that matter is not going \nto amount to much.\n  The bill, I do believe, as I have indicated before, is only going to \nreduce illegal immigration by a net 13 percent over the next 20 years. \nThat number comes straight from the Congressional Budget Office Cost \nEstimate on this bill, which they released June 4th, I did not make it \nup. Our own Congressional Budget Office, has told the Senate that we \ncan expect to have an additional 8.7 million people illegally in our \ncountry after this bill becomes law.\n  That is not what we had been promised by the grand bargainers that \nbrought this bill back to the floor. That is not what they are claiming \nwill happen. They have promised us that this bill will secure the \nborder. I assume that they mean they believe this bill will end illegal \nimmigration. Well, it just simply will not secure the border and end or \neven substantially reduce illegal immigration. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has told us it will not. In the beginning, I analyzed the bill \nand my staff worked on it, and we did not believe it would be an \neffective enforcement mechanism. The Congressional Budget Office has \nnow also concluded that the bill will not fulfil the\n\n[[Page S8639]]\n\nenforcement promises being made on the floor of this Senate.\n  I will note again that the Association of Retired Border Patrol \nAgents roundly criticized the legislation. Two former chiefs of the \nBorder Patrol of the United States, one of them under President Bush, \none under President Reagan, have strongly and totally condemned the \nlegislation.\n  The current Association of Border Patrol Officers opposes the \nlegislation. The former Assistant Attorney General, Kris Kobach, who \nserved in the as counsel to Attorney General Ashcroft on issues dealing \nwith immigration and national security says this bill will not make us \nsafer but will make us less safe. So does Mr. Cutler, a former INS \nagent of many years of experience. He is worried that we will be \nissuing U.S. government identities to people who we have no idea who \nthey really are.\n  So, bottom line, the bill is not going to do what supporters are \npromising it will do. Those of us who were not in the little group of \ngrand bargainers certainly have no responsibility to affirm the deal \nthey may have reached, especially if we know that it is not going to \nwork.\n  If the bill before us was a good piece of legislation and it solved \nthe problems it claims to solve, then maybe we would just have to hold \nour noses and live with this sort of secret pressure that our good \nfriends, the masters of the universe, have put on us by meeting and \nwriting up a bill and telling us we have to take it or leave it. They \ntell us they will only allow a few little amendments, but anything that \ngoes to the core of the legislation we will not allow you to change. \nThey tell us they are all going to stick together and vote against \nit amendments that offer any real changes to the deal.\n\n  I have had members of the group say to me, and I find this very \ndisturbing: Well, Jeff, that is a pretty good amendment you have, but \nit changes what we agreed on. I might agree with your amendment, but I \ncannot support your amendment. That is a rather unusual way to do \nbusiness on the floor of the Senate, it is not a way of doing business \nthat should make us proud, not one that is worthy of a matter of this \nimportance.\n  Constituents all across the country are opposed to this legislation. \nI think I earlier said 20 percent support it. I think more accurately \nit is 22 percent that support this legislation. According to the latest \nRasmussen poll, there has been a continual drop in support for the last \n3 consecutive weeks in the tracking they have been doing.\n  Twice as many said they prefer no legislation at all to the bill that \nis before us today. We have been told by our colleagues promoting this \nlegislation, that the only way to get the enforcement we want, is to \nvote for this legislation. Well, I don't think that all enforcement \nitems should be held hostage to amnesty, and I have just explained why \nthe enforcement they promise is not going to work.\n  The bill does have some concepts that are fairly significant. For \nexample, the idea that people get legal status in the form of the \nprobationary benefits visa a mere 24 hours after filing an amnesty \napplication is very significant. These are legal documents we will be \ngiving them, a certification that a person is in our country legally. \nIt can then be utilized to get a state driver's license, a Social \nSecurity card, and those kind of things.\n  So the only thing that is going to be done before people are given \nthis document just 24 hours after filing an application is a cursory \nbackground check. I submit to my colleagues that a full background \ncheck can not possibly be performed within 24 hours. The only way an \namnesty application will not get legal status in 24 hours is if they \nhad been arrested and fingerprinted somewhere in the country, and their \nfingerprints have been put into the national fingerprint index. That is \nreally the only thing that will disqualify them within that 24 hour \nperiod.\n  But I wish my colleagues would think back to 9/11. Several of the 9/\n11 hijackers were stopped by state and local police at various times \nprior to 9/11 for speeding or such and each time they were let go by \nlocal law enforcement. Local law enforcement was now aware that some of \nthem were here illegally. In the future, all of these 12 million would \nbe given an identification document that would give them legal status, \nso, in fact, their position would be enhanced to an even greater status \nthan the 9/11 hijackers. They would have U.S. government issued \nidentification and a driver's license. They could travel the whole \ncountry with freedom under these documents.\n  So Mr. Kris Kobach and Mr. Mike Cutler and others have written op-eds \nand editorials that point out that this could be a tremendous advantage \nfor terrorists, not a disadvantage.\n  These are complex issues. I think it would be better if our wise \ncolleagues had invited somebody like Mr. Kobach, who is a professor of \nlaw now, a former Assistant Attorney General, to speak on these issues. \nMaybe they should have sought his opinion instead of the special \ninterests they were listening to when they cobbled together this \npolitical deal.\n  Maybe they would have been better off if they asked some of experts, \nsuch as the former chairmen of the Border Patrol, what they thought, or \nthe present head of the Border Patrol Association.\n  SO, the question is, what do we need to do now? The first thing we \nneed to do is take this bill off the agenda tomorrow by defeating the \ncloture motion. Let's just end this agony, please. Let's not continue \ndown this path. Let's say: No, it is time to pay a decent respect to \nthe opinions of our constituents. They do not like this. Let's respect \nthem. Let's acknowledge that independent experts say this bill will not \nwork. This is not just the opinions of some radio talk show hosts, as I \nhave heard my colleagues talking about this week, but we have \nindependent experts saying it will not work. I will just observe that \nthe radio talk show hosts know more about the bill than most of the \nSenators do, if you want to know the truth.\n  But at any rate, this is where we are. I think we ought to come down \nwith it. We should probably follow what the people have suggested in \nthe polling data that I saw. The American people would favor \nincremental steps emphasizing enforcement. There are some things that \nwe could do to achieve what the American people want. I suggest that if \nwe can come up with a credible enforcement mechanism--and we can--then \nwe need to enact it. Then we can begin to talk about the future flow in \nimmigration levels. I don't think most people know--I am not sure most \nSenators have fully understood--this bill over the next 20 years will \ndouble the number of people given green cards, legal permanent \nresidence in America. It will double the current numbers. It has only a \n13-percent reduction in the 500,000 or so who come illegally every \nyear. Remember, it was last year when we arrested 1 million people \ncoming into our country illegally. What kind of system is this when our \nBorder Patrol agents are out there working their hearts out and risking \ntheir lives to arrest a million people and we want to give immigration \nbenefits for those that snuck past our agents?\n  That type of immigration system does not work. The way to make it \nwork is for this Nation to state with crystal clarity that our border \nis not open anymore. Don't bother to try to illegally cross our border. \nPeople are coming from all over the world, not just Mexico, to sneak \nacross the Mexican border, because it is wide open in their thoughts \nand it has been easier to get into the United States that way. It is \nnot that difficult to create the reality that it is not open, and \npeople will not spend their money trying to go through deserts and so \nforth to get into this country if the word gets out that it is no \nlonger possible to be successful at it. That is what we need to do, \nreach that tipping point. We could see a big drop in the flow of \nillegal immigrants into our country. Then we could focus on a \ncompassionate solution to those who have been here for a long time, who \nhave children and families and have jobs and solid ties to our country. \nBut the legislation before us today moved the date by which you could \nmake claim for legal status from January of 2004 to January of 2007. \nBasically, no illegal alien is left behind; everybody is going to be a \nparticipant in this deal. I was stunned at that. Senator Webb offered \nan excellent amendment today on that point to say it ought to go back 4 \nyears. Why would we do that? The reason that is important is because we \nmade an announcement that we were going to close the\n\n[[Page S8640]]\n\nborder down. The President said so. He looked the American people in \nthe eye and said we were going to do this. He called out the National \nGuard last year, and the National Guard has been at the border, I \nguess, now over a year.\n  This bill would say, if you got past the National Guard before last \nDecember 31, then you are in the pot. And the argument that I have \nheard is that we need to do something about the people who have been \nhere for a long time. They have children. They are deeply embedded in \nthe communities. We can't ask them to leave. But what about a person \nwho ran past the National Guard last December? How can that person be \ndeeply embedded in our society after sneaking in after we have said \nthat the border is no longer open? What do you tell our Border Patrol \nofficers when they are out there trying to enforce the law and somebody \njust got past them last November and now they are free and on the path \nto receiving some type of permanent status? Congress just says: Forget \nit, those who snuck past the border six months ago are going to be \ngiven a legal status and a path to citizenship.\n  These concerns should not be lightly dealt with. Politicians can meet \nand plot and think, but you have to remember what we are doing here. \nThis is a great nation. A great nation creates laws. That nation should \nsee that those laws are enforced and followed through effectively. If \nthe laws are not enforced then that nation loses respect. Its law \nofficers lose respect. Instead, people who are inclined to violate laws \nare encouraged. Clearly, the nation will have more violations if that \nnation doesn't enforce the laws it passed. The bottom line is that this \nbill evidences a lack of commitment to make sure that the system that \nis getting established will work any better than the old one. So if we \nare not able to establish with confidence and clarity and conviction a \nnew system of immigration that we intend to enforce, what is the point \nof legislating another immigration bill that won't achieve those goals?\n  But the American people aren't ready to quit. If any Senator doubts \nthat, I suggest they sit at their front desk a while and answer the \nphone. That is the deal. We need as a nation to make a decision, are we \ngoing to create a lawful system of immigration or not? That is the \nquestion. This bill answers it in the negative. This bill is not going \nto create a legal system. To pass it is one more indication of our lack \nof will and commitment. It will breed cynicism and unhappiness among \nour constituents.\n  I thank the Chair for its patience allowing me to wrap up. I do \nbelieve the last vote on the Baucus amendment that did not table the \namendment sent a signal that Senators are frustrated and uneasy about \nthis process. I do believe more and more Senators, some of whom voted \nfor cloture just yesterday, may not vote for cloture tomorrow.\n  I urge my colleagues not to worry. The issue is not going away. We \nhave had it going since 1986. Just because this grand compromise by the \ngrand compromisers didn't work does not mean we don't have a problem \nthat needs to be fixed. But next time let's make sure we do it right \nfor our country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/27/senate-section/article/S8640-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
