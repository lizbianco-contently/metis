Mr. President, we have talked now for several months about \nthe number of filibusters. Today, this will be raised to 71. Comments \nhave been made by Republican leaders that it doesn't matter; we are \njust doing the people's business; we are only getting done what is \nimportant.\n  The American people know what is going on. It is obstructionism at \nits zenith, at its best. The American people are beginning clearly to \nsee this issue. A story in newspapers all around the country today, \nbased on an article by Jon Cowen and Dan Balz in the Washington Post, \nindicates that the American people are seeing what is going on.\n  In polling done by the Post, along with others, the political party \nin America best able to deal with the country's problems: Democrats, by \na 21-point advantage. It is obvious why. We are trying to do something \nabout the problems facing America today. We are trying to do something \nabout the intractable civil war we are engaged in in Iraq. We have a \nsituation where we have 50 million people with no health insurance. We \nhave the Earth's temperature rising every day. Our Earth has a fever. \nWe need to do something legislatively to try to bring down that fever. \nWe have an education system that is in crumbles. We want to do \nsomething about educating the troops coming back from Iraq. We believe \nthese troops are just as gallant and heroic as the troops who fought in \nWorld War II. When the World War II troops came home, they had the \nability to go to school and were educated, and it happened. It changed \nAmerica forever. We think America could be changed forever again in the \nnew paradigm we now face with these men and women coming back by the \ntens of thousands and not being able to afford to go to school.\n  We know that the Presidential candidate of the Republicans, Senator \nMcCain, says it is too generous. Well, this piece of legislation, \nwritten by Jim Webb, is generous, but it should be because these troops \nreturning from Iraq deserve our generosity.\n  The Democratic advantage is going to be pronounced come election \ntime. We have tried to work on a cooperative basis and have been denied \nthat time after time after time. We know that\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\nBush's disapproval rating in some polls is around 70 percent. Think \nabout that. We have had a number of stories written in just the last 10 \ndays that the lowest approval rating of any President in history is the \nPresident we are now dealing with, a person who is a divider, not a \nuniter. The American people see this. Eighty-two percent of the \nAmerican people feel our country is headed in the wrong direction. I \nwould hope that during the next few months we have left in this \nlegislative session, we can stop the increase in this number here and \nwork to try to accomplish good results for the American people. We have \nso much that needs to be done. We want to work to get this done. If we \nare able to accomplish things, there is credit to go around for \neveryone, Democrats and Republicans. But, of course, the obstructionism \nwe face has made it so that there is no credit to go around, period. \nThe American people have identified this, and rightfully so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4048-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later this morning we will vote on an \namendment to increase production of American energy, which will help \nlower prices at the pump and create more American jobs. Last year, this \nCongress acted in a bipartisan way to reduce our demand for oil by \nincreasing fuel economy standards for cars and trucks and by increasing \nour use of renewable fuels. But no matter how hard we might try, we \ncannot repeal the law of supply and demand. We know we also need to \nincrease supply in order to lower gas prices, and that is what our \namendment does.\n  In the short term, it places a 6-month moratorium on deposits to the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, which will immediately have an impact on \ndomestic supply. It also increases production of American energy right \nhere at home by opening a small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge for production and allowing coastal States to decide if they \nwant to allow increased production on the Outer Continental Shelf. It \nrepeals the moratorium on oil shale development that was included in \nlast year's Omnibus appropriations bill, and it would encourage the \ndevelopment of coal to liquid, a very promising substitute for \npetroleum products that we can produce right here in America and \nspecifically in Kentucky, my home State, with American workers. Our \namendment would provide grants and loans to accelerate the development \nof advanced batteries that can be used to power the next generation of \nplug-in hybrid vehicles here in America. These measures, coupled with \nthe conservation and biofuels measure we supported last year, will \nincrease our energy independence and help to bring down gas prices in \nthe long term.\n  Some say opening new areas for production won't do anything in the \nshort term. But remember, if President Clinton had not vetoed \nlegislation to open ANWR 13 years ago, more than a million barrels of \noil would be flowing to American consumers every single day. I believe \nit makes more sense for us to produce these additional barrels here at \nhome with American jobs rather than begging OPEC to produce more, as \nsome on the other side have advocated.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider our long-term energy goals and our \nneed for increased energy independence and vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  We can't continue to ignore the No. 1 issue facing American families, \nand further delay is not an option that Americans can afford. Some of \nour friends on the other side of the aisle believe we need to ask OPEC \nto supply more oil, that we ought to be sending even more money and \njobs to the nations of OPEC. But we take a different approach. Our \namendment would increase the production right here at home in America. \nWhile some want to increase OPEC's control over oil supply by refusing \nan increase in American supply, our amendment increases American \ncontrol through American energy and American jobs right here in the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4048-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4048]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour of debate equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the amendment \nwhich we will vote on shortly. It relates to the cost of gasoline. I \ncan't think of another issue that has been in the forefront across \nAmerica for a longer period than the cost of gasoline. It goes beyond \nthat, obviously, to diesel fuel and jet fuel costs. We see it every \nday. You drive down the road, and you watch prices going up at the gas \nstation. People ask Senators and Congressmen: You are supposed to be \nthe bigwigs here. You are supposed to be so influential. Why haven't \nyou done something; the gas prices are killing us.\n  And they are. Whether it is a family member commuting back and forth \nto work in downstate Illinois, trying to get to the State capitol, \nwhether it is a an over-the-road trucker spending almost $1,000 to fill \nup his rig with diesel fuel, whether it is the CEO of an airline who \nhas seen the worst first-quarter losses in the history of that airline \nbecause of the rise in the cost of jet fuel, it is hitting everybody. I \ntalked to a chiropractor over the weekend. She told me her practice was \ndying because people didn't want to drive 20 miles for her services. \nThey said: We will see you every other week instead of every week. As \nyou see, it is starting to reach into every single area.\n  So what response do we have from the Republican side? The response is \npredictable and ineffective. Here is what they say: You know what we \nought to do. We ought to start drilling for oil in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge and we ought to start drilling for oil off the coasts \nof America.\n  OK. How much oil is there?\n  Oh, there is a lot.\n  In the scheme of things, it is not a lot. All of the oil reserves \nwithin the control of the United States of America, all of them \ncombined come to 3 percent of the world's total oil reserves. Each \nyear, our Nation--a powerful, large economy--consumes 25 percent of all \nthe oil produced in the world. We cannot drill our way out of this \nissue. We cannot drill our way to lower prices.\n  Here is something they fail to mention: If we gave approval today--\nwhich I think would be a bad idea--to the Republican approach, it would \nbe years before the oil would start trickling in, meaning years of high \nprices.\n  So what can we do here and now? Two things: First, we can start \ndealing with the price gouging of consumers. Prices are going up \ndramatically at historically high rates. They are not justified by the \nbarrel-of-oil prices. The spread between the cost of a barrel of oil \nand the cost of refined product keeps growing larger and larger, and \nthe oil companies that are refining the crude oil keep making more and \nmore money. Price gouging is going on. That is the first issue. Is \nthere any mention of consumer price gouging in the Republican approach? \nNot one word. In the Democratic approach, we believe price gouging \nshould be part of this.\n\n  Secondly, accountability of the oil companies. These oil companies, \nover the last 7 years when George Bush from oil country has been our \nPresident, have seen their profits quadruple--four\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\ntimes the profits they were making just a few years ago. The cost of \noil and diesel fuel has gone up 2\\1/2\\ times; the oil company profits, \nquadrupled. These companies are not only making more money than oil \ncompanies have ever made, they are making more money than any business \nin the history of America. That is a fact.\n  We have a windfall profits tax. We say there is a limit to how much \nthese oil companies should be making as profits when it causes so much \ndamage to American families and businesses and farmers and truckers and \nthe economy. We have a windfall profits tax. The Republican approach: \nnothing--nothing to address the oil company profits. That is the \nreality.\n  Now, Senator Reid, the Democratic majority leader, came to the floor \na few minutes ago and told us what is going on with the Republican \nstrategy. So far in this session of Congress--we have 2-year sessions \nof Congress--the Republicans have initiated 70 filibusters. Today, they \nwill hit 71. You might say: So what. What does that mean? In the \nhistory of the Senate--over 200 years--the maximum number of \nfilibusters in a 2-year period of time was 57. The Republicans have \nbroken that record.\n  What is a filibuster? A filibuster is a way to delay, slow down, \navoid, try to turn the page to another issue. Over and over and over \nagain--70 times--the Republicans have now set a record for obstruction \nin stopping progress in the Senate, whether it is on issues of energy, \nwhether it is on issues of health care, helping our schools, dealing \nwith the war in Iraq--over and over and over again, Republican \nfilibusters.\n  Today, we will have a vote. We are going to have a vote in a short \nperiod of time--at 12:15, maybe earlier; I am not sure. But in the \ncourse of that vote, we will have a choice on whether we at least will \nmake one small step forward when it comes to dealing with gasoline \nprices. We cannot justify, in the current situation, continuing to take \noil off the market where the Federal Government buys it and stores it. \nIt is called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Currently, it is at about \n97 percent of capacity. We are buying the most expensive crude oil in \nthe history of the world, and storing it, taking it off the market, \nfurther putting an increase on gasoline prices.\n  We will offer an alternative to the Republican approach which will \nsay that we will suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It \nmight pass. Fifty-one Democratic Senators, incidentally, wrote a letter \nto the President on March 11 asking the President to suspend the \nfilling of the Petroleum Reserve because gasoline prices were out of \ncontrol. The President refused. Now we have to pass a law to force the \nPresident to do something about these gasoline prices.\n  I think suspending shipments to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is \nthe most sensible way for us to bring these prices down. I hope we can \nget the cooperation of the Republicans, beyond that, to deal with the \nprice gouging of consumers and accountability for oil companies and not \nface another Republican filibuster when it comes to that important \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, can I propound one unanimous consent \nrequest, please. I am sorry. If the Senator from New Mexico will allow \nme, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be allocated 5 \nminutes each from the majority's time after the Senator from New Mexico \nspeaks: Senators Kennedy, Dorgan, and Bingaman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, just a minute. Do you have time on each \none of them?\n  Mr. DURBIN. We will alternate back and forth.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand.\n  Mr. DURBIN. These Senators asked for 5 minutes each.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the ``5 minutes each.'' I am sorry. I \nhave no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, following mine, we would like Senators \nHutchison, Enzi, Vitter, and Cornyn to be recognized for 5 minutes \neach, and 5 minutes for wrap-up for the Senator from New Mexico, with \n10 minutes right now for the Senator from New Mexico, and alternating \nback and forth.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just have so much to talk about. I \nwanted to follow my text I had prepared, but having heard the \nDemocratic Senator discuss this issue, I have to tell the American \npeople, one, their energy policy, if they are talking about today, is a \npolicy that has to do with the filling of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. The leader of that policy is the distinguished Senator Dorgan. \nHe has led that cause, and he is going to win. But literally that \ncannot be an energy policy. It is 70,000 barrels a day that we are not \ngoing to buy and put in the reserve--70,000--and that is for the rest \nof this year.\n  Now, we use 21 million barrels of oil a day. So let's face up to it. \nIf you do not think 1 million barrels a day from the Alaskan arctic \nwilderness--which would be American, and we could get that coming to \nAmerica for maybe 50 years--if that is not better than 70,000 barrels \nfor 7 or 8 months to not put in the Reserve but leave in the world \nmarket--I will leave that to anybody who is listening.\n  Price gouging is in their portfolio again. They talk about it. Last \nyear, we gave authority to the Federal Trade Commission. They have not \nyet found any gouging. We hope they do.\n  Now, I would like to go on and talk about what we are trying to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor \nto amendment No. 4737. It is now known as the Reid amendment, but it is \nactually Senator Dorgan's amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, earlier this year, I gave a detailed \nspeech on the Senate floor about the perils of our Nation's growing \ndependence on foreign oil. At that time, I noted the Nation was \nignoring policies that would increase our energy supply while the \nstranglehold of foreign oil was tightening. I spoke bluntly and warned \nof dark days ahead for our Nation's economy and foreign policy if we \ncontinued to send our money abroad to buy oil from unstable and hostile \nregions around the globe.\n  I stated that at the current price of oil, we are at a pace to send \nnearly a half trillion dollars overseas annually to purchase oil--a \nhalf trillion. When the driving season ends, and the price at the pump \nsubsides a bit, naturally the volume of constituent letters and phone \ncalls will decrease a bit. When the cameras fade and the focus of the \nday begins to turn elsewhere, we should stop and reflect on the debate \nwe are having today.\n  Make no mistake, a growing and gathering storm is swirling around \nthis Nation. It is threatening our economic strength, our national \nsecurity, and our place in the world. That storm comes in the form of \ndependence upon foreign oil.\n  Last year, Congress passed a strong energy bill, built on advancing \ncellulosic ethanol and strengthening our fuel efficiency standards. We \nmade great steps in setting up policies that will reduce our gasoline \nconsumption. However, I said at the time, and say again today, last \nyear's legislation had a glaring weakness, which is highlighted today. \nLast year's bill failed to include measures for domestic energy \nproduction.\n  When we tried to open the Virginia Outer Continental Shelf to natural \ngas leasing, the other side blocked that. When we tried to improve our \nNation's refining capacity, the other side blocked that. And when we \ntried to advance domestic coal-derived fuels--a very major way for \nAmerica to diminish its dependence on foreign oil--the other side \nblocked that. On conservation and efficiency and the pursuit of clean \nenergy, this Chamber is in wide bipartisan agreement. But on producing \nmore American oil and gas to reduce the price of gasoline at the pump, \nit will become clear from today's debate and vote that the vast \nmajority on the other side opposes action.\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\n  When today's vote is over, regardless of the outcome, I will continue \nto return to the Senate floor and speak on this important issue of our \ngrowing dependence on foreign oil. I will continue to speak out against \npolicies that increase the cost of energy, when the American people so \nclearly want us to provide relief from high gas prices.\n  I have listened intently to the increased debate over the past few \nweeks about our energy challenges. I have heard some on the other side \nplead with OPEC nations to increase production by one-quarter of the \namount we provide for in America with this amendment--one-quarter the \namount. I have heard ANWR opponents from a decade ago repeat their \nclaim from a decade ago that ANWR oil will take a decade to produce. I \nnever heard this argument when we were supporting increasing vehicle \nfuel economy standards that we know will take a decade to come to \nfruition. We passed a bill that everybody takes credit for. It will \ntake 10 years for it to have an impact. Yet we praise ourselves for \nproducing it.\n  Of course, all of this would be assuming the price of oil did not \nincrease over $100 per barrel during the time that ANWR was being \nblocked. If President Clinton had not vetoed ANWR over 12 years ago, we \nwould have this oil from Alaska on the market today. I have also heard \nmy colleagues argue that 70,000 barrels of oil per day would make a \nsignificant difference in the price of oil--that is the SPR bill--while \ndenying access to over 1 million barrels of oil per day from ANWR \nalone.\n  It is time to act, and what the other side has offered at this \ncritical moment is talk of energy independence supported by more \nGovernment investigations and empty threats to OPEC combined with pleas \nfor more OPEC production. If that were not enough, we are faced with \nthe prospects of a windfall profits tax like the one that passed in \nApril by the Chavez administration in Venezuela. We tried to implement \nsuch a tax in the 1980s. It did not work then, and it will not work \nnow. We cannot produce more energy by taxing oil companies or taxing \nanyone.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the imposition of a \nwindfall profits tax could have ``several adverse economic effects.'' \nAnd such a tax could be expected to ``reduce domestic oil production \nand increase the level of oil imports.'' The architect of this tax \nduring the Carter administration recently called the windfall profits \ntax ``a terrible idea today.''\n  Today, we consider real solutions to our national problem. On May 1, \nI introduced the American Energy Production Act of 2008. Obviously, if \nwe had Democratic support and help we could make it even better, but we \nhad to do this with Republicans, to lay before the American people a \nfact: that there are ways to produce more American oil and natural gas \nwithout doing any real harm to the American environment. I am pleased \nto have 21 cosponsors on that bill, and I am pleased Senator McConnell \nhas offered this legislation as an amendment to the bill currently \nbefore us. Unfortunately, the other side has not allowed us to consider \nthis proposal to address record-high gas prices.\n  Speaking of filibusters, on our bill they have insisted there be 60 \nvotes. That is the equivalent of a filibuster. So you can chalk one up \nfor us. They are filibustering the only Energy bill we have seen in a \nwhile that would produce energy for America.\n  I support the bipartisan amendment on the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, and I have already indicated to you that I do, and it needs no \nfurther explanation. I am confident, if enacted, the American Energy \nProduction Act--the one we are talking about--will strengthen our \nNation's security for decades to come. In this legislation, we open \n2,000 of the 19 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nAnd I defy anyone with common sense to seriously contend that 2,000 \nacres out of 2 million will harm that wilderness. It can be done with a \nsmall footprint, and everyone knows it. We have just chosen sides, \nregardless of the real facts. Therefore, I assume the Democrats will \ndefeat it again.\n  Taken together, these policies enable the production of 24 billion \nbarrels of American oil, which would increase our domestic production \nby nearly 40 percent over the next three decades. Opening ANWR alone \nwould create thousands of American jobs, provide $3 billion in revenues \nin the next 10 years to the Federal Treasury, and bring on line over 1 \nmillion barrels of oil per day. This amendment also spurs the \ncommercialization of coal-derived fuels and oil shale resources. \nAdvancement of these policies will be spoken of in more detail by other \nSenators but, clearly, they are things to look at. The American people \nought to know about them. They are sources--huge sources--of energy \nthat can be made in America by Americans for America. With emerging \neconomies around the world increasing their thirst for oil, we face a \nnew energy challenge in America.\n\n  The world demand for oil continues to grow. America's production of \noil has fallen to its lowest levels in 60 years. That is because we \nhaven't done anything new or significant to add to what we have \nproduced for years. If we do not start producing more of our own energy \nresources, we will continue to rely on unstable foreign oil and \ncontinue to pay a high price. That is what is at stake with today's \nvote. We probably will not win, but we feel very comfortable giving the \nother side an opportunity to vote no again for the production of oil \nand gas that is American, by Americans, for America.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                   Employer-Employee Cooperation Act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  We are going to be voting on some extremely important energy issues, \nand I have expressed my views on those before. I wished to take an \nopportunity to talk about another matter which we will be voting on \nlater this morning, early this afternoon, and then will be the subject \nmatter that will be before the Senate for the next few days. It is an \nextremely important matter. It deals with our national security; \nprimarily homeland security. It deals with the challenges that our \nfirst responders are faced with. I am talking about our police \nofficers, our firefighters, and our first responders. They are the ones \nwho are on the cutting edge of our domestic national security.\n  We are seeing massive reorganizations of our various institutions \nthat have dealt with homeland security. We have seen additional \nresources focused on homeland security. The legislation Senator Gregg \nand I offer will strengthen our national security by including those \nindividuals who are on the frontline into the decisionmaking about what \nis helpful and useful in terms of the security of our communities, \nsmall cities, and large cities all across this Nation. It will give \nthem a voice in making judgments and decisions so those decisions and \njudgments are not only going to be made by policymakers and bureaucrats \nbut by men and women who are on the ground. The legislation is called \nour Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act. It is bipartisan \nin nature, and it can make an extraordinary difference.\n  We had the opportunity last evening to go over the essential elements \nof the legislation, sort of the dos and the don'ts. There are those who \nhave misconstrued this legislation and have misrepresented the \nlegislation. We have seen that sort of technique around here in the \nSenate when Members differ with the legislation. They distort it or \nmisrepresent it and then differ with it. It is an old technique that is \nused around here.\n  We will have the chance this afternoon and tomorrow--and this is a \nnotice we will welcome--Senator Gregg and I--will welcome amendments. \nThis legislation has in one form or another been before the Senate \npreviously. It had extraordinary bipartisan support in the House of \nRepresentatives. I believe 98 Republicans supported the legislation, \nwhich is an indication of the breadth of support it has.\n  So we will look forward--and we are going to urge our colleagues to \nhelp us move this legislation, which is of such great importance and \nconsequence to the security of our people--we will ask them to help us \nmove it forward. This week is Police Week. Police Week goes back \nactually to 1962, when it was named by President Kennedy. Since that \ntime, police officers have gathered to pay tribute to those members of \nthe force who have lost their lives over the period of the last year. \nIt is a very impressive ceremony for those who have not gone to it. I \nhave on a number of\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\ndifferent occasions. But we take time this week to pay tribute to those \nfirst responders, and we have welcomed their very strong support for \nthis legislation.\n  This legislation will affect police officers and firefighters. Some \n300,000 police officers in 24 States will benefit from this bill and \nare in strong support of the legislation. We also see support with \nregards to the firefighters: 134,000 firefighters in 24 different \nStates will benefit. We have worked very closely with them. These are \nthe various groups that support this legislation: The International \nAssociation of Firefighters; Fraternal Order of Police; the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations; the International Union of Police \nAssociations; the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal \nEmployees; and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n  So as I say, we will be ready to deal with this right after the \ncaucuses that we will have during the noon hour. This legislation will \nhopefully be before the Senate. We are hopeful now. This is a vote on \nthe motion to proceed. We ought to at least have that opportunity to \ndebate this issue, and we are hopeful we will receive the support from \nboth sides of the aisle so we can move forward and debate the issue.\n  My time has expired and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the bill we \nare going to vote on starting at 11 o'clock. We have an amendment filed \nby the distinguished Republican leader. The Senator from New Mexico is \nthe prime sponsor of this amendment. I commend Senator Domenici for his \ncontinuing leadership in the energy arena.\n  In January of 2007, when control of Congress changed hands, the price \nof gasoline was $2.33 a gallon. Today, it is $3.73 a gallon. That is a \n60-percent increase, and it is going in that direction even further.\n  The reason for the record-high price is simple economics. The global \ndemand for energy has soared, especially in fast-rising countries such \nas China and India. Meanwhile, the supply of energy has remained \nlargely stagnant. This is a simple, classic economic principle: The law \nof supply and demand. When the demand goes up and the supply stays the \nsame, the price goes up. Knowing that, the best way for Congress to \nreduce the price of energy is to increase the supply of energy. We need \nmore American oil, more American natural gas, more American clean coal, \nand we need more American nuclear power. That is why I joined the \nranking member of the Energy Committee to introduce the bill today that \nwould do exactly that.\n  First, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Two weeks ago, I wrote a \nletter to the President, signed by 13 Republican Senators. I noticed it \nwas announced by the majority leader that 51 Senators on his side had \nsigned the same type of letter in March. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe letter be printed in the Record with the signatures of the 13 \nSenators.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2008.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We write today to request that the U.S. \n     Department of Energy (DoE) immediately halt deposits of \n     domestic crude oil into the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     (SPR). As we enter the busiest driving season of the year. \n     the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil \n     hovers around a record $120.\n       The SPR was established in 1975 to provide a supply of \n     crude oil during times of severe supply disruptions. Today. \n     The SPR contains more than 701 million barrels of oil, \n     exceeding our International Energy Program commitments to \n     maintain at least 90 days of oil stocks in reserve.\n       High energy prices are having a ripple effect throughout \n     the U.S. economy and exacerbating recessionary pressures. The \n     Energy Information Agency reports that supplies and \n     inventories of crude oil and refined products are above 2007 \n     inventories while our demand for gasoline is down. Yet, the \n     price of crude oil has skyrocketed 100% from last year's \n     levels which were just above $63 a barrel in April 2007. \n     Despite these economic realities, the DoE recently solicited \n     contracts to exchange up to 13 million barrels of royalty oil \n     from Federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico for deposits in the \n     SPR.\n       Some analysts blame geopolitical instability and disruption \n     in production for the rapid price increases; however, these \n     factors alone do not explain the extraordinary increase in \n     oil prices compared to previous years, when these same \n     challenges were present. Temporarily halting deposits to the \n     reserve can provide some relief because the increased supply \n     of oil available for refinement will send the right signal to \n     all markets that the U.S. Government will take measures \n     necessary to address exorbitant crude oil prices that \n     negatively affect the global economy. We believe, in light of \n     the dramatic increase in oil prices, a temporary halt to \n     deposits into the SPR should be considered until the economy \n     stabilizes.\n       I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward \n     to hearing back from you.\n           Sincerely,\n         Kay Bailey Hutchison, John Barrasso, Kit Bond, John E. \n           Sununu, Johnny Isakson, Orrin G. Hatch, Jeff Sessions, \n           Saxby Chambliss, Judd Gregg, John Cornyn, Lisa \n           Murkowski, Elizabeth Dole, Sam Brownback, Susan \n           Collins.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, what we are asking the President to do \nis temporarily halt deposits of oil into the SPR. Today, the SPR holds \n118 days--almost 4 months--of reserve for an emergency in this country.\n  I wish to stop now to ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the Dorgan amendment No. 4737.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Because what the Dorgan amendment does--and what is \nalso included in our bill--is to ask for a temporary halt on any more \noil going into the SPR. Halting the daily deposits of 76,000 barrels a \nday into the SPR would allow 3 million additional gallons of gasoline \nto be available on the market. If we halted the 13 million barrels of \noil the Department of Energy has sought contracts for to go into SPR, \nit would be more than the total February 2008 imports from Libya, \nSyria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Azerbaijan, and China \ncombined.\n  The amendment offered today would halt additional contributions to \nthe SPR for 180 days and ensure that these resources could be utilized \nimmediately in the marketplace. In addition, we would open the grassy \nplains of ANWR, which is unavailable for drilling today. The U.S. \nGeological Survey estimates there could be as much as 10 billion \nbarrels of oil in ANWR. This would be almost enough oil to replace what \nwe import from Saudi Arabia every day. What would be drilled in ANWR \nisn't near a forest or a stream. It is a grassy plain. It is 2,000 \nacres, about the size of National Airport, in an area of ANWR which is \nthe size of the State of South Carolina. So drilling in this grassy \nplain would be environmentally safe, and it would make America much \nmore independent, much more reliant on ourselves and our resources for \nour energy needs--a place we need to go.\n  Another area, the Outer Continental Shelf, could contain as much as \n115 billion barrels of oil.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 3 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. There could be 115 billion barrels of oil in the \nOuter Continental Shelf. That is more than Venezuela's proven reserves \nof 80 billion barrels.\n  We need more refinement capacity. This amendment encourages \nrefinement expansion to alleviate supply concerns with refined \npetroleum, which is gasoline.\n  This amendment we are voting on today would not do much to bring down \nthe demand because, in fact, we can't control what China and India are \ndemanding in oil and natural gas resources, but it can affect supply. \nThat is what Congress has turned a blind eye to doing.\n  All they talk about is a windfall profits tax on oil companies. We \ntried that once before and what happened? Jobs went overseas. We had to \nimport more from overseas, so we became more dependent on foreign \nsources and we lost jobs for our country. The price would not go down. \nIt would just come from foreign sources instead of ourselves. So let's \ndon't talk about things that will not help; let's talk about supply, \nwhich we can help by working together to increase our utilization of \nour own natural resources.\n  This year we will spend about $500 billion to import oil. All those \ndollars\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\ncould stay in America, creating good jobs in America and making us \nself-reliant. If there is anything America stands for, it is the spirit \nof self-reliance, of knowing that if we are running into a crisis, if \nour economy is down, that we would be dependent on ourselves because we \nhave the resources to meet this demand. We have the resources. Now we \nneed the willpower. We need the good old American spirit to say we can \nprevail. We can reduce prices. We can help the American family get over \nthe hump. We can do something by relying on ourselves. That is what the \namendment we are voting on will do.\n  I hope the American people will look at these votes. Do they want \npolitical rhetoric, windfall profits taxes that send jobs overseas or \ndo they want real solutions short term, by not putting any oil in SPR \nright now and putting it on the market to start bringing that price \ndown and to let those who are hedging on commodities know America is \ngoing to act. The best we can do for America to show those hedgers we \nare going to act is to say we are going to take the long-term steps. We \nare going to drill in our own areas that we control. We are going to \nput jobs in America. We are going to help the States get their \nroyalties if they want to drill offshore. We are going to stand up and \nsay: This is America, and we will take care of ourselves with our own \nnatural resources. That is the vote today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am not going to speak so much about what \ndivides us. Today I wish to talk about what would unify us with respect \nto the two energy plans. We are going to vote on an amendment that is a \nbill I offered back in February of this year that would stop putting \noil underground. Some say that doesn't mean very much in terms of \nenergy prices or that it would not accomplish a lot.\n  We had testimony before the Senate Energy Committee by economists and \nan energy expert. Dr. Verleger testified that what's coming from the \nGulf of Mexico is sweet light crude, the most valuable subset of oil. \nDespite the fact that it is a small percentage of the oil usage, it \ncould have as much as a 10-percent impact on the price of sweet light \ncrude. I don't think we should underestimate the significance of this \nproposal. At a time when oil prices are bouncing up in record highs, \nwith oil prices at $120, $124, and $126 a barrel, we have speculators \nplaying their fiddle. The oil prices dance up into the stratosphere; \nthe economy is damaged; consumers get injured; and industries are going \nbelly up.\n  The question at this time is, what unites us here? I will tell you \none thing we can agree on. There are at least 80 Senators who have \nexpressed themselves, including all three Presidential candidates. They \nhave said let's stop putting oil underground. Is it a reasonable thing \nto do to set oil aside underground? We have something called the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. Let me show you what it is. This is what \nit looks like. Instead of oil going into the pipeline so you can \nconvert gasoline to your automobile, it is going underground. This is \nwhat the SPR looks like. Here is where the SPR is being stored--at \nBryan Mound, Big Hill, West Hackberry, and Bayou Choctaw.\n  The SPR is 97 percent full. The question is this: With oil at $126 a \nbarrel and gasoline around $4 a gallon or more, and with the American \nconsumer being burned at the stake, why should its Government be \ncarrying the wood? Why should we be putting oil underground at a time \nof record-high prices? Who thinks it is smart to go out into the \nmarketplace and take oil that is that valuable and stick it underground \nwhen it is having an impact of upward pressure on oil prices? That \nmakes no sense at all.\n  As I said, all three Presidential candidates have said we ought to \nstop at this time. Eighty Senators have agreed with this decision. \nSomehow, the President and Vice President are insistent that we \ncontinue to fill the SPR.\n  Look, there are a lot of other things happening. Number 1, we need \nmore production. I was one of four Senators who introduced the \nlegislation, with Senator Domenici, that led to opening Lease Sale 181 \nin the Gulf of Mexico. That is additional production, and I am proud \nthat became law. It should have been broader, but it got narrowed \nthrough the legislative process. I have a bill in to expand production \nin the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Yes, we need additional production, conservation, efficiency, and \nrenewables. We need all those things. We have made progress in some of \nthem. Last year, we finally passed reformed CAFE. We increased CAFE \nstandards 10 miles per gallon in 10 years. That is a historic \nachievement after 32 long years in this Congress. We set us on a course \ntoward renewables.\n  There are short-term, intermediate, and long-term solutions. John \nMaynard Keynes says that in the long run we are all dead. How about the \nshort term? How about today? I know where there is 70,000 barrels of \noil, including sweet light crude, that could go into the gas pumps and \ninto cars and put downward pressure on gas prices. I know how we can \ntake action and so do my colleagues. At least we can agree on that \npiece of legislation today.\n  Here is another point. There is unbelievable speculation in the \ncommodities market. It is interesting. Let me give you a couple of \ncharts that show this. The senior vice president of ExxonMobil said \nlast month:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50 or $55 per barrel.\n\n  Mr. Cazalot, the CEO of Marathon, said:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     marketplace.\n\n  A man who testified before the Energy Committee, Mr. Gheit, a senior \nenergy analyst with Oppenheimer, said:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil, and I am absolutely \n     convinced that oil prices should not be a dime above $55 a \n     barrel. I call it the world's largest gambling hall. It is \n     open 24/7.\n\n  The fact is, we have speculators, hedge funds, and investment banks \nthat have never been in the futures market before and are in neck deep. \nThey are driving up prices that have very little to do with the \nfundamentals of supply and demand. Should we ignore that and say that \nis OK?\n  Mr. President, I think I have consumed 5 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Should we say that is OK, let's talk about other \nsubjects? I don't think so. If you want to purchase stock on margin, \nyou have to put up 50 percent of the money. If you want to control \n$100,000 worth of oil, the subject of such speculation, all you need \nnow is a margin requirement between $5,000 and $7,000. It seems to me \nthat the margin requirement ought to be increased to the point of \nwringing speculators out of the system. We need a futures market for \nlegitimate hedging and for liquidity.\n  There are times when speculative bubbles develop. In this case, the \nbubble driving up the price of oil and gasoline at the pumps is \ndamaging our economy. A lot of industries are suffering, including \ntruckers and the airlines. It is hurting a lot of American families, \nand we can do something about it.\n  We have a couple different plans. Let's take the one common part of \nboth plans, which is the amendment I offered as a bill in February, and \npass that today because that will make a difference. Is it a giant \nstep? Not at all. Is it a step that is finally at long last in the \nright direction? It is. So instead of getting the worst, let's try to \nget the best of both sides and say this we agree on, this we can do.\n  My hope is that at the end of today, at least this Congress will have \nsaid to the President and Vice President: Stop doing what you are \ndoing. The last thing in the world we ought to do is put upward \npressure on gas and oil prices. We ought to put downward pressure on \nthat, and we can do that today with one single vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my friend, Senator Dorgan, I \nhave changed my mind about the SPR bill. I think he knows that. People \nwonder about changing your mind. A lot of people change their mind. I \nchanged mine because of the real price of oil and because I do believe \nwe are not going to harm our strategic reserve by\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\nthis one event. I wish to make the record clear. America needs the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. We must have it, and we should not grow \naccustomed to thinking the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is going to \nsolve our energy supply problem. Senator Dorgan has never said that. \nBut it would not. I will answer some of the remaining questions when I \nwrap up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, last weekend, when I traveled around \nWyoming, it was clear that high energy prices were on everyone's mind. \nIt is a trend I have noticed each and every summer for the past several \nyears. Each year, our constituents ask us to do something to address \nenergy prices. While we talk and talk about what we are doing, rarely \ndo we take any meaningful action.\n  It is a little different this year because Americans are seeing \nrecord prices at the pump. Those voices saying ``get to work on this \nproblem'' are more numerous. They are louder. Will the anguished calls \nfor help make it through the thick and, thus far, shut doors of \nCongress? Americans are caught in a tight spot. Some are asking: How \ncan I put food on the table when I cannot afford the gas it takes me to \nget to work? On top of that, the food is more expensive because of the \nfuel it takes to produce and ship it.\n  No one in this Chamber has all the answers. No, but we can do \nsomething. We can act. We can help. The question for me and my \ncolleagues in the Senate is, will we? We have the opportunity to do so \ntoday. We have the opportunity to vote for an amendment that provides \nshort-term relief and, at the same time, helps address the long-term \nissues that got us into this situation. I am a cosponsor of the \nMcConnell-Domenici amendment, known as the American Energy Production \nAct of 2008, because it is a responsible way to address the need to \nproduce more domestic energy and to reduce energy prices.\n  The energy situation we are in has been a long time in the making, \nand we are not going to fix it overnight. We don't have enough domestic \nenergy to meet our Nation's energy demands, but the American Energy \nProduction Act would help change that. It opens an important sliver of \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, to environmentally conscious \nleasing and allows for more production from the Outer Continental \nShelf, with consent of the State. Doing so will help the United States \nproduce more of its own energy. Instead of sitting at the trough of \nforeign oil barons with our hands out begging, Americans will produce \nmore American energy.\n  Later today, I expect to see support for the Dorgan amendment to \nsuspend filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. If you are worried \nabout roughly 70,000 barrels a day staying off the market for this \nreserve fill, then you should be outraged that 1 million barrels a day \nfrom ANWR is kept off the market because it was vetoed by President \nClinton more than 10 years ago. That is a million barrels we would not \nneed to purchase from South American dictators, or a million barrels \nfrom countries who are friendly to those who wish to destroy the United \nStates.\n  What will Americans say about this vote 10 years from now? Will they \nsay: Better late than never, because we passed the American Energy \nProduction Act, or will they say: You just didn't get it and now look \nat us suffer for it. The American Energy Production Act recognizes also \nthat coal is our Nation's most abundant energy source. It recognizes \nAmerican ingenuity. It recognizes that coal has been turned into diesel \nfuel for half a century, and it encourages the building of coal-to-\ndiesel facilities in the United States. The United States is the \n``Saudi Arabia of coal.'' Wyoming is the leading coal producer in the \nUnited States. It makes sense that we use America's most abundant \nenergy source at a time when we all agree we are too dependent upon \nforeign energy sources.\n  The amendment also includes a number of important provisions that \nwill help Wyoming and the Nation. The amendment repeals the mineral \nroyalty theft that was included in the fiscal year 2008 Omnibus \nappropriations bill. It allows development of oil shale to move \nforward.\n  I support the idea of developing more alternative energy, the use of \nwind energy, and the development of better solar energy technologies. \nAs my constituents can tell you, Wyoming is an especially good State \nfor wind, and we have high solar potential as well. While we need to \ndevelop these technologies for the long term, we need all the energy we \ncan get.\n  We need more domestically produced oil, more wind energy, more \ndomestic natural gas, more solar energy, more nuclear energy, and we \ndefinitely will need more clean coal energy.\n  Our Nation's energy policy is haphazard, broken, and it threatens to \nbreak our country. We need to make meaningful changes to that policy, \nand voting in favor of the American Energy Production Act is the first \nstep in the right direction. I hope my colleagues will recognize the \nneed to take this step and support the McConnell-Domenici amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me take up to 5 minutes at this \npoint. If the Chair will advise me when that 5 minutes has been used, I \nwould appreciate it.\n  We have two votes coming up related to energy. The first is on the \nMcConnell amendment, which is a compilation of various provisions that \nrelate to energy but, I argue, do not hold out much promise for \naffecting the price of oil or gas. Following that, we have the vote on \nthe proposal that is put forward by the majority leader, Senator Reid, \nwith regard to suspending the filling of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve for the balance of this year.\n  I will be voting against the first amendment and voting for the \nsecond amendment. I hope my colleagues will do so as well. Let me give \nthe reasons why I think we should vote against the Republican leader's \namendment.\n  First, the Republican leader's amendment doesn't do anything to deal \nwith the issue of speculation in oil markets. We have had testimony \nrepeatedly before our Senate Energy Committee that speculation in these \nmarkets is a significant factor contributing to the $126-per-barrel \nprice of oil we are seeing today. So if someone is concerned--as all of \nus are--about energy, consumers, and the burden that is being place \nupon them, then dampening speculation in these markets should be high \non our list of work to be done. It is not in the Republican leader's \namendment.\n  Of course, the amendment he proposes also doesn't do anything with \nregard to the weakening of the U.S. dollar, anything with our fiscal \npolicies. Yesterday, I went into a discussion about how that is \ncontributing to the increase in the price of oil. I think most \neconomists would agree with that.\n  The second reason I would oppose the Republican leader's amendment is \nthat it misses the boat on how to promote more supply. The argument \nbeing used is the assumption within the amendment that the way to \npromote more supply is we need to open more areas for drilling. And \nparticularly we need to open the east coast of the United States for \ndrilling offshore on the Outer Continental Shelf, we need to open the \nwest coast offshore on the Outer Continental Shelf, and we need to open \na portion of ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n  As I say, I think it misses the key issue in that we are opening \nadditional areas for drilling at a pretty rapid rate in the onshore \nareas of the United States where oil and gas production occurs and in \nthe offshore areas. But additional leases by themselves are not going \nto make a difference to consumers either in the near term or the medium \nterm. What we need to be focused on is how we can promote more diligent \ndevelopment. Nearly three-quarters of what we have leased domestically \nonshore is not now being produced. A little over three-quarters of what \nwe have leased offshore is not being produced, and that is what we \nshould be concentrating on--how do we build in incentives for actual \nproduction in areas we have, in fact, leased.\n  Finally, with respect to future lease sales, the Republican leader's \namendment leaves out the most promising\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\narea, and that is the area in the gulf coast, particularly the area we \nhave still not opened in the original lease sale 181 area of the gulf \ncoast. This is something we clearly should be addressing as well.\n  As I say, the second vote is going to be on the proposal to suspend \nthe filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. A version of that is in \nthe Republican leader's amendment, as well as being proposed by Senator \nReid. I hope we will get a very strong bipartisan vote for that \nprovision.\n  I do think it is prudent to turn down this compilation of various \nenergy-related provisions that has been put forward by the Republican \nleader with the claim that it is going to bring down the price of gas. \nIt simply will not.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nMcConnell-Domenici amendment because it does what we need to do to \naddress this real crisis in our country--crippling energy prices, \nrising energy prices that hit the pocketbook of every Louisiana family \nI represent and every American family, that is causing grave concern \nabout our economic future.\n  I am afraid what we heard from the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico just now is more of the same excuses we have heard for a couple \nof years now: why we can't do this, can't do that, and can't act in \ngeneral. What has that inaction, that paralysis, those excuses all led \nto? I will tell you what it has led to. It has led to soaring energy \nprices. In January 2007, when this Democratic Congress took office, the \naverage price of a gallon of gas was $2.33 at the pump. Today, it is \n$3.72--a 60-percent increase. That is what those excuses, that is what \nthat inaction has led to.\n  We need to do a number of things across the board on the demand side \nand on the supply side. This Domenici-McConnell amendment includes all \nof those. Does it include every one of them? No. No single proposal is \never going to include every good idea out there that we probably need \nto act on, but it includes a lot on which we need to act.\n  I want to focus on one part of the amendment in particular of which I \nam very supportive, and that is opening more of our Outer Continental \nShelf to exploration and production.\n  I believe one of the most important things in energy policy that we \nhave done since the short time I have been in the Senate is to open new \nparts of the Gulf of Mexico with revenue sharing. This provision in the \nDomenici-McConnell amendment will expand on that precedent. It would \nsay we can open areas of the Atlantic and the Pacific, but with two \nvery important caveats, both of which are great policy. First of all, \nthe host State, the State off which the activity would occur, has to \nwant the activity, has to agree to it. The Governor has to say: Yes, we \nwant this activity off our waters. And secondly, that host State in \nreturn would get significant revenue sharing, exactly the same revenue \nsharing we passed a few years ago, 37.5 percent to go to the host State \nto meet its environmental or educational or highway or other needs. \nThat is sound policy. We passed that policy for new areas of the gulf \nthat were opening. We need to expand on that policy to dramatically \nincrease our domestic energy production, and we can do that safely and \nin an environmentally friendly way.\n  There is much the McConnell-Domenici amendment does that is needed as \nwell, but I wanted to highlight that point because it is so absolutely \ncrucial and important. It builds on good policy we set a few years ago. \nIt expands on that precedent, and I believe expanding on that precedent \ncan significantly increase our domestic energy resources in this \ncountry.\n  Do we need to do other things? Absolutely. Do we need to act on the \ndemand side further? Absolutely. This isn't brain surgery. Economics \n101 tells us that price has to do with two lines on a graph: the demand \nline and the supply line. We need to mitigate, bring down demand, and \nwe need to increase supply. I am for any reasonable policy that does \nthose two things. On the demand side, conservation, greater efficiency, \nnew sources and forms of energy--absolutely.\n  I am going to agree with Senator Dorgan and vote for his amendment \nregarding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Like Senator Domenici, I \nhave changed my mind on that issue because the increases in price at \nthe pump have gotten so dramatic and so outrageous. So that can \nmitigate demand increases as well.\n  But as we make all of those efforts on the demand side--and we need \nto do more--we cannot constantly ignore the supply side, particularly \nthe domestic supply side. That is exactly what this Congress has done \nfor the last 2 years. Mr. President, $2.33 price at the pump then; \n$3.72 price at the pump today. Let's act, and let's act now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish today to support the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid. It embodies a policy \nchange that I have advocated for many months. In January, I wrote to \nthe Secretary of Energy and urged the administration to stop filling \nthe SPR while oil prices are so high. The Reid amendment would suspend \nacquisition for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR, until the end of \nthe year or until the price of a barrel of oil goes below $75.\n  The SPR is an emergency stockpile and an essential safeguard against \nmajor disruptions in global oil markets. However, the SPR already \ncontains nearly 700 million barrels of oil, 97 percent of its current \nstorage capacity. This is more than sufficient to meet a crisis.\n  Mr. President, our Nation faces record-high energy prices affecting \nalmost every aspect of daily life. The prices of gasoline, home heating \noil, and diesel are creating tremendous hardships for American \nfamilies, truckers, and small businesses. High energy prices are a \nmajor cause of the economic downturn. Last week, crude oil was trading \nat over $120 per barrel.\n  The administration's decision to fill the SPR when oil prices are so \nhigh defies common sense. In 2005, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin, and I joined forces on a bipartisan amendment directing the \nDepartment of Energy to better manage the Reserve by requiring the \nDepartment to avoid purchases when prices are high so as not to drive \nup prices further by taking oil off the market. I don't believe the \nDepartment of Energy is abiding by this law. If it were, the Department \nwould not be making purchases while prices are so high.\n  It simply does not make sense for the Department of Energy to be \npurchasing oil for the Reserve at a time when oil prices exceed $120 \nper barrel. The Federal Government is taking oil off the market and \nthus driving up prices at a time when consumers are struggling to pay \ntheir fuel bills.\n  If the administration stopped purchasing oil for the SPR, the Energy \nInformation Administration has estimated that the impact on gas prices \nwould be between 4 and 5 cents a gallon. Other experts believe it is \nconsiderably higher. At a hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations in December, one energy expert, Philip Verleger, said, \n``DOE's actions added between 5 and 20 percent to the price of oil.'' \nIt is a bad deal for taxpayers for the Department of Energy to be \npurchasing oil when prices are so high.\n  There are other short-term steps we must take to address the energy \ncrisis--for example, regulating energy futures markets and repealing \ntax breaks for major oil companies--but suspending filling the SPR is a \nkey step that I hope we approve tomorrow.\n  In the long term, our challenge to address energy prices is, of \ncourse, to reduce our reliance on imported oil. We need to pursue the \ngoal of energy independence just as fervently as the Nation embraced \nPresident Kennedy's goal in 1961 of putting a man on the Moon. Energy \nindependence, stable energy costs, and environmental stewardship are \ngoals that are within our reach. I urge my colleagues to get us started \non the effort by supporting this proposal to suspend filling the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has 6 minutes 18 \nseconds. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I understand it, the other side is \ngoing to have only one speaker to use their\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\ntime. I am trying to find the Senator from Texas. He wanted to speak. \nLet me take a couple of minutes. If he gets here, I will yield the \nfloor as soon as he arrives.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I wish to say that my good \nfriend, my fellow Senator from New Mexico spoke about speculation in \nthis oil market. There may be some. We heard testimony there may be. So \neverybody knows, there is nothing before the Senate that the Democrats \npropose regarding speculation. They just have a one-shot bill, and it \nis pretty good, but it is not an energy policy. Probably most of us are \ngoing to vote for it. That is what Senator Dorgan proposed.\n  As I indicated, I changed my mind. If people are wondering about \nthat, I was reading about economic history, and I read where John \nMaynard Keynes, the great economist, was asked: Why did you change your \nmind? He said: When the facts change, I change my mind. That is what \nhappened here with reference to SPR. The facts changed, and I changed \nmy mind.\n  The good Senator from New Mexico, my colleague, also said we have a \nbig problem with the weakening of the dollar. I hope he doesn't intend \nto imply by that, when we find we can strengthen the dollar, then we \nwill solve the energy problem. I don't know that we know how to do that \none any quicker than we do the energy crisis. I don't think that would \naccomplish anything.\n  We have a lot going on in the gulf, so we said let's let those \ncontinue. That is what the Domenici bill says. But we say the rest of \nthe offshore around America--and incidentally, there is probably more \nthan any of us know in offshore America. We probably would send such a \nbig signal to the world if we decided to move on that. That alone would \nhave a positive impact.\n  In addition, the bill before the Senate does a lot in a number of \nareas that have not been talked about very much. It would cause the \nworld to take another look and to say: America is serious, they are \nreally going to do something about their energy problems.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the remainder of the time to the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am required by our leadership to object \nbecause they want to get the vote off on the time predetermined. I \napologize for that, but that is what I am required to do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Four minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, one thing has been accomplished by the \ndebate leading up to this morning's vote; that is, Congress finally--\nfinally--has acknowledged the existence of the law of supply and \ndemand. If we look at these two votes we are going to have this \nmorning, first is the McConnell-Domenici amendment, of which I am proud \nto be a cosponsor, which would produce, if implemented, potentially up \nto 3 million additional barrels of oil a day from the United States of \nAmerica--3 million--making us less dependent on imported oil from some \nof our Nation's enemies, countries such as Iran and Venezuela that are \npart of OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n  Alternatively, our friends on the other side of the aisle have \nproposed--and I will vote for it--a temporary suspension of putting oil \ninto the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But how much does that represent? \nIt represents 70,000 barrels of oil that would not be put in the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and would be available on the open market \nas an additional supply of oil, which is then available to be refined \ninto gasoline. I suspect it will have some modest impact on the price \nof gasoline at the pump, maybe 3 to 5 cents a gallon. But if we think \n70,000 barrels of additional oil into the open market will be \nbeneficial in terms of bringing down the price of gasoline, how much \nmore beneficial would it be to have 3 million additional barrels of oil \nproduced from our country out on the open market available for refining \ninto gasoline to help bring down the price of gas at the pump?\n  I am pleased that our colleagues have recognized the importance of \nthe law of supply and demand, something Congress has turned a blind eye \nto for lo these many years as we put so much of America's natural \nresources out of bounds when it comes to developing those resources, \nand, of course, we know what the consequences of that have been, with \n$3.71 average price for gasoline in America today and the price of oil \non the spot market bouncing up around $125 a barrel.\n  I don't know whether this amendment, of which I am proud to be a \ncosponsor, could produce ultimately 3 million new barrels of American \noil each day. I don't know whether it will get the requisite 60 votes. \nBut if it does not, when gasoline is $3.71 a gallon and oil is $125 a \nbarrel, I wonder if the same vote, if we have it again when gasoline is \n$4 a gallon and oil is $150 a barrel or when gasoline is $4.50 a gallon \nand the price of oil is even higher, at what point the Congress, the \nSenate is going to listen to the American people and say: We need some \nhelp; we need some relief.\n  Now that Congress has acknowledged the importance of additional \nsupply in terms of bringing down the price at the pump, ultimately it \nis my hope our colleagues will vote, at least 60 of us, for the \nDomenici-McConnell amendment. I think the American consumers would be \nthe beneficiary of that. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me conclude with a couple of thoughts. \nFirst of all, my colleague from New Mexico described the issues of \nspeculation a bit. We do, in fact, in our larger proposal that we \nannounced last week, have a provision dealing with speculation. And it \nis important that we do that because speculation is part of what is \ndriving these prices. I showed comments from executives of some of the \nlargest oil companies in this country that said there is no \njustification for the current price given supply and demand.\n  They said the price of oil should not be much above $50, $60, $70 a \nbarrel. So what is happening? Well, let me come to that in a moment. \nLet me say, first of all, my hope is that today, here on the floor of \nthe Senate, we will decide to do some good things.\n  Now, how do you do good things? You try to find areas of common \ninterest and legislate moving ahead where you can. That is what Senator \nReid has suggested in the underlying amendment that we will vote on \ndealing with stopping and halting the putting of oil underground in the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. This is something I introduced in the \nSenate back in February.\n  Now, as I said before, when the American consumer is being burned at \nthe stake by high gas prices, its Government ought not be carrying the \nwood. I mean, it is that simple. We can do something about this.\n  We are talking about 70,000 barrels a day, 70,000 barrels every \nsingle day of sweet light crude that we are taking off the market. Dr. \nPhilip Verleger, an economist and energy analyst, testified before the \nEnergy Committee on the effects of such a move. He said although it is \nonly three-tenths of a percent of usage, because it is sweet light \ncrude, the most valuable subset of oil, it could have up to as much as \na 10-percent effect on the price of oil.\n  So it seems to me what we do is, do what the Republicans and \nDemocrats have now generally come together to say we should do, and say \nto the President: Look, you cannot put 70,000 barrels of oil \nunderground every day. You cannot do that. The Strategic Petroleum \nReserve is 97 percent filled, 97 percent.\n  Now, oil is $120, $126 a barrel; gas is going to $4 a gallon. Let me \ndescribe the situation we all understand that we face on this planet of \nours. We stick straws in the planet and suck oil out. We suck out 85 \nmillion barrels every day. We are required to use one-fourth of that in \nthis little spot of geography on the planet called the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\n  Let me say that again. We take 85 million barrels a day, and we need \none-fourth of it to be used in the United States. Now, 60 percent of \nthat which we use comes from outside of our country. That holds us \nhostage to others. And 70 percent of the oil we use in this country is \nused to fuel vehicles. So vehicles are an important part of this issue. \nI am proud to say this Congress, with this majority and some minority \nhelp, has passed for the first time in 32 years an increase of 10 miles \nper gallon in the next 10 years of CAFE standards. This will lead to \nbetter automobile efficiency and better gas mileage.\n  We made some progress in other areas. We opened production in Lease \n181 in the Gulf of Mexico where there are substantial reserves. We made \nprogress in the biofuels ethanol standards and renewable fuels \nstandards. We have made some progress on all of those issues, but we \nhave people coming to the floor today to say: Well, gas is $4 a gallon. \nLet's open ANWR. That means we get oil in 10 years.\n  As John Maynard Keynes said, in the long run we are all dead. What \ncan we do in the short term? At least today, on Tuesday, we can at \nleast do what we both believe--that is, what the minority and majority \nbelieve is appropriate--and that is stop putting oil underground and \nput some downward pressure on gas prices and oil prices. Give the \nconsumer an opportunity to see some decent prices.\n  This speculation in the futures market is speculation that is driving \nup prices. We want to do something about that as well. But at least \ntoday we have one common theme; we can increase supply by 70,000 \nbarrels a day of sweet light crude. Instead of it going into the supply \nthat comes through the pump into the cars, which puts downward pressure \non gasoline, it is now going underground, underground in the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. It makes no sense at all.\n  So I am saying: Let's stop doing bad things and let's start doing \ngood things. We can start by taking the first step in doing that today.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 1 minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me make one additional point, if I can. It does not \nrelate specifically to this amendment, but this issue of the free \nmarket. You have an OPEC cartel behind closed doors. You have oil \ncompanies that are bigger through mergers. You have a futures market \nthat is now rife with speculation. There is no free market. So the \nAmerican people deserve, it seems to me, a Congress that will stand up \nand take some steps to put some downward pressure on gasoline prices.\n  That is a step we can take today. It is a step that is not a giant \nstep, but it is a step in the right direction that will put downward \npressure on gas prices. It will help this country. My hope is, \nfollowing this vote, we will see that both parties can contribute to \nsomething when we agree on it. I think this will be a good day to put \ndownward pressure on gas prices.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4737\n\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4737.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do we not have 1 minute left on each side? The \namendment is not in order while time remains.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is simply being \nreported. We will have 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for Mr. Reid, \n     for himself and Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n     Levin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n     Sanders, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Salazar, \n     Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Carper, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n     Reed, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Domenici, and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 4737 to amendment No. 4707.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the supply and lower the cost of petroleum by \n temporarily suspending the acquisition of petroleum for the Strategic \n                           Petroleum Reserve)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SUSPENSION OF PETROLEUM ACQUISITION FOR STRATEGIC \n                   PETROLEUM RESERVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b) and \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, during the period \n     beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and ending on \n     December 31, 2008--\n       (1) the Secretary of the Interior shall suspend acquisition \n     of petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the \n     royalty-in-kind program; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Energy shall suspend acquisition of \n     petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through any \n     other acquisition method.\n       (b) Resumption.--Not earlier than 30 days after the date on \n     which the President notifies Congress that the President has \n     determined that the weighted average price of petroleum in \n     the United States for the most recent 90-day period is $75 or \n     less per barrel--\n       (1) the Secretary of the Interior may resume acquisition of \n     petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the \n     royalty-in-kind program; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Energy may resume acquisition of \n     petroleum for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through any \n     other acquisition method.\n       (c) Existing Contracts.--In the case of any oil scheduled \n     to be delivered to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve pursuant \n     to a contract entered into by the Secretary of Energy prior \n     to, and in effect on, the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, negotiate \n     a deferral of the delivery of the oil for a period of not \n     less than 1 year, in accordance with procedures of the \n     Department of Energy in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act for deferrals of oil.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4720\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There now will be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 4720.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That means 1 minute each?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On behalf of the amendment, I wish to say whoever is \ninterested in what is going on today should know that Democrats speak \nof doing other things to bring the price down, but the only thing we \nare really doing is the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota on \nSPR. We all agree with that.\n  That is a temporary 7-month deferral of purchases. Clearly, if it \ndoes anything, it will be extremely temporary. All of the other things \nthat are spoken about, none of them are in this bill, whether it has to \ndo with fraud, speculation, or whatever.\n  On our side we have at least said: Let's start coal to liquid, a \ngreat American resource. Let's start offshore around America. Let's \nstart on ANWR. Let's start moving on oil shale. Let's accelerate \nbattery research, which will move us toward automobiles that can plug \nin, which will be a big American boon.\n  So there are lots of pluses. There is a lot of rhetoric. And there is \none amendment that the Democrats offer that we agree upon. I believe \nthose people interested in production should vote for the Domenici \namendment and tell the American people the truth: We can produce in \nAmerica and put pressure on the world markets and reduce the price of \noil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I urge Senators to vote against the \nMcConnell amendment. It is a compilation of various proposals. The main \nthrust of it is to try to lease more Federal land. People should \nunderstand that we have been leasing a great deal of Federal land \nonshore. That pie chart on the left is offshore, and the Outer \nContinental Shelf, that is the pie chart on the right.\n  We currently have 31 million acres of land that is leased and is not \nproducing. What we need to do is to get diligent in the development of \nthese areas that are already leased.\n  Offshore, the same thing; the Outer Continental Shelf has 33 million \nacres that are not producing. So this amendment is a compilation of \nenergy-related provisions that are put into the McConnell amendment. It \nis not going to bring down the price of gas at the pump.\n  I urge Senators to oppose it and then to support the second vote on \nthe proposal to suspend the filling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 4720.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, requiring \n60 votes for adoption of this amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4737\n\n  There are now 2 minutes, equally divided, prior to a vote on the Reid \namendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take the 1 minute.\n  This is a piece of legislation I introduced in February of this year. \nThe Strategic Petroleum Reserve is 97 percent filled. We have oil and \ngas prices going through the roof in this country. We are putting \n70,000 barrels of oil underground every day. It is a subset of the most \nvaluable kind of oil: Sweet light crude, coming from the Gulf of \nMexico.\n  We heard testimony before the Senate Energy Committee that even \nthough it is a small part of our oil usage, this subset of oil--the \n70,000 barrels a day put underground--could have an impact of up to 10 \npercent of the price of oil. I am not suggesting this does everything, \nbut it is a step in the right direction.\n  As I said earlier, when the American consumer is being burned at the \nstake by energy prices, the Government ought not be carrying the wood. \nSticking oil underground is wrong at this point in time, and this \namendment simply says: Stop it. Halt it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment to stop deliveries \nof oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, SPR.\n  Crude oil prices reached a record high recently of $126 per barrel, \nleading to record highs in the price of other fuels produced from crude \noil, including gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. With \nprices going through the roof, it is the wrong time for the Department \nof Energy, DOE, to take millions of barrels of high-priced oil off the \nmarket and put it into the SPR. Instead of reducing supplies by taking \noil off the market and increasing the price of oil, the DOE should be \nlooking for ways to decrease the price of oil. One step is a moratorium \non filling the SPR until oil prices are lower.\n  Unfortunately, the DOE is contributing to the current price spike by \nfilling the SPR regardless of the cost of crude oil or the petroleum \nproducts that are refined from crude oil.\n  There are three major problems with the DOE's insistence on putting \nhigh-priced oil into the SPR. First, by placing oil into the SPR the \nDOE is reducing the supply of crude oil and putting upward pressure on \nthe price of oil. Second, by placing very expensive crude oil into the \nSPR, the DOE is significantly increasing the cost of the SPR program to \nthe taxpayers. Third, the DOE's approach runs counter to the direction \nprovided by the Congress in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which \nrequires the DOE to fill in the SPR in a manner that minimizes the \nimpact upon prices and the costs to the taxpayers.\n  The DOE is currently taking about 70,000 barrels per day of crude oil \noff the market and putting it into the SPR. For the first half of 2008, \nthis will total to about 10 million barrels of crude oil. This is \nreducing our inventories of crude oil and refined products, such as \ngasoline, just at a time when our refineries need to be running at \nmaximum to make gasoline for the spring and summer driving seasons. The \nDOE also has asked for bids for another 6-month program to fill the \nSPR, beginning later this year. If the DOE is permitted to continue \nwith this program, it will take millions more barrels of oil off the \nmarket beginning sometime later this year.\n  Under the basic economic principle of supply and demand, reducing the \nsupply of crude oil available to U.S. refineries will increase the \nprice of oil and gasoline. Even the DOE agrees with this basic economic \nprinciple. Mr. Guy Caruso, the head of the DOE's Energy Information \nAdministration, testified to the Congress earlier this year that an SPR \nfill of 100,000 barrels per day would add about $2 per barrel to the \nprice of oil. Last December, Dr. Philip Verleger testified that the SPR \nfill was adding about $10 per barrel to the price of crude oil. \nEconomists may disagree on the amount of the increase, but now there \nshould be no doubt that the DOE is increasing the price of oil by \nfilling the SPR at this time. The DOE acknowledges this. The DOE should \nbe working to lower oil prices, not helping to boost them to record \nhighs.\n  DOE says the amount of oil it is putting into the SPR is \ninsignificant compared to total global supply. This is the wrong \ncomparison. The amount of oil DOE is putting into the SPR represents a \nsignificant marginal increase in the demand for oil. When supply and \ndemand are closely balanced, a marginal increase in demand can have a \nvery large impact on price. This is precisely the situation we are in \ntoday. Supply and demand are very closely balanced. Adding a demand of \nmillions of barrels of oil over a period of several months can have a \nvery significant impact on the amount of oil on the market or in \ninventories. In a tight market, taking millions of barrels off the \nmarket can indeed have a major impact upon oil prices.\n  When the DOE fills the SPR it does not have to actually purchase any \ncrude oil. Instead, the DOE takes oil that is paid to the Federal \nGovernment as royalties for oil produced by private oil companies on \noffshore oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico and trades it back to private \noil companies for oil that is then placed into the SPR. Thus, the DOE's \nprogram to acquire oil for the SPR does not require any Federal \nappropriations. But that doesn't mean the program doesn't cost the \ntaxpayers any money. In fact, the opposite is true--the SPR program \ncosts the taxpayers a lot of money. The higher the price of oil, the \nmore it costs the taxpayers. This is because instead of selling the \nroyalty oil on the open market at whatever the market price of oil is, \nrecently as much as $126 a barrel, the DOE is taking that oil off the \nmarket, trading it for oil that meets the specifications of oil for the \nSPR, and leaving taxpayers without the revenue that would be created by \nselling tens of millions of barrels of oil. In essence, the taxpayers \nare paying the market price of oil for each barrel of oil placed into \nthe SPR.\n  A moratorium on filling the SPR until prices are lower would save the \ntaxpayers money. If the DOE were to acquire SPR oil at $75 per barrel \ninstead of $125 per barrel, it would save $50 per barrel. For 10 \nmillion barrels, that would add up to $500 million. Delaying the \nfilling of the SPR would not affect or harm our national security or \nour energy security. The SPR is currently about 97 percent full, with\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\nslightly more than 700 million barrels of oil. This amount of oil is \nlarge enough to ensure that we are prepared for any contingencies that \nthe SPR is designed to cover.\n  To date, over the entire life of the SPR the largest withdrawal of \noil from the SPR has been for about 30 million barrels. The amount of \noil in the SPR today already is far more than has ever been needed to \ncover market disruptions.\n  The DOE's policy to fill the SPR at the same rate regardless of the \neffect on oil prices or taxpayer costs runs counter to the intent of \nCongress in section 301 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which directs \nDOE to consider and minimize the effects on oil prices and costs to the \ntaxpayers when acquiring oil for the SPR. I sponsored the amendment, \nalong with Senator Collins, that became this provision in the law. We \ndid not intend this to simply be a formality, whereby in every case DOE \nwould simply conclude that the effect on price was insignificant. Yet \nthat seems to be how DOE is applying this provision.\n\n  In 2003, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, \ncompleted a detailed investigation of the SPR fill program. The \nsubcommittee's 2003 report is titled ``U.S. Strategic Petroleum \nReserve: Recent Policy Has Increased Costs to Consumers But Not Overall \nU.S. Energy Security.'' It can be found on the Subcommittee's Web site. \nThe investigation found that in 2002 the Bush administration changed \nthe DOE's policy on how it would fill the SPR, and that this change in \npolicy increased the price of oil but not our overall energy security.\n  Before the Bush administration changed the DOE's policy on filling \nthe SPR, the DOE sought to put more crude oil into the SPR when \nsupplies were plentiful and prices low and less crude oil into the SPR \nwhen supplies were scarce and prices high. The DOE also would allow oil \ncompanies to defer deliveries for up to a year when supplies were \ntight, provided that the oil companies would deposit more oil into the \nSPR at the end of the deferral period. Through this deferral policy, \nthe DOE was able to obtain additional SPR oil for no additional cost to \nthe taxpayer. This policy made good sense.\n  As my subcommittee's report documented, in 2002 the White House \ndirected DOE to change its policy. Instead of allowing the DOE to \ncontinue with its sensible policy, the White House directed the DOE to \nfill the SPR at the same rate, regardless of market conditions. The new \npolicy also prohibited the DOE from accepting any deferrals, regardless \nof market conditions. The career DOE staff vigorously protested the \nchanges ordered by the White House. The career staff pointed out that \nfilling the SPR in times of tight supplies and high prices would push \nprices up and that not allowing any deferrals would cost the taxpayers \nmore money. The career staff also argued that the old policy followed \ngood business judgment and the new policy would be difficult to defend \nunder sound business principles. These memos are included as exhibits \nto the subcommittee's 2003 report. The DOE career staff's \nrecommendations were rejected, however, and the current policy was \nadopted.\n  Following the issuance of this report, in early 2003, I asked the \nDepartment of Energy to suspend its filling of the SPR until prices had \nabated and supplies were more plentiful. The DOE refused to change \ncourse and continued the SPR fill without regard to market supplies or \nprices. In response, I offered a bipartisan amendment, with Senator \nCollins, to the Interior appropriations bill--which provides funding \nfor the Strategic Petroleum Reserve program--to require the DOE to \nminimize the costs to the taxpayers and market impacts when placing oil \ninto the SPR. The Senate unanimously adopted our amendment, but it was \ndropped from the conference report due to the Bush administration's \ncontinued opposition.\n  The next spring, I offered another bipartisan amendment, also with \nSenator Collins, to the budget resolution expressing the sense of the \nSenate that the administration should postpone deliveries into the SPR \nand use the savings from the postponement to increase funding for \nnational security programs. The amendment passed the Senate by a vote \nof 52 to 43. That fall, we attempted to attach a similar amendment to \nthe Homeland Security appropriations bill that would have postponed the \nSPR fill and used the savings for homeland security programs, but the \namendment was defeated by a procedural vote, even though the majority \nof Senators voted in favor of the amendment, 48 to 47.\n  The next year, the Senate passed the Levin-Collins amendment to the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005 to require the DOE to consider price impacts \nand minimize the costs to the taxpayers and market impacts when placing \noil into the SPR. The Levin-Collins amendment was agreed to by the \nconferees and signed into law as section 301 of the Energy Policy Act \nof 2005.\n  But, unfortunately, passage of this provision has had no effect upon \nthe DOE's actions. The DOE continues to fill the SPR regardless of the \nmarket effects of buying oil, thereby taking oil off the market and \nreducing supply by placing it into the SPR. In the past year, no matter \nwhat the price of oil or market conditions, the DOE has consistently \nsaid that the market effects are negligible and claimed that there is \nno reason to delay filling the SPR, effectively ignoring the section \n301 requirements of the Energy Policy Act. The result is that we have \nthe current contradiction of DOE depositing oil into the SPR at the \nsame time the President is urging OPEC to put more oil on to the \nmarket.\n  Now is not the time to be filling the SPR. When oil prices are at \nrecord highs, we should be looking for ways to increase oil supplies \nand reduce prices. The Department of Energy is doing just the opposite. \nIt is taking oil off the market and increasing prices, doing so at \ngreat costs to taxpayers and despite enacted law requiring that they do \notherwise. There is now a strong bipartisan consensus to put a halt to \nthe administration's misguided SPR policy. I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor this amendment to postpone the filling of the SPR until oil prices \nhave fallen to lower levels.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want the Republicans to know I have \nchanged my mind over the past 3 or 4 weeks, and it is simply because \nthe price of oil is now up to $125 a barrel--perhaps in real dollars \n$110. I think for 7 months to stop filling SPR could have a chance of \nreducing the price by a small amount.\n  Make no bones about it now, this is no big energy policy. This is one \nlittle thing we can do, and I think we ought to go ahead and do it. I \nknow there are some who take the fact that we need a big reserve very \nseriously, and they think we ought to continue to fill it even more \nthan we are, and I respect those views. But with reference to this \namendment, by Senator Dorgan, I think we ought to support it and at \nleast do one positive thing. It was in our bill, incidentally, as one \nof a number of positive things we would do, including Alaska, which is \ncomplained so much about. It would produce a million barrels \npermanently, more or less. This is 70,000 barrels one time--so we \nunderstand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do not \nobject, of course, but might I observe that I understood the objection \nto the previous unanimous consent request. My hope would be that in the \ncoming hours today we might have some discussions between the \nleadership of the minority and majority so that we can proceed on the \nSPR amendment. I understand the objection was raised, but there has \nbeen an overwhelming amount of support by the Senate. I hope we could \nhave those discussions this afternoon and perhaps proceed on the basis \nthat Senator Reid has suggested.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the substitute amendment, as amended, is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4707), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week, the Senate had a fruitful debate \non, and today the Senate will vote on passage of the Flood Insurance \nReform and Modernization Act. This bill extends the flood insurance \nprogram for 5 years, while making commonsense reforms so that flood \ninsurance remains available to millions of Americans who live in flood-\nprone areas.\n  Though many people think of floods as confined to coastal areas, I \nwant to let my colleagues know that in the last year, there have been \nflood claims in all 50 States. Every State has at-risk areas, and in \nthe absence of private insurance, the National Flood Insurance Program \nis the only way for home and business owners to ensure they can rebuild \nafter the waters recede.\n  The bill we are considering makes some tough choices, as I talked \nabout last week.\n  In order to assure the continuation and availability of flood \ninsurance, this bill essentially restarts the flood program. It \nforgives the $17 billion of program debt so that all policyholders will \nnot face steep premium increases. All 5.5 million policyholders would \nhave to double their premium payments just to pay the interest on this \ndebt. To make a dent in the principal, premiums would have to increase \nmany times over. Increases of this magnitude would drive untold numbers \nof people to drop flood insurance--at a time when we ought to be \nencouraging more people to purchase this critical coverage.\n  In an effort to avoid these steep premium increases, the bill \nforgives the debt. In addition, it reforms the premium structure so \nrates are actuarially based. Yes, this reform will result in some \npolicyholders paying more for flood coverage, but the premium increases \nare much less than they would be if this bill were not to pass. If we \ndo nothing, FEMA's $17 billion debt hangs over the entire program.\n  Last week, we accepted 11 amendments. We were able to accommodate \nSenators on both sides of the aisle--specifically Senators Menendez, \nCoburn, McCaskill, DeMint, Dole, Thune, Durbin, and Landrieu. Their \namendments help to strengthen this bill and the flood insurance \nprogram. These amendments include provisions to ensure that FEMA does \noutreach when mapping changes occur, to make policy exclusions clear to \nhome and business owners, and to strengthen the flood insurance \nadvocate created in the committee-passed bill.\n  I want to thank Senator Shelby and his staff for working so closely \nwith us on this bipartisan bill. I also want to thank the majority and \nminority leaders for agreeing to move to this bill, and for supporting \nour efforts last week to accommodate debate and amendments.\n  I especially thank the staff who have worked on this legislation. In \nparticular I want to thank Lula Davis, Tim Mitchell, Tricia Engle, and \nMark Wetjen on Leader Reid's staff, and I want to thank Rohit Kumar and \nDave Schiappa on minority leader McConnell's staff.\n  Senator Shelby's staff have been invaluable, and I want to recognize \nthe work of Bill Duhnke, Mark Oesterle, Mark Calabria and Jim Johnson. \nI also want to acknowledge the hard work of my own staff, including \nShawn Maher, Jennifer Fogel-Bublick, and Sarah Kline.\n  As I have said, this is a strong bill that ensures flood insurance \nwill be available for many years to come. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill so that families can rebuild their homes and their \nlives after a flood.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Flood Insurance \nReform and Modernization Act of 2007.\n  After Hurricane Katrina, I had a chance to meet some of the survivors \nwho were displaced by the storm and ended up in Illinois. Many had lost \ntheir homes, their jobs, their communities, everything. Nearly 3 years \nlater, some are still picking up the pieces of a former life.\n  We can't stop every disaster from happening. But we can be prepared, \nso what happened after Katrina never happens again.\n  Katrina taught us the importance of being prepared. We need to \nunderstand the risks of disaster, prepare homes\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nand communities to withstand disaster, and make sure that once disaster \nstrikes, communities can get back on their feet as quickly as possible.\n  The national flood insurance program is one of the best ways we do \nthis. It allows people who live near rivers or other flood-prone areas \nto insure themselves at an affordable rate against the risk of a flood. \nIf the worst happens, it covers some of the costs of recovery.\n  This program is critically important to Illinois.\n  Illinois has the largest inland system of rivers, lakes, and streams \nin the Nation. Floods are 98 percent of Illinois' declared disasters. \nThat is why only three other States have more communities participating \nin the flood insurance program than Illinois.\n  The bill before us today renews the flood insurance program, which \nexpires this September, and strengthens the program in several \nimportant ways.\n  It puts the program on sound financial footing. It forgives the $17 \nbillion debt from Katrina and other storm-related losses, a debt the \nprogram could never repay. But the bill also requires FEMA to establish \na reserve fund so we are in better shape to cover future losses.\n  It encourages more people to buy flood insurance.\n  It provides more funding to update old flood maps, so communities \nknow where the hazards are and can plan accordingly.\n  And I am pleased that this legislation also contains an amendment I \noffered to make sure that the costs of flood insurance are shared \nfairly between Illinois and Missouri down near St. Louis.\n  Floods are among the most common and costly natural disasters. \nPassing this bill will strengthen our ability to prepare for what we \nknow is coming and to return to our lives as soon as possible once the \nflood waters recede. This bill helps ensure that when the next Katrina-\nlike disaster hits, we won't see a Katrina-like aftermath.\n  I thank Senators Dodd and Shelby for their hard work on this bill and \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to express my views \nabout the pending energy amendment aimed at increasing domestic oil and \ngas production. In recognizing that this is a symbolic vote aimed at \nstimulating debate on the Nation's energy situation, I am voting for \nthis amendment today because I want to affirm the principle of taking \ndecisive action on the Nation's energy issues. I do, however, have \nreservations about some of the provisions contained within this \nmeasure.\n  While I fully support measures contained in the package which would \nfurther the development of alternative fuels for the transportation \nsector and for electric-powered vehicles; set goals for the use of \ncoal-derived fuels; suspend filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; \nand streamline the permitting process for new oil refineries, I believe \nfurther debate is necessary on some other provisions.\n  Specifically, when these energy issues are revisited, there should be \nfurther discussion of opening additional areas of the Outer Continental \nShelf to drilling as well as further discussion on the moratorium on \ncommercial leasing of oil shale in the Western United States. I \nunderstand the need to develop our domestic resources due to growing \nglobal demand for oil, but we must ensure these steps are taken with \nthe utmost environmental sensitivity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote for the Flood Insurance Reform \nand Modernization Act because it would help place the National Flood \nInsurance Program, NFIP, back on solid financial footing. It is not a \nperfect bill, but I hope that some of my concerns can be addressed in \nthe House Senate conference process.\n  When Congress established the NFIP in 1968, flood insurance was not \navailable at an affordable price, resulting in frequent and costly \nFederal disaster aid payments. The new program created a method to \nshare the risk of flood losses through a national insurance program and \nrequired preventive and protective measures to mitigate the risk. \nCurrently, Michigan has over 27,000 flood insurance policies, and since \nthe program's inception, over $42.6 million in flood claims have been \npaid to Michigan policyholders. This bipartisan reform bill extends \nthis important program through 2013, and enhances the long-term \nviability of the program, helping to provide self-sustaining, critical \ninsurance coverage for millions of home and business owners throughout \nthe country.\n  Historically, the flood insurance program has covered most claims \nthrough the premiums it has collected. However, recent losses from the \n2004 floods and 2005 catastrophic hurricanes have left the program over \n$17 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury. This reform bill takes the \npainful but necessary step of forgiving that debt. At the same time, \nthis legislation makes changes to the program to help ensure its \ncontinued long-term financial solvency. The aim is to ensure that each \ntime a hurricane, deluge or other natural disaster hits, flood claims \ncan be paid without relying on taxpayer funds from across the country.\n  There are a number of measures in this bill aimed at restoring the \nprogram's financial stability. These include requiring certain at-risk \nproperties to pay phased-in actuarial rates, extending the Severe \nRepetitive Loss Mitigation program to mitigate losses on the most at-\nrisk properties, and requiring the program to build up reserves. These \nand other new requirements reflect difficult choices because they are \nnot without cost to property owners, many of whom are already stretched \nby staggering gas and grocery prices, falling home values and a dismal \neconomy. This bill attempts to recognize that reality by maintaining \nsome subsidized rates for Federal flood insurance where buildings were \nbuilt before the existence of a federal flood map, and phasing-in new \nactuarial rates.\n  The bill also expands and encourages the purchase of flood insurance \nfor properties in areas with flood risks. Property owners in a 500-year \nfloodplain would be notified about the risks they face, but would not \nbe required to purchase flood insurance. To better define areas of \nflood risk, the bill would require FEMA to establish an ongoing map \nmodernization program using the most accurate data and consistent \nstandards for mapping. These changes will help generate the necessary \npremium income for the program while striving to maintain affordability \nfor homeowners.\n  The bill also expands and encourages the purchase of flood insurance \nfor properties in areas located behind levees, dams, and other man-made \nstructures, recognizing that these structures could be breached. While \nrecent history has shown us that levees can and do fail and that no \nproperties are entirely risk-free, I am concerned that imposing this \nmandatory requirement in a uniform fashion may not accurately reflect \nthe risks these communities face. Michigan has 2,500 dams and numerous \nlevees scattered across the State; properties behind these structures \nwould be required to purchase federal flood insurance regardless of the \nrisks they face. We need to better understand the implications of \nrequiring mandatory insurance for all of these areas before we impose a \nblanket requirement on all of them. For this reason, I voted in support \nof an amendment offered by Senator Landrieu that would have lifted this \nnew mandatory requirement and would have instead required a study to be \nconducted to assess the impact, effectiveness, and feasibility of \nextending mandatory flood coverage to these areas. I believe Senator \nLandrieu's more thoughtful approach is warranted. Unfortunately, the \namendment failed 30-62.\n  While I recognize that making the NFIP more financially sound \nrequires making some tough decisions, I believe some of the choices \nreflected in this bill lead to unfair results. For example, I am \nconcerned about what will happen to property owners currently not \nmapped into a floodplain should a new map require them to purchase \nflood insurance. Currently, these property owners would receive \nsubsidized policies, because the buildings were built before the flood \nrisk was known. However, this bill removes the subsidized rate for \nproperties that get remapped into a floodplain. While the bill provides \na 2-year phase-in for these unsubsidized rates, it is not fair to \ndemand higher rates from those who, through no fault of their own, had \nno idea they had exposure to flood damage, especially at a time when so \nmany families are struggling to meet their monthly expenses. This \ninequity is one that I hope can be addressed when this bill is \nconferenced with the House version passed last year.\n  There are also inequities in existing approaches of FEMA's mapping of \nflood risk which need to be corrected in conference. For instance, \nrevised flood\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\nmaps are being developed by FEMA for the city of Grand Rapids in such a \nway that does not incorporate the existing flood protection provided by \nthe city's recently completed $12.4 million floodwall improvement \nproject. The revised flood maps would put over 6,000 additional \nproperties into the 100-year floodplain, at a cost of over $6 million \nper year. This is an area that has not flooded at that level since \n1905, and that occurred when the city did not have structural flood \nprotection. FEMA's action appears arbitrary, ignores the participation \nof its State partner, and would likely decrease property values and the \ntax base of the community, hampers economic development, and imposes \nunfair costs on thousands of people in the city of Grand Rapids. FEMA \nshould more thoroughly and accurately reassess flood risks using a \nrisk-based analysis to account for local conditions and incorporate \nprotection by the city's improved floodwalls, rather than ignoring \ntheir presence. I am hopeful that the managers will work with us in \nconference to address this unconscionable and unnecessary burden the \ncity of Grand Rapids and its citizens are facing.\n  I wish that no American had to worry about suffering damage from a \nnatural disaster, but it is a fact of nature that such damage can \nhappen. That is why it is important to do what we can to help property \nowners have adequate insurance. The goals of the National Flood \nInsurance Program are important, and reauthorizing and revamping this \nprogram is necessary. This bill represents a necessary step to ensure \nthat more at-risk property owners are protected while the cost of \ndisaster relief and adequate insurance is less of a burden to the \naverage taxpayer. Flooding is a risk that many communities face, and \nthe availability of flood insurance is important for ensuring that our \ncitizens can recover from any losses suffered. However, this must be \ndone in a way that does not unduly and unfairly burden our communities. \nI will continue to work to strengthen the National Flood Insurance \nProgram in a fair and responsible manner as it proceeds to conference.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the flood insurance claims resulting from the hurricane \n     season of 2005 will likely exceed all previous claims paid by \n     the National Flood Insurance Program;\n\n[[Page S4062]]\n\n       (2) in order to pay the legitimate claims of policyholders \n     from the hurricane season of 2005, the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency has borrowed over $20,000,000,000 from the \n     Treasury;\n       (3) the interest alone on this debt, is almost \n     $1,000,000,000 annually, and that the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency has indicated that it will be unable to pay \n     back this debt;\n       (4) the flood insurance program must be strengthened to \n     ensure it can pay future claims;\n       (5) while flood insurance is mandatory in the 100-year \n     floodplain, substantial flooding occurs outside of existing \n     special flood hazard areas;\n       (6) recent events throughout the country involving areas \n     behind man-made structures, known as ``residual risk'' areas, \n     have produced catastrophic losses;\n       (7) although such man-made structures produce an added \n     element of safety and therefore lessen the probability that a \n     disaster will occur, they are nevertheless susceptible to \n     catastrophic loss, even though such areas at one time were \n     not included within the 100-year floodplain; and\n       (8) voluntary participation in the National Flood Insurance \n     Program has been minimal and many families residing outside \n     the 100-year floodplain remain unaware of the potential risk \n     to their lives and property.\n\n     SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In this title, the following definitions \n     shall apply:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the \n     Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n       (2) National flood insurance program.--The term ``National \n     Flood Insurance Program'' means the program established under \n     the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4011 et \n     seq.).\n       (3) 100-year floodplain.--The term ``100-year floodplain'' \n     means that area which is subject to inundation from a flood \n     having a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any \n     given year.\n       (4) 500-year floodplain.--The term ``500-year floodplain'' \n     means that area which is subject to inundation from a flood \n     having a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in \n     any given year.\n       (5) Write your own.--The term ``Write Your Own'' means the \n     cooperative undertaking between the insurance industry and \n     the Flood Insurance Administration which allows participating \n     property and casualty insurance companies to write and \n     service standard flood insurance policies.\n       (b) Common Terminology.--Except as otherwise provided in \n     this title, any terms used in this title shall have the \n     meaning given to such terms under section 1370 of the \n     National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4121).\n\n     SEC. 104.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Commission on Natural \n     Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which struck the \n     United States in 2005, caused, by some estimates, in excess \n     of $200,000,000,000 in total economic losses;\n       (2) many meteorologists predict that the United States is \n     in a period of increased hurricane activity;\n       (3) the Federal Government and State governments have \n     provided billions of dollars to pay for losses from natural \n     catastrophes, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic \n     eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, droughts, \n     and other natural catastrophes;\n       (4) many Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to \n     obtain and afford property and casualty insurance coverage;\n       (5) some insurers are not renewing insurance policies, are \n     excluding certain risks, such as wind damage, and are \n     increasing rates and deductibles in some markets;\n       (6) the inability of property and business owners in \n     vulnerable areas to obtain and afford property and casualty \n     insurance coverage endangers the national economy and public \n     health and safety;\n       (7) almost every State in the United States is at risk of a \n     natural catastrophe, including hurricanes, earthquakes, \n     volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, \n     droughts, and other natural catastrophes;\n       (8) building codes and land use regulations play an \n     indispensable role in managing catastrophe risks, by \n     preventing building in high risk areas and ensuring that \n     appropriate mitigation efforts are completed where building \n     has taken place;\n       (9) several proposals have been introduced in Congress to \n     address the affordability and availability of natural \n     catastrophe insurance across the United States, but there is \n     no consensus on what, if any, role the Federal Government \n     should play; and\n       (10) an efficient and effective approach to assessing \n     natural catastrophe risk management and insurance is to \n     establish a nonpartisan commission to study the management of \n     natural catastrophe risk, and to require such commission to \n     timely report to Congress on its findings.\n\n     SEC. 203. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a nonpartisan Commission on Natural \n     Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance (in this title \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 204.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory \nquorum call is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 980, the Public Safety Employer-Employee \nCooperation Act, shall be brought to a close?\n  There is 2 minutes of debate, equally divided.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the legislation to provide a \nvoice for our public safety offices. We have spent a great deal of time \nin the Senate on homeland security, but the key to effective homeland \nsecurity is having effective firefighters, police officials, and first \nresponders. They are the individuals who are really protecting our \nhomeland. They are the ones who should have a voice in decisions \naffecting the security of our country. This legislation provides them \nwith that, to ensure greater safety and security for all Americans. I \nhope the Senate will support the cloture motion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, once again, we have one of those bills that \nhas never been to committee. I guess we are afraid to take labor issues \nto the Labor Committee. We ought to be able to review these things and \nwork on them as we do on other kinds of bills, but that is not \nhappening on the labor issues. We are just going to play ``gotcha'' \npolitics.\n  This bill will take longer than a minute or an hour or a day just to \ncover some of the flaws that are in this bill. Some of the things that \nhave shown up in the substitute bill never got introduced on this one. \nSo we can see how this doesn't work. This will affect all 50 States. \nThis is an opportunity for you to impose the will of the Federal \nGovernment on your State. I don't think you really want to do that. We \nneed to have a little bit more than a minute to discuss that.\n  I think the leadership is asking for people to vote for this \namendment. We have agreed that we would go to it right after lunch. \nThis isn't a matter of stalling out in the Senate; it is a matter of \ntrying to get the right decision made. I ask you to look at these \nthings. It ought to go to the Labor Committee so that reasonable \nsuggestions can be made.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 46 years ago, President Kennedy \ndesignated this week to honor our first responders, particularly police \nofficers who have lost their lives in the line of duty.\n  This week is National Police Week, and Thursday is National Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day. Here in Washington, DC, and across the country, \nour communities are honoring the contributions of their public safety \nofficers.\n  I think all of us in this body would agree that our police officers, \nour firefighters, paramedics, and all of our first responders are \nheroes. Their jobs are dangerous and they are extremely demanding. \nUnfortunately, they too often do not get the respect and gratitude they \ndeserve. And that is why I rise this afternoon to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Public Safety Employee-Employer Cooperation Act, which \nwould take a small step toward repaying that sacrifice.\n  In most States around the country, our police and firefighters have \nthe right to form unions. In fact, my brother was a firefighter in my \nhome State of Washington. He is a proud member of his local union. But \neven so, there are still several communities in which our first \nresponders do not have the ability to negotiate. They do not have the \nability to bargain for better wages or hours or working conditions or \nbenefits.\n  The bill we are considering on the Senate floor this afternoon would \nensure all of our first responders have the power to organize and stand \nfor their rights. And I believe it will make a real difference for our \npublic safety officers and for all of our communities.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg for their work on this \nlegislation. Their work truly has been a bipartisan effort, and I hope \nit is a sign the entire Congress is willing now to come together to \nensure our first responders have a right most workers in our country \nalready enjoy.\n  I believe this bill will make our police and fire departments \nstronger and our communities safer. Everyone in our communities gains \nwhen our police and firefighters are working together with their \nemployers. Having a voice in their work schedules, in their safety \nprocedures, in their pay scales and benefits helps our police and fire \ndepartments. It helps them improve safety and reduce the number of \ndeaths and injuries on the job, and it makes most departments more \nefficient. A department that is safer and more efficient is a \ndepartment that is then better able to respond to a crisis.\n  I believe there is another reason we as Members of Congress should \nvote now to guarantee the right for all first responders to organize. \nEver since the September 11 terrorist attacks, we have called on our \nfirst responders to play an even greater role in keeping our homeland \nsafe.\n  Increasingly, as every one of us knows, our police, our firefighters, \nour troopers, our paramedics are the eyes and ears on the ground in our \ncities, counties, and States where they serve, no matter how large or \nsmall their communities.\n  So I think as we ask our first responders to do more for our entire \nNation, we owe it to them to ensure that across the country they have \nthe same collective bargaining rights.\n  This bill is pretty simple. The new law would only affect States that \ndo not already allow their public safety forces to bargain \ncollectively. It does not set up a new system of legislation. In fact, \nit is designed to ensure States have as much freedom as possible to \ndecide how to implement this law. And it specifically allows States to \nkeep enforcing their right-to-work laws. States that are affected would \nhave 1 year to create a process for discussions with workers. If they \nhave not acted by then, the Federal Labor Relations Authority would \nestablish a way to give employees the ability to choose whether to form \na union.\n  And that is it. Unlike some of the false rumors you may have been \nhearing, it does not encourage police and firefighters to go on strike. \nIn fact, it specifically outlaws that. It does not require State and \nlocal governments to adopt any particular terms. It excludes our \nelected sheriffs and other policymakers, and it will not affect an \nemployee's right to work part-time or prevent them from volunteering.\n  In short, this bill would be very good for our first responders and \nvery good for our communities. But seeing this bill become law would \nnot only be a victory for our first responders, it would be the first \nmajor victory for organized workers in the last 7 years. Unions have \nforged the way for millions of working families to share in the \nprosperity they helped create. Unions have helped balance the \nrelationship between employers and employees. And they help to ensure \nthat working families get their fair share of the economic pie. I am \nvery proud to stand with working families to protect their right to \norganize and advocate for on-the-job safety, job security, and fair \npay.\n  As we recognize National Police Week, what better way to honor the \nsacrifice our police and other first responders have given us than by \nensuring they have the right to collectively bargain. Allowing our \nfirst responders to negotiate with their employers is the fair thing to \ndo, and it also happens to be the right thing to do.\n  I hope all of our colleagues will support them and our communities by \nsaying yes and passing this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my colleague from New York. I think \nhe would like to speak on this issue, and then we will continue to \nbalance off the speakers the best that we can to try to take into \nconsideration the Members' schedules.\n  But we thank the Senator from New York. If he is prepared to speak, \nwe would welcome his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am going to speak on this for a minute and then on one \nother issue that I mentioned to the Senator from Massachusetts. But \nfirst I thank him for his leadership.\n  The bottom line is, we have made progress in this country over the \nlast 100 years because workers gather and bargain. Simply because \nsomebody is in a life-threatening position, a position that saves \nlives--police and fire and emergency medical personnel--does not mean \nthey should be deprived of that right.\n  The rules might not be exactly the same, and this bill is cognizant \nof that, but at the same time, for a policeman, a firefighter, to have \nthe right to basically bargain and give his family a life with some \ndecency and some dignity is extremely important. So I thank the leader \nfrom the Health, Education and Labor and Pensions Committee for \nbringing this bill forward. I think it will mark real progress.\n  I think, again, those who put their lives on the line for us, police \nand fire, should not be penalized because they are in those \nprofessions. The right to bargain is an important one. Many State and \nlocal workers have it. It is something I supported my whole career. I \nam proud to be a supporter of this legislation. I thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for his leadership.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Schumer pertaining to the introduction of S.J. \nRes. 32 are located in todays Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nWyoming, Senator Enzi, for extending the courtesy, because we have had \nsome speakers on our side, out of respect for their schedules. We have \nwelcomed their comments at this time.\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\nBut I wish to refocus attention to the subject matter at hand, the \nmatter that is before the Senate, and to describe in greater detail \nthis legislation and the reasons for it and the support for this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  First, I commend the Senate for voting earlier today to take up the \nPublic Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act. The House passed this \nbill last July by an overwhelming vote of 314 to 97. The Cooperation \nAct isn't just about protecting union rights. This bill is vitally \nimportant to each and every American because, at its core, it is about \nsafety, the safety of our dedicated first responders and the safety of \nour Nation in this new era of heightened concerns about homeland \nsecurity. The bill takes a major step forward in protecting our \nfirefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians, and other \nfirst responders from danger on the job. Public safety workers are on \nthe front lines of our constant efforts to keep America safe. They are \nall on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, doing backbreaking, \ndifficult work, and doing it with great skill, great courage, and great \ndedication.\n  We have seen all too often how dangerous these jobs can be. These \ncharts illustrate the point. In 2006, more than 75,000 police officers \nwere injured in the line of duty. Last year, 140 police officers paid \nthe ultimate price and lost their lives in the line of duty. We see \nsimilar numbers with firefighters who put their lives on the line every \nday. In 2006, more than 83,000 firefighters were injured in the line of \nduty. Last year, 115 firefighters paid the ultimate price. Another 45 \nhave lost their lives so far this year. This is dangerous work, life-\nthreatening work. These are careers which men and women follow for \nyears with great courage, dedication, and commitment to the public \ninterest and to the families of America. Those are the individuals we \nare talking about with this legislation.\n  First responders can also face chronic long-term health problems as \nwell. The courageous firefighters who rushed to Ground Zero on 9/11 now \nsuffer from crippling health problems such as asthma, chronic \nbronchitis, back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, depression, and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder. They often pay the ultimate price. Last year \n250 public safety employees across the country lost their lives in the \nline of duty. Our public safety workers do not hesitate to rush into \nfires, wade into floods, put their lives on the line in other ways to \nprotect our homes, our families, and our communities. They know better \nthan anyone else what is needed to keep them as safe as possible on the \njob, and they deserve the right to have a voice in decisions that \nprofoundly affect their lives and their safety.\n  When governments and public safety workers are unable to cooperate \nthrough collective bargaining, the workers' lives are put at needless \nrisk. The numbers tell the story. Look at this chart. States without \ncollective bargaining, which is the underlying issue before the Senate \nwith this legislation, have 39 percent more fatalities. The reason \nprimarily is because firefighters know how to work in ways that can \nprotect the public and also can provide greater safety and security for \nthe firefighters and first responders and police officials as well, \nbased upon their experience, their knowledge of the task which is \nbefore them. Because of that, they are able to have a much better \nsafety record. That is basically what we are trying to share, that kind \nof experience, with the other firefighters and police officials and \nfirst responders in other parts of the country who don't have these \nkinds of protections.\n  Behind those numbers are the tragic stories of lives that could have \nbeen saved with better communication or better cooperation of effort. A \nheartbreaking example occurred last year in Charleston, SC. Here is the \nstory. In 2002, the Charleston firefighters association asked the city \nto begin following the National Fire Protection Association. That is an \norganization that makes recommendations with regard to safety and \nsecurity in fighting fires. Unfortunately, there was no mechanism to \nensure that these concerns could be heard and addressed. On June 18, \n2007, nine Charleston firefighters died in the line of duty. In October \nof 2007, an expert panel hired by the city to investigate the loss \nrecommended that the department begin following NFPA standards and \nbegin meeting with workers.\n  That was their recommendation after experiencing the loss of lives. \nAfterwards we wanted to try to establish a procedure to avoid those \nkinds of circumstances in the future. We will never know how many lives \nmight have been saved on that day in Charleston, if adequate safety \nstandards had been in place, but we do know that in many other fire \ndepartments across the country, critical discussions about safety \nshould be happening, but they are not. Unless public safety workers \nhave a voice on the job, these problems will never be fully and fairly \naddressed. Without the protection of collective bargaining, workers are \nafraid to speak out for fear they will face retaliation. These fears \nare well founded because of countless examples of brave and dedicated \nfirst responders who have been harshly punished for raising safety \nconcerns.\n\n  Consider the case of firefighter Stan Tinney of Odessa, TX. Here is \nhis situation. In 2001, Stan Tinney, president of the Firefighters \nAssociation of Odessa, TX published a newsletter critical of the fire \ndepartment's safety practices, including inadequate staffing and \nequipment. Tinney was suspended without pay, reprimanded, downgraded in \na performance evaluation, and it took a Federal court that later found \nthe Odessa officials violated Tinney's constitutional rights. It took a \nFederal case in order to do that. Think of all the other Stan Tinneys \naround the country who have been intimidated by that kind of action. We \ndon't need that. We need to have suggestions. We need ideas. We need \nrecommendations about how to protect our firefighters, our first \nresponders, and our police community.\n  Tinney and four of his coworkers, when this incident took place, were \nquestioned individually by city officials and Tinney was suspended \nwithout pay, reprimanded, and downgraded. A Federal court later found \nhis constitutional rights had been violated, and the city settled \nTinney's claim for $265,000. All that heartache and expense could have \nbeen avoided if there had been a mechanism in place for Tinney to \nexpress his concern. This legislation provides that.\n  The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act will give Stan \nTinney and countless others like him a voice in the decisions that \naffect their jobs, their health and safety, and their families. It will \ngive them a safer workplace, and, just as important, it will give them \na right to be treated with dignity and respect.\n\n  It is not just individual workers who will benefit from this \nimportant legislation. Enabling public safety workers and their \nemployers to work cooperatively together makes our entire Nation safer.\n  In the past decade, we have seen dramatic changes in the way we \nprotect our country. National security has become a local issue. Every \ncity and town in our country--large and small, urban and rural--now has \na vital role in keeping us safe from harm.\n  In this new and more dangerous world, State and local public safety \nworkers are being asked to play an even larger role. We have asked them \nto become true partners with Federal security agencies in protecting \nour country from threats, and these dedicated workers have risen to the \nchallenge. But year after year, we are failing to give them the support \nthey need to do their vital jobs as effectively as possible.\n  Giving these brave men and women the voice they deserve at the \nbargaining table will facilitate cooperation between public safety \nworkers and their employers. It will enable them to perform their jobs \nmore efficiently and effectively. The benefits are obvious, and we see \nthem in communities across the country that have already accepted the \nbasic principles of public safety cooperation.\n  Take the example of Annapolis, MD. Until recently, scheduling rules \nfor firefighters and paramedics in Annapolis, MD, often forced them--\nthese are the workers--to work 48-hour shifts, leaving workers \nvulnerable to exhaustion and dangerous mistakes. The local union worked \nwith management through collective bargaining to change scheduling \nrules, shortening\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\nshifts and improving safety for the workers and the public. It does not \nsound too complicated. It just sounds like common sense to me. And it \nsounds like an important step in order to provide greater safety and \nprotection for families in Annapolis. Workers there were concerned \nabout scheduling rules, and through a cooperative collective bargaining \nrelationship, the union worked with management to negotiate a new \nschedule that met the city's needs, while reducing the length of \nindividual shifts. These obvious changes resulted in better rested and \nmore effective firefighters and paramedics, with real benefits to both \nthe first responders and the communities they serve.\n  Such cooperation also gives State and local governments the \nflexibility they need to respond to changing circumstances.\n  Look at this chart. The economy in Tulsa, OK, was struggling after \nSeptember 11. Through collective bargaining, the mayor and the \nfirefighters agreed to defer payments into the firefighters' Health and \nWelfare Trust for 1 year. The deferral saved the city over $400,000, \nand the city was able to spread its repayment to the trust over a \nlonger period of time, providing valuable flexibility that helped the \ncity address its budget troubles--working together with the community \nand for the community, an important achievement and an important \naccomplishment.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that granting them collective bargaining \nrights will limit the ability of States and cities to respond \neffectively to an emergency. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nWe have seen, in the most dramatic illustration, that all 343 \nfirefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty on September 11 \nwere union members and with collective bargaining rights. There is no \nquestion about their courage, no question about their bravery, no \nquestion about their willingness to do their duty and do it heroically. \nWhen challenged, that has certainly been the evidence time-in and time-\nout. So we reject those suggestions and those observations.\n  In addition, for example, before 9/11, the Port Authority police \nofficers worked 8-hour days, with 2 days off, each week. After 9/11, \neveryone worked 12-hour shifts every day and all vacations and personal \ntime were canceled. This hard schedule continued for nearly 3 years, \nbut neither the union nor any union member filed a single grievance \nabout it. They did their duty, and they did it heroically.\n  Do we understand that? As to police officers for the Port Authority \nthat has responsibility in the greater port area in New York, before 9/\n11 they worked 8-hour days, with 2 days off, each week, and after 9/11 \neveryone worked 12-hour shifts every day and all vacations and personal \ntime were canceled. The hard schedule continued for nearly 3 years, and \nneither the union nor any union member filed a single grievance--not a \nsingle grievance--when they were called upon to meet their \nresponsibility--not a single grievance. They did their duty, and they \ndid it heroically.\n  Our families and communities deserve the best public safety services \nwe can possibly provide, and achieving that goal starts with the strong \nfoundation that comes with collective bargaining.\n  No one doubts that our communities and our country are living on \nborrowed time. We all hope the numerous other steps we are taking will \nbe successful in preventing similar catastrophic attacks. It makes no \nsense not to make the basic rights granted by this legislation \navailable to all of America's first responders. It is an urgent matter \nof public safety. I commend Senator Gregg for his leadership on this \nimportant issue, and I urge my colleagues to give our heroes the \nrespect and support they deserve by approving the Cooperation Act.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nKennedy and the other 31 cosponsors of the Public Safety Employer-\nEmployee Cooperation Act of 2007, as we begin discussion of this \nlegislation. The Cooperation Act would extend to firefighters, police \nofficers, and other public safety officials the right to discuss \nworkplace issues with their employers.\n  Each year, more than 80,000 police officers and 75,000 firefighters \nare injured protecting their communities. Not counting the tragic \nevents of September 11, it is estimated that 162 police officers and \n100 firefighters will lose their lives each year in the line of duty. \nThese extraordinary individuals selflessly risk injury, and sometimes \ntheir lives, to protect others, yet they remain the only sizable \nsegment of workers who do not have the combined right to enter into \ncollective bargaining agreements with their employers.\n  The Public Safety Employee-Employer Cooperation Act is balanced in \nits recognition of the unique situation and obligation of public safety \nofficers. The bill requires that, within 2 years of enactment, States \noffer public safety officers the ability to vote in a free and fair \nelection on whether to form and voluntarily join a union and \ncollectively bargain over hours, wages, and conditions of employment. \nThe bill only affects States which do not currently provide this \nopportunity, and those States would have 2 years to establish their own \ncollective bargaining systems that can meet their unique needs. This \napproach leaves the decisions regarding implementation, enforcement, \nand all other major details with the individual States and local \ngovernments, ultimately allowing them to have the final say over any \ncontract terms. Finally, under this legislation, States with right-to-\nwork laws, which prohibit employers and labor organizations from \nnegotiating labor agreements that require union membership or payment \nof union fees, can continue to implement those laws.\n  The legislation recognizes the need to put public safety first, so \nthe use of strikes, lockouts, sickouts, work slowdowns, or any other \naction that is designed to influence the terms of a proposed contract \nand that will disrupt the delivery of emergency services is strictly \nprohibited. It further protects small towns by ensuring that areas with \npopulations of less than 5,000 or fewer than 25 full time employees are \nexempt from collective bargaining and that firefighters or EMTs who are \nemployed by a department participating in collective bargaining \nagreements can still serve their local communities as volunteers.\n  Healthy labor-management partnerships result in improved public \nsafety for our towns and cities. The bipartisan Cooperation Act helps \nbuild these partnerships by putting firefighters, law enforcement \nofficials, and other public safety officers on much deserved equal \nfooting with other private and public sector employees and providing \nthem with the ability to negotiate with employers over basic workplace \nrights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to finally \ncomment on some of these things and to do my opening statement.\n  I do want to say I was a little surprised by the speech of the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer, about, primarily, the price of gas. \nI have to say, he has got it right. That is the biggest concern on the \nminds of people across this country. No matter what else we are talking \nabout, it is about the price of gas. What I learned from his speech is \nwe are going to be disrupted in this debate later today as the majority \nleader rule XIVs an energy bill.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Domenici for his work on putting \ntogether an energy bill which we had a vote on this morning. I really \nthink if that could have been voted on in pieces, a number of those \npieces would have passed and made a difference to this country.\n  I can see that the main thrust of the bill we are going to be \ninterrupted by later to take a look at is one to force Saudi Arabia to \nincrease their production by a million barrels a day or give up some \narms purchases from us.\n  Let's see, if we sell them arms--which I have not looked at enough to \nknow whether that is a good idea--we get some money back. When we force \nthem to do a million barrels a day, we give them $120 million a day. \nPart of that, which some people do not like, was ANWR. ANWR would \nproduce at least a million barrels of oil a day from the United States. \nWe would be paying people in the United States for the oil, not \nshipping it over to Saudi Arabia, and we have to worry about what they \nare going to do with the arms we sell them.\n  So I can understand they ought to be concerned about gas and are \nfinally\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\nconcerned about gas and are going to interrupt us to be concerned about \ngas, but we had a proposal this morning that should have gotten a \nlittle bit more consideration and some of those provisions put into \neffect so we could actually solve some of our energy problem.\n  Let's see now, we are going to put the burden on Saudi Arabia.\n  My first encounter with higher gas prices happened back in 1973. I \nwas president of the Wyoming Jaycees. We did some things to Saudi \nArabia they were not very pleased about, and they cut us off \ncompletely. That produced the biggest crisis in this country in my \nmemory. We had lines at the gas pumps. We had people who could not \ntransport goods. We had people who could not get gas. We were trying to \nfigure out ways to store gas should we ever get it again. It was \nbecause Saudi Arabia said: OK, if that is the way you are going to be, \nno oil.\n  Well, at any rate, I do not think we are carrying as big a stick on \nthis as we think we are. We need to be looking at a number of the \nsolutions.\n  Windfall profits tax--that was a good way for us to drive our \ncompanies overseas to do their work, to sell us oil. That does not \nbring down the price of oil. If I had my way, I would call the energy \ncompanies in. I would tell them I want to know what they are doing with \nhowever many billions of dollars worth of profit they are making. I \nwant to know about it weekly. And I would report to the American people \non a weekly basis. I do not suspect that would bring down the price of \noil. I do suspect that would bring up the investment in energy, all \nkinds of energy. We need to have that done.\n  So I do not mean to go on and on about this, but as long as we are \ngoing to be interrupted in our debate on public employees, I want to \nmake sure I have my say on it too.\n  Mr. President, I do rise today to voice my opposition to H.R. 980, \nthe so-called Public Employer-Employee Cooperation Act. The fact that \nthis bill has come to the Senate today is just another example of the \ncynical calculus of election-year politics. We are still doing \n``gotcha'' politics on this floor. How do I know that? I know we have \nnot passed a bill that did not go through committee--not just the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that I am the ranking \nmember of but the other committees. If it does not go through \ncommittee, it does not pass. But here we have an issue that I am told \nwas passed last July by the House. Do you know how many hearings we \nhave held on it? I looked back 4 years, and we have not had a hearing \non this one--not a hearing on it.\n  What we do at hearings is kind of invite people in to tell us some \nspecific points they want to make on a particular bill. Now, you will \nfind that I am not a very big proponent of hearings because the \nchairman--and I used to be the chairman--gets to invite all the people \nto the committee except one and the ranking member gets to invite one. \nThen, people from both sides show up to beat up on the other witnesses. \nThat is not very productive.\n  We did switch to a system, occasionally, where we have had \nroundtables. Roundtables are a little bit different than hearings. With \nroundtables, you invite in 10, 15, 20 people who have actually done \nsomething in the area, and you hear what the problems are and what the \nadvantages are, and after all of them have spoken, then they interact \nwith each other. They are not Senators asking clever questions. They \ninteract with each other on ways their ideas fit with somebody else's \nidea. They come up with some good legislation.\n  Now, we have not ever had hearings--or roundtables on this issue. So \nhow do you know what is really a good idea? How do you know what the \neffect is going to be on other people when you do not do anything to \nprepare for it and then you bring it right to the floor?\n  Another advantage of going through committee is that you can find out \nwhat the concerns are from the amendments when it gets to the markup \nprocess. From those amendments, you can say: Well, this might be a good \nidea, but we have to revise it a little bit. People go off and work on \nthat part of the idea, and they bring it back in a workable fashion \nthat will fit that both sides agree on.\n  You say it cannot be done on labor issues? Well, in the past we have. \nWe passed a mine safety bill through here in less than 6 weeks, and it \npassed unanimously in the Senate, and it passed unanimously in the \nHouse. That is how we did it. We did it through the committee process. \nNow, that was the first change in mining law in 28 years, but it was \ndone cooperatively, and it was done through the committee process.\n  This one has, I guess, purposely circumvented the regular order of \nthe Senate and its committee process because the scrutiny of that \nprocess would expose some multiple flaws in the legislation. We are \ngoing to have some amendments that will point out what some of the \nflaws are in this legislation. Now, it is very difficult to do it here. \nI have to put in an amendment, and we kind of vote it up or we vote it \ndown. We cannot go off and work it out so it is agreeable to both \nsides. It is a difficult process, especially when you involve 100 \npeople with it. It is much easier to do it in committee.\n  So we have this bill, and once again we are going to play the \nelection-year spin, going to do sound bites, probably do a lot of \npress. But I suspect the result may be the same as other things that \ndid not go through committee.\n  Now, their calculation is simple: Since this bill involves unions \nthat organize among police and firefighters, they will continue to \nsimply claim that anyone who opposes this bill is against police and \nfirefighters. You have already heard it.\n  Let's address that calculated untruth first. There is no one I know \nof--Republican or Democrat, supporter or opponent of this bill--who \ndoes not respect and value the work and dedication of our police, our \nfirefighters, and other first responders. Their contributions to our \ncommunities are immeasurable, and our support for them is unwavering. \nHowever, this bill provides no benefit to any police officer, \nfirefighter, or first responder. It does not provide a dime in Federal \nmoney to any State, city, or town to hire or to train or to equip any \nadditional public safety personnel. In fact, it only imposes costs that \nwill make that result less likely.\n  The bill does not contain a dime of Federal money or a word of \nlanguage that would increase the pay or benefits of any firefighter, \npolice officer or first responder or that would enhance their working \nconditions or that would make their job safer or make their retirement \nmore secure. It only imposes totally unfunded costs on States, cities, \nand towns that will make those rules less--not more--likely.\n  Plain and simple, the only direct beneficiaries of this legislation \nare labor unions. This bill does nothing more than open new markets for \nunions, and it provides them with the opportunity for increased revenue \nfrom new dues-paying members. This bill does nothing for any police \nofficer, firefighter or first responder, except to provide them with \nthe dubious opportunity to share a portion of their paycheck with the \nlabor union.\n  The real truth is there is absolutely nothing inconsistent about \nbeing fully supportive of our local police and firefighters and first \nresponders and totally opposed to this bill. A vote against this bill \nis not a vote against first responders. Proponents of this bill would \nserve both the debate and themselves better by abandoning any absurd \nclaims to the contrary. The public is simply not that gullible, and I \nthink the public is fed up with a Congress that transparently panders \nto special interests, while trying to tell the rest of the world they \nare acting in everybody's interests. The old song is out of tune, but \nas long as some continue to sing it, there shouldn't be any surprise \nabout the fact that the public opinion of Congress is at an all-time \nlow.\n  Let me now turn for a moment to some of the serious and fundamental \nproblems with this legislation. Over 70 years ago, the Congress passed \nwhat is now referred to as the National Labor Relations Act. That \nlegislation has been amended numerous times over the many decades of \nexistence, and it has become universally recognized as the embodiment \nof our national labor policy. A hallmark of that policy for eight \ndecades has been the well-reasoned principle that the employment and\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\nlabor relations between a State, city or town and its own employees \nshould not be a matter of Federal law, but a matter of local law. That \nbedrock principle is not only rooted in our national labor policy; it \nis firmly fixed in our Constitution and our traditions of federalism. \nFor more than 70 years, Congress has repeatedly and consistently \nexcluded State and local labor relations from Federal control and \nintervention. Yet today the proponents of this bill seek to overturn \nthis hallmark principle and to radically change decades of unbroken \nFederal law and policy. The enormity of this change is only matched by \nthe prospect that it could occur in the wake of an appalling lack of \nthought, total disregard for the processes of the Senate, and complete \nabsence of any meaningful opportunity for rational debate.\n  This body has before it a bill that would overturn more than 70 years \nof unbroken precedent and law. It would raise profound constitutional \nissues. It would overturn law in a majority of States--in a majority of \nStates--and completely reverse the fundamental and founding principle \nof our national labor policy. You would think the Senate would consider \nsuch a bill only after careful examination and due deliberation. But if \nyou do think that way, sadly, you are wrong. This legislation, as I \nsaid, has not had a Senate committee hearing or markup this Congress. I \nlooked back 4 years. I could not find a single hearing or markup on \nthis bill. There has been no meaningful exploration by the HELP \nCommittee this Congress of the important issues that this legislation \nimplicates. This bill grants enormous power over States to a virtually \nunknown Federal agency that will make critical decisions about these \npeople. Yet we have never so much as asked a representative sampling of \nState officials about their views, nor have we ever informally asked \nthe Federal agency involved if it feels up to the job we are about to \nimpose on it. These shortcomings alone are ample proof that this bill \nis being pushed not because it is good policy but only because we see \nit as expedient politics in an election year.\n  This bill would require that every State, every city, and every town \nwith more than 5,000 residents would open its police, firefighters, and \nfirst responders to unionization. It would impose as Federal mandate--\nnot in the absence of any State consideration of this issue but in \ndirect opposition to the legislative will of several States.\n  Proponents of this legislation have attempted to maintain the fiction \nthat it actually does little to disturb State laws--a good way to pass \na bill, I guess, but not true. It is simply not the case. Within the \nlast 2 legislative sessions, some 13 States have officially considered \nand rejected legislative proposals similar to the law that would be \nfederally imposed under H.R. 980. The proponents of this legislation \nhave attempted to maintain the fiction that it wouldn't disturb State \nlaws. Nothing could be further from the truth. Every expert who has \nreviewed this law has concluded it is clearly in conflict with the \ncurrent law in at least 22 States, and the chart shows the 22 States. \nSome believe the number is as high as 26, and even the bill proponents \nfreely concede it is at least 21. All of these States, their citizens, \nand their legislatures have expressly considered all the issues raised \nin this bill and have decided on a different approach--a different \napproach--than what would be required under this bill. Some States have \ndecided to use meet-and-confer laws. Some have placed limits on the \nenforceability of agreements. Some have limited the subjects of \nbargaining. Some have made the issue one of local option, and some have \ndecided to limit bargaining by employee function.\n  States, cities, and towns have done what they think best to provide \nfor the safety and welfare of their own citizens in developing their \nlabor relations policy for their own public safety employees. Yet we \npropose to clearly overturn the democratic judgment of at least 22 \nStates through this legislation.\n  Let's be clear. We would take this action not because States have not \nacted; that is not the case. All these States made a conscious, \ndemocratic decision about what is best for their citizens. In fact, \nsome 16 of these States have considered and rejected laws similar to \nH.R. 980 within the last few years.\n  Now, the impact, however, doesn't end there. Experts who have \nreviewed this legislation and existing State laws have identified at \nleast 12 States where this bill would raise serious legal questions \nabout one or more aspects of their existing collective bargaining law. \nYou can see those filled in on the chart. These are States that \nsupposedly have full collective bargaining statutes. Remember: The \nquestion of whether an existing State law complies with the \nrequirements of H.R. 980 is going to be figured out later by a little-\nknown Federal agency--the Federal Labor Relations Authority--that is \ndevoid of any experience in State labor relations and isn't accountable \nto a single State government. I am sure all the technical and legal \nissues left unclear by this bill, which bear on whether a State law \ncomplies, will keep an awful lot of lawyers busy for a long time and \nguarantee a huge expansion of the Federal labor relations authority.\n  Now, the effect of this bill, however, goes beyond the States where \nthe law is clearly overturned and where it is probably overturned and \nwhere the lawyers will fight about whether it is overturned. By \nfederalizing State labor relations, this bill will affect every State, \ncity, and town in the country. As a matter of State law, States have \nthe authority to effectively take items off the union bargaining table. \nMany States with collective bargaining laws already do this, \nparticularly in the area of public safety. Manning and staffing levels, \ntraining and job requirements, deadly force rules, drug testing, merit \npay, job requirements, and promotion are a few of the examples of the \nterms and conditions of employment which must be bargained but could be \nexempted from bargaining by State action or a law. Now, once you \nfederalize this law, States will lose that authority.\n  Look closely at both the Senate and the House language of this bill. \nIt specifically lists only three things a State can exempt or take off \nthe bargaining table: pension, retirement benefits, and in one version, \nhealth insurance. Everything else is on the table. That will be the \nFederal law over which a State can do nothing.\n  This is a critical problem for every State. States can't be \nresponsible for the safety of their citizens when the Federal \nGovernment takes away the authority they need to accomplish the job. \nHere is one example. Suppose a State decides to implement mandatory \ndrug testing for public safety officers. It can't just do that under \nFederal law if H.R. 980 passes. Any change such as that would require \nbargaining. Why would we ever require that any State, city or town \nbargain or horse trade over matters of public safety?\n\n  If you don't think this is a real problem, you need only look at \ntoday's paper. The city of Boston has for years sought to negotiate a \ndrug-testing provision with its public safety union. Despite incidents \nof documented and suspected drug use by Active-Duty personnel, the city \nhas not been able to implement a program. We have seen the same pattern \nreflected in the utterly shameful situation in Major League Baseball \nand the inability to achieve any meaningful resolution, despite years \nand years and years of collective bargaining. Now, here is the \ndifference: Baseball is a game; public safety isn't.\n  So let us be completely clear about what we propose doing with this \nlegislation. Any vote that advances this bill is a vote to overturn the \nlaw and the democratic will of citizens of a near majority of our \nStates. Let me say that again. Any vote that advances this bill is a \nvote to overturn the law and the democratic will of the citizens of a \nnear majority of our States to create unnecessary question and \nlitigation over the validity of law in many other States and to forever \ntie the hands and limit the authority of every State to protect the \nsafety of its citizens as it sees best. This legislation is not only \ndirectly contrary to over 70 years of Federal labor policy; it further \nviolates the most fundamental, centuries-long principles of federalism \nand most likely runs completely afoul of the U.S. Constitution to boot.\n  With all this in mind, we should be asking ourselves: What price is \nthis Congress willing to pay in an effort to ingratiate itself to \norganized labor?\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\nEarlier this year, Congress transparently pandered to the special \ninterests of organized labor and came perilously close to depriving \nworkers of their democratic right to a secret ballot in deciding the \nquestion of unionization. Now we are at it again. This time, however, \nthe price of congressional pandering is the sovereign authority of \nStates and the integrity of their democratic process.\n  Since even these compelling facts are unlikely to stand in the way of \npolitics, we need to look at the legislation itself. Since it has not \nbeen discussed and has not been marked up in the committee of \njurisdiction, I suppose at least a few moments of legislative \nconsideration is better than none at all.\n  In no particular order, here are a few of the multiple and fatal \ndrafting and policy problems of this bill:\n  First, this bill is the height of hypocrisy by the Federal \nGovernment. This bill would require States, cities, and towns over \n5,000 to provide full collective bargaining for all their public safety \nemployees. However, while requiring this of States, cities, and towns, \nthe Federal Government would continue to exempt itself from any \ncollective bargaining obligation with regard to many of its public \nsafety employees.\n  Let's see. We are going to tell States, cities, and towns what to do, \nbut we don't tell ourselves what to do. That sounds like hypocrisy to \nme.\n  Second, this law would require States to bargain over wages of their \ncovered employees. However, the Federal Government routinely exempts \nitself from bargaining over wages with its employees.\n  I wonder how many Senators bargain with their staff? Moreover, this \nbill would severely limit--in fact, virtually eliminate--the right of \nState governments to determine the appropriate subjects for bargaining \nwith their employees--a right fully retained by the Federal Government \nwith regard to its employees.\n  Third, this legislation forces collective bargaining on States but \ndoesn't require or ensure fundamental employee rights. For example, \nFederal law preserves the right of the workers in the private sector to \ndecide the issue of unionization by secret ballot. However, this \nlegislation, which imposes collective bargaining on unwilling States, \ncities, towns, and their employees, not only fails to guarantee the \nright to a secret ballot in union elections, it specifically ratifies \nand approves State laws that strip public sector workers from this \nfundamental democratic right.\n  Fourth, this legislation is a gift to organized labor that comes with \nnone of the obligations or safeguards of other federally mandated \nbargaining. Unionized workers, under current Federal law, have the \nright to information about their union's finances, and those unions \nmust publicly report on their finances every year. This bill would \nforce unions on States, cities, and towns but would not require union \nfinancial transparency or require that workers have access to this \nfinancial data.\n  Fifth, this is the gift that keeps on giving. Not only is there no \nrequirement about union financial reporting and disclosure in this \nbill, this bill also fails to contain any guarantees to the workers \nabout how their union dues money can be spent. For example, workers \nunionized under current Federal law cannot be required to contribute to \na union's favorite political causes. This bill, which forces collective \nbargaining on States, cities, and towns that have rejected it contains \nno such guarantee.\n  Sixth, this bill would not only fail to provide any meaningful \nguarantee against the disruption of municipal services because of labor \ndisputes, it practically guarantees the right of unions to cause those \ndisruptions. The bill purports to have no strike guarantee. However, it \ngoes to great pains to say it is not a strike when a public safety \nofficer refuses ``to carry out services that are not mandatory \nconditions'' of their employment.\n  What does that mean? Who decides which duties of a firefighter or \npolice officer or public safety officer--that is a pretty broad title--\nare ``mandatory''? This provision appears to be nothing more than \nlegislative code words specifically authorizing ``work to rule'' and a \nhost of other types of disruptive job actions that have become all too \nfamiliar among public school teacher unions. This bill forces unions on \nunwilling cities and towns, and then gives those unions a legislative \ngreen light to disrupt municipal services.\n  Finally, there is the enormous problem in this legislation that \nrelates to volunteer firefighters. It is no secret that the \nInternational Association of Firefighters, the principal firefighter \nunion in this country, actively opposes the use of voluntary fire \ndepartments. It has consistently sought to prevent its members from \nvolunteering their services. Its own union constitution provides for \nthe discipline, fining, or discharge of members who do. The most \neffective way this union has to prohibit volunteering or, as they refer \nto it, ``two-hatting,'' is the union contract clause to that effect. \nThey have sought and obtained this kind of clause in union contracts \nacross the country and want to make sure they can continue to do so \nunder H.R. 980.\n  Now, there is a clause in there that may be referred to. If you look \nat it, it is ``weasel'' words. It does not do what it is purported to \ndo, and it will eliminate volunteer fire departments.\n  Members are being told this problem with the bill has been ``fixed.'' \nThat is wrong. It is not. If you really wanted to make sure unions had \nno authority to kill off volunteer firefighting, you could write a \nplain provision that does exactly that. Instead, both the House and \nSenate versions use convoluted, double negative, lawyer speak in a \ndeceptive effort to claim that the problem is solved. I guarantee you \nthat it is not. Once you unwind the language, you will find both the \nHouse and Senate versions of the bill leave the door wide open to an \nall-out union assault on the use of volunteer firefighters.\n  In 25 States, volunteer firefighters account for all or most of the \nstaffing in more than 90 percent of the departments statewide. In 14 \nStates, volunteers account for all or most of the staffing in more than \n80 percent of the departments. With just two exceptions, in the \nremaining 11 States, volunteers account for all or most of the staffing \nin more than 60 percent of the departments. No State can provide fire \nprotection in its cities, towns, and rural districts without volunteer \nfirefighters. Anyone who even considers advancing this legislation \nought to be completely sure that it could not have a negative effect in \ntheir State.\n  These problems represent only the tip of the iceberg. This bill is \nquite simply a prime example of terrible policy being badly executed, \nwithout process.\n  Mr. President, I want to bring up another point regarding this \nlegislation that is also of critical importance. This bill imposes an \nenormous unfunded Federal mandate on States, cities, and towns across \nthe country. I want to take a minute and address this serious concern \nnot only from my current position as a Senator but from my former \nposition as mayor of Gillette, WY, a city of about 22,000 people.\n  As I look around the Chamber, not many here have had any experience \nwith trying to balance the budget of a city or town. So I guess we \nshould understand why they would pay so little attention to the very \nreal financial consequences of their actions on thousands of \nmunicipalities. They ought to.\n  Just last week, after teetering on the brink of insolvency, the city \nof Vallejo, CA, finally declared bankruptcy. Everyone has acknowledged \nthat the cause of Vallejo's financial problems was plain and simple: \nThe spiraling costs of their police and firefighter labor agreements.\n  Vallejo is not alone. In the last few years, a number of other cities \nand towns have teetered on the brink or actually have been forced into \nbankruptcy: McCall, ID; Toledo, OH; Marion, MS; Moffet, OK; Duluth, \nMN--just to name a few.\n  Now, what we usually don't realize in this body is those bodies don't \nget to print their own money. They actually have to work with the \nrevenue that comes in. Most of them have severe limitations on the \nability to raise money. They could not raise taxes if they wanted to. \nSo the revenue is limited, but the costs go up. What do you do?\n  Here is the reality. Without regard to pay or benefits, just the \nadministrative costs alone of collective bargaining represent a very \nsignificant line item\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\nthat Congress now proposes to force on States, cities, and towns. \nTowns, particularly small ones, that currently don't have the resources \nto negotiate and administer multiple collective bargaining agreements \nmust now hire and pay for these additional services. And this isn't \njust going to be one; it is multiple.\n  Towns and cities that do not devote the long hours of municipal time \nto the complicated process of bargaining and overseeing multiple union \ncontracts and to administering contract provisions and resolving \ndisputes under a collective bargaining system will be required to spend \nthat time. Nobody should be fooled. Those additional manpower and \nmanhour requirements are enormously costly and burdensome. This bill \nwould impose those costs by Federal mandate but would not provide a \nsingle penny of Federal money to help offset those costs. Make no \nmistake, the Congress is proposing to buy organized labor a free lunch \nand stick America's small towns with the bill.\n  As a former mayor and as the only accountant in the Senate, I remind \nmy colleagues about the cold realities of municipal finance. If you \nincrease municipal costs, you have only two ways to meet those \nincreased costs: You either increase revenues or decrease services. \nThis bill will unquestionably place many municipalities in \nthat difficult position of choosing between raising State and local \ntaxes, which they probably would not have the capability to do, or \ndecreasing and eliminating local municipal services, which they don't \nwant to do.\n\n  Are the Members of this body so completely out of touch with the real \nneeds of their constituents and the real fiscal problems that their \ncities and towns face every day that they would impose these \nunnecessary costs and burdens? With stagnant or declining property \nvalues and an endless parade of increasingly fixed costs, don't our \ncities and towns have enough on their plate without the Federal \nGovernment imposing yet another cost on them?\n  This isn't an imaginary problem. Remember Vallejo, CA, and the other \ncities and towns I mentioned across the country that make it clear that \nthis problem is very real.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. President, I am opposed to H.R. 980. I \nurge my colleagues to vote no on this legislation. Hopefully, we will \nhave a chance to make some corrections to this bill--particularly on \nthe flaws that I have pointed out.\n  I will just recap. It didn't go to committee. It is an unprecedented \nintrusion by the Federal Government. It directly overturns existing \nlaws in 22 States. It casts doubt on a dozen more. Sixteen States have \nrecently considered and rejected legislation very much like this. It \ncalls into question the constitutionality. We had no hearing or markup. \nIt creates unfunded mandates. It would impose costs on small towns.\n  I don't know how many of you think 5,000 is a big city. Actually, in \nWyoming it is; 3,500 is considered a first-class city. But 5,000 is not \na very big town, and there isn't as much expertise.\n  I mention that another piece of the bill says the requirement is \nimposed when there are 25 employees. It doesn't say 25 public safety \nemployees. It doesn't say 25 people who would be covered by this. It \nsays a flat 25. I suspect there are a lot smaller towns than 5,000 that \nhave 25 employees. That is a pretty small amount. That is not the same \nas public safety employees. So they either have to cut services or \nraise taxes or the city is going into bankruptcy.\n  The bill doesn't contain any worker protection for them getting to \nvote on whether they will have a union, and it puts in charge a little \nknown Federal agency. Again, it is pretty hypocritical of us. We have \nnot imposed this on the Federal Government, but we are willing to \nimpose it on the little places back home. I think we will regret it, \nand it will remind us of the mistake we made here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend from Utah. We did have \nthree speakers on our side, and we are going to do the best we can to \nbalance it. I think the Senator's side is next. How long does the \nSenator from Utah wish to speak? Then I will ask that the Senator from \nNew York to follow.\n  Mr. HATCH. I can probably do it in less than 10 minutes or around \nthat.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey be recognized for 20 minutes following Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4755 to Amendment No. 4751\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I believe my amendment No. 4755 is at the \ndesk. I call it up and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4755.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for a public safety officer bill of rights)\n\n       At the end of section 2, add the following:\n       (5) Public safety officers frequently endanger their own \n     lives to protect the rights of individuals in their \n     communities. In return, each officer deserves the optimal \n     protection of his or her own rights under the law.\n       (6) The health and safety of the Nation and the best \n     interests of public security are furthered when employees are \n     assured that their collective bargaining representatives have \n     been selected in a free, fair and democratic manner.\n       (7) An employee whose wages are subject to compulsory \n     assessment for any purpose not supported or authorized by \n     such employee is susceptible to job dissatisfaction. Job \n     dissatisfaction negatively affects job performance, and, in \n     the case of public safety officers, the welfare of the \n     general public.\n\n     SEC. 2A. PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER BILL OF RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State law described in section 4(a) \n     shall--\n       (1) provide for the selection of an exclusive bargaining \n     representative by public safety officer employees only \n     through the use of a democratic, government-supervised, \n     secret ballot election upon the request of the employer or \n     any affected employee;\n       (2) ensure that public safety employers recognize the \n     employees' labor organization, freely chosen by a majority of \n     the employees pursuant to a law that provides the democratic \n     safeguards set forth in paragraph (1), to agree to bargain \n     with the labor organization, and to commit any agreements to \n     writing in a contract or memorandum of understanding; and\n       (3) provide that--\n       (A) no public safety officer shall, as a condition of \n     employment, be required to pay any amount in dues or fees to \n     any labor organization for any purpose other than the direct \n     and demonstrable costs associated with collective bargaining; \n     and\n       (B) a labor organization shall not collect from any public \n     safety officer any additional amount without full disclosure \n     of the intended and actual use of such funds, and without the \n     public safety officer's written consent.\n       (b) Applicability of Disclosure Requirements.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any labor \n     organization that represents or seeks to represent public \n     safety officers under State law or this Act, or in accordance \n     with regulations promulgated by the Federal Labor Relations \n     Authority, shall be subject to the requirements of title II \n     of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 \n     (29 U.S.C. 432 et seq.) as if such public safety labor \n     organization was a labor organization defined in section 3(i) \n     of such Act (29 U.S.C. 402(i)).\n       (c) Application.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the provisions of this section shall apply to all \n     States.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, many of my colleagues have spoken about the \ntremendous service America's public safety employees give to the \npublic. I could not agree more. Any given day one of these officers may \nbe asked to put his or her life on the line, and they will do so \nwillingly and courageously. I agree with my colleagues that individuals \nwho choose these careers deserve respect, gratitude, and special \ntreatment. But the bill we are considering today would actually result \nin diminishing the rights of public safety employees who are not \ncurrently unionized.\n  Once a workforce is unionized, even employees who don't wish to be \npart of a union will have pay deducted from their paychecks, spent in a \nmanner outside of their control, and they will have very little ability \nto question or alter the legal representation that has been established \nwith or without their support.\n  My amendment seeks merely to balance that diminution of self-\ndetermination by establishing a Public Employee Bill of Rights.\n  This amendment would do three things: Guarantee the right to vote by\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\nsecret ballot, limit the right of public unions' dues collection \nauthority to nonpolitical uses, and allow financial transparency.\n  By ensuring that public safety employees in all States have the right \nto vote on whether to unionize by secret ballot, my amendment \nguarantees for public safety employees that same right private \nemployees now have. In a democratic society, nothing is more sacred \nthan the right to vote, and it is undeniable that nothing ensures truly \nfree choice more than the use of a private ballot.\n  The possibility of coercive or threatening behavior toward employees \nwho may not wish to form a union is even more concerning in the context \nof public safety employees who rely on coworkers to reduce the deadly \nrisks they face routinely in the course of their important work.\n  The amendment would also limit the right of public unions' dues \ncollection authority to nonpolitical uses. Those who choose public \nservice often accept lower pay than they might make in the private \nsector because they are dedicated to public service. Let's not insult \nthat choice by allowing labor bosses to take money from that paycheck \nand spend it on purely political causes the employee does not support.\n  I believe public employees should have the same protections from \nfraud and abuse as private employees. My amendment would empower public \nemployees by allowing them to observe how their dues are being spent \nand the other financial dealings of their unions. It does this by \nbringing public unions under the requirements of the Labor Management \nReporting and Disclosure Act, a 1959 law enacted with bipartisan \nsupport, including then-Senator John F. Kennedy.\n  Public employees who pay union dues, especially those who are \ncompelled to do so against their wishes, are no less entitled to \nfinancial transparency and fraud protections than the private sector \nemployees covered under the law today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is a simple \namendment. It provides for protections that ought to be there. If this \nbill should pass, these protections, at a minimum, ought to be part of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we will recognize the Senator from New \nJersey, but if he will yield a minute.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we want to permit others to speak. I will \nspeak in a short time in response to my friend and colleague from \nWyoming. If this legislation did what he suggested it did, I would not \nbe a sponsor or support the legislation either. I will go into some \ndetail in explaining what the legislation does do and what it doesn't \ndo.\n  With regard to the Senator from Utah, this issue about having a \nsecret ballot or nonsecret ballot, we leave up to the States. Rather \nthan trying to mandate that--a lot has been talked about giving the \nStates options as to how to proceed. We say on both items the Senator \naddressed that the States are the ones that should make the judgment \nand determinations.\n  We will have a longer time to debate this issue.\n  I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, let me first say I appreciate the \nSenator from Massachusetts and his leadership in this regard. I have \ncome to the floor not only to acknowledge his leadership on this \ncritical piece of legislation but to speak strongly in support of the \nPublic Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act. For me, this bill is \nabout protecting some of the most basic fundamental rights of America's \nbravest and finest public servants. Our Nation's first responders put \ntheir lives on the line every day. That sometimes only comes vividly to \nus when we lose one of those brave men and women and their lives are \nlost in the line of duty, but the reality is they are at risk every \nday, risking everything they have to protect us, to protect complete \nstrangers, to protect their communities. At a moment's notice, they are \non call to respond to natural and manmade disasters of every size, \nscope, and severity. These men and women are firefighters, emergency \nmanagement technicians, police officers, and first responders who are \nprepared day in and day out to go to any length to save the life of a \ncomplete stranger.\n  They have one goal: to keep others safe. In those moments, they don't \nthink about anything else. As they rush to respond to a fire, they are \nnot thinking about their job security. As they risk their life in a \ncollapsing building, they are not doing it in return for a higher wage. \nAs they put themselves into harm's way, they are not thinking about the \nbenefits their family might receive if the worst should happen.\n  In 2006, more than 75,000 police officers were injured in the line of \nduty, and last year 140 police officers paid the ultimate price and \nlost their lives in the line of duty. In 2006, more than 83,000 \nfirefighters were injured in the line of duty, and 115 firefighters \npaid the ultimate price. This year alone, another 45 have lost their \nlives.\n  Today we have an opportunity to thank these selfless heroes, not just \nwith our words but with our actions. We have an opportunity to \nguarantee the rights of those who work to protect our lives and safety \nevery day. In short, we have an opportunity to fix what is wrong and do \nwhat is right.\n  This legislation simply gives first responders the same right that \nvirtually all Americans enjoy: the right to collectively bargain and \nhave a voice about their working conditions, to come together in common \ncause to achieve a better standard.\n  A majority of the States already confer this right of collective \nbargaining, including my home State of New Jersey. This bill would give \npublic safety officers across the country that right. It would ensure \nif they choose--if they choose--they can join a union and bargain over \nwages, hours, and working conditions.\n  I was a former mayor. I did not have the challenges of having a \nunionized police force and firefighting force that ultimately worked in \ncontradiction to the interests of my municipality. I did not. \nCertainly, in the urbanized context in which I was, that was a bigger \nchallenge than others. So the reality is I do not believe the right to \ncollectively organize automatically means the dire consequences that \nsome have portrayed as it relates to this legislation.\n  In New Jersey, we recognize how important it is for first responders \nto have a strong working relationship with the municipalities they \nserve. We recognize these public safety officers deserve the dignity \nand respect to have a say in their wages, hours, and working \nconditions. And we recognize that when public safety employers and \nemployees work together, the results serve us extremely well.\n  Some of my colleagues will try to argue this legislation will hurt \nvolunteer firefighters by limiting the amount of time professionals can \nvolunteer while off duty. We have volunteer firefighters in New Jersey \nalongside those who are organized at the same time, and that has not \nsimply been the case. This is simply incorrect, as the legislation \nspecifically forbids any State from putting limits on professional \nfirefighters who volunteer during their off-duty hours.\n  Others are saying this legislation could effectively repeal State \nright-to-work laws. Again, this legislation specifically allows States \nto enforce right-to-work laws. The bill makes no change in States that \nhave right-to-work laws and would not prevent any other States from \nadopting new right-to-work laws.\n  Let's be honest about what the bill actually does say. It does not \ndictate how States should approach this issue. The bill only requires \nlocal governments to engage in negotiations if workers choose to join a \nunion. It respects the authority of local legislative bodies to approve \nor disapprove funding for any negotiated agreement. The bill only \naffects States that do not already provide their public safety officers \nwith the right to bargain collectively. States that do not have these \nprotections can choose to establish their own collective bargaining \nsystems.\n  I hope we realize what is at stake here. Beyond fairness, which is \nsomething which is fundamentally important, particularly for those who \nrisk\n\n[[Page S4081]]\n\ntheir lives every day, we are talking about safety. In States where \nthere are not collective bargaining protections for workers, fatalities \nare 39 percent higher. That is a fact. In States where there is not \ncollective bargaining opportunities, fatalities are 39 percent higher.\n  The fact is, greater protections for workers lead to better safety \nconditions. We have seen this time and time again in which the \nnegotiation--some people think it is only about money. It is not just \nabout money. When I was a mayor, some of the most significant \nnegotiations were about the standard under which you operated, which \nwas not only important as it related to the firefighter or the police \nofficer but was important as it related to the response time and the \nability to perform the services that ultimately saved property and \nsaved lives.\n  Some people think this is all about simply money and making more and \nhaving better benefits. A lot of it is about working conditions and the \nnature of how one, in fact, applies their profession in a way that not \nonly saves lives of those who serve--firefighters and police officers--\nbut also saves the lives of those they were sworn to protect because \nthey had a better system--breathing apparatus, having the technology to \nenter into a fire and being able to detect someone who has been \nimmobilized. Often that negotiation was not about money but about can \nwe have this equipment that is essential for us to perform our duty in \nbehalf of those we are sworn to serve.\n  It seems to me we have to understand there is a direct correlation \nbetween the benefits that often are on the negotiating table to \ncitizens, not only to those who serve but to citizens in terms of \nhaving greater lifesaving capabilities--for me as a mayor, that was \noften what I heard the negotiations being about. I thought it was \nexemplary, that we were negotiating over how do we better save lives at \nthe end of the day.\n  Any time we can have the reality that more lives are saved because, \nin fact, the collective bargaining system allows us to create \ncircumstances under which not only the workplace and the profession, \nbut the lives of the citizens of those communities are saved, is worthy \nof achieving.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I always appreciate hearing from the Senator from New \nJersey. I hope our colleagues will listen carefully to what the Senator \nfrom New Jersey has said because he comes to this debate as a former \nmayor. Mayors, as we all know, have had special relationships, \nobviously, with firefighters and police on the firing line. So when I \nhear the Senator from New Jersey talk about that value as a former \nmayor, he can see the value in terms of safety and security for the \npeople in that community as a result of this legislation in terms of \ncooperative discussions and arrangements. That says a good deal.\n  Some have presented a situation--which, of course, is not accurate--\nwhere this legislation is going to be imposing extraordinary hardships, \nadditional burdens, and unfunded mandates on mayors, particularly in \nsmaller communities, and do a great disservice, actually, in terms of \nthe whole relationship between the public safety officers and the \nsecurity of the community.\n  So I particularly value his comments on this aspect of the bill. \nThere are obviously a number of other important aspects of it. But as \nit relates to small towns, I forget the actual population or the size \nof the community, the city that the good Senator was the mayor of, but, \nin any event, if he could elaborate on his views about this legislation \nand its importance to mayors as well as to firefighters, I think it \nwould be very helpful because he speaks from very practical experience.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Well, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. We had about 60,000 people in the community at the time. \nBut it was a challenge, 60,000 people in 1.1 square miles, the most \ndensely populated city in the Nation.\n  So the uniqueness of some of those challenges of having police and \nfirefighters be able to respond was very much--although the population \nwas high, the geography was small. So we had a much smaller sense of \nthe response times and the necessities that were demanded.\n  But I also was part of the mayors' coalition in the State of New \nJersey at the time. That coalition represented urban, suburban, rural \nmayors. Throughout the State of New Jersey, they had obviously the \nright for collective bargaining. To be honest with you, I don't recall \nany of those mayors saying collective bargaining was the bane of their \nexistence as it related to being able to produce the services.\n  I think the reality is that what we do through this process is we \nbuild strong partnerships between first responders and the cities and \nthe States in which they serve. When public safety employers and \nemployees work together, it not only reduces worker fatalities, and \nthey have a consequence, even in a noncollective bargaining system--\nthere obviously clearly are claims against the municipality--but above \nall, it improves the quality of the services and the delivery of those \nservices at the end of the day.\n  I believe in a post-September 11 world, having resided in a State \nthat lost hundreds of people on that fateful day and in a community \nthat saw several hundred lost on that fateful day, that these are \nindividuals who now play a critical role far beyond what we envisioned \noriginally or what their history has been, which is certainly producing \nthe safety in our communities from the normal challenges of crime, \nburglaries, thefts, robberies or assaults, or maybe even more minor \nroles of traffic violations.\n  These first responders across the landscape of the country face a \nmuch heightened responsibility. They play a critical role in homeland \nsecurity. So by enhancing cooperation between those public safety \nemployers and employees, I believe the legislation helps to ensure that \nvital public services run as smoothly as possible.\n  It is interesting that every New York City firefighter and police \nofficer who responded to the disaster at the World Trade Center on \nSeptember 11, 2001, was a union member under a collective bargaining \nagreement.\n  I believe their ability to have been integrated in their negotiations \nwith the cities about all aspects of the delivery of their services \ngave some of the most incredible response on that fateful day.\n  There is not a reason why we cannot see that take place across the \ncountry in terms of readiness. So I believe that if we look at the \nbill, it only requires local governments to engage in negotiations. If \nworkers choose to join a union, that is a rather low threshold. Again, \nStates that do not have these protections can choose to establish their \nown collective bargaining systems. So I hope we realize what is at \nstake--that safety is incredibly at stake.\n  Twenty-nine States, along with the District of Columbia, currently \nguarantee all public safety workers the fundamental right of collective \nbargaining. Now, with the House of Representatives overwhelmingly--\noverwhelmingly--approving companion legislation almost a year ago, it \nis hard to believe the Senate will not act.\n  In fact, it is time for the Senate to act and to respond. With 80,000 \nfirefighters and 76,000 police officers being injured in the line of \nduty each year, the time has come to ensure that these workers are \nprotected. It is time to put our votes where our values are. It is \ninteresting to me how very often those of us who serve in this body and \nthe other body want to be there with police and firefighters. We want \nto take our picture with them, acknowledge them. We appreciate their \nservices.\n  We talk about their heroism. But the time for all that talk to be \nmeaningful is when you come to the Senate and you cast a vote that is \nto simply have a right that is fundamentally basic, that we have \nbelieved it to be truly an American right. And so all those pictures, \nall those speeches, it is time to put that vote to work. It is time to \nput our votes where our values are. It is time to uphold the rights of \nthose who provide for our safety. It is time we show how much we \nappreciate the dedication and bravery of our Nation's heroes who take \nthis risk every day.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to yield.\n\n[[Page S4082]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think all of us in this body know the good Senator \nrepresents the State of New Jersey in this case, which had suffered \nextraordinary loss at the time of 9/11. A number of those extraordinary \nfirefighters lived in the Senator's State. So when he speaks about \nthese issues, talking about the courage and the bravery of these \nfirefighters, he talks about it with a good deal of background and \nunderstanding and an enormous sense of compassion for having gone \nthrough with many of these families their loss.\n  That is why, I believe, the Senator in his strong support for this \nlegislation, as a former mayor and also someone who knows and has \npersonal experience with these firefighters, can speak so \nauthoritatively about what this legislation can mean in terms of the \nsafety and security of the community and also with regard to the safety \nand security of the firefighters, police officers, first responders.\n  Does the Senator agree with me that those who were not lost on that \nday but in a very real sense brothers and sisters of the first \nresponders who were lost on 9/11, many of whom were lost in his \ndistrict, do they feel that legislation will help and assist providing \nsafety and security to the people, whether it is in New Jersey, or in \nthe communities they represent, and that they are supporting this \nlegislation because they are very hopeful and prayerful we will never \nagain face that kind of tragedy we faced but that they believe this \nlegislation can help provide additional safety and security for their \ncommunities and for their fellow citizens?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the question of the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the chairman of the committee. The answer is, yes, I \nsay to the Senator. The fact is that New Jerseyans have this right. Yet \nevery year when I have had visits from firefighters and police \nofficers, they have talked about this legislation because they \nunderstand, even though they already have the right, they never want to \nvisit another State for the loss of one of their fellows in service who \nhave committed the ultimate sacrifice.\n  They understand very powerfully that the ability to negotiate, as I \nsuggested earlier, is not only about salaries. Look, you do not do this \ntype of work for a salary. You do not do this type of work for a \npension. You do not do this type of work for certain benefits. You do \nthis type of work because you are committed to the proposition that you \nare willing to sacrifice your life in return for saving someone else's, \nand that is incredibly important.\n  Finally, the reality is, I found it interesting in those negotiations \nthat I used to have as a mayor, very often, as I said before about the \nability to perform the job, because it was with the mission in mind and \nthe oath taken to save lives, that more often was on the table than the \nquestion simply about salaries or pensions or benefits. They know their \ninteraction with their governmental bodies in performing and having a \nservice goes far beyond that which may exist in those States that do \nnot permit that interaction through the collective bargaining system, \nthat in fact lives of their fellow officers can be saved, their fellow \npolice officers and, most importantly, the lives of their fellow \ncitizens. That is why they have come and advocated for this \nlegislation.\n\n  Even though they already enjoy the benefit, they understand the \npotential benefits for a much broader benefit for a much broader \nuniverse.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see other Senators wish to address the Senate. We have \nbeen reminded about how long we have been considering this legislation \nand how important it is that we do it at the present time.\n  As the Senator knows, this bill was initially introduced by our \nformer colleague, Senator Mike Dewine, in 1999. The Senate even voted \non it in 2002. We had a HELP Committee hearing on this same legislation \nin the 106th Congress in 2001.\n  So many of these brave responders have waited for a long time. This \nhas gone on for some 8 years without coming to completion. It is a \nmatter that has been before this body as well during this Congress.\n  So would the Senator not agree with me, finally, that the time is now \nto take action? This is the time. We are talking about homeland \nsecurity; we are talking about first responders; we are talking about \nthose firefighters and police officers. Now is the time to permit them \nto be fully engaged and involved in further advancing the safety and \nsecurity of our colleagues.\n  Would the Senator not agree with me that this is a significant matter \nthat we have full awareness of and knowledge of and should be ready to \ntake action on?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I agree fully with Senator Kennedy, that in fact, it is \npast time. Senator Dewine was a Republican and obviously saw the wisdom \nof this legislation. It is even more appropriate today. We face \nchallenges unlike any other time in our history as it relates to what \npolice and firefighters are called to do, to go far beyond their \ntraditional roles. They need to have a voice as it relates to how they \nrespond to these new challenges and to their new roles.\n  Finally, I would simply say, when they negotiated, I know New York \nCity firefighters did not say: Well, we do not have enough men on the \nrig according to our contract so we are not going to respond on \nSeptember 11 or enough police officers to say we do not have two-men \ncars patrolling so we are not going to respond.\n  That has never been the case of those who serve. They have an oath \nand calling and they live up to that calling every day. We need to live \nup to our ultimate calling in the Senate to respond to the challenges \nthey face each and every day to give them the right and the dignity \nthey deserve to be able to negotiate not only for themselves and their \nfamilies but for the well-being of the citizens they serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator the Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4760 to Amendment No. 4751\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I send to the desk an amendment and ask for its \nimmediate consideration. I believe Senator Kennedy has seen a copy of \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4760 to amendment No. 4751\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4760) is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To guarantee public safety and local control of taxes and \n                               spending)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. GUARANTEEING PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCAL CONTROL OF \n                   TAXES AND SPENDING.\n\n       Notwithstanding any State law or regulation issued under \n     section 5, no collective-bargaining obligation may be imposed \n     on any political subdivision or any public safety employer, \n     and no contractual provision may be imposed on any political \n     subdivision or public safety employer, if either the \n     principal administrative officer of such public safety \n     employer, or the chief elected official of such political \n     subdivision certifies that the obligation, or any provision \n     would be contrary to the best interests of public safety; or \n     would result in any increase in local taxes, or would result \n     in any decrease in the level of public safety or other \n     municipal services.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is an amendment to the pending \nlegislation which would give the mayors and chief administrative \nofficers of cities and States the opportunity to opt out if they \nconclude that this law would be, in their circumstances, contrary to \nthe best interest of public safety, No. 1, or would result in an \nincrease in local taxes or a decrease in the level of public safety or \nother municipal service. In other words, if this legislation amounted \nto an unfunded Federal mandate, it would not be effective.\n  Let me speak to the unfunded mandate aspect of this legislation and \nits interference with the prerogative of States. Those are two \ndifferent ideas and two very important ideas in the American fabric. \nLet me begin by saying we are talking about some of the most honored \nmen and women in our country--firefighters, policemen, and other public \nsafety workers. That is true in Tennessee as well. We have over\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\n700 fire departments, and we were grateful for the heroism of \nfirefighters everywhere on 9/11. Local fire fighters in Tennessee and \nacross the Southeast were among the first on the scene after the deadly \ntornadoes earlier this year. We are deeply grateful for that.\n  Charles Martinez from Maryville, my hometown, was named Tennessee \nfirefighter of the year in 2004 for giving his kidney to a fellow \nfirefighter. We deeply admire him for that.\n  In 2006, Lieutenant Terrance Andrews of Chattanooga was named \nTennessee firefighter of the year for his dramatic rescue during a \nhouse fire in which he pulled the security bars away from a window to \nsave Virginia Humphrey. Ms. Humphrey was injured and spent some time in \na hospital, but she fully recovered. I admire Lieutenant Terrance \nAndrews' bravery.\n  Another example, firefighter Shane Daughetee of the Highway 58 \nVolunteer Fire Department in Chattanooga died in the line of duty in \nJanuary of last year when he was trying to rescue a family. We mourn \nShane Daughetee's death and admire the bravery of that individual. All \nof us admire and respect the bravery of firefighters and other public \nsafety employees in all our communities. But that is not what this \nlegislation is about.\n  A better name for this bill would be the ``Washington knows best \nunfunded mandate act.'' In the name of some of the men and women we \nrespect the most, our firefighters, policemen, and others, we are about \nto commit two of Washington's worst and most flagrant sins. That is, \nNo. 1, to take away from States and communities their right to decide \ntheir own labor relations, what they ought to be; and, No. 2, to pass \nan expensive piece of legislation, make it sound good, take credit for \nit, and then send the bill home to mayors, Governors, and local \nofficials who will have to either raise taxes or cut services to deal \nwith it. It is an unfunded mandate in that sense.\n  Current Supreme Court law suggests that the tenth amendment permits \nthe Federal Government to require State compliance with the general \nregulatory scheme but does not permit the Federal government to require \nStates in their sovereign capacities to regulate their own citizens.\n  The argument made by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey \nbasically boiled down to this: We have it in New Jersey, so we are \ngoing to make Tennessee have it. We have decided in New Jersey that it \nis a good idea, so I am going to fly to Washington and impose it on \nTennessee, Georgia, Wyoming, and all 21 States which have different \nlaws.\n  This is not a new subject. We haven't been waiting a long time to \ndiscuss this. We debated and discussed this law every year I was \nGovernor of Tennessee in the 1980s, which is where it is supposed to be \ndiscussed, because we are discussing the labor relations of the State \nof Tennessee. It was discussed almost every year in the 1990s and \nrejected by the legislature of Tennessee in an entire series of years. \nI have here the years in which it was considered and rejected by our \nState. Tennessee considered this specific question in both the State \nHouse and the State Senate which, I might add, are majority Democratic \nduring all of this time. In 1997, Tennessee said: We prefer to have a \nlaw in Tennessee that provides that mayors and local officials deal \ndirectly with public safety employees such as firefighters and police \nofficers. We believe that is the best way to encourage public safety, \nto have strong communities, and to provide the best labor-management \nrelationship in our State.\n  The State legislature said that in 1997. The Democratic State \nlegislature said it again in 1999. They said it again in 2001, 2003, \nand 2005. In our State of Tennessee, we will grant that a different \nrule might be good for New Jersey, but we have decided over the last \ntwo or three decades that way is not good for our State.\n  What are we talking about here? What we are saying in this Federal \nlaw--which will be imposed, as the Senator from Wyoming has said, on \nevery State, but in 21 States like ours, it overturns our law--is \nbasically that a mayor is required to recognize a union leader, if he \nor she wants to sit down and talk instead of with the policemen and \nfiremen and other public safety employees about pay, benefits, and work \nrules. It takes away the State's decision that says we believe it is \nbetter for the mayor to deal directly with those employees. I don't \nknow what that will do to improve working conditions or cooperation or \nthe public safety, but I am confident it will coerce hundreds of \nthousands of local policemen and firemen to pay union dues and fatten \nthose treasuries.\n  This bill is saying what is good for New Jersey, what is good for \nMassachusetts, is good for Tennessee. What I am saying is we have 90 \ntowns in Tennessee that will be forced to change how they deal with \ntheir public employees, because someone in New Jersey or someone in \nMassachusetts or other States thinks that is what we ought to do. Not \nonly does Washington know best, according to the advocates of this \nlegislation, but also that Washington knows best how to spend our \nmoney. Because what are these discussions about? They are discussions \nabout towns such as Pulaski, 7,800 people; Mumford, 5,000 people; \nDyersburg, 17,000; Alcoa, 7,700; my hometown of Maryville, 23,000.\n\n  Let me take Maryville as an example. We have good schools there. My \nfather ran for the school board after World War II with a ticket of men \nand women who said: We will take all the money we have and we are going \nto focus on having great schools. So in that blue-collar town where at \nthe time most of the people worked for the Alcoa plant, middle-income \ncommunity, lower middle income, by and large, we slowly built up a \nculture of very good schools. About 75 percent, if I remember the \nfigure correctly, of the local tax dollars go to make those schools \nsuperior. They win academic scores year in and year out.\n  What we are saying to Maryville is: OK, the Senator from New Jersey \nand the Senator from Massachusetts have a better idea for you folks in \nMaryville. We are going to impose on you a different way of dealing \nwith your policemen and firemen. As a result, some labor union leader \nfrom Massachusetts and New Jersey may come into Maryville and say: \nInstead of spending 75 percent of your money to make schools better, we \nwant you to do this, that, or the other about public safety and reduce \nspending on schools and increase spending for salaries of public safety \npeople.\n  One could make that argument.\n  But so far, the people in my hometown have said: We would rather not \ndo it that way. We would rather make education our priority. We think \nwe have a super police force. We are very proud of them. But we like \nthe way we are doing things. The same in Sweetwater and Erwin and \nBolivar and Rockwood and Church Hill and Millersville. Ninety of our \ntowns in Tennessee would suddenly be doing things the New Jersey way, \nthe New York way. If we wanted to do things the New Jersey way, we \nwould move to New Jersey. We would move to Massachusetts. We would move \nto New York. Those are wonderful States, but we don't choose to live \nthere. We like to do things our way, and we have always been able to.\n  We don't have a chance to do that just out of common sense. Common \nsense would suggest that a big, complex country of 300 million people, \nwhere people come from all over the world and freedom and liberty are \nour values, that we allow people as much as possible to do things in \ndifferent ways, so long as they meet with certain constitutional \nrights. Senator Byrd likes for us to carry around in our pockets the \nConstitution to which we took an oath to honor. It says in amendment X:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  In other words, it says that in the United States of America--it \nmight not be true in some other countries--unless the Constitution says \nthe Federal Government shall do it, the States do it. And so the States \nhave been doing it. We don't say in this country if New Jersey does it \nand the Senator from New Jersey thinks it is a good idea to do it in \nTennessee, make Tennessee do it. That is not the way we do things. So I \ndon't believe this legislation is constitutional, among other things.\n  Let me also say that as a former Governor, I am trying to make a \ntemperate speech about this legislation, because I feel so strongly \nabout it. But\n\n[[Page S4084]]\n\nas a former Governor, when I was sitting there in Nashville, nothing \nmade me madder than to look up to Washington and see some Congressman--\nand I will have to say, sometimes they were Republicans and sometimes \nthey were Democrats--who flew to Washington and got smarter than they \nwere when they were back in the small towns in which they grew up. They \nwould say in Washington: I have a great idea. They would pass it into \nlaw and hold a press conference and take credit for it, and then they \nwould send the bill to me, the Governor. Then what would happen? The \nnext week that same Congressman, if it was a Republican, would be home \nin Knoxville making a Lincoln day speech bragging about local control, \nand the Democrat would be in Nashville making a Jackson day speech \nbragging about local control, and I would be paying the bill. That is \nnot right. That is called an unfunded Federal mandate.\n  The American people don't like it. I will tell you how much they \ndon't like it. I was one of those Senators--there are a lot of us--who \nfelt a calling to run for the Presidency of the United States a few \nyears ago in the middle of the 1990s. I didn't make it. My preacher \nbrother-in-law said it was a reverse calling and that I should be doing \nsomething else for the people. So I am here. But I remember in 1994, \n1995, and 1996, there was a strong resentment in this country toward \nbeing told what to do from Washington, DC. People had had it up to \nhere. The Republicans seized on that. I remember Newt Gingrich and a \nlot of Republican candidates for Congress standing on the Capitol steps \nand saying: No more unfunded mandates. They put it in something they \ncalled a Contract with America. And the first piece of legislation that \nwas passed by the new Republican Congress, elected overwhelmingly by \nthe people, S. 1, was the no unfunded Federal mandate act. That was S. \n1. We are not going to pass unfunded mandates anymore. If we are going \nto pass something, we are going to pay for it.\n  This legislation doesn't pay for it. It might tell Erwin and \nMaryville and Alcoa and Pulaski and 90 other towns in Tennessee what \nthey need to pay firefighters and policemen. It might tell them what to \npay them or create an environment that creates a higher salary, \nperhaps, or a bigger benefit, but it doesn't pay the bill.\n  Now, the Republican Congress said in 1994: No more unfunded mandates. \nIf we break our promise, throw us out. In fact, the people have, and I \nthink part of the reason is because some Republicans forgot about no \nunfunded Federal mandates.\n  So I urge my colleagues to recognize that to impose upon a State--as \ndifferent as Tennessee might be from New Jersey; as different as \nWyoming might be from Georgia--we do not need the same rules and \nregulations. We are capable in our hometowns of making a good decision \nabout how to have good labor relations, or how to deal directly with \nour volunteer firemen. We have over 700 fire departments in Tennessee--\n700--and lots of different ways of dealing with them. We do not need \nanybody from New Jersey or Massachusetts or somewhere else telling us \nhow we should deal with them.\n  This is an ominous trend. Tennessee is also a right-to-work State. \nNow, I know this legislation has a little section that says this does \nnot interfere with right to work. Well, I wonder about that. Maybe this \nlegislation by itself does not in its explicit terms. But if the \nFederal Government can say, in New Jersey, in New York, and other \nStates: We have a union shop--in other words, employees do not have the \nopportunity to make a choice about whether to join a union--why cannot \nthey say: It is good for New Jersey; let's have it in Tennessee? It is \nnot a very big step.\n  Or if New Jersey or some other--I am not just picking on New Jersey, \nbut their Senator was here saying if this is good for them, it would be \ngood for us--State might say: We do not see any need for the secret \nballot in union elections. Let's just let employees sign cards. It \nmakes it a lot easier to organize, and if it is good for New Jersey or \nNew York or California, it is good for Tennessee. A lot of people moved \nto Tennessee because they prefer our level of taxes. They prefer the \nright to work. They prefer the relations we have between employers and \nemployees.\n  I imagine the auto industry, which is now one-third of our \nmanufacturing jobs in Tennessee, is there because we have a different \nlabor environment than in some other parts of the country. Now, that \ndoes not mean we do not have union workers. We have a lot of union \nworkers.\n  In fact, in the mid-1980s, a lot of people paid attention to our \nState because here came the Nissan plant, which even today is nonunion, \nand it is the largest, most efficient automobile plant in North \nAmerica, making 500,000 or 600,000 cars and trucks a year. Right next \ndoor, 15 miles away, is General Motors' Saturn plant. When General \nMotors came, the United Auto Workers came, and they are a partnership. \nBoth plants are successful. There has been some shifting and changing \nat the General Motors plant, but it is back on track.\n  So we have both plants there: one where employees are required to \njoin the union, one where people have a choice to join the union. We \nlike it that way, and I think they like it that way.\n  Now, we are the third or fourth largest State in suppliers. They seem \nto like it that way. So why would we do it the way some other State \ndoes it, especially if we figured out a better way to do it, in our \nopinion. Particularly in the United States of America where we have a \n10th amendment to the Constitution, we believe in federalism, and we \nare a decentralized society.\n  So I am very worried about this piece of legislation. I think it is \nbad for Tennessee. It is bad for our labor-management relations. We \nhave enough common sense in our State--with our Democratic Governor, \nour Democratic House of Representatives, our Republican State senate \nnow--to make these decisions for ourselves. Why do we need U.S. \nSenators telling us this? Then, when we get in the majority, we might \nsay: What is good for us in Tennessee is good for New Jersey, and \nchange their law; or what is good for us in Tennessee is good for New \nYork, and change their law. We don't care about New Jersey's law. As \nlong as we follow the constitutional rights of the people of the United \nStates, we would like to settle things.\n  I come from the mountains of Tennessee. My great-grandfather was \nasked about his politics. He said: I am a Republican. I fought with the \nUnion and I vote like I shot.\n  The reason we were unionists and Republicans in the Civil War--and \nstill today--was because we did not want the Federal Government telling \nus what to do. This is an extreme example of serious meddling.\n  One last example, and then I will stop.\n  The argument is, if we can only force all these 90 Tennessee \ncommunities to collectively bargain, that will improve public safety. \nWell, how do we know that? Is New Jersey and New York safer than \nTennessee? Do we know that for sure?\n  Or let's take the one example in Tennessee where we have required \ncommunities to collectively bargain, and that is with teachers. The \nunit is an arm of the National Education Association. I have had some \npretty important disagreements with my friends in the Tennessee \neducation association over the last 25 years about what is good for \neducation. For example, I thought it would be a good idea to reward \noutstanding teaching, pay teachers more for teaching well. Twenty-five \nyears ago, our State became the first State to do so. We created a \ncareer ladder system, and we raised taxes in order to offer every \nsingle teacher a 70-percent pay increase on the State's share. Ten \nthousand teachers went up that ladder. Guess who the No. 1 opponent to \nthat was. The teacher's union. Not Albert Shanker and the American \nFederation of Teachers, but the National Education Association.\n  I am not criticizing them. They are very open about that. They do not \nlike the idea of paying teachers more for teaching well. I think to \nimprove education we should. So does that really improve education in \nTennessee to require that collective bargaining?\n\n  Another example: I notice a lot of teachers were worried about being \nsued by parents. I think that is not right. Why not offer teachers the \nsame liability insurance the State provides to State employees?\n  The Tennessee Education Association raised its dues to defeat my \nproposal\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\nbecause they offer liability insurance. Did that improve education in \nTennessee?\n  Or charter schools? I think charter schools are a good idea, public \ncharter schools that leave teachers free to make their own decisions \nabout the kids who are there. But the teachers union disagreed. That is \na legitimate difference of opinion. But I think I am right. They think \nI am wrong. But does that improve Tennessee's schools to have them \nthere?\n  Choices for parents: I think the best thing to do in Nashville, for \nexample, where schools are having a very difficult time, might be to \nask all the parents where they would like to send their kids to school \nand see if we could do it. Give them their first, second, and third \nchoice to see if we could probably supply that. The teachers union is \nopposed to that.\n  Everyone, when we were bringing in the auto industry to Tennessee, \nbringing in the Nissan plant--the first time we had ever had those \njobs, which raised our family incomes--I wanted to build a road out to \nthe plant with State dollars, and the teachers union objected because \nthey wanted me to give the money to the teachers. I thought that was \nshort-sighted because if we improved the tax base, we would have the \nmoney to improve education.\n  So there are differences of opinion about what would improve \neducation, and there are differences of opinion about what would \nimprove public safety. We like our opinions in Tennessee. That is why \nwe do not like this bill.\n  So I will be seeking a vote on my amendment when the appropriate time \ncomes. I would urge my colleagues, you may be right about your own home \nState. Maybe it is better to require all your communities to \ncollectively bargain. Maybe that improves safety in New Jersey or New \nYork or somewhere else. But in Tennessee, we have considered it almost \nevery year for the last 25 years, and we have decided a different way. \nWe believe States ought to have the right to decide what their own \nlabor relations ought to be. We do not believe it is a right of the \nFederal Government to impose unfunded mandates on us and cause us to \npay our extra bills at a time when the Governor is laying off people in \nour State because there are not enough tax dollars coming in.\n  This is the grossest sort of interference to the sovereignty of our \nState. We have a strong bipartisan opinion about this in Tennessee. \nThat is why I am so vigorously opposed to this piece of legislation.\n  It should be called the Washington Knows Best Unfunded Mandate Act. I \nam going seek to amend it. I am going to do my best to defeat it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4759\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in a short while I am going to call up an \namendment, and I will move at that time to set aside the pending \namendment to call up amendment No. 4759. I am not going to do it yet \nbecause I want the distinguished Republican manager of the bill, \nSenator Enzi, to have a chance to see what it is before I do. But let \nme describe it a little bit before I do call it up.\n  The amendment would reauthorize and extend the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Program. This is a program that some may recall the \nformer Senator from Colorado, Mr. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, and I began \nsome years ago.\n  This morning, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing about this \nimportant grant program. We heard compelling testimony from an officer, \nDetective David Azur of Baltimore, whose life was saved in 2000 when he \nwas shot at pointblank range in the chest. He said he had enormous pain \nand a huge bruise from it, but the bullet did not penetrate his vest. I \nsaid to Detective Azur from Baltimore--and I know his family; his \nfather served as a police officer in Burlington, VT, when I was a \nprosecutor--at least he felt the bruise. Had he not had the vest on, he \nwould not have felt anything. He would have died instantly.\n  We also heard from Vermont State police lieutenant Michael Macarilla. \nI know Lieutenant Macarilla very well. He spoke about the assistance \nVermont law enforcement officers have received from the program.\n  This week, thousands of law enforcement officers from around the \ncountry have come to Washington to honor the men and women who have \ngiven their lives in service over the past year. One thing everybody in \nthis Senate could agree on, all Americans could agree on: We should \noffer our gratitude to the officers and their families.\n  On Thursday, May 15--this week--Congress and the American people are \ngoing to pause to reflect upon the sacrifices too many have made, as we \ncelebrate Peace Officers Memorial Day. This week, at the Police \nOfficers Memorial, we will recognize and remember the 181 officers who \nwere lost in the line of duty during the past year. Every death is a \ntragedy, but 181, Mr. President--that is the largest yearly total since \nthe extraordinary losses on 9/11 and in its aftermath. Think of that: \n181 officers lost, lost in the line of duty. It also means that a \nfamily lost a loved one: a spouse, a father, a mother, a son, a \ndaughter, a brother, a sister. We need to do all we can for the men and \nwomen who risk their lives protecting us and the public's safety every \nday.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program saves lives. It makes \na real difference to our officers and their families. The officers who \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee today have firsthand \nexperience with the importance of armor vests. So I am grateful to \nDetective David Azur from Baltimore and grateful to Lieutenant Michael \nMacarilla from the Vermont State police for their willingness to share \ntheir experiences with the committee and the Senate and the Congress.\n  I was proud to initiate the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act with \nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell in 1998. Both of us relied on our own \nexperience in law enforcement, experience both of us had in law \nenforcement before we came to the Senate. Between 1999 and 2007, our \nprogram has assisted in the purchase of an estimated 818,044 vests. We \nhave taken a giant step away from the days in which law enforcement \nofficers were required to purchase their own vests or go without the \nvest. Actually, I do believe the bulletproof vests should be standard \nissue equipment for law enforcement, just as we have standard equipment \nissuing a badge and a weapon.\n  In addition, as we were reminded at this morning's hearing, body \narmor is not effective forever. You buy it but it wears out. In fact, \nmanufacturers offer only a 5-year warranty for these lifesaving vests. \nThey have to be replaced periodically. In fact, for Detective Azur, his \nwarranty was just about to run out when he was shot.\n  Despite the fact that the President's budget has repeatedly--\nrepeatedly--neglected to request authorized funding for this program, \nCongress has stepped up and recognized its importance and appropriated \nthe funds needed to keep it strong. I hope Congress will do so again \nthis year. It may be easy to just look at Federal grant programs as \njust numbers, and say: Here's a number we can cut. It is a good way to \nreduce Federal spending. But when it comes to the safety of law \nenforcement officers, I can think of no rational excuse not to fully \nmeet Congress's determined levels of support for the men and women who \nprotect us all. Look what we have done in Iraq. This administration has \nprovided the Iraqi police forces with a virtual blank check over the \npast several years. American taxpayers have seen hundreds of millions--\nsome would say billions--of dollars sent to Iraq and misspent, this \njust on the police forces there. Large sums of cash and weapons \ndisappear. We sent over thousands of weapons, and we didn't even know \nwhere they went until some of them showed up in the hands of the people \ntrying to kill our own soldiers. If we can afford to pay for training \nand equipment for the Iraqi police, we ought to be able to afford \nbulletproof vests for the officers who protect Americans here at home.\n\n  There is money in the President's budget for the Iraqi police forces. \nI would like a little bit of money in the budget for American police \nforces. I worked with these police officers for 8 years when I was \nState's attorney. I think we ought to start paying a little bit of \nattention here at home.\n  State and local law enforcement officers assist Federal authorities \nin many areas, and this grant program should\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\nbe viewed in the spirit of this cooperation. In an era when State and \nlocal law enforcement are shouldering more responsibilities on the \nfront lines in the name of national security or in cooperation with \nFederal authorities in fighting interstate crime, then the Federal \nGovernment owes it to them to provide them with some support. Much of \nour Nation's strength lies in our rule of law, and Congress should \nsupport the men and women who uphold the laws and protect our \ndemocracy.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act expires next year, so the \namendment I filed would reauthorize this program for another 3 years. \nIt is drawn from the bill that Senators Specter, Mikulski, Shelby, \nHatch and I have introduced today. It also includes giving \ndiscretionary authority to the Director of the Bureau of Justice \nAssistance at the Justice Department to waive the matching requirement \nfor jurisdictions experiencing financial hardship. That provision is \ndrawn from the Leahy-Shelby bill, S. 2511. I think that in a narrow and \ntighter budget and a troubled economy, it makes sense to give the \nagency making these plans the authority and the flexibility to ensure \nthat no jurisdiction is excluded from such critical assistance simply \nbecause it can't afford to meet the matching requirements.\n  Local law enforcement agencies don't have oil revenues. They don't \nhave outside sources of revenue. If we are going to have the \nadministration say send money to the Iraqi police force, which does \nhave enormous oil revenues, and ask the American taxpayers to pay for \nit, let's pause and do something to help American police forces.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup amendment No. 4759.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Is there objection?\n  Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4759 to amendment No. 4751.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To reauthorize the bulletproof vest partnership grant and \n provide a waiver for hardship for the matching grant program for law \n                        enforcement armor vests)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n\n TITLE __--BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT AND HARDSHIP WAIVER FOR \n         MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ARMOR VESTS\n\n     SEC. 01.

Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to take a little bit of time to talk \nabout at least two of the amendments and probably make a mention of the \none we just had. As to the underlying bill, we have two amendments that \nhave been suggested--one for a public employees bill of rights and the \nother one for an unfunded mandate exemption--and I want to comment on \nthose a little bit. I haven't gotten to speak much, and there are \nseveral on the other side who have spoken to some extent.\n  I did notice that the Senator from New Jersey, the former mayor of a \ncommunity of 60,000, made some comments about how this bill would work, \nand I wished to point out that 60,000 is a pretty big city in a lot of \nStates around this country. That would be bigger than any city in \nWyoming. So when we are talking about how easy it is to do these \nnegotiations, I think we are leaving out some crucial factors.\n  The bill says it applies if a municipality has more than 5,000 people \nor--this is very important. It says 5,000 people or 25 employees. If it \nhas 25 employees, no matter what they do for the city, the city comes \nunder this bill. It becomes an unfunded mandate for the city even if \nthere are less than 5,000 people. I can tell my colleagues there are a \nlot of towns that have less than 5,000 that would have, depending on \nwhat services they provide, more than 25 employees.\n  I think that some of these other employees are going to be a little \nupset, too, realizing that we have this opportunity to place some \nspecial emphasis--and should--on the public safety employees, but not \nothers. My city had its own electrical utility, and I can tell my \ncolleagues, if the power goes out, the most important person in the \ncity for public safety is the guy who comes and gets the electricity \ngoing again. This bill would not cover those people. If your city sewer \nis backing up into somebody's home, the most important city employee \nfrom a public safety standpoint is the guy with the city utility. This \ndoesn't include him. But it will force some mandates on the city that \nwill take away money from the guy who fixes the sewer backing up into \nyour house or fixes the electrical utility that keeps the power on that \nhandles heat and air-conditioning and other important things for your \nhome.\n  I also was kind of fascinated by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, mentioning that as far as the secret ballot, they are going to \nleave that up to the States. Why would we leave that up to the States? \nWe are not leaving any of the rest of this up to the States. Not only \nthat, we are saying that no matter what the city and the employees \nagree to, there is going to be this little-known Federal agency that \ncan say: Nope, not enough. That is the way the bill reads. It allows \noverriding of agreements by the director of a Federal agency. So we are \nnot only saying: We don't care what kind of relationship you have with \nyour public safety people, we don't care how unfunded this is, and we \ndon't care if it steals money from other city employees, we have a \nFederal agency that is going to keep its eye on you and let you know if \nyou are doing it well enough. Not to mention, of course, that the rules \nhaven't even been written on this, so we don't even know how those are \ngoing to go.\n  So there are some difficulties, and I want to have the chance to \naddress some of these amendments a little more fully.\n  Of the people who voted for the motion to proceed--some voted that \nway to say we should debate this. I mentioned in my speech that we \nneeded to have some time to talk about the difficulties of this bill, \nthat there are a lot of things that people don't realize about this \nbill that need to be corrected and brought out, and we are doing that \nthrough some logical amendments.\n  But Washington does not know best how a municipality works. There is \nno way we can understand the diversity of all of the municipalities in \nthis United States that would qualify under this bill. Remember, it \napplies to those with a population of 5,000 or more or 25 employees. So \nwe are not even sure whom we are pulling into this. But we do know we \nare affecting State law in all 50 States. The exception, of course, is \nthe question of card check or secret ballot where the bill says if they \nalready require it, it is OK, but if they don't, that is OK too. So we \ncan impose every rule on them we can possibly think of, but we are \ngoing to leave the right to a secret ballot part out. I hope that is \nnot the case.\n  I hope some of the amendments that are being suggested will be voted \non and passed or, even better yet, accepted. I think some of them are \nworthy of that.\n  So with that, I yield the floor and reserve the right to speak again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Public Safety \nEmployer-\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\nEmployee Cooperation Act. I have been a cosponsor of this legislation \nin previous Congresses, and I am pleased that the bill, which I first \njoined several years ago in cosponsoring, is finally coming to the \nSenate floor.\n  This bill would ensure that the people we most count on to protect \nand serve the public--our firefighters, our police officers, our \nemergency medical personnel, and other first responders--can exercise \ntheir rights to organize and bargain collectively with their employers.\n  Currently, 20 American States do not effectively provide for this \nright despite the fact that it applies across nearly every other area \nof the American economy. All first responders should have an effective \nprocess to address job issues and practices with the State and local \ngovernments they serve.\n  Now, some have argued that this bill interferes with the proper \nauthority of States and municipalities, but, in fact, the bill simply \nrequires States to allow public safety officers to bargain over wages, \nhours, and working conditions. My State of Maine has a very similar law \nin place already. This bill does not in any way dictate outcomes of \nthis process. It gives State--not Federal--courts the authority to \nenforce contract rights that arise from collective bargaining.\n  I also wish to emphasize that the bill does not authorize actions \nthat might threaten public safety. In fact, it prohibits both strikes \nand walkouts. Further, it does not interfere with any existing \ncollective bargaining agreements, nor does it impinge on any area \ntraditionally reserved to management decisionmaking.\n  Mr. President, I have heard some of my colleagues say this bill will \nsomehow harm the volunteer firefighters who are so important in rural \nStates, such as mine and the State of the Presiding Officer. I think it \nis important we spell out why that is not the case. In fact, there is \nno collective bargaining established by this bill for volunteers, \nvolunteer fire departments. This is a bill about collective bargaining \nrights of employees who are paid for their work. Volunteers, by \ndefinition, are not employees. Any suggestion that cities and towns are \ngoing to be required to bargain with and possibly pay their volunteer \nfirefighters is simply wrong.\n  Volunteers are expressly not covered by this bill and will have no \nright to collective bargaining. All volunteer departments would have no \nbargaining complications. Furthermore, professional firefighters would \nstill be encouraged to volunteer. I am touched by the fact that some of \nthe professional firefighters in my town act as volunteer firefighters \nfor their hometowns. They may be employed by a larger city in Maine, \nsuch as Bangor, Lewiston or Portland, but they may live in a very small \ntown outside the city, where they volunteer on the all-volunteer \nfirefighting force. There is nothing in this bill that discourages \nanyone from serving as a volunteer firefighter.\n  In many towns, as I mentioned, volunteer firefighters are actually \nprofessional firefighters who volunteer during their off-duty hours. \nOur legislation preserves that kind of relationship by actually \nprohibiting States from putting limits on professional firefighters who \nwant to volunteer during their off-duty hours.\n  This bill addresses concerns that were raised by some of the \nvolunteer firefighters because the protections in the House-passed bill \nweren't clear enough. The Senate version of this bill will dispel any \nambiguity in the House-passed version and make clear that a \nprofessional firefighter can, in fact, volunteer to be part of a \nvolunteer force.\n  The Senate drafters of this bill worked with groups representing \nvolunteer firefighters. I note that the National Volunteer Fire Council \nsupports the language in the Senate substitute that protects the \nvolunteer firefighters.\n  I believe this bill is a balanced, constructive measure that will \nhelp first responders and improve public safety, without improperly or \nunduly burdening States. It has won the endorsement of the \nInternational Association of Firefighters, and it is particularly \nappropriate that we are turning to this bill during National Police \nWeek, when so many police officers are also in town.\n  I believe all Americans gained a new appreciation for the service and \nthe sacrifices of our first responders on that terrible day, September \n11, 2001. On that day, 343 New York City firefighters and paramedics, \n28 New York Police Department officers, and 37 Port Authority officers \ndied doing what they loved. They died trying to rescue others. Such \nheroism occurs, usually, with far less tragic results in towns and \ncities across our country every day.\n  The least we can do to repay the sacrifice and service, the \nselflessness of our first responders is to ensure that all public \nsafety officers have the right to bargain on their pay and safety \nstandards and working conditions.\n  This legislation makes sense. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bill to put America's public safety workers on an equal \nfooting with their counterparts in other jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nstatement. I have one request for her though. Look at the paragraph \nthat deals with volunteer firefighters--the language regarding allowing \nprofessional firefighters who want to help out in the community to \nvolunteer as well. There has been language suggested that would make it \nclear that what you described would happen. But the language from the \nHouse definitely doesn't say that. The language, as revised in the \nsubstitute amendment, still doesn't say that. I would appreciate it if \nthe Senator would take another look at that and see if that can be made \na lot clearer. The language I was referring to is ``to prohibit an \nemployee from engaging in volunteer or part-time employment, any \nagreement that contains such language shall be unenforceable.'' That is \npretty clear. I am concerned that will not only be misconstrued, but it \nwill be bargained away without any consequence. I would appreciate if \nthe Senator would take another look at that.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I may respond to my good friend--and \nhe is a good friend who knows this issue very well and considers bills \nvery carefully, which I have always admired about the Senator from \nWyoming. First, let me say it is clear the House bill does not do a \ngood job in this area. I think the House bill is very ambiguous and \ndoesn't make clear what I described. So I think we are in agreement \nabout the House bill. I will take a second look at the substitute \nlanguage, as the Senator has suggested. But I know the drafters of the \nbill, Senators Gregg and Kennedy, worked very closely with the National \nCouncil of Volunteer Firefighters, and I doubt they would have signed \noff on the language--which it is my understanding that they have--if, \nin fact, it did not protect the volunteer firefighters.\n  Thirdly, my intent is not to impose any sort of obligation on \nvolunteer firefighters. They are, by definition, not employees, so I \ndon't think they come under this bill. In addition, I do wish to make \nsure anyone who is a professional firefighter, and employed in that \nprofession, is not precluded from also acting as a volunteer \nfirefighter, as so many professional firefighters in Maine and across \nthis country do. I will take another look at the language, but I do \nknow Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy have worked very closely with \nthe Volunteer Firefighters Council, and they believe the substitute \nlanguage does cure what I think all of us would agree was a problem in \nthe House bill.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Wyoming. I will take another look at \nthe language.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I concur in what the junior Senator from \nMaine has said, if the volunteer firefighter organizations worked \nclosely with Senators Gregg and Kennedy and they are supportive and \nhave signed off on the language.\n  I am particularly pleased to participate in this discussion for a lot \nof reasons. One of them is because I was in the Ohio State legislature \nmany years ago--about 25 years ago--when we debated a bill that would \nhave given collective bargaining rights to Ohio first responders. That \nlegislation eventually passed. I have to tell you Ohio, partly\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\nbecause of that legislation, has the best public safety forces in the \nUnited States of America, the best police officers, the best \nfirefighters, and the best EMS professionals. I may be biased about \nthat, but I am also right.\n  I have worked with the firefighters in Cincinnati to push for \nlegislation that would help eliminate needless risks to their safety on \nthe job. I have worked with firefighters in Lorain and Akron to make \nsure Federal and municipal firefighters receive the proper benefits \nwhen injury strikes. I have worked with police officers to fight for \nthe COPS Program and with EMS professionals to reduce the redtape \nsurrounding hometown hero benefits. All these men and women have \npledged to fight for our lives. Every single day they bear deadly risks \non our behalf.\n  The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act gives Members of \nthis body an opportunity to fight for first responders, just as they \nfight for us. It gives us an opportunity to take on risk and overcome \nit, just as our first responders do. S. 2123 will reduce the risk of \ninjury or death to first responders and the public they serve.\n  The Alexander amendment will take away our ability to do that. S. \n2123 will reduce the risk of a first responder workforce shortage. The \nAlexander amendment, again, will take away our ability to do that. It \nwill reduce the risk that first responders will be grossly overworked \nor dramatically underpaid. The Alexander amendment will take away our \nability to do that. It will reduce avoidable risks, and when it comes \nto public safety, avoidable risks are unconscionable risks.\n  Some public safety professionals have the right to negotiate fair \nwages, decent benefits, and proper equipment. Some don't have that \nright. That is because some States empower their first responders to \ncollectively bargain and others don't.\n  Collective bargaining is not just about wages or benefits; it is \nabout doing the job in the safest way possible, doing the job in the \nbest way possible. If first responders, without bargaining rights, are \nunderpaid or overworked or poorly outfitted, their options include \nliving with it or leaving.\n  Neither option serves the public good. Our Nation has a stake in \nensuring that public safety jobs are filled in every town, every city, \nand every State.\n  Denying first responders the right to negotiate fair wages--denying \nthem the right to negotiate their own safety--is not exactly a strong \nselling point for these jobs. That is why the Alexander amendment \nshould go down and the bill should pass.\n  The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act ensures that \nevery first responder, regardless of where she or he lives, can do \nthat. This bill promotes fairness and safety. It wasn't just written \nfor first responders--police, firefighters, and EMS professionals. It \nwas also written for those who rely on first responders. That is us. \nThis bill was written for us.\n  Senator Alexander's amendment, when he spoke, talked about the \n``Washington knows best'' attitude. I thought about that as he was \ntalking. His points were well made and well articulated. I wear on my \nlapel a pin that is a depiction of a canary in a birdcage. About 100 \nyears ago, the mine workers used to take the canary into the mine, and \nif it died from toxic gas or from a lack of oxygen, the mine worker \nknew he had to get out of the mine. In those days, the worker had no \nGovernment that cared enough to protect him, no union strong enough to \nprotect him, and he didn't have collective bargaining rights. We know \nthat 100 years ago, a baby born in this country lived to be about 46 or \n47 years old. Today, a child lives 30 years longer. Do you know why \nthat is? It is not mostly miracle medical technology. Certainly, \nchemotherapy and heart transplants and other things help many of us \nlive longer. But the reason people live 30 years longer today is, \nfrankly, because of national standards, because of collective \nbargaining rights. Look around. We have strong collective bargaining \nlaws, and people live 30 years longer because we have strong laws on \nsafe drinking water and clean air. We have strong laws on minimum wage \nand Social Security and Medicare and prohibition on child labor and \nprotections for women and all the things that were negotiated at the \nbargaining table and were passed by this Congress--setting national \nstandards on clean air, on safer drinking water, on worker safety, \nnational standards on a whole host of issues that are important to all \nof us. That is why when I hear this ``Washington knows best,'' we will \ndo it our own way--we have not done that on civil rights or worker \nrights. As a nation, we share these values, whether we are from \nWyoming, Tennessee, New Jersey, Massachusetts or Ohio, and we share \nthese values of helping people, giving them collective bargaining \nrights, passing a minimum wage increase, having safe drinking water and \nclean air and pure food laws--all that our country has stood for.\n  Also, Senator Alexander said this act imposes an unfunded mandate on \ncities and States, and they would not even be able to afford new \nbenefits for public safety officers. I will answer that for a moment. \nFirst of all, under the bill, no costs are imposed. The bill comes with \nno pricetag. There is not a single provision in the bill that requires \ncities and States to spend a penny.\n  Senator Alexander spoke about Pulaski and other communities in \nTennessee, saying we are going to go to Tennessee and tell them how \nmuch they are going to have to pay first responders in Pulaski or in \nNashville. We don't want to do that. I don't want the Federal \nGovernment to tell us what first responders in Mansfield, Zanesville, \nLima, Springfield, and Xenia should get. But this bill doesn't do that. \nIt doesn't set those kinds of standards, and we know that.\n\n  I wish to speak to a couple other issues. No particular terms are \nimposed in this legislation. Local governments under the Kennedy-Gregg \nbill are free to write their own contracts. The bill doesn't require \nany particular terms. State and local officials will sit down with \nworkers and figure out together what will work for their communities. \nThat is the whole point of collective bargaining, not to impose this \nhealth provision or this level of pension or that particular wage. It \ndoesn't do that. It simply gives those communities the right to \norganize and bargain collectively.\n  There is no binding arbitration in this bill. Many States have done \nbinding arbitration. This bill doesn't require binding arbitration. So \nno third party can require a government to raise wages or spend any \nmoney the local government and their citizens don't agree to spend.\n  State and local legislatures have the final say. We went out of our \nway to respect the autonomy of State governments. One way we have done \nthat is to let State and local legislatures have the final say on \ncollective bargaining agreements. The States can give their \nlegislatures the right to approve or disapprove funding for any \nnegotiated agreements. Again, that is what collective bargaining is all \nabout, whether it is in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Wyoming, Ohio, or \nTennessee.\n  This bill most specifically is about mandating a discussion between \nemployers and workers. It is not a mandate. It certainly is not an \nunfunded mandate. That is why the Alexander amendment should be \ndefeated. That is why the underlying bill should be approved.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWN. I certainly will yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues have listened \ncarefully to the Senator from Ohio because he has laid out the \nessential elements of this legislation and did it effectively.\n  As I mentioned, very often around here we have people who \nmisrepresent or mischaracterize legislation and then differ with it. I \nhave even done it myself a few times. We have seen that done with \nregard to this legislation.\n  I listened to my friend and colleague--and he is my friend and \ncolleague--from Tennessee. I watched him wave the Constitution and talk \nabout the tenth amendment, and the Senator from Ohio has answered that.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me that the basic process that is \nfollowed is that if this legislation is passed, a State then must set \nup some opportunity fulfilling four different requirements that are \nincluded in the bill? Those four different requirements that are to \nprovide public service officers\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\nthe right to form and join a labor organization; requires the employers \nto recognize a union that is chosen, require employers to engage in a \ncollective bargaining process, and make available an impasse \nresolution. As the Senator correctly pointed out, that may very well be \narbitration, that may be factfinding. It is completely left open.\n  Now the State takes these four broad guidelines and fashions \nlegislation. Once Tennessee passes a law, if Tennessee workers say we \ndon't like unions, they don't have to have one. End of the story. I had \ndifficulty in understanding the Senator from Tennessee talk eloquently \nfor half an hour describing this amendment, and I said one of us hasn't \nread it because there is no such requirement in this legislation as \ndescribed by the Senator from Tennessee.\n  I wish the Senator would once again speak to the issue of an unfunded \nmandate. There is no possibility, as the Senator has mentioned, that \nthere can be any impact on the local community or the State in terms of \nrequiring them to spend a nickel if it isn't going to be approved by \nthe regular order within that State. The State is going to have to make \nthat judgment and that decision whether they want it, but there is \nnothing included in this legislation that is going to alter that part \nof the procedure.\n  As to these concerns we have heard during the course of the afternoon \nthat this new legislation is going to suddenly be an unfunded mandate, \nI am always interested, if you eliminated the words ``unfunded \nmandate,'' you would quiet about half the Senate. They use those words \nso frequently when too often they don't have anything else to say. ``It \nis an unfunded mandate,'' and everyone quivers and shakes about it. \nThat is the situation.\n  It is good if we have a debate, and we welcome the opportunity to \ntake some time to debate. We are in no rush. This is important \nlegislation. It is important that the Members understand it, but it is \nimportant, it does seem to me, as we are engaging in this debate, for \nthe Members to understand correctly what we are doing and what we are \nnot doing.\n  I was interested to know if the Senator agrees with me that the bill \nwill not require any town or community in Ohio or any State to expend \nresources and funds that the State will not duly authorize under its \nexisting appropriations procedures?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I certainly agree with \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts. In my State in Ohio, I have \nwatched for 25 years what has happened with public employee collective \nbargaining. It has made the State better.\n  At the beginning of my comments, I talked about Ohio, I believe, has \nthe best police, fire, and EMS forces in the entire country. A big part \nof that came out of collective bargaining.\n  Many times in communities when the city council reaches a difficult \nposition with their police or with their fire or with their other first \nresponders, the Federal Government does not get involved. We don't \nmandate that there should be a certain level of pay or certain level of \nfringe benefits or certain level of worker protections as they do their \njobs. That is up to them, and this bill makes that easier to \naccomplish.\n  In no way is there a mandate, and in no way is this an unfunded \nmandate. No costs are imposed, no terms are imposed, there is no \nbinding arbitration. As Senator Kennedy said, if Newton, MA, Lynn or \nBoston want to have binding arbitration or factfinding, they can do \nthat. It is the same with Marion, Portsmouth, and Ravenna, OH. They \nmake those decisions. That is the beauty of this legislation. We set up \nthe system of collective bargaining and let them make those \ndeterminations.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, would \nthe Senator not agree with me that the decisionmaking then is going to \nbe done at effectively the local level by workers rather than at the \nFederal level or even at the State level? The State is going to outline \na process. Then the workers are going to make a judgment as to whether \nthey want to follow that process. And if they choose that they will not \ndo it, then there is no process or procedure, and they don't have to do \nit.\n  A compelling aspect of this legislation is the fact that we are \ngiving the authority to deal with the most local issues to those who \nhave responsibility today in the local community and who know best in \nterms of safety and security, and are trained in safety and security--\nthe first responders.\n  The record is powerful in this area about how to ensure additional \nsafety and protection for local communities, the State, and the \ncountry. We want to make sure that those decisions are made by the \nworkers who have that expertise.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments because we have heard a good \ndeal of rhetoric on the floor. It is important that we make sure our \ncolleagues have a good understanding and awareness of the great efforts \nthat have been made to make sure we are going to respect the States, we \nare going to respect, obviously, local communities and the differences \nthat take place, and we are going to have special provisions, as the \nSenator correctly pointed out, in terms of voluntary fire departments.\n  We tried to work very carefully and closely--as the Senator has \nmentioned, this has been a bipartisan effort with Senators from all \ndifferent parts of the country. What is important is that local \nfirefighters, local first responders, local police officers are so \nstrongly in support of this legislation because they understand better \nthan anyone on the floor of this Senate the difference it can make for \nthe safety and security of the American people.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy again for his \ncomments. Look at what happened in this country over the last decades, \nas we set up a system of collective bargaining for private employees. \nThis body had no interest in telling GM and the UAW how to negotiate a \ncontract, only that the rights of collective bargaining are recognized \nin this country.\n  We have the same view--not a mandate, not an unfunded mandate, to be \nsure--the same view of setting up collective bargaining with \ngovernments, elected officials, in all that we do.\n  As Senator Kennedy said, it is all pushed to the local level. They \nwill make the decisions. That is why defeat of the Alexander amendment \nis crucial. It undoes all the good in this bill. After defeating the \nAlexander amendment, this legislation should receive an affirmative \nvote.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nPublic Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act, a bipartisan measure \nthat will guarantee our Nation's law enforcement officers, firefighters \nand emergency medical personnel the right to bargain collectively with \ntheir employers. I want to thank Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy for \ntheir long-standing commitment to this critically important \nlegislation.\n  Now more than ever, the risks taken by our first responders are \ngreater than they have ever been. From the increased risk of terrorist \nattacks, to the catastrophic hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires that \nhave ravaged our country from coast to coast, each and every day we ask \nmore from our emergency workers, and they always rise to the challenge. \nThese are people who have chosen to dedicate their lives to serving \ntheir communities--making the streets safe, fighting fires, providing \npre-hospital emergency medical care, conducting search-and-rescue \nmissions when a building collapses or a natural disaster occurs, \nresponding to hazardous materials emergencies, and so much more.\n  The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act provides these \nbrave men and women with basic rights to bargain collectively, a right \nthat workers in many other industries have used effectively to improve \nrelations with their supervisors. This bill is carefully crafted to \nallow States a great deal of flexibility to implement plans that will \nwork best from them. All it requires is that States provide public \nsafety workers with the most basic collective bargaining rights--the \nright to form and join unions and to collectively bargain over wages, \nhours, and working conditions. It also will require a mechanism for \nsettling any labor disputes. These are rights that a majority of States \nalready provide these workers, and this bill does nothing to interfere \nwith States whose laws already provide these fundamental rights.\n  This bill will allow States to continue enforcing right-to-work laws\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\nthey may have on the books, which prohibit contracts requiring union \nmembership as a condition of employment. This bill even allows States \nto entirely exempt small communities with fewer than 5,000 residents or \nfewer than 25 full-time employees.\n  Importantly, this bill takes every precaution to ensure that the \nright to collectively bargain will not interfere with the critical role \nthese workers play in keeping our communities safe. It explicitly \nprohibits any strikes, lockouts, or other work stoppages. But the key \nto this bill is truly to foster a cooperative atmosphere between our \nfirst responders and the agencies they work for. Cooperation between \nlabor and management will inevitably lead to public safety agencies \nbeing better able to serve their communities. Unions can help ensure \nthat vital public services run smoothly during a crisis, and this bill \nwill further that goal.\n  I would add that this legislation enjoys enormous bipartisan support. \nThe House passed H.R. 980 by an overwhelming margin of 314-97. Here in \nthe Senate, our version enjoys the support of all my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle and many on the other side as well, including Senator \nGregg, the bill's sponsor. In an era ruled by party-line votes, this \nspeaks to the great importance of this legislation. That is because we \nrecognize the unique and essential role these workers play in every \nsingle community, and we recognize that by granting them these basic \nrights they will be able to better serve those communities.\n  This bill addresses some of the most critical concerns of our \nNation's first responders. It goes beyond negotiating wages, hours and \nbenefits. In this circumstance, for this group of people, it means so \nmuch more. It means that the men and women who run into burning \nbuildings, resuscitate accident victims, and patrol the streets of our \ntowns and cities can sit down with their supervisors to relate their \nreal life experiences. They can discuss their concerns and use their \non-the-ground expertise to help improve their service to the community. \nGranting our first responders this basic right is not only in their \nbest interest it is in all of our best interests. It will allow these \nmen and women to better serve their communities by fostering a spirit \nof cooperation with the agencies and towns that employ them.\n  When tragedies have struck us, from the September 11 attacks to \nHurricane Katrina, it is these workers who are the first people on the \nscene and the last to leave. We owe them everything, and all they have \nasked of us in return is dignity and respect in the workplace. They \nstand with us every single day on the job, and it is time we stand with \nthem. I urge all my colleagues to join me and the millions of first \nresponders who form the backbone of our nation's homeland security by \nvoting to pass this crucial legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak to this legislation and \naddress briefly some of the comments that have been made.\n  I don't think there is any question that this legislation would \nrepresent an unprecedented intrusion by the Federal Government into the \naffairs of States. It is justified on the basis primarily that it is \nneeded, that States should be required to do the things the law \nmandates.\n  I don't think one can argue this is not an intrusion into State law. \nAs a matter of fact, as I understand it, the bill would specifically \nreverse the actions of 13 States that have considered and rejected \nsimilar legislation in the last two legislative sessions of those \nStates. The law in these States would be overruled by this legislation. \nThe bill would specifically overturn the current law in an additional \neight States and cast into doubt a number of aspects of current law in \nat least an additional nine other States.\n  Apart from the constitutional issues that have been raised by some of \nmy colleagues, the first point I wanted to make is we cannot very well \nargue we are not telling the States to do anything, we are not really \nchanging anything in the States; this is Federal law that controls \ncertain aspects of State labor laws from now on and, as I said, in \nseveral situations would specifically change the policies of States as \ndetermined by the citizens of those States.\n  We have to ask ourselves a fundamental question: Do we trust States \nand local governments or do we not? There are some reasons why States \nhave different labor laws, as well as other kinds of laws. There are \nreasons why some States have permitted what this legislation would \nmandate and other States have not.\n  For example, it is very difficult to argue a State that doesn't \ncurrently have this kind of requirement doesn't care about the safety \nof its employees. These are people in our communities, these are people \nwho are already governed by other laws relating to minimum wage and \nsafety, to the things that were mentioned by my colleague from Ohio, \nand these are people who certainly have the ear of others in their \ncommunity. They are leaders in their community.\n  I can certainly attest to my State of Arizona. There are some \ntremendous folks in our firefighting communities, specifically in my \nhometown of Phoenix, but in other communities as well. If they were \nworking under unsafe conditions or conditions they felt were not \nappropriate for the circumstance, I think we would hear about that.\n  To suggest that the mayor of a town doesn't care about their safety \nor else he would be doing this and, therefore, we are going to have to \nmandate it on to that community is not a proper recognition of the way \nour Government works in this country, starting from the ground up \nrather than the top down. That is what the United States is all about, \nand that is why communities have different ways of dealing with these \ndifferent situations.\n  I, frankly, have not heard any case made for the legislation. I have \nnot heard of situations where in several of these communities over \n5,000 population, because this particular mandate doesn't exist, there \nare all sorts of horrible things happening that have to be fixed.\n  Unless there is some suggestion that is the case--first, that \npetition ought to be brought to the State or local government that is \ninvolved to see if they want to change their laws. But otherwise, there \nis certainly no reason why the Federal Government should be intruding \ninto the area.\n  I don't think we can say this legislation is not a mandate to the \nStates, that it simply allows States to continue to operate as they \nare. That is clearly not the case.\n  As my colleague from Massachusetts pointed out, there are four \nspecific requirements that have to be met under this legislation. But \nhe then went on--and I am not certain of exactly what the point here \nwas--that if they do not agree, then that is the end of it.\n  The reality is, the legislation itself has a very explicit provision \nfor what happens if the Federal authority does not believe the \nagreement is in compliance with this law. It is subject to the \nenforcement of section 5 of the law, which is a very extensive section \nthat deals with what happens if you are not in compliance. I will not \nbother to go through the whole legislation, but it speaks about the \ndetermination of rights and responsibilities and says that the \nauthorities shall make a determination as to whether a State \nsubstantially provides for the rights and responsibilities set forth in \nthe legislation not later than 180 days after enactment. If it \nconcludes that it does not meet the requirements, then it shall be \nsubject to the enforcement or to the procedure described in section 5. \nThat is on page 9 of the bill. Then section 5 goes on to provide all of \nthe ways in which the Federal authority would then have the \njurisdiction to make determinations as to what the State is supposed to \ndo. This is an intrusion of the Federal Government into activities that \nhave previously been left to the States, and I think there is a failure \nto protect both the rights of the workers in this case as well as the \nlocal communities.\n  I note that Senator Hatch has an amendment, which I think is a good \nidea, to provide for, in effect, a bill of rights for the workers under \nthis legislation.\n  I also think the bill itself purports to prohibit strikes. But let me \ndescribe to you what the bill does do. It goes to great pains to say \nthat it is not a strike when a public safety officer refuses ``to carry \nout services that are not mandatory conditions of their employment.'' \nWell, what does that mean? There is a rich history in labor law\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\nabout, you know, well, we were all sick that day. It was purely \ncoincidence that we did not come to work, that kind of thing. We are \nall familiar with that. Who decides this?\n  Obviously, at least in my view, this provision appears to be nothing \nmore than legislative code words that authorize work-to-rule and a host \nof other types of disruptive job actions that we have all become \nfamiliar with in certain unions--teachers unions, for example.\n  The bill forces unions on unwilling cities and towns and then gives \nthose unions the legislative green light, in effect, to disrupt \nmunicipal services as long as it is not the refusal to carry out a \nmandatory condition.\n  I think some of these things probably could have been corrected had \nthe bill gone through the regular legislative process. But, as the \nSenator from Wyoming, the ranking member of the committee, the former \nchairman, pointed out, the bill has not gone through committee. It has \nnot had the benefit of some of the changes that would have improved the \nbill had it done so.\n  In fact, I am informed that there were changes that were recommended \neven by some supporters of the bill when it came from the House of \nRepresentatives, things they understood at that point that should be \ndone to the bill to make it a better bill and to make it work more \neffectively. But the committee had no opportunity to consider those \nitems.\n  So, at a minimum, this kind of complicated legislation that is going \nto direct States and municipalities should be the subject of hearings \nand of the regular legislative process that would enable us to correct \nits deficiencies before it comes to the floor of the Senate here.\n  Now, there has been discussion about the administrative expenses not \nbeing an unfunded mandate. Well, I do not think there is any doubt that \nthere are costs associated with this. The Federal Government is not \npaying for them. You can call it whatever you want. I do not know what \nthose costs would totally amount to, whether they would end up \nbankrupting cities. I am not going to make those claims. But I do not \nthink you can deny there would be extra costs associated with this \nlegislation and that the Federal Government does not pay for those \ncosts.\n  It has also been pointed out that because of provisions that have--\nunion contracts that cities have taken on in certain instances, those \ncities have either declared bankruptcy or become close to declaring \nbankruptcy because of the requirements of these union contracts. I am \nnot going to assert that every city would end up in that kind of a \nsituation either. But I do think it is important to note that there \nwill be financial ramifications. There is no point in doing it \notherwise. As a result, I think the cities and the folks in these \ncommunities need to consider what their additional obligations are \ngoing to be. As I said, there is no reason to have this legislation \nunless one assumes there will be additional costs imposed upon the \nfolks in those communities.\n  Another thing about this legislation that causes a great deal of \nconsternation, at least on this side of the aisle and among a lot of \npeople who have been surveyed about the so-called card check \nlegislation, is the principle that in order to unionize a particular \nfacility, you do not have to have a secret ballot. The people, the \nworkers there, are not, in fact, entitled to make their wishes known by \nsecret ballot but, rather, it is done through what is called a card \ncheck, a nonsecret proposition where somebody comes around and says: \nYou want to sign this petition, don't you? And through various methods \nof intimidation--direct or indirect--they could end up forcing \nunionization in that situation. That is not the American way. We have \nalways prided ourselves on having secret ballots in this country, in \nlabor relations as well as when we elect our officials and vote on \npropositions that affect our communities.\n\n  This bill contains no workers' protections. Specifically, it \nsanctions State card check laws that do not guarantee secret ballot \nelections for unionization, and it does not require transparency, \nfiscal transparency, for labor unions or any other control over the way \nthe unions would then spend the union dues of the members of the union.\n  One of the things that bothers me most about it, though, is what is \ncalled the authority, the Federal entity. It is a new entity that would \nbe created to supervise this legislation. It is not accountable to the \nState, but it basically becomes in charge of their State laws. In fact, \nas I said, if it makes the determination that the State law does not \ncomply in what it thinks is the requirement of this legislation, then \nthere are several different enforcement actions it can take to bring \nthe State into compliance. That is not States rights. That is not \nallowing communities to decide. That is an imposition from the top down \nfrom the U.S. Government here in Washington.\n  There are a lot of smart people in the Senate and a lot of smart \nbureaucrats and other officials here in Washington, but I do not think \nany of them got any smarter when they came to Washington, DC, from \nwhere they were originally located. We have many smart people in our \nStates and communities who can do these things. We do not have to turn \nto Washington, DC.\n  The final point I wish to make is that there is a little bit of a \ndouble standard here because, of course, we do not have this in the \nFederal Government. We are not mandating full collective bargaining for \nFederal employees, but we are going to impose it on States and towns \nfor a large segment of their employees. I think our folks back home \nwould rightly ask us: Now, what about this? It is something you are \nimposing on us. If it is such a wonderful idea, why don't you try to do \nit at the Federal level as well? I think most of us recognize it would \nnot get very far at the Federal level, and it should not get very far \nat the local level.\n  I will conclude with this: We all have folks back in our communities \nwho do a tremendous job in protecting us through fire and police \nprotection, providing emergency services. It has been my pleasure and, \nfrankly, an honor to visit with some of them even this week and to \nvisit with them back home and to represent them and to work with them \non matters of concern to them. From time to time, some of them have \nspoken to me about this legislation.\n  We have a pretty rich tradition in Arizona. It is a right-to-work \nState. It is a State that obviously has unions, but it also has a rich \ntradition in trying to protect workers' rights. I find so much of this \nlegislation, as it is written, does not meet what the people of the \nState of Arizona have year after year insisted in labor relations \nlegislation to govern the relations with the folks who work in the \nState of Arizona. I think it would be rejected by my constituents. \nTherefore, it is far better to try to work to correct conditions as \nthey exist locally if those conditions can be presented as significant \nproblems. As I said, I have not seen that. I have not seen it in my \nlocal community. I have not seen it presented as a national emergency \nthat has to be dealt with in this extraordinary way. If there are \nhearings, bring these problems out. If the legislation then works \nthrough the committee in a way that provides some of the worker \nprotections we do not see here, provides a little more clarity with \nrespect to things that are not clear, then it is obviously something \nfolks could look at.\n  In the meantime, I am going to respect the local communities and the \npeople in the State of Arizona who have spoken to this issue in the \npast and, as a result, urge my colleagues to reject this legislation in \nits current form. In the meantime, I will support some of the very \ninteresting amendments that have been brought forth, one by my \ncolleague from Tennessee, but I specifically mention my colleague, \nSenator Hatch.\n  Let me conclude by acknowledging the good work of the leader on our \nside of the aisle, the ranking member of the committee, the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, and also the fine work that, as always, he does in \nputting legislation like this together with the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Kennedy. To suggest that the bill is not perfect is \nnot to suggest that I do not respect his considerable skills at writing \nand legislating. It is that we have some disagreement about some of \nthese things. I suspect that had the bill gone through the committee \nprocess, it would be a better product than it is today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take a few moments to respond to \nsome of the points that have been made during the afternoon. There are \nsome very basic and fundamental points that I think should be made, and \nthat is on the question of the right to choose and the ability for \nindividuals to have that right to choose.\n  Here on the floor of the Senate, we heard last night from the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and at a time here earlier from the Senator from \nArizona. I appreciate his kind personal comments. And I join him in \npaying tribute to my colleague, the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Although we differ on this legislation, he knows the great respect I \nhave for him as a legislator and the affection I have for him. But \nthere is a difference between a State saying: We are going to deny \npeople the opportunity for collective bargaining, and a State having a \nprocess and a procedure in which the people in the State make that \njudgment and decision. It is similar to the right to vote. Every \nindividual ought to have that right to vote, and if they are not going \nto use it, that is their judgment and decision, but it is an important \nenough right to say that we must make it available and allow them to \nexercise it.\n  That is what we are saying with this legislation, that a decision \ndealing with safety and security and a voice on the job for first \nresponders is sufficiently important that workers should have an \nopportunity to express themselves and decide whether they want \ncollective bargaining. The States themselves, as good as we believe \ntheir judgments are, shouldn't get to make that decision for the \nworkers. The States should set up a process and procedure and let the \npeople in the States make that judgment--that is pretty apple pie \nAmericana, to let people make judgments and decisions about matters \nthat are going to make an important difference with regard to safety \nand security of their jobs and their communities. That is what this is \nbasically about.\n  So when we hear on the other side: my State made a judgment on it, \nand we are trying to see another State trying to impose its will on \nmine, well, I think my friend Senator Brown answered that very well as \na general concept, but in particular, it is important to understand \nwhat is at the root of this, and that is a process. If this legislation \npasses, a State has four broad criteria that it must meet, and the \nSenator from Arizona is correct that if the State does not meet these \nrequirements, then the Federal Labor Relations Authority has to step in \nand make sure these criteria are met. But if they do meet these basic \nrequirements the Federal Labor Relations Authority would not become \ninvolved at all.\n  The idea that workers are going to be forced to join a union if they \ndon't want one is a scare tactic--and I don't say that in a pejorative \nway, but just for our membership to understand. We are giving the \nchoice to the workers. We believe those firefighters and first \nresponders can make that judgment. We think it is an important enough \ndecision that affects their lives and the lives of the people they are \nprotecting that they should make it. Then they can make the judgment \nand decision on what they want in that particular State. If they make \nthe decision that they don't want to have collective bargaining, so be \nit. But at least they have the possibility of moving ahead in that \ndirection. It is difficult for me to believe that the States would \nrefuse to establish the kind of process and procedure that would make \nthat choice possible.\n  There are a host of different provisions in the Hatch amendment which \nhave previously been rejected in one form or another. We might go over \nthem briefly tomorrow. But I wanted to point out, in this legislation \nthere is no requirement that workers must use majority sign-up, or \ncard-check. I am a supporter of card check. I think it would open up \nopportunities for people to speak on the issue of whether they want to \norganize. But we have not made that judgment in this legislation. That \nisn't what this legislation is about. It is always interesting to me to \nhear all the opposition to card check, when we know historically that \nwe used to have card check and it worked very well. Into the l950s, we \nhad it, and we didn't hear a lot of the horror stories that we hear \nassociated with it at this time. But there is not any requirement in \nthis bill about card check. So it is important people understand that.\n  During the course of the afternoon, I heard a description of this \nlegislation that I could not understand and never would have supported, \nif the legislation provided that. I hope we can clear up some of these \nmisconceptions. We have had a good discussion on a number of these \nissues and on a number of others during the course of the afternoon. We \nwill have a chance to go through the Record in more careful detail this \nevening, and make additional points when that opportunity presents \nitself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as the Senator from Tennessee prepares, I \nwish to make a couple of comments because I still haven't gotten to \ntalk about either the bill of rights or the unfunded mandate \namendments. I am equally as disturbed as the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas just described himself. Where he thinks that I don't understand it, \nI don't think he understands it. But we have never had a chance to work \nthis out as part of the committee. We come here to the floor, and here \nit is, kind of take it or leave it. Any amendment that we bring up is \ngoing to be considered to have been old and regurgitated. These are \nthings we have always had a concern for, especially when something is \nbeing thrust on States that have specifically addressed the particular \nissue and said no.\n  I know the Senator from Ohio had a lot of enthusiasm, but I don't \nthink we can connect collective bargaining with the Clean Air Act and \nthe Clean Water Act. Both sides are using some things that might be a \nlittle extraneous to what we are trying to achieve here. I do want \neveryone to pay particular attention to what is in the bill about the \nfinal and unprecedented authority of the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority. As the Senator from Massachusetts says, there are only four \nrequirements. Those are very vague requirements. There are many people \nwho work with this on a daily basis who have noted the vagueness of \nthese terms and how impossible it would be to deal under that criteria. \nNot to mention the fact that some of these States have not been subject \nto such ruled before, and after they make agreements, a Federal agency \nmay say: No, that is not good enough.\n  That is what we are mandating in this bill, asking a Federal agency \nthat we hardly ever hear about, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, \nto decide, even if a city and their first responders, police, and \nfirefighters say this is a contract we like, that group can override \nit. They can say: That is not good enough. I don't think that is the \nkind of Federal authority we should be trying to give to an agency that \nhasn't had that kind of authority.\n  I do have more to say, but the Senator from Tennessee is here. I \nwould love to hear his comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4761\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I don't expect that I \nwill object, but would the Senator withhold that request for a few more \nminutes?\n  Mr. CORKER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am sure we are going to accede to it, but there is \nsomething we want to check out.\n  Mr. CORKER. If it is OK to continue, I will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Please, I appreciate that.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, with the approval of the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, at the appropriate time I will send to the desk an \namendment to the pending legislation we are discussing. What this \namendment would do, in the spirit actually of what our distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts said, talking about giving States the \nability to do what they wish after this legislation passes, in that \nsame spirit, what this amendment would do is actually give each State \nor political subdivision the ability within 1 year of enactment of this \nlegislation, should it pass, to be able to override that and not have \nthis legislation apply to their State or to their political \nsubdivision.\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\n  I think this is very much actually in keeping with many of the \nstatements the Senator from Massachusetts made. I hope this amendment \npasses.\n  Let me say, in giving a background to this, I was a mayor of a city. \nI don't think I will ever have a job that I loved more than being the \nmayor of a city, working with citizens right there with the problems \nthey have to deal with, nor do I think there will ever be a group of \npeople I respect more than the firefighters and the men and women of \nour police departments who serve us so well. Like many people here, I \nhave attended funerals of policemen who have lost their lives in the \nline of duty. I have attended retirements and other meaningful events \nfor firefighters who spent their entire life giving public service to \nour cities. I don't think there is anybody in this body who respects \nmore what firefighters and police men and women do in their line of \nduty to protect each of us and deal with us. But I have also had to \ndeal with those issues at the local level where we have to balance a \nbudget, the same thing at the State level, something we here in \nWashington don't have to do. We don't have the financial constructs \nthat local municipalities and States have. They actually have to \ndeliver. I find it almost ironic that here in Washington we are going \nto mandate to the States, we are going to mandate to cities all across \nAmerica, how they should go about dictating labor agreements in their \nown cities and States. This is a tremendous overreach by those of us at \nthe Federal level.\n\n  I have yet to hear a good policy reason for this to be in place. \nStates and cities throughout our country, should they decide to \nincorporate collective bargaining in the area of public service, can do \nso if they wish.\n  This legislation certainly deserves defeat in its present mode. I \nhope this amendment, as it will be presented tomorrow, can be accepted \nand at least cause this legislation to give back to States and cities \nthe right to determine their own destiny as it relates to negotiating \nwith people who work in firefighting and police departments all across \nthe country.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent, again, to send the amendment to \nthe desk.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have no objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Corker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4761 to amendment No. 4751.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To permit States to pass laws to exempt such States from the \n                        provisions of this Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. STATE EXEMPTION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     provisions of this Act shall not apply to a State (or \n     political subdivision) that, within 1 year of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, enacts a law that specifically refutes \n     the provisions of this Act.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, very quickly, the effect of the Corker \namendment would be to gut or undermine the legislation. What we are \ntrying to do is give workers an opportunity to make a judgment about \nhow to proceed. That choice should be made by workers, not the Federal \nGovernment, not us here in Washington, DC, not in the State capitols, \nnot the legislatures, but to let the workers, who are on the \nfrontlines--firefighters, police officers, first responders--make the \njudgments that are going to make a difference in terms of their lives \nand in terms of their view of what is in the best interests of the \nsafety and security of fellow citizens. This amendment, of course, will \nundermine that effort.\n  Finally, I want to review what this legislation does. We have done \nthis a bit earlier today. I wanted to mention exactly what the \nrequirements would be. First, there are four requirements that the \nStates must meet to establish a framework by which the first responders \nand the firefighters and the police would make a judgment about whether \nthey want a union. There must be a process allowing workers to form or \njoin a union so they can have a voice in important decisions such as \nsafety; they must be allowed to bargain over working conditions with \ntheir employers; they must be able to sign legally enforceable \ncontracts; and they must have access to a neutral third party to help \nresolve disputes. We don't say whether it is arbitration, mediation, \nfactfinding. All of those options are available. At the end of the day, \nif the workers say: We don't want that, then the issue is settled. But \nthey have the voice. That is at the heart and the soul of this \nlegislation. Do you have sufficient confidence in these individuals to \nbe able to make that judgment. Those 343 extraordinary firefighters who \nlost their lives on 9/11, should they have had the opportunity to make \njudgments with regard to their safety and security? Shouldn't they be \nthe individuals who know what is important in terms of safety and \nsecurity? They weren't failing or flagging in terms of their resolution \nor their courage. What we are attempting to do is say: They are the \nknowledgeable people. They are the trained people. They are the ones \nwho know how to improve safety. They should have a voice at the table, \nif they want one.\n  All of this about unfunded mandates, all of this about the Federal \nLabor Relations Authority, all of the language about volunteer \nfirefighters, all of that is useful to talk about but misses the very \nbasic and important element and thrust of this legislation, which is so \nimportant in terms of people who work every day to make our communities \nand our cities in our country safe and secure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, again, I appreciate the words of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and do enjoy working with him on bills. I think I \nhave been pretty cooperative in getting bills through committee, as he \nwas when I was the chairman.\n  Again, we have not had a chance to work on these amendments or on the \nbill together. We are having to do it separately, and there is a lot of \nrhetoric involved in this issue, and a lot of misunderstanding. Those \nare the kinds of things that get cleared up in a little closer working \nrelationship than you can get by addressing it on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  But I too was a mayor, and I was a mayor of a boomtown. Boomtowns \nattract young people, and young people are vivacious. They are busy. \nThey like to work hard, and they like to play hard. As a result, I had \na police department that had to handle some probably unique situations.\n  I had a volunteer fire department to work with, and we later combined \nthat with the county so we did not have disputes over whether a \nbuilding that was on fire was inside the city or outside the city. That \nhelped overcome a lot of difficulties there.\n  So I worked with the firefighters. I have worked with police. I \nworked with the sheriff's department. Again, we had that same boundary \nproblem when it came to: What is within the city limits and outside the \ncity limits, particularly when you have a fast-growing community; and \nwe did. And we do again. The energy boom is creating a fast-growing \ncommunity again.\n  I remember being at a crawfish boil almost a month ago. That is one \nof the highlights of the year for people who work particularly in the \noil patch, but actually people who work all over the community. It was \nstarted by some Cajuns from Louisiana who came up to work in the oil \npatch. They said: We ought to have a crawfish boil. They even figured \nout a reason for it. They said: If we can get somebody to donate the \nfood, and then we can charge people to come, we can put that in kind of \nan emergency fund for anything that happens to anybody. They did that. \nThe event still goes on 25 years later. They used to give the beer \naway. Now they sell the beer. That is worth about another $45,000 in \ndonations. But they did about 11,000 pounds of crawfish this year and \nfed about 5,000 people. At any one time, there were easily 3,500 people \nin the building. As you came in, you\n\n[[Page S4094]]\n\nhad to be approved as being over 21 in order to be able to buy that \nbeer. If you were over 21, you got this bright orange wristband, \nvirtually impossible to take off without cutting.\n  As I was enjoying my crawfish, I looked around the room and noticed \nthat almost everybody there had on one of these orange bands. But I \nalso noticed that they all looked like they were about 18 or 19. I knew \nthey were 21.\n  So, once again, we have a very young community of people who are \nworking hard and playing hard. That puts some extra stress on law \nenforcement. I respect the people who are in law enforcement. In fact, \nmy brother-in-law is a policeman in Gillette. He is the oldest person \nto ever go through the Wyoming law enforcement academy. He decided to \nbecome a policeman at the time most policemen are retiring, and he \nloves it. He enjoys it, and he does a good job with it. He has seen \nsome interesting situations and even been bitten by a person. But he \nloves his work. He does it well. But he has not asked me to mandate \ncollective bargaining. Neither did the people who worked for me when I \nwas mayor.\n  I would not have had the capability to do any particular additional \nthings for them because while it was a boom, it was an energy boom, and \nall the energy happened outside of the community. So we did not get any \ntax base off of that business--the business that was growing and \ncausing the city growth. We only got to tax what was inside the city \nlimits. We had to handle things such as sewer and water, streets, \ngarbage, police protection, and electricity. We even had our own \nelectrical utility.\n  I had to find water for people. They considered that to be the \nbiggest need. The only place we could get enough water to take care of \nthe population--we were already on water rationing when I took office--\nwas to go 42 miles away. The cost of that project--the interest alone \non the cost of that project exceeded all the revenue for the city of \nGillette. It did not leave me a lot of negotiating capability with \nanybody. It tied my hands significantly.\n  I had to come to New York City and prove that we would be able to pay \noff the water bonds. I had to go to New York to go to the rating \nagencies so we could get a good enough rating that I could get revenue \nso we could afford the whole thing. The ironic part of it was, it was \nwhen New York City was going broke. New York City was going broke. \nMayor Lindsay was having a few problems with the city. The questions I \ngot were very difficult to handle for a small town in Wyoming because \nthey were basing them on a big city in New York. They wanted to know if \nwe were going to run into the same problems New York City had.\n  Well, the big problem that New York City had was that they bargained \nearly retirement for firefighters and police, so they only had to work \n20 years until they could get their retirements. So they worked for 20 \nyears. They were only 40 years old. They had two people retired for \nevery one person who was working. It is hard to provide police \nprotection if you have twice as many people retired as you have \nworking, and you have to pay all of these people who are not working \ntheir retirement. It created a huge problem for New York. They did not \nneed us to say: You have to have collective bargaining, because they \nalready had collective bargaining. So we did not have collective \nbargaining. I was able to explain why our policemen would work a little \nbit longer and be a productive part of the police force longer than in \nNew York City. I got the rating I needed on the bonds and was able to \nbuild the water project. It has been a good source--and still is a good \nsource--of water. But now the town has had another one of those booms \nwhere they probably doubled or maybe tripled in size. That will require \na lot more water. Water is a basic need for communities. So I do not \nfeel comfortable imposing on them any kind of requirements of how they \nare supposed to do their business. They are right there where the \npeople are. They are in the best position to know what the community \nneeds and wants the most.\n\n  When I was mayor, I used to talk about the ``oh, by the ways.'' That \nis when you are walking down the street or you are out to dinner, even \nwith your family, and people come up and say: Oh, by the way, I have \nthis little problem. Don't get up and solve it right now. Tomorrow will \nbe fine. But they do intend for you to solve that problem by tomorrow.\n  Now, the whole discussion today has made it sound as though \nmunicipalities are enemies of public service and public safety \nemployees. I do not know of any communities where that is true. To make \nit sound as though the whole country works against the policeman, \nagainst the fireman, against the first responders because there is not \na collective bargaining law, is wrong. There is an old expression: You \ncan't fight city hall. My opinion of that is, if you can't, you never \ntried it. Because the people at city hall are responsive. The mayors \nand the council keep their job if they take care of the problems the \npeople have. If they do not, they are out of there--probably not just \none at a time, but en masse. They do not try to pick out exactly who \nmade the bad decisions; they just get rid of them. So towns have to be \nresponsive to all of their employees.\n  As I said before, I think there are probably a lot of employees out \nthere who say: How come I am not important? How come just the \nfirefighters, just the police, just the first responders are important? \nI am important too, and this leaves me out.\n  So we are trying to make some points while a big public relations \nevent is going on here this week. I finally figured out that is why \nthis bill has been brought up at this time, even though it has not gone \nthrough committee or had any hearings in the Senate. On bills that came \nbefore this committee before, we tried to avoid the heat of the moment \nbecause I have found in legislating, if it is worth reacting to, it is \nworth overreacting to. I think what we have here is a little bit of an \noverreaction, and there is not going to be much chance to make any \nchanges in it.\n  I have been kind of keeping track of time here. I know we had about \nthe same number of speakers, but we certainly did not have the same \namount of time to speak. I also know the leader also already sent out \nthe word there were not going to be any more votes today. Well, since \nwe have not gotten to address this bill before with the rest of the \nbody, I have asked all of them to pay attention to the amendments we \nare doing. But I would hesitate to offer any more amendments when I \nknow everybody has gone home. They are all out to dinner by now.\n  I do not think this is the way we should try to do business. I do not \nthink it was intentional. But I think it certainly puts us at a \ndisadvantage when we are trying to bring up some things that point out \nsome difficulties with this particular bill--offering some responsible \namendments, regardless of how they are portrayed.\n  So with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we have had a good discussion \ntoday on this legislation. I hope we will have a chance to look over \nthe Record tonight. We have four pending amendments. We understood \nMembers wanted to talk about these measures, and they wanted to give \nconsideration to them. So we will be ready. There is another group of \namendments that I believe have been filed, but we are checking with \ntheir authors whether they want to call those up. So I think in the \ntotality of things we have made some good progress today.\n  I understand we will be on this legislation in the mid or late \nmorning tomorrow. We look forward to that opportunity to further \nrespond to questions and to consider other amendments. We would \ncertainly look forward to the authors of these amendments being ready \nto give consideration to voting on some of these measures. I think they \nare all--at least the amendments we have seen--pretty straightforward. \nI have responded to a few this afternoon. We will have a chance to \nfurther respond in the morning. But I think we will be prepared to keep \nthe process moving and move ahead. There are matters which should\n\n[[Page S4095]]\n\nbe discussed and debated. We look forward to that debate and discussion \nas well tomorrow.\n  At least now, we have no further speakers on this legislation at this \ntime. I see our friend from Iowa on his feet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4095-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, about a month ago on my Web site, which \nis sanders.senate.gov, I requested that Vermonters e-mail me about what \nthe collapse of the middle class means to them personally--not in \nesoteric economic terms but in a sense of what they are going through.\n  Frankly, we are a small State, and our people are pretty reticent. \nPeople in Vermont don't like to open up and tell everybody all of the \nproblems they have. They try to keep it to themselves. We expected that \nwe would receive perhaps a few dozen replies. In fact, over the last \nmonth, we have received some 700 e-mails that came into my office \ntalking about how people in the middle class today are trying \ndesperately to survive. About 90 percent of the e-mails came from the \nState of Vermont. We have had a number from around the rest of the \ncountry.\n  I sometimes think that many of our colleagues here really don't have \nmuch of a clue about what is going on in the real world. It is no great \nsecret that the Halls of Congress are filled with lobbyists who make \nhundreds of thousands of dollars a year representing the energy \ncompanies, the coal companies, the oil companies, the drug companies, \nthe insurance companies, the banks, and the credit card companies. They \nare all over the place, and they try to influence--and are successful \nin many instances--in influencing Congress to pass legislation that \nprotects the interests of multinational corporations or the wealthiest \npeople in this country. It is far too rare that we hear the pain and \nthe reality of life that is going on among ordinary people, especially \npeople who come from a rural State such as mine.\n  What I wish to do is spend most of my time doing nothing more than \njust reading to my colleagues and for the American people some of the \nreality that takes place in a small, rural State which I think is not \nradically different from what is taking place today all over this \ncountry. All of these are verbatim e-mails that I received from \nfamilies in the State of Vermont. Let me begin by reading one which \nsays:\n\n       I make less than $35,000 a year and work hard to earn it. I \n     am trying to get by with rising costs of fuel. I have a wife \n     and four kids that I love dearly and I am trying to do the \n     best that I can for them. With the cost of gas pushing $4 a \n     gallon and the price of heating oil up to over $4 a gallon, \n     it is hard to make ends meet. On top of that, the furnace \n     that heats the house and keeps my kids warm died today, and \n     while it will not need to run much longer, the nights are \n     still too cold for a 3-year-old. I am not sure how I am going \n     to pay for the repairs. I never thought that I would be \n     classified as poor having grown up in an upper middle class \n     family, but that is where I am now. I don't know what we need \n     to do, but I know we need to do something before the middle \n     class is a thing of the past.\n  As I read these stories, what you are going to hear today in the year \n2008 is that children are going cold in America, and we have to \nunderstand that. This is one example. I will read more. Anyone who \nthinks it is not true doesn't know what is going on in the real world. \nHere is another e-mail that I received:\n\n       I am a teacher with 20 years of experience, and I have a \n     master's degree. As a single parent, I am struggling every \n     day to put food on the table.\n\n  This is a teacher with a masters degree.\n\n       Our clothes all come from thrift stores. I have a 5-year-\n     old car that needs work. My son is gifted and talented. I \n     tried to sell my house to enroll him in a school that had \n     curriculum available for his special needs. After two years \n     on the market, my house never sold. The property taxes have \n     nearly doubled in 10 years, and the price of heating oil is \n     prohibitive. To meet the needs of my son, I let the house sit \n     and moved into an apartment near his high school. I don't go \n     to church many Sundays because the gasoline is too expensive \n     to drive there.\n\n  Now, I wonder how many people all over this country are facing that \nsame reality. I will read right from her letter:\n\n       I don't go to church many Sundays because the gasoline is \n     too expensive to drive there.\n       Every thought of an activity is dependent on the cost. I \n     can only purchase food from dented can stores. I don't know \n     how I can continue this way for two more years of my son's \n     high school; yet, I am trying to meet his academic and \n     psychological needs. I know that I will never be able to \n     retire on a teacher's retirement with no insurance. I am \n     stretched to the breaking point, with no help in sight.\n\n  That is a teacher with a master's degree. This is not somebody who is \nunemployed, who never graduated high school. This is solid middle \nclass. This is her reality.\n  Here is another story:\n\n       My wife and I live in rural Vermont. We own a home and make \n     about $75,000 a year combined.\n\n  That is, in Vermont, not a bad income.\n\n       We own two vehicles and travel about 74 miles a day \n     roundtrip to get to our jobs. Not only is the price of gas \n     killing us, I have been displaced from two jobs in the last \n     nine years due to the exportation of jobs overseas. My \n     current job is in jeopardy of being downsized due to the \n     economy. Every job I have had since I moved here in 1999 has \n     paid less, with less benefits. We are spending our life \n     savings just to make ends meet.\n\n  When you read these stories, you hear recurring themes: The price of \ngas and people losing jobs due to outsourcing. Over and over again, \nthese themes appear. I want to reiterate that these are not ``poor'' \npeople, homeless people, people without any education. These are people \nwho once considered themselves to be part of the American middle class. \nSimilar to millions and millions of other people, that middle-class \nlife is rapidly disappearing.\n  Here is another one:\n\n       I work full-time at the largest hospital in Vermont. I am \n     in more debt now than I was 10 years ago as a single mother \n     going full time to college and waitressing to make ends meet. \n     When is something going to be done to lower gas prices, which \n     have exponentially raised the cost of everything? I would \n     love to just tell my children, ``Yes, we can go out to the \n     movies'' and not have it break the bank.\n\n  In other words, what you are seeing all over this country is for \npeople who take a ride to church or go to the movies, they can no \nlonger perform these basic joys of life because they cannot afford to \ndo that anymore.\n  Here is another letter:\n\n       My husband and I have lived in Vermont our whole lives. We \n     have two small children (a baby and a toddler) and felt \n     fortunate to own our own house and land, but due to the \n     increasing fuel prices we have at times had to choose between \n     baby food, diapers, and heating fuel. We've run out of \n     heating fuel 3 times so far, and the baby has ended up in the \n     hospital with pneumonia 2 of the times. We try to keep the \n     kids warm with an electric space heater on those nights, but \n     that just doesn't do the trick.\n       My husband does what he can just to scrape enough money for \n     car fuel each week, and we've gone from 3 vehicles to 1 just \n     to try and get by without going further into debt. We were \n     going to sell the house and rent, but the rent around here is \n     higher than what we pay for our monthly mortgage and property \n     taxes combined. Please help.\n\n  This is the story in America in 2008--a family not having enough heat \nand their child getting pneumonia. This is the United States of America \nin 2008. She asks, ``Please help.'' Well, let's help.\n  This is from north central Vermont:\n\n       Due to illness, my ability to work has been severely \n     limited. I am making $10 an hour and if I am lucky, I get 35 \n     hours a week of work. At this time, I am only getting 20 \n     hours as it is ``off season'' in Stowe.\n\n  That is a major recreation area in Vermont.\n\n       It does not take a mathematician to do the figures. How are \n     my wife and I supposed to\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\n     live on a monthly take home income of less than $800. We do \n     it by spending our hard-earned retirement savings. I am 50 \n     and my wife is 49. At the rate we are going, we will be \n     destitute in just a few years. The situation is so dire that \n     it is all that I can think about.\n\n  Listen to this:\n\n       Soon, I will have to start walking to work, an 8 mile round \n     trip, because the price of energy is so high it is that or go \n     without heat.\n\n  In the United States of America, in 2008, somebody will be walking 4 \nmiles to work and 4 miles back. The alternative is not having enough \nmoney to heat their home.\n\n       As bad as our situation is, I know many in worse shape. We \n     try to donate food when we do our weekly shopping, but now we \n     are not able to even afford to help our neighbors eat. What \n     has this country come to?\n\n  Imagine that, having to walk 4 miles to work, and they donate food \nfor other people who are worse off than they are.\n  Here is one from a single mother in a small town in southern Vermont:\n\n       I am a single mother with a 9-year-old boy. We lived this \n     past winter without any heat at all.\n\n  In Vermont in the wintertime.\n\n       Fortunately, someone gave me an old wood stove. I had to \n     hook it up to an old, unused chimney we had in the kitchen. I \n     couldn't even afford a chimney liner (the price of liners \n     went up with the price of fuel). To stay warm at night, my \n     son and I would pull off all the pillows from the couch and \n     pile them on the kitchen floor. I'd hang a blanket from the \n     kitchen doorway and we'd sleep right there on the floor. By \n     February, we ran out of wood and I burned my mother's dining \n     room furniture. I have no oil for hot water. We boil our \n     water on the stove and pour it in the tub. I'd like to order \n     one of your flags and hang it upside down at the capital \n     building. We are certainly a country in distress.\n\n  This is a gentleman from another town in southern Vermont:\n\n       I make less than $35,000 a year and work hard to earn that. \n     I am trying to get by with the rising cost of fuel. I have a \n     wife and four kids that I love dearly and am trying to do the \n     best I can for them. We do receive help from the State, but I \n     would like to be able to make it without that help.\n\n  He would like to do it without that help.\n\n       With the cost of gas pushing $4 a gallon and price of \n     heating oil up over $4 a gallon, it is hard to make ends \n     meet.\n       On the top of that, the furnace that heats the house and \n     keeps my kids warm died today, and while it will not need to \n     run much longer this winter, the nights are still too cold \n     for a three year old, and I have next winter to look forward \n     to. I am not sure how I am going to pay for the repairs.\n\n  Here is another from a woman from a small town in central Vermont:\n\n       My husband and I followed all the rules. He grew up in \n     urban projects and went into the military with Vietnam \n     service so he could get GI Bill benefits and go to college. I \n     grew up picking strawberries as a migrant worker but had a \n     mother who so pressed education that I was able to go to \n     college on scholarship and by working full time nights in a \n     mental hospital. My husband and I worked hard to buy a home, \n     maintain good credit, even taking government jobs because we \n     truly wanted to help others. I became disabled and unable to \n     work, but we managed to live a middle class life on one \n     salary.\n       Slowly, though, we have sunk back to the ``poor'' days. Our \n     heating oil bill, gas prices, food prices--well, you know the \n     story. Even a pizza is a splurge now. The interest on our \n     meager savings doesn't seem worth keeping the money in the \n     bank. We're so much more fortunate than many others, since we \n     can still meet our bills, but we're scared that we will drop \n     beneath that level soon. It doesn't seem right that after \n     working hard and following all the rules for our lives, now, \n     at 60, we're tumbling down.\n\n  Here is an e-mail from a Vermonter from a small town near the New \nHampshire border:\n\n       Dear Senator Sanders: First, let me thank you for all of \n     the support and rallying behind the middle class you have \n     done. I, too, have been struggling to overcome the increasing \n     cost of gas, heating oil, food, taxes, etc. I have to say \n     that this is the toughest year, financially, that I have ever \n     experienced in my 41 years on this earth. I have what used to \n     be considered a decent job. I work hard, pinch my pennies, \n     but the pennies have all but dried up. I am thankful that \n     my employer understands that many of us cannot afford to \n     drive to work five days a week. Instead, I work three 15-\n     hour days. I have taken odd jobs to try to make ends meet.\n       This winter, after keeping the heat just high enough to \n     keep my pipes from bursting (the bedrooms are not heated and \n     never got above 30 degrees), I began selling off my \n     woodworking tools, snowblower (pennies on the dollar), and \n     furniture that had been handed down in my family from the \n     early 1800s, just to keep the heat on.\n       Today, I am sad, broken, and very discouraged. I am \n     thankful that the winter cold is behind us for a while, but \n     now gas prices are rising yet again. I just can't keep up.\n\n  This is from a mother in a town near the Canadian border:\n\n       I am a single mother of 4. Each day the struggle becomes \n     more difficult. Thank goodness for Spring. My last oil \n     delivery was $500. I spend over $200 a month on gas just \n     driving back and forth to work (approximately 300 miles a \n     week).\n\n  Sometimes what some of my colleagues don't understand is that in \nrural parts of America, people don't walk to work, they don't take a \ncar ride of 5 minutes. Sometimes people drive 50 miles to work. \nSometimes they drive 100 miles to work. When gasoline costs $3.70 a \ngallon, every nickel of the pay raise they may have gotten goes right \ninto that gas tank.\n\n       We have cut our budget again and again. There is little \n     left to cut. Spring and Summer brings a respite from the fuel \n     bills of winter, but I worry what next winter will bring. I \n     will have to dig into my small 401(k) to make some home \n     repairs this summer. Money that had been set aside went to \n     fuel, an electric bill that increased by 14%, and food.\n\n  I read these letters because sometimes in the middle of the debates \nwe have here, everybody is spouting off all kinds of facts and figures \nand ideas. I thought it important to bring a little bit of reality of \nwhat is going on in middle-class Vermont. I have to say I doubt very \nmuch that it is any different than middle-class New Jersey or any other \nState in this country. People are hurting. Poverty is increasing. The \nmiddle class is collapsing. The only people in our economy who are \ndoing well are the people at the very top, and they are doing extremely \nwell.\n  Many of the stories we have heard deal with high energy prices. I \nbelieve that what happened is that while the middle class has been \nshrinking for many years now, these high energy prices have resulted in \na lot of people now dropping over the cliff. They were struggling and \ntrying to keep their heads above water and, suddenly, out of nowhere, \ncomes $3.70 for a gallon of gas and $4 for home heating oil. That has \ntaken them over the edge.\n  That is one of the reasons 82 percent of the American people think \nour country is moving in the wrong direction. What do we do? There is a \nlot we can do.\n  Let me focus on energy. The good news is that today, thankfully, 97 \nSenators voted to stop the Bush administration from continuing the \nabsurd policy of adding 70,000 barrels of oil a day into the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, which is already 97 percent full. Is that going to \nresult in a precipitous drop in gasoline prices? No. Will it help? Yes. \nI applaud my colleagues for doing that.\n  I find it interesting that 97 of our colleagues voted for this today, \nwhen 2 or 3 weeks ago we were wondering whether we had the votes to get \nthis through. I think many of our colleagues are hearing, when they go \nhome, that people are in trouble. They are hearing the same stories I \nam hearing, and they are hearing people want them to begin to stand up \nto the Bush administration, stand up to the oil companies, stand up to \nthe speculators, stand up to the people who are ripping them off while \ntheir lifestyle is rapidly declining.\n  What we did today is a good thought, but, clearly, we have a long way \nto go. I am onboard legislation, which we discussed a little bit today, \nwhich demands that President Bush tell Saudi Arabia it is not \nacceptable that they have cut back on their oil production, that it is \nimperative they increase oil production so we can have more oil on the \nmarket, which will lower gas and oil prices.\n  In addition to that, I believe the time is long overdue that we start \ndealing with the reality that OPEC is, by definition, a cartel \ndesigned, created to restrict trade, to collude to limit oil production \noutput, and to make prices higher than they need be. We have to take a \nhard look at OPEC and begin to demand that this President go to the WTO \nand break up OPEC.\n  Furthermore, it is very clear that at a time when oil prices are \nsoaring, it is, in my view, absolutely necessary that we impose a \nwindfall profits tax on the oil and gas industry. The American people \ndo not understand why they are paying recordbreaking prices at the gas \npump while ExxonMobil has made more profits than any company in the \nhistory of the world for the past 2 consecutive years.\n  Last year alone, ExxonMobil made $40 billion in profits and rewarded \nits CEO with $21 million in total compensation. Just a few years ago,\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\nExxonMobil gave its former CEO a $400 million retirement package--a \n$400 million retirement package and people in Vermont and all over this \ncountry are unable to fill up their gas tanks or heat their homes.\n  But ExxonMobil is not alone. Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and BP \nhave also been making out like bandits. In fact, the five largest oil \ncompanies in this country have made over $600 billion in profits since \nPresident Bush has been in office.\n  Last year alone, the major oil companies in the United States made \nover $155 billion in profits. Believe it or not, these profits continue \nto soar. Recently, ExxonMobil reported a 17-percent increase in \nprofits, totaling $10.9 billion. Earlier, BP announced a 63-percent \nincrease in profits and on and on it goes. Every major oil company is \nseeing a significant increase in their profits. Meanwhile, what these \nbig oil companies do with all their revenue is they have the capability \nof providing their CEOs with lavish compensation. In 2006, Occidental \nPetroleum gave its CEO, Ray Irani, $400 million in total compensation \nfor 1 year of work.\n  My friends, when you are going to fill up your gas tanks at $3.75 a \ngallon, let's remember, the gentleman who runs Occidental managed to \nsurvive last year on $400 million in total compensation.\n  Last year, Anadarko Petroleum's CEO received $26.7 million; Chevron's \nCEO received $15.7 million; and ConocoPhillips' CEO made $15.1 million \nin total compensation.\n  Let's be clear, I believe oil companies should be allowed to make \nreasonable profits, and CEOs of big oil companies should be able to \nmake a reasonable compensation. But at a time when so many Americans \nare struggling to make ends meet and when people cannot afford the \noutrageously high prices they are now forced to pay, these kinds of \nexecutive compensations are to me totally unacceptable.\n  It is not just the oil companies that are ripping off the American \npeople. There is a lot of evidence, and there have been hearings held \non this issue, that wealthy speculators and hedge fund managers have \nbeen making obscene amounts of money by driving up the price of oil in \nunregulated energy markets with absolutely no Government oversight. The \ntop 50 hedge fund managers earned $29 billion in income last year.\n  What we are seeing now is not only oil company greed driving up \nprices, but we are seeing financial institutions and hedge funds \nspeculating on oil futures also driving up the price of oil. This is an \nissue that must be dealt with in a number of ways, including repealing \nthe so-called Enron loophole.\n  I conclude by saying what I think the American people know. They know \nour middle class is in deep distress, that people who have worked their \nwhole lives hoping to enjoy a secure retirement are not going to have \nthat retirement. We have heard from young people who are very worried \nabout how, if ever, they are going to be able to pay off their very \nhigh college loans, and we heard about other people who cannot afford \nto go to college.\n  The time is very much overdue for the Congress to stop listening to \nthe oil companies, the speculators, the banks, and the credit card \ncompanies and all these people who make huge sums of money and who pay \ntheir CEOs obscene compensation packages and start listening to \nordinary Americans who, to a great degree, are not having their voices \nheard. That is what our job is. That is what we swore to do when we \nswore to uphold the Constitution. I think we swore to uphold the needs \nof the American people.\n  I hope we can move forward in addressing the energy crisis short \nterm. Long term, of course, we need to transform our energy system away \nfrom fossil fuels and foreign oil into energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy. I know you and I, Mr. President, have worked on a \nnumber of pieces of legislation that will move this country in that \ndirection, and that is what we have to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4097-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Sergeant First Class Lawrence D. Ezell\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of a \nsoldier whose work defusing bombs and traps in Iraq and Afghanistan \nsaved countless American, Iraqi, and Afghani lives. Army SFC Lawrence \nEzell, of Fountain, CO--a hero by all standards--was killed on April 30 \nwhen a roadside bomb detonated near his unit. Assigned to the 62nd \nOrdnance Company, 71st Ordnance Group, out of Fort Carson, Sergeant \nEzell was 30 years old.\n  I know of no words that can properly honor Lawrence Ezell's sacrifice \nor measure the depth of his courage. Serving in an ordnance company \nrequires a fortitude, a strength of mind, and a professionalism that \nfew possess and even fewer are brave enough to summon for the task. It \nis a job with no room for error and no respite from danger. It demands \na steady hand. It requires even steadier wits.\n  Sergeant First Class Ezell performed his job day in and day out in \nthe most dangerous places in the world. In 2003 and 2004, he was in \nIraq. In 2005 and 2006, he was in Afghanistan. And this time he was \nback in Baghdad, trying to bring a measure of calm to its violent \nstreets.\n  We cannot know how many American servicemembers are alive today \nthanks to Sergeant Ezell's work, or how many Iraqi or Afghani citizens \nwere saved from a devastating blast. We do know, however, how talented \nSergeant Ezell was, and what a gifted leader he proved to be. He was \nhighly decorated for his service. His awards included the Bronze Star, \nthe Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, and the Senior \nExplosive Ordnance Disposal Badge.\n  He was the type of soldier who has earned the admiration and praise \nof our Nation, generation after generation. He was the type of soldier \nwho Douglas MacArthur hailed in a 1962 address to cadets at West Point. \nThe type of soldier who ``prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear \nthe deepest wounds and scars of war.'' The type of soldier who typifies \nthe creed of ``duty, honor, and country.''\n  ``In twenty campaigns,'' General MacArthur told the cadets, ``on a \nhundred battlefields, around a thousand campfires, I have witnessed \nthat enduring fortitude, that patriotic self-abnegation, and that \ninvincible determination which have carved his statue in the hearts of \nhis people. From one end of the world to the other, he has drained deep \nthe chalice of courage.''\n  Sergeant Ezell's chalice of courage must have been bottomless. There \nis no other way to explain how a man can rise each morning, thousands \nof miles from his family, step into streets torn by sectarian strife, \nand put his life on the line to defuse bombs, day after day. He was a \npeacemaker in a land of great turmoil.\n  To Sergeant Ezell's wife Christina, his parents Rebecca and Lawrence, \nand all his family and friends, our thoughts and prayers are with you. \nSergeant Ezell's humbling service was beyond anything a nation can \nexpect from its citizens. You can be certain that his country will \nnever forget him, and never cease to honor his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4097-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4097-S4098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, 10 Louisiana law enforcement officers \nwere killed in the line of duty this past year, and they are being \nrecognized in Washington this week as part of National Police Week. I \nwelcome their families and colleagues to the Nation's Capital. These \nofficers lost their lives while serving their communities and are being \nhonored for their courage and the ultimate sacrifice they made to serve \nand protect the citizens of Louisiana.\n  National Police Week is collaborative effort to honor the service and \nsacrifice of America's law enforcement community and includes the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, NLEOMF, the Fraternal \nOrder of Police/Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary, FOP/FOA, and the \nConcerns of Police Survivors, COPS.\n  Officers from around the country and the families of fallen officers \ntravel to Washington, DC, for events including the Peace Officers \nMemorial Day Service at the U.S. Capitol and the National Police \nSurvivor's Conference. In addition, the names of our 10 Louisiana \nheroes will be engraved on the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial along with 348 other names from around the country. The names \nwill also be read at a candlelight vigil at the memorial this week.\n  The following brave police officers and Sheriff's deputies gave their \nlives\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\nto protect our Louisiana communities: Patrolman Brian Keith Coleman, \nAlexandria Police Department; Detective Thelonious Anthony Dukes, Sr., \nNew Orleans Police Department; Sergeant R. Alan Inzer, Calcasieu Parish \nSheriff's Office; Deputy Hilery Alexander Mayo, Jr., St. Tammany Parish \nSheriff's Office; Deputy Joshua E.

They put themselves in \nharm's way each day so that the rest of us may live safely and \npeacefully in a free society. There is no group more deserving of our \nfull support, and the truth is, our Federal Government has not done \nenough to care for and honor these officers, their families, and their \nsacrifice.\n  National Police Week provides an opportunity for us to reflect on our \nlaw enforcement officers' contributions to building safe and productive \ncommunities in Louisiana and across the country. I ask the Senate to \njoin me in honoring these 10 Louisiana fallen officers, their families, \nand their colleagues across the country for their unwavering service \nand dedication to keeping us safe.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish today to commemorate the hard \nwork and sacrifices made daily by law enforcement officers all across \nour great land. Many officers have lost their lives in the line of duty \nso that our families and communities may remain safe. We must never \nforget those who have given their lives to protect us all.\n  In 1962 President John F. Kennedy first declared the annual \ncelebration of Peace Officers Memorial Day and National Police Week in \n``recognition of the service given by the men and women who, night and \nday, stand guard in our midst to protect us through enforcement of our \nlaws.''\n  Since then, many men and women have paid the ultimate price for our \nsecurity, including many brave New Mexicans. This year, two New Mexico \npolice officers will be honored and remembered by having their names \nadded to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, \nDC.\n  The first, Patrolman Germaine F. Casey of Albuquerque, was tragically \nkilled in a motorcycle accident while he was a part of the police \nescort for President George W. Bush's trip to Albuquerque, NM, on \nAugust 27, 2007. Patrolman Casey was an officer with the Rio Rancho \nPolice Department and had previously served as an officer with the \nUniversity of New Mexico Police for 2 years.\n  Also being honored this week is Officer Christopher M. Mirabal of \nAlamogordo, who passed away as a result of injuries sustained in a \nmotor vehicle accident while on duty as a New Mexico State police \nofficer on July 13, 2007. Officer Mirabal was a lifelong resident of \nAlamogordo and like Patrolman Casey, worked to protect New Mexicans, \nincluding the families they left behind.\n  This week we remember the dedication of Patrolman Casey and Officer \nMirabal and all of our fallen police men and women who protect and \nserve our communities, and the tragic price they paid for that \ndevotion. We must also remember the families of all fallen officers and \nthe sacrifices they have incurred because of a deep-seated commitment \nto duty and public service. All of us from New Mexico owe a debt of \ngratitude to each and every officer who has lost their life in the line \nof duty. To those who continue to serve, we are grateful.

Mr. President. This month we are celebrating one of the \ngreatest achievements of the 20th century--the founding of the modern \nState of Israel.\n  The story of Israel is unique. A people forced into exile, who \nendured centuries of persecution, rebuilt their ancient homeland. They \nforged a nation where they could practice their ancient faith and \ntraditions. They created an open and free democratic society. And \nalways, they offer a home to Jewish immigrants from around the world.\n  The founding of Israel followed the most incomprehensible and evil \nevent of the 20th century, when the Nazis--with the complicity of so \nmany others--sought to exterminate a people. The survivors of the \nHolocaust helped to build modern Israel. Never again will the Jewish \npeople be dependent on anyone else for their security.\n  At first Israelis envisioned an agrarian society. But today, Israel \nis a center for technology and science. American scientists and \nengineers are working as partners with Israelis to develop the \ninnovations of the future. Our great Federal Laboratories, like the \nNational Institutes of Health, are now working with Israeli scientists \non a cure for cancer and other deadly diseases. Together America and \nIsrael are working toward a future that is safer, stronger, and \nsmarter.\n  America's relationship with Israel is also unique. We share common \ngoals, values, and interests. We stand by each other in good times and \nbad.\n  Israel has had to endure many wars and live in constant readiness for \nbattle. They live with the constant threat of terrorism. Yet the people \nof Israel are strong and resolute. They are committed to building a \nsafer and more peaceful future.\n  On this anniversary, all friends of Israel should recommit ourselves \nto ensuring the survivability and viability of the State of Israel, now \nand forever. Our friendship is based on shared values, shared \ninterests, and strategic necessity. My support for Israel is unabashed \nand unwavering. I will continue to be a voice for Israel and a vote for \nIsrael in the United States Senate.\n  Mr. President, I salute the people of Israel as they celebrate 60 \nyears of independence, and I look forward to a future of peace, \nprosperity, and friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4098-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4098-S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President. I wish to speak about Government barriers \nto competition in the aviation sector. Like many of my colleagues, I am \ndisappointed that the Senate was unable to pass the legislation \nreauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration last week. This is a \ndifficult and dynamic time for the aviation industry, and it is \nimportant that Congress review and update our Nation's aviation \npolicies.\n  Rising ticket prices and increasing delays have made the flying \nexperience more unpleasant for many travelers. Any inefficiencies \nintroduced into the system only serve to exacerbate such problems. \nTherefore, I believe it is important that Congress reduce barriers to \ncompetition whenever possible so that the marketplace can best serve \nconsumers and the public interest.\n  One issue that needs to be addressed is how Government-imposed slot \ncontrols at a handful of U.S. airports effectively bar the entry of new \nairline competitors at those airports. These federally regulated slot \ncontrols are intended to reduce congestion-related delays; this \ncongestion mitigation, however, comes at the expense of open \ncompetition.\n  Once slots at an airport have been doled out to the airlines, it \nbecomes very difficult for new entrant carriers to break into the \nairport because the market has essentially been closed. Airlines with \nlimited operations at these airports face similar problems should they \nwish to increase their presence in an effort to compete with the larger \nairlines. Because the marketplace has been artificially constrained, \nthis leads to higher ticket prices and fewer flight options for \ntravelers.\n  It has been proven time and again that prices go down and flight \noptions go up when airlines are allowed to freely compete. The \nDepartment of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration \nshould take every step possible to ensure that competition can flourish \nat these slot-controlled airports. As these agencies administer \ncongestion programs, I hope that they will develop mechanisms that will \nallow for new entrants to compete with\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\nthe more entrenched airlines at these airports. If they are unable to \ndo so, it may be up to us in Congress to provide them with legislative \nguidance to ensure a more open marketplace.\n  Another arbitrary barrier that Congress should address is the \noutdated perimeter restriction at Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport. For over 40 years, Federal law has restricted flights at \nReagan National and delayed the arrival of competition at the airport. \nWith Senator Boxer and Senator McCain, I introduced an amendment to the \nFAA reauthorization bill to revise Reagan National's outdated perimeter \nrestriction.\n  The American flying public has shown strong demand for more flights \nbetween the Western United States and the Washington, DC, area. \nUnfortunately, the perimeter rule prevents airlines from responding to \nthat demand by largely prohibiting flights to western cities such as \nSan Francisco, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, and Seattle. Revising the \nReagan National perimeter restriction would help free-market \ncompetition, directly benefiting consumers. While I am disappointed \nthat the FAA reauthorization bill was pulled from the floor before my \namendment could be considered, I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to find a way to revise the perimeter restriction so that \nair service between the West and Reagan National is increased in a \nmarket-based manner.\n  We owe it to the American flying public to squeeze every last bit of \nefficiency out of our aviation system. As the Senate considers aviation \nissues in the future, I hope my colleagues will work together to reduce \nthe artificial barriers to competition created by well-intentioned yet \nburdensome Government regulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4099-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LARRY TRIBE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, most of us in Congress know Larry Tribe \nas the highly regarded expert on constitutional law at Harvard Law \nSchool who has been so helpful to us for decades on the many important \nconstitutional issues we often deal with in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  But another side of Larry came to light last month in a very moving \nfront-page article of the ``Scope'' section in the April 16 Shanghai \nDaily newspaper in China.\n  Shanghai is Larry's birthplace and he recently returned there for the \nfirst time for the Harvard Alumni Association's ``Global Conference in \nShanghai.'' He was interviewed by a reporter for the newspaper during \nthe visit.\n  As the article states, Larry was born in Shanghai in October 1941. \nHis father was a Russian American who had been living in northeastern \nChina where he had met his wife. When war broke out between China and \nJapan in the 1930s, they moved to Shanghai to be safer, because the \ncity welcomed Jewish refugees. The Japanese occupied Shanghai, however, \nand after Pearl Harbor, Japanese soldiers arrested Larry's father and \nheld him in a concentration camp because of his American citizenship. \nLarry and his mother were not allowed to visit him until near the end \nof the war, and after the war, the family came to the United States.\n  During those early years in China, Larry attended kindergarten at the \nShanghai American school. He remembers that when he finally saw the \nconcentration camp, he was shocked by its harsh conditions, and he says \nthe experience may have influenced his decision years later to become a \nlawyer involved in fighting for justice and human rights.\n  As the author of the article, Yan Zhen, writes, ``Who would have \nthought a frightened little boy who once ran through the streets of \nShanghai during World War II would go on to become one of the most \nrevered legal minds in the United States?''\n  Mr. President, I believe all of us who know and work with Larry Tribe \nwill have even greater respect for him because of this extraordinary \npart of his life. He truly has lived the American Dream. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Shanghai Daily, Apr. 16, 2008]\n\n  A Life Spent in Search of Justice--Amazing Legal Mind Forged in Old \n                                Shanghai\n\n       Laurence Tribe is regarded as one of the foremost \n     constitutional law experts in the United States. The Jewish \n     professor's books on the subject are compulsory reading for \n     aspiring--and practicing--lawyers.\n       He was once voted the most admired living alumni of the \n     Harvard Law School where he is a professor while one of his \n     former research assistants was none other than US \n     presidential hopeful Barack Obama.\n       Tribe's life has been filled with achievements and \n     accolades--and much of it may have to do with his early years \n     in Shanghai. He may have lived here for just five and a half \n     years, but all of these years later Tribe readily \n     acknowledges it was a special experience that helped shape \n     his life.\n       After more than six decades, the premier scholar and lawyer \n     recently returned to his birthplace for the first time during \n     the Harvard Alumni Association's Global Conference in \n     Shanghai.\n       It was an incredible return to the city, he tells Shanghai \n     Daily in an exclusive interview. ``It was an amazing \n     homecoming,'' he says with some emotion.\n       Tribe was born in Shanghai in 1941 and remained here until \n     his family moved to the United States at the end of World War \n     II.\n       His father George Israel Tribe was a Russian American who \n     had lived in Harbin, capital of China's northeastern \n     Heilongjiang Province, where he met his wife Polia \n     Diatlovitsky during the war.\n       For safety reasons, the family moved south to Shanghai. But \n     just one day after the Japanese occupation of the city, \n     George Tribe was taken away by Japanese soldiers due to his \n     American citizenship and thrown into a concentration camp.\n       Only as the end of the war approached were young Tribe and \n     his mother allowed to visit his father at the camp which he \n     recalls was located on Suzhou Creek, near a tobacco factory.\n       ``I was quite struck by physical features of the camp,'' \n     Tribe recalls. ``My sense of justice rose . . . he didn't do \n     anything wrong, why should he be in such a place?''\n       Obviously Tribe was too young to understand what American \n     citizenship meant at the time and, being a little boy, he \n     simply felt it was unfair that his father had been thrown \n     behind bars.\n       ``Maybe that influenced my decision many years later to \n     become a lawyer interested in human rights,'' he says.\n       Tribe, 66, is widely regarded as the leading practitioner \n     and scholar of US constitutional law. He has helped draft the \n     constitutions of countries including Russia, South Africa, \n     the Czech Republic and the Marshall Islands.\n       At Harvard, where he has taught since 1968, Tribe achieved \n     a tenure professorship before the age of 30 and he was ranked \n     the most admired law professor still living in a survey of \n     more than 13,000 Harvard Law School alumni.\n       Tribe, who is also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts \n     and Sciences, says he has taught more than 25,000 students \n     over the past 40 years. Among them are John Roberts, the US \n     chief justice, and Obama, a current US presidential candidate \n     who worked as Tribe's research assistant for a year.\n       ``Amazing'' seemed to be the most frequent word used by \n     Tribe during his visit to Shanghai last month. Not just \n     because of the extraordinary development of the city but more \n     importantly, because he got the chance to track down the \n     residences where he once lived.\n       While having dinner at a friend's house, Tribe came across \n     a lady who helped his vague recollections of Shanghai when \n     she produced the 1941 Shanghai Directory.\n       The historic document recording members of the Jewish \n     community in Shanghai clearly showed that the Tribe family \n     had lived on Lafayette Avenue (now Fuxing Road) before later \n     moving in to the Picardie Apartments (now the Hengshan Hotel) \n     on Hengshan Road.\n       Records also showed Tribe attended kindergarten at the \n     Shanghai American School at that time--all places he visited.\n       ``It's so amazing to find buildings are still there in a \n     city of such dynamic development,'' the Jewish scholar says \n     after visiting his former residences.\n       ``Some of the things are a little bit familiar, but I was \n     very small at that time (to remember everything).\n       ``Many things have changed at Picardie but I definitely \n     remember the balcony. I remember standing there looking at \n     the street when I was about four,'' Tribe adds, his eyes \n     lighting up.\n       What is even more amazing is that Tribe even managed to \n     find the name of his grandfather in the old Shanghai \n     directory and got the chance to visit his grandparents' \n     former home on Seymour Road (now Shaanxi Road N.), where he \n     would often visit.\n       Tribe says he would have liked to have brought his son and \n     daughter and grandchildren to Shanghai, but sadly their busy \n     schedules prevented them from doing so. Both children are \n     accomplished artists and art theorists.\n       Before coming though, Tribe's daughter gave him a digital \n     camera and asked him to take pictures of the places where he \n     grew up so that he could share the memories with the rest of \n     his family.\n       ``It would still be nice to bring my grandchildren here one \n     day,'' he says. ``I am enormously grateful to Shanghai. I \n     would not exist but for Shanghai. Not only because I was born \n     here but this city welcomed Jews and other refugees at a time \n     when no one else would take them.''\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4100-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4100]]\n        TRIBUTE TO CONGRESSMAN WILLIAM LOUIS ``BILL'' DICKINSON\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my friend, former \nCongressman William Louis ``Bill'' Dickinson, who recently passed away \nafter an extended illness. He represented the Second District of \nAlabama as a Member of Congress from 1965 to 1993.\n  Bill was born in Opelika, AL, on June 25, 1925. After graduating from \nOpelika public schools, he enlisted in the Navy, serving from 1943 to \n1946 and then joined the Air Force Reserves.\n  After graduating from the University of Alabama Law School, Bill \nreturned to Opelika where he practiced law before becoming an Opelika \ncity judge. He later served as a judge of the Lee County Juvenile \nCourt, and as a judge for the Fifth Judicial Circuit of Alabama.\n  In 1964, Bill was elected as a Republican to Congress for the Second \nDistrict of Alabama. He was known to his colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle as an honest and collegial statesman and a first-rate \nlegislator. The people of southeast Alabama were proud of Bill's work \nin representing them in Congress, as evidenced by his election to 14 \nterms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Bill never wavered from his \nconservative principles. It would be difficult to count the ways that \nAlabama and our Nation benefited from Bill's time in Congress. Though \nwe did not serve together, I knew him well, campaigning for him when I \nwas in college and benefiting from his strong support and wise advice \nsince I have been in the Senate.\n  As a long standing member of the House Armed Services Committee, he \nworked arduously for our men and women in uniform. His work was \ndecisive in supporting military bases in Alabama that have become \nstrong, enduring installations like Maxwell Air Force Base and Fort \nRucker. He was a fixture on the Armed Services Committee, serving 10 \nyears as ranking member. Indeed, it was ironic that if he had chosen to \nseek another term, he would have been the chairman of the House Armed \nServices Committee. As the committee's leading Republican, he gave his \nsupport to President Reagan's defense buildup in the 1980s which helped \nto bring down the Soviet Union. Our Nation's military continues to reap \nthe benefits of programs and policies adopted under his watch.\n  There are times when our Nation has to defend itself and Bill \nDickinson fully understood that reality. That knowledge made him a \nsteadfast advocate for the proposition that the best way to peace was \nthrough strength.\n  Finally, despite all of his accomplishments, Bill's family and his \nmany friends will miss his wit and humor. As we say in the South, he \nwas ``good company''. People loved to hear him speak. The smiles on the \nfaces of the audience would start even before he reached the podium. \nHis humor and a realistic approach to life were surely great assets to \nhis work.\n  He is survived by his wife, Barbara, four children, and \ngrandchildren. They have all been superb citizens, and I am proud to \nsay that his son, Bill, worked for me when I was attorney general doing \na great job for the people of the State of Alabama.\n  Our State and our Nation are better places because of Bill \nDickinson's leadership. Let his service be an example for those of us \nwho continue to serve in public office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4100-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SANDER LURIE\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

I could not have asked for a better person to direct my \nlegislative efforts; with his support I was able to hit the ground \nrunning and work for the great people of the State of Michigan from the \nvery start.\n  Prior to joining my staff in 2001, Sander spent 10 years working for \nthe honorable Senator from the State of New Jersey, Mr. Frank \nLautenberg, including serving as his chief of staff prior to Senator \nLautenberg's retirement in 2000. When I asked Senator Lautenberg about \nSander and his contributions to his office, Senator Lautenberg told me, \n``Sander was an integral part of my team for many years and played a \nlarge role in our successes during that time. He is a smart, natural \nleader with a real dedication to public service.'' I could not agree \nmore. For the 7 years he spent on my staff no one was more tireless, \nmore hardworking, or more dedicated to helping the citizens of Michigan \nand the citizens of the United States. He was a constant source of \nmotivation and inspiration.\n  Sander has always been the kind of person whose first priority is to \nimprove the lives of those around him. This was clearly evident during \nhis time in Senator Lautenberg's office. He was instrumental in \nassisting Senator Lautenberg's push for major reforms in tobacco and \nwas very helpful to the state attorneys general who took on the tobacco \nindustry. Sander played a key role in the Senator's successful battle \nto reduce drunken driving deaths by making the .08 blood alcohol level \nthe law of the land. Amidst all this, Sander was able to work with \nSenator Lautenberg and help craft the historic 1997 Balanced Budget \nAgreement that helped to produce the budget surpluses of the late \n1990s.\n  As he made his way to my office, Sander used his experience with the \nbalanced budget agreement to become the go-to person on my staff \nregarding the budget, and all of us here in the Senate can attest to \nthe complexity that comes along with it. Sander always prided himself \nin knowing the ins and outs of the budget process and he never ceased \nto amaze me with his ability to recall rules and regulations at will. \nHis work and knowledge was a pivotal part of my ability to be a leader \nand contributor to the budget committee, and I cannot thank him enough.\n  Sander was born in Warwick, RI, and raised for most of his early life \nin Milwaukee, WI. He earned his bachelor's degree from the University \nof Wisconsin-Madison, and following that he earned his master's degree \nin public administration from the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public \nAffairs at the University of Texas-Austin. Sander's priority of working \nfor the people in his community and his commitment to public service \nbegan at a young age before he ever made his way to Washington. He \nspent time working for both the Wisconsin State Assembly and the Texas \nEmployment Commission, making sure to give back to the States that he \ncalled home. This selflessness followed him to Washington as he spent \nthe last 17 years of his life serving the citizens of Michigan and New \nJersey.\n  Sander has now begun a new chapter in his life. And though everyone \nin my office and those that know him best were saddened to see him \nleave, we are all incredibly proud of the work he has done and are \ndeeply grateful for the positive impact he has had on all of our lives.\n  Today, Sander resides in Washington, DC, with his wonderful wife \nDorian Friedman, and their beautiful daughter Mara. As Sander continues \non in what will certainly be an illustrious career, I wish him well. He \nis sorely missed, but I, and everyone around him, know that the same \nselflessness that brought him to public service will follow him to \nwhatever path he chooses, and he will undoubtedly continue to improve \nthe lives of those around him. I am honored to have had Sander serve as \nmy chief of staff, and I wish him only the best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4100-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4100-S4101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF BURLINGAME\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of the city of Burlingame, located in \nSan Mateo County, CA.\n  The city of Burlingame was incorporated into the State of California \non June 6, 1908. This year, we celebrate its centennial anniversary. \nAlso known as the ``City of Trees'' because of its 18,000 public trees, \nthe city of Burlingame has fascinated and charmed visitors for decades.\n  Situated in eastern San Mateo County near San Francisco Bay, \nBurlingame is named after diplomat Anson Burlingame, the former U.S. \nMinister to\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\nChina who stopped in the bay area on his way to China in 1866 and \npurchased 1,043 acres in what is currently Burlingame and Hillsborough. \nIn the mid-1860s, a railroad line was built down the Peninsula, with \nmany wealthy San Franciscans building secondary homes south of San \nFrancisco. When the great earthquake devastated much of San Francisco \nin 1906, many people looking to escape the dangers and hardships of the \ncity also moved south, this time permanently.\n  In 1894, the Burlingame Train Station was built to service the \nBurlingame Country Club, which was founded in 1893. This station, which \nwas financed largely by country club members, was built to resemble the \nstyle of California's missions. Today, the Burlingame Train Station is \non the National Register of Historic Places and has also been \ndesignated a State historic landmark.\n  For 100 years, the city of Burlingame has not only served as a \nhistorical wonderland for those visiting the city but a place to call \nhome for its more than 28,000 residents. I commend Burlingame for \nmaintaining the natural beauty and historical significance of this fine \ncity.\n  The city of Burlingame's vision and commitment to protecting its \nsmall piece of California history should be commended. I congratulate \nthe city of Burlingame for its hard work on this special occasion and I \nlook forward to future generations having the opportunity to visit and \nenjoy this unique city for another 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4101-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF JAMESTOWN, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. From June 28 \nto July 6, the residents of Jamestown will come together to celebrate \ntheir community and its historic founding.\n  Founded in 1883 on the intersection of the Pipestem and James Rivers, \nJamestown was named by GEN Thomas La Fayette Rosser whose hometown was \nJamestown, VA, which was also located on a James River. In 1883 and \nagain in 1932, the city of Jamestown made an attempt, though \nunsuccessful, to become the capital of the State. Jamestown is known as \nthe ``Pride of the Prairie''--and it has much to be proud of.\n  The city's dedication to promoting both conservation and tourism \nresulted in the construction of the World's Largest Buffalo. This \nmassive 60-ton monument, which began as an art project of students from \nJamestown College, draws visitors from all over the country. The \nbuffalo is the center of the Frontier Village, a gathering of genuine \nFrontier-era buildings and the National Buffalo Museum--all of these \ntogether attracting over 100,000 visitors a year.\n  Adding to Jamestown's celebrity is the presence of two of only a few \nalbino bison in North America. The first, known as White Cloud, gave \nbirth to an albino calf this last year, bringing another albino bison \nto the herd tended by the National Buffalo Museum. The rarity of this \noccurring is immense and has added to interest in the city.\n  Jamestown has also helped shape the direction of North Dakota. And, \nfor many, as the city that brought us Louis L'Amour and Peggy Lee, \nJamestown has helped shape a generation. Coming into its 125th year, I \nam certain that Jamestown will continue in its role to provide \nleadership to many of our communities for years to come.\n  Jamestown will be commemorating this special occasion with over a \nweek of fireworks, car shows, races, banquets, socials, air shows, golf \ntournaments, school reunions, presentations, and parades.\n  Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating \nJamestown, ND, and its residents on their 125th anniversary and in \nwishing them well for the future. By honoring Jamestown we keep the \npioneering, frontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places \nsuch as Jamestown that have helped to shape this country into what it \nis today, which is why this fine community is deserving of our \nrecognition.\n  Jamestown has a proud past and a very bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4101-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             125TH ANNIVERSARY OF VALLEY CITY, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that will be celebrating its 125th \nanniversary. On June 11-15, the residents of Valley City will gather to \ncelebrate their community's history and founding.\n  Founded by the Northern Pacific Rail Road in 1872, this community \nwent through an assortment of names before settling on Valley City. \nAfter being known as Second Crossing, Fifth Siding, Wahpeton, and \nWorthington, Valley City was chosen to describe this beautiful town \nlocated in the Sheyenne River Valley.\n  Because the community was developed around the winding Sheyenne \nRiver, its eight historic bridges have become an integral part of \nValley City's rich history. This ``City of Bridges'' offers many one of \na kind and original bridge designs, including the Valley City State \nUniversity suspension footbridge and the concrete arched Rainbow \nBridge.\n  Valley City has a lot to offer its residents and visitors alike. With \nits antiques, crafts and collectables Valley City offers a distinctive \nshopping experience. Some of its hidden treasures include a visitor's \ncenter, the Barnes County Museum, and the Sheyenne River Valley \nNational Scenic Byway. The scenic byway stretches 63 picturesque miles \nalong the Sheyenne River, following ancient Native American foot paths. \nThe area has become a magnet for hunters, fisherman, and outdoor \nenthusiasts of all kinds. It is also the proud hometown of our \nCongressman, Earl Pomeroy.\n  Valley City is the ideal location for its residents to grow and \nprosper together. To celebrate its 125th anniversary, the city will \nhold a rubber duck race, a street dance, a craft fair, a parade and \nfireworks.\n  Mr. President, I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating \nValley City, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in \nwishing them well in the future. It is places such as Valley City, \nNorth Dakota that have helped shape this country into what it is today, \nwhich is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Valley City has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4101-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4101-S4102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LINDA NELSON\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is an old saying that no \nexercise is better for the human heart than reaching down to lift up a \nchild. Whenever I think about Linda Nelson, that saying comes to mind \nbecause she had devoted her life to nurturing and educating and lifting \nup children.\n  Likewise, for the past 4 years, as president of the Iowa State \nEducation Association, Linda Nelson has devoted herself to lifting up \nthe teaching profession in the State of Iowa. She has fought for better \npay and professional development, for more generous funding for public \neducation, and for commonsense reforms to the No Child Left Behind Act. \nShe has done an exceptional job for Iowa's teachers and education \nsupport professionals. However, I know that she is looking forward to \nreturning next fall to her real love, which is the classroom at Carter \nLake Elementary School and the students she has missed so much.\n  Linda Nelson has led and served ISEA with true distinction. Under her \nleadership, membership has increased and local associations have been \nstrengthened. She tirelessly crisscrossed the State of Iowa to visit \nschools and to consult with teachers and support professionals. I am \ntold that she has been away from home so much that her cats no longer \nrecognize her.\n  Mr. President, I have always loved what Lee Iacocca said about \nteachers. ``In a completely rational society,'' he said, ``the best of \nus would be teachers, and the rest would have to settle for something \nless.'' Fortunately, in Iowa, so many of our best do go into teaching. \nAnd Linda is one of those truly outstanding classroom professionals.\n  She graduated from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and has \ntaught for more than 30 years. She has been an active member of ISEA \nthroughout her career. She has held leadership positions at the local, \nState, regional, and national levels. In 1992, the National Education \nAssociation recognized her outstanding contributions to public \neducation with the Charles F. Martin Award.\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\n  As I said, Linda's first love is the classroom. But she is committed \nto securing a quality education for every child, not just those in her \nclassroom, and this has led her to activism in the broader public and \npolitical arenas. She was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives \nin 1992 and served for 4 years as an outspoken champion of quality \npublic schools for all of Iowa's children.\n  As a teacher, Linda Nelson is a consummate professional, and she \nspeaks with that special authority that can only come from decades of \nclassroom experience. She has been an association president, a mentor, \na leader, a legislator. But of the many titles she has worn during her \nlong and distinguished career, she prizes none more highly than the \nsimple title of ``teacher.''\n  Linda Nelson is one of the many reasons why Iowa public schools are \namong the most respected and highest achieving in the Nation. We are \nblessed with an extraordinary cadre of talented teachers, and this is a \nreal point of pride among Iowans. We honor our teachers. We are \ngrateful for their keen minds and generous hearts. We appreciate the \nlong hours they devote to their work--their service above and beyond \nthe call of duty.\n  Linda Nelson has made a very real difference for the good as \npresident of the Iowa State Education Association. As she returns to \nCarter Lake, I join with educators across Iowa in thanking Linda for \nher service, and wishing her the very best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4102-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN HONOR OF DR. JERRY BEASLEY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we all know that college can \nbe a wonderful, eventful, and sometimes overwhelming time in the life \nof a young person. With new doors opening and a plethora of choices \nahead, the years that young people devote to their college education \nshape the person they grow to be. We should all hope that when our \nloved ones set out on this journey that they encounter role models and \nmentors like Dr. Jerry Beasley. He has steered Concord University since \n1985, in which time he has had an immeasurable impact on the \ninstitution and its students. In the time I have been allotted, I \ncannot do justice to the great service Dr. Beasley has dedicated to \nConcord University, but through the examples I can provide I hope to at \nleast honor these selected accomplishments.\n  From the beginning of his career at Concord, Dr. Beasley has embodied \nthe university's mission of learning and service. Traditionally, \nuniversity presidents hold elegant ceremonies and inauguration parties \nin order to celebrate themselves and their achievements before \nbeginning work. Dr. Beasley is not one of these presidents. He \npreferred to donate the funds usually allocated for such ceremonies to \nthe support of student scholarships, setting a precedent of \nselflessness he continued throughout his tenure. He taught his students \nthat giving and service were the foundation of citizenship, and \nrenewing Concord's commitment to social responsibility.\n  As many of you know, access to technology is an issue of particular \nimportance to me. I have committed myself to the enhancement of \ntechnology resources for students in West Virginia, a commitment which \nDr. Beasley and I share. During his tenure as president and thanks, in \npart, to his oversight, the $13.9 million Rahall Technology Center is \nnow complete and open for student use. Its 24-hour facilities provide \nstudents with access to technology ranging from high-speed internet to \ncomputer science courses.\n  Our society today is becoming increasingly dependent on technology. \nAs we become integrated into a global marketplace, the values of \nknowledge and service have become even more important. The expansion of \nour resources and influence demands that we all develop a greater \nunderstanding of the world we live in and the people we share it with. \nUnder Dr. Beasley's leadership, Concord University has met these \nchallenges headon. The student body has grown significantly reaching an \nall-time peak enrollment of 3,055 students in the fall of 2001. The \nstudent body has also become incredibly diverse, with representatives \nfrom 27 States, 22 countries, and the District of Columbia. The \ndiversity of faces and backgrounds at Concord is also complemented by a \ndiverse range of study abroad opportunities, with scholarships \navailable for study in Europe, South America, and around the world.\n  Dr. Beasley not only enhanced the diversity of the Concord student \nbody, but also broadened the resources available on campus. Since the \nearly 1930s, a goal of an interfaith chapel has been kept alive on the \nConcord campus, but, for many years, the project was left unfinished. \nDr. Beasley has shepherded the project, which is now nearing \ncompletion. The building will mark not only the campus's concern for \nmulticultural understanding, but also of Dr. Beasley's ambition to this \nend.\n  Concord University students can now enjoy a wealth of opportunities \nwithout fearing the exorbitant financial burdens of education. \nFinancial aid and scholarships are now more available than ever with \nmore than 90 percent of Concord's students receiving some form of \neducational assistance. Dr. Beasley was instrumental in the effort to \nbring programs such as the Bonner Scholars program to campus.\n  What I admire the most about Dr. Beasley, though, is his personal \ncommitment to public service, and the inspirational example he has set \nfor his children, his students, and all of us. He has dedicated his \ncareer to improving education, and for that we owe him our sincerest \nthanks. Dr. Beasley, I am very grateful for your contributions to \nConcord University, and I wish you well in a peaceful \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4102-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4102-S4103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         STOWE WEEKEND OF HOPE\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the State of Vermont is proud of \nthe people in our state who organize the annual Stowe Weekend of Hope, \none of the most inspiring and educational events for cancer survivors \nin the United States.\n  ``We believe that the Stowe Weekend of Hope is unique, as it covers \nall cancers, reveals the generosity of an entire community, and has \nenhanced the lives of thousands of past attendees and their loved \nones,'' said Jo Sabel Courtney, the chair and cofounder of the \nuplifting event. ``Our mission,'' she explained, ``is to inspire, \neducate, and celebrate the lives of people living with cancer.''\n  Altogether, some 900 participants from 21 States, the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, and Canada participated in this year's events presented by the \nStowe Area Association and the Vermont Cancer Center. The Stowe Area \nAssociation's lodging properties donated 312 complimentary rooms to \ncancer survivors and their loved ones.\n  Jo Sabel Courtney would be the first to tell you that making the \nweekend a tremendous success is a team effort.

Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the \nremarkable achievements of a small Maine company that is doing business \nin an incredibly forward-thinking way. Safe Handling, Inc., of Auburn, \nis a cutting-edge transporter of industrial products, and both the firm \nand its president, Ford Reiche, have earned significant recognition, \nculminating in Mr. Reiche being named the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration's 2008 Maine Small Business Person of the Year.\n  Founded in 1989, Safe Handling offers businesses the convenience of \nboth bulk product transportation and logistics, as well as toll \nprocessing, to enable them to more efficiently move their goods. \nSignificantly, Safe Handling is responsible for both sensitive and \nhazardous materials. To safely handle these products, the firm runs the \nlargest rail-to-truck transloading facilities in both New England and \nwestern Pennsylvania, where it has an additional transload yard and \nwarehouse. Safe Handling presently manages roughly a half million tons \nof products every year which translates to nearly 4,000 railcars and \n12,000 truckloads of raw materials annually. It also operates the only \nethanol terminal in Maine.\n  Transporting such perilous materials requires Safe Handling to be \nmindful of many concerns, and the company has risen to the top as a \nleader in environmental safety by exceeding Federal and State \nrequirements on a regular basis. Most recently, the company became the \nfirst Maine-owned business to earn both the ISO14001 and Responsible \nCare certifications, which address a host of health, safety, \nenvironmental, and security concerns. Of all its initiatives, Safe \nHandling has most visibly led the way in reducing transportation \nemissions. The company ships dry products that it transfers into \nliquids, uses tri-axle trucks, provides long-haul rail services, and \nutilizes biodiesel fuel, all of which reduce discharge. Not \nsurprisingly, the firm placed first in the Governor's Carbon Challenge, \nby voluntarily reducing its carbon emissions by 75 percent. Safe \nHandling has additionally instituted an Employee Green Idea Reward \nProgram that gives $100 to each employee who saves the company money \nthrough an environmentally friendly idea.\n  Because of its innovative practices and proven track record, Safe \nHandling has garnered three prestigious awards this year alone. In \nMarch, Mainebiz magazine declared Ford Reiche its Executive of the Year \nin its large business category. Less than a month later, the Maine \nInternational Trade Center recognized Safe Handling as its Maine \nInnovative Company of the Year Award for the company's energy saving \nmethods and customer savings. Additionally, the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration presented Mr. Reiche with its prestigious 2008 Maine \nSmall Business Person of the Year for his ``business expertise, \ncommitment, creativity and community involvement.'' Mr. Reiche's \ndedication and knowledge inspire the nearly 100 employees of Safe \nHandling, and the company is a better place for his profound leadership \nskills.\n  Safe Handling is truly a company of which all Mainers can be proud. \nConsistently seeking greater energy efficiency while never sacrificing \nits loyalty to its customers, Safe Handling promises to make the \nLewiston-Auburn area--and Maine--a better place in every way.

I am also pleased to transmit my written approval, \nauthorization, and determination concerning the Agreement, and a \nNuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the \nAgreement (in accordance with section 123 of the Act, as amended by \ntitle XII of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 \n(Public Law 105-277), a classified annex to the NPAS, prepared by the \nSecretary of State in consultation with the Director of National \nIntelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, will be \nsubmitted to the Congress separately). The joint memorandum submitted \nto me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy and a \nletter from the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission stating \nthe views of the Commission are also enclosed.\n  The proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act \nand other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements and will advance the non-proliferation and other \nforeign policy interests of the United States.\n  The proposed Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with Russia based on a mutual commitment \nto nuclear non-proliferation. It has a term of 30 years, and permits \nthe transfer of technology, material, equipment (including reactors), \nand components for nuclear research and nuclear power production. It \ndoes not permit transfers of Restricted Data, and permits transfers of \nsensitive nuclear technology, sensitive nuclear facilities, and major \ncritical components of such facilities by amendment to the Agreement. \nIn the event of termination, key non-proliferation conditions and \ncontrols continue with respect to material and equipment subject to the \nAgreement.\n  The Russian Federation is a nuclear weapon state party to the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Like the United States, it \nhas a ``voluntary offer'' safeguards agreement with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). That agreement gives the IAEA the right to \napply safeguards on all source or special fissionable material at \npeaceful nuclear facilities on a Russia-provided list. The Russian \nFederation is also a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection \nof Nuclear Material, which establishes international standards of \nphysical protection for the use, storage, and transport of nuclear \nmaterial. It is also a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, whose \nnon-legally binding Guidelines set forth standards for the responsible \nexport of nuclear commodities for peaceful use. A more detailed \ndiscussion of Russia's domestic civil nuclear program and its nuclear \nnon-proliferation policies and practices, including its nuclear export \npolicies and practices, is provided in the NPAS and\n\n[[Page S4104]]\n\nin the classified annex to the NPAS submitted to the Congress \nseparately.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe Agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123b. and 123d. of the Atomic Energy Act. My Administration is \nprepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in \nsection 123b. Upon completion of the 30-day continuous session period \nprovided for in section 123b., the 60-day continuous session period \nprovided for in section 123d. shall commence.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to reauthorize the Route 66 Corridor Preservation \nProgram; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \ncontinue the restoration and preservation of the unique cultural \nresources along the famous Route 66. Passage of the Route 66 Corridor \nPreservation Reauthorization Act would carry on the wonderful work of \nthe Park Service's Route 66 program over the past decade. As in the \npast, I am joined in this effort by my colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Bingaman.\n  In 1990, I introduced the Route 66 Study Act, which directed the \nNational Park Service to determine the best ways to preserve, \ncommemorate and interpret Route 66. As a result of that study, I later \nintroduced legislation authorizing the National Park Service to join \nwith Federal, State and private efforts to preserve various aspects of \nhistoric Route 66, the Nation's most important thoroughfare for east-\nwest migration during the 20th century.\n  The Route 66 program is a collective effort by private property \nowners; non-profit organizations; and local, State, Federal, and tribal \ngovernments to identify and address preservation needs along the \nhistoric route. The program offers grants for the restoration of \nsignificant properties dating all the way back to the mid 1920s.\n  The bill authorizes funding over 10 years and supports grassroots \nefforts to preserve aspects of this historic highway. Designated in \n1926, the 2,200-mile stretch from Chicago to Santa Monica, California, \nthe Mother Road, as it was called, rolled through eight American \nstates, and in New Mexico, it passed through the communities of \nTucumcari, Santa Rosa, Albuquerque, Grants and Gallup. New Mexico added \nto the aura of Route 66, giving new generations of Americans their \nfirst experience of our colorful culture and rich heritage. Route 66 \nallowed travelers to see firsthand previously remote areas and \nexperience the traditions and natural beauty of the Southwest and West.\n  The bill authorizes the National Park Service to support State, local \nand private efforts to preserve the Route 66 corridor by providing \ntechnical assistance, participating in cost-sharing programs, and \nmaking grants. Since 1990, the Park Service has acted as a \nclearinghouse for communication among Federal, State, local, private \nand American Indian entities interested in the preservation of \nAmerica's Main Street. Congresswoman Heather Wilson of Albuquerque, New \nMexico, has introduced a similar bill in the House of Representatives, \nand I hope Congress will act promptly in passing this important \nlegislation.\n  I thank my colleagues for considering the Route 66 Corridor \nPreservation Reauthorization Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 3010\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Route 66 Corridor \n     Preservation Program Reauthorization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ROUTE 66 CORRIDOR PRESERVATION PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 4 of Public Law 106-45 (16 U.S.C. 461 note; 113 \n     Stat. 226) is amended by striking ``2009'' and inserting \n     ``2019''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Shelby, \n        Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Obama):\n  S. 3012. A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 to extend the authorization of the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Program through fiscal year 2012; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce a bill today to \nreauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act for 3 years, \nthrough 2012. This legislation has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in \nCongress since it was enacted in 1998, and I thank Senators Specter, \nMikulski, Shelby and Hatch for joining me in today's introduction. I am \nalso glad to be joined by Congressmen Visclosky who will introduce this \nbill in the House of Representatives today as well.\n  Since 1999, the Bureau of Justice Assistance at the Department of \nJustice has distributed $234 million to State and local jurisdictions. \nThose grants have resulted in the purchase of an estimated 818,000 \nvests. Since its enactment, over 11,900 State and local jurisdictions \nhave participated in this program. Congress can be proud of the fact \nthat this legislation has directly provided life-saving equipment to so \nmany law enforcement officers. I know that when State and local \njurisdictions receive the matching grants through this program, their \nbudgets can go farther in fighting crime in their communities.\n  Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the \nimportance of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program. We heard from a \nlaw enforcement officer who was shot in the\n\n[[Page S4109]]\n\nchest at pointblank range during an auto theft investigation. He lived \nto tell the committee and others his story, thanks to the bulletproof \nvest he was wearing. In my home state of Vermont, the program has \nallowed the Vermont police to purchase over 350 sets of armor in the \nlast 10 years. The program has had a tremendous impact on the ability \nof States and localities to give our law enforcement officers the \nprotection they deserve while serving the needs of our communities.\n  As a Nation, we ask much of our law enforcement officers. Men and \nwomen who serve face constant and unknown risks, and too often make the \nultimate sacrifice. During this week in Washington, law enforcement \nofficers from around the country will remember those officers who died \nin the line of duty while protecting their fellow citizens. \nUnfortunately, an ongoing trend of rising violent crime in the U.S. \nunderscores the continuing need of this program that has had such a \npositive impact on the safety of law enforcement officers. \nReauthorizing and funding this program is the right thing to do, and it \nis something I hope all Senators will support. Every additional officer \nwho is able to put on a vest today as a result of this grant program \nmeans that one more officer may survive a violent attack. Protecting \nthe men and women who protect all Americans should be a priority for \nCongress and we have a chance to advance that priority with the \ncontinuation of this important program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3012\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership \n     Grant Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n       Section 1001(a)(23) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control \n     and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3793(a)(23)) is \n     amended by striking ``2009'' and inserting ``2012''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Inouye, and Ms. \n        Murkowski):\n  S. 3013. A bill to provide for retirement equity for Federal \nemployees in nonforeign areas outside the 48 contiguous States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I join with my good friends Senators \nTed Stevens, Daniel Inouye, and Lisa Murkowski to introduce legislation \nto ensure retirement equity for Federal workers in Hawaii, Alaska, and \nthe U.S. territories. For years, Federal employees in my home state of \nHawaii and in other non-foreign areas have been disadvantaged when it \ncomes to their retirement due to a lack of locality pay. Federal \nworkers in those areas may receive a nonforeign cost of living \nallowance, COLA, based on the differences in the cost of living between \nthose areas and the District off Columbia, but this amount does not \ncount for retirement purposes. Furthermore, while locality rates \ngenerally increase, nonforeign COLAs have been gradually declining. \nThis lack of retirement equity has resulted, in several lawsuits \nagainst the Federal Government and hinders efforts to recruit and \nretain Federal workers in those areas.\n  On August 17, 2000, the U.S. District Court of the Virgin Islands \napproved the settlement of Caraballo v. United States, which was a \nclass-action lawsuit in which employees in the nonforeign areas \ncontested the methodology used by the Office of Personnel Management to \ndetermine COLA rates. However, on January 30, 2008, Judge Phillip M. \nPro in the U.S. District Court in Honolulu ruled against the Federal \nemployees in Matsuo v. the Office of Personnel Management, which held \nthat excluding Alaska and Hawaii from locality pay did not violate the \nequal protection clause and substantive due process under the Fifth \nAmendment. Judge Pro acknowledged the disparity in his ruling saying \nthat Congress ``discharged its legislative responsibilities \nimperfectly'' and recommended that Congress ``correct the incongruity \nmade so evident by this case.''\n  While this issue has been discussed for years, a solution seemed out \nof reach given the lack of support for various proposed solutions. Last \nyear, the Administration announced a legislative proposal to phase-out \nnon-foreign COLA and phase-in locality pay. In May 2007 the \nAdministration's draft bill was submitted. The draft bill would freeze \nnonforeign COLA rates at their current rates at their current rates and \nOPM would no longer conduct COLA surveys. Over the 7 years following \nthe enactment of the proposal, locality pay would be phased in for \nGeneral Schedule, GS, employees while nonforeign COLA is phased out. \nAccording to OPM, preliminary data indicates that the locality pay rate \nfor Hawaii would be 20 percent. At the end of the 7 year period, if the \nlocality pay rate is less than the amount of nonforeign COLA for a \nparticular area, employees would continue to receive the difference in \nnonforeign COLA and locality pay until the locality rate reaches the \nCOLA amount. Only at that time would employees no longer receive non-\nforeign COLA. However, the proposal did not address the impact such a \nchange would have on postal employees, employees who receive special \nrates, members of the Senior Executive Service, and others who are in \nagency specific personnel systems or those who do not receive locality \npay, such as employees under the National Security Personnel System at \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Knowing of the growing interest in this proposal, I sent staff from \nmy Federal Workforce Subcommittee to Hawaii last July to meet with \nemployees and hear their questions and concerns about the \nAdministration's proposal. Based on the questions and comments I have \nreceived, I submitted questions to OPM and other Federal agencies to \nobtain additional information. I also posted information on the \nAdministration's proposal on my website, a link to a calculator created \nby OPM for Federal employees to determine exactly how their pay and \nretirement will be impacted by the proposal, and the agencies' response \nto my questions. Since then, I have received numerous letters and phone \ncalls from constituents and Federal employees in the nonforeign areas \nabout this issue. While there are still divergent views on this \nproposal, the vast majority of employees who I have heard from are \nsupportive of a change to locality pay.\n  The legislation I introduce today is a collective effort of Senators \nStevens, Inouye, Murkowski, and myself to find an equitable solution to \na difficult and divided issue. The Non-Foreign Area Retirement Equity \nAssurance Act is not to be seen as the last word, only the latest step \nforward toward determining the best way to ensure retirement equity for \nFederal workers in the nonforeign areas. Our bill seeks to provide \nanswers to the questions raised by the administration's proposal and to \ncover all employees. Most importantly, our bill seeks to protect \nemployee's take home pay. During this current economic climate, we must \nbe careful to do no harm.\n  Over the Memorial Day recess my subcommittee plans to hold a series \nof meetings in Hawaii on the Administration's proposal and this bill to \nhear remaining questions and concerns. I also plan to hold a hearing on \nthese proposals in Honolulu on May 29, 2008. I continue to encourage \nemployees in Alaska, Hawaii, and in the territories to write us with \ntheir questions and concerns on these proposals. My ultimate goal \nremains to ensure that Federal workers in the nonforeign areas are not \ndisadvantaged when it comes to their pay and retirement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3013\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Non-Foreign Area Retirement \n     Equity Assurance Act of 2008 or the Non-Foreign AREA Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I join my friend from Hawaii in \nintroducing the Non-foreign Area Retirement Equity Act. I thank Senator \nAkaka for his hard work on this important legislation that finally \nbrings retirement equity to the thousands of Federal employees in \nAlaska and Hawaii.\n  Alaska and Hawaii are the only States in which Federal employees do \nnot receive locality pay. Instead, they receive what is called a \nnonforeign cost of living allowance, or COLA. COLA was put in place in \n1949, before Alaska and Hawaii were States. It is based on the cost of \nliving in an area compared to the cost of living in Washington, DC. \nCOLA was not available to employees in the lower 48 States.\n  When locality pay was established to benefit Federal employees in the \nlower 48, Alaska and Hawaii were not included because they were already \nunder the COLA system. Locality pay brings Federal salaries closer to \nprivate industry salaries in an area.\n  The key difference between these two systems is how it affects a \nFederal employee's retirement. As you know, a Federal employee's \nretirement is based on their ``high 3'' years of service, usually the \nfinal 3 years of their base pay salary.\n  COLA is nontaxable income that cannot exceed 25 percent of the base \npay. It is currently being reduced in Alaska and Hawaii by 1 percent \neach year. Because COLA is not taxed, it is not considered as part of \nan employee's base pay for retirement purposes. This means an employee \nin Alaska retires with a much lower ``high 3'' than an equivalent \nposition in the lower 48.\n  Locality pay is taxable income, but is also considered part of an \nemployee's base pay for retirement purposes. This makes a big \ndifference in the amount of retirement benefits an employee receives.\n  Alaska has one of the highest costs of living in the Nation. Our \nFederal employees need to know they can continue to afford living in \nthe State they call home on the money they receive in their retirement \nbenefits. Many Alaskan Federal employees nearing retirement relocate to \nthe lower 48 in order to receive locality pay for their ``high 3.'' \nThis puts my State at a disadvantage because we are losing highly \nskilled, seasoned employees.\n\n  This is an inequitable and outdated system. It is time to bring \nretirement equity to all States. The bill Senator Akaka and I introduce \ntoday with Senators Inouye and Murkowski will do just that. Simply put, \nthis bill will convert Federal employees in our States from the COLA \nsystem to the locality pay system. This conversion will not only \nbenefit the Federal employees in these States, it will also save the \nGovernment money.\n  The COLA system requires that a survey be conducted every 3 years to \ndetermine an area's COLA. Our bill would eliminate these expensive and \ntime consuming surveys. By changing to a locality pay system, employees \nwill pay taxes on income they now receive tax free. Federal employees \nin Alaska and Hawaii have filed lawsuits to fight the inequity of the \nCOLA system. With this change, the Government will not have to spend \ntime and resources defending against this litigation.\n  The Office of Personnel Management supports replacing COLA with \nlocality pay for all of these reasons.\n  This bill addresses several employee groups with unique \ncircumstances, including postal employees. I am confident we can work \nclosely with the U.S. Postal Service and the postal employee unions to \nensure that postal employees in Alaska and Hawaii are protected.\n  Senator Akaka and I hope that all groups affected by this change will \ncontact us so that we can ensure this bill takes everyone's concerns \ninto consideration. Senator Akaka will be holding a hearing on this \nissue in Hawaii this month. Feedback from that hearing will be vital to \nimproving our bill.\n  It is important we pass this bill before the end of this Congress to \nbring equality in retirement to all of our Federal employees. I urge \nSenators to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 3014. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to strengthen \npenalties for child pornography offenses, child sex trafficking \noffenses, and other sexual offenses committed against children; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss with my \ncolleagues an issue that has hit home over the last few years for all \nAmericans, and that issue is crimes against children. We have all heard \nstories of children, our most innocent population, being victimized and \nabused by predatory criminals. While it is true we have made great \nstrides passing Federal legislation against criminal predators, more \nwork needs to be done. That is why I am here today to introduce a bill \nthat I entitled the Prevention and\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\nDeterrence of Crimes Against Children Act of 2008. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Kyl and Senator Vitter who have cosponsored this bill \nwith me.\n  This is a very important bill that will protect our children from the \nvilest forms of abuse and will send a strong signal to criminals that \nwe as a society will not tolerate such behavior and that their \npredatory actions have real significant consequences.\n  I wish to take a moment to talk about the murder of a girl from my \nhome State of Iowa, Jetseta Marrie Gage. On March 24, 2005, Jetseta, a \n10-year-old girl from Cedar Rapids, IA, went missing from her home. \nWithin 12 hours of her disappearance, Iowa law enforcement agents \narrested a registered sex offender, Roger Bentley, for the crime. He \nhad been previously convicted of committing lascivious acts with a \nminor.\n  Regrettably, this criminal served just over a year in prison for his \nprevious sex crime conviction. Two days after her disappearance, an \nAMBER Alert tip led officials to the location of her body. She was \nfound stuffed in a cabinet in an abandoned mobile home. The autopsy \nrevealed she had been sexually assaulted and suffocated with a plastic \nbag.\n  I can't help but wonder whether Jetseta would still be alive today \nhad her killer received stricter penalties for his first offense. It \nbreaks everybody's heart to hear about cases such as this, but it is \neven more demoralizing when you know that it might have been prevented \nwith adequate sentencing.\n  Last week, I honored two extraordinary law enforcement officers who \nhelped put away another one of Jetseta's abusers: James Bentley. \nUnbelievably, James Bentley is the brother of Roger Bentley who was \nresponsible for the rape and murder of Jetseta. A year prior to her \nmurder, James Bentley took nude photos of 9-year-old Jetseta and her \n13-month-old little sister Leonna.\n  After the child abuse prosecution of James Bentley stalled in State \ncourt due to sixth amendment concerns, U.S. Postal Inspector Troy Raper \nand Cedar Rapids Police Department Investigator Charity Hansel followed \nup on child pornography allegations that eventually led to James \nBentley's conviction on Federal child pornography charges.\n  These investigators worked tirelessly to find nine previous victims \nof James Bentley. Only two of the nine victims testified, but their \ncourage and their accounts of abuse by this man were very powerful. As \na result, these testimonies influenced the district court's decision to \nuse higher sentencing guidelines to put him away in Federal prison for \n100 years. I am truly thankful for the public service that Inspector \nTroy Raper and Investigator Charity Hansel have done for Iowa's kids.\n  In doing our part, we in Congress have not sat idly by. Two years ago \nwe passed into law the Adam Walsh Child Protection Safety Act. This \nimportant legislation made great strides in protecting America's \nchildren against violent sexual predators. Among its many components, \nthis act standardized the National Sex Offender Registry, eliminated \nthe statute of limitations for sex crimes against children, provided \ngrants for electronic devices used for monitoring sex offenders and, \nlastly, established more severe criminal punishment for certain crimes \ncommitted by sex offenders.\n  As part of the Adam Walsh Act, we were able to include the Jetseta \nGage Assured Punishment for Violent Crimes Against Children amendment. \nThe amendment created mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for \ncriminals who commit murder, kidnapping, or serious bodily harm against \nchildren.\n  We are on the right path, but I still say this is not enough--not \nenough punishment for people who commit these despicable crimes. There \nis still a lot of work that needs to be done on this serious issue.\n  This bill I am introducing today will help change this by protecting \nchildren in four ways. It will increase mandatory minimum sentences, \nboost penalties for certain crimes against children, control the use of \npassports by convicted sex offenders, and strengthen the process for \nremoving criminal aliens who commit sex offenses.\n  The first section of the bill increases the penalties for child \npornography offenses and elevates the mandatory minimum punishment for \ncriminals who commit exploitation crimes against children. I know some \nof my colleagues have concerns about mandatory minimums, especially in \nthe context of drug sentences. I understand that concern, but in light \nof the Supreme Court's decision in the Booker case, something must be \ndone to ensure that sexual predators receive the type of sentences \nappropriate for their crimes.\n  In Booker, the Court held that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are \nno longer mandatory, thus Federal judges have unfettered discretion in \nsentencing. I am very worried judges are not doing their job to protect \nchildren. As a matter of fact, Deputy Attorney General Laurence E. \nRothenberg testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee last year that \nsince the Booker decision, Federal judges have significantly increased \nthe number of downward departures for those convicted of possession of \nchild pornography.\n  To counter this trend, my bill establishes the following mandatory \nminimums for exploitation crimes against children: One, where a crime \ninvolves child pornography, the offender will receive 20 years to life; \ntwo, where the crime deals with sexual exploitation of a minor by a \nparent or guardian, the offender will receive no less than 3 years to \nlife.\n  The second section of the bill increases penalties for child sex \ntrafficking and child prostitution. The penalties for these crimes need \nto be adjusted to adequately reflect the gravity of these crimes and \nthe damage that they do to children.\n  The third section of the bill will ensure harsh penalties for \ncriminals convicted of child sex offenses resulting in death, repeated \nchild sex crimes, and forcible rape of children. These crimes involve \nthe most violent types of sex offenders, and justice for these crimes \nshould be dealt out with the strongest available prison sentences.\n  The final section of the bill has to do with not permitting these sex \noffenders to travel outside the country. If we know someone is a \nconvicted child molester, we have the responsibility to not allow them \ntravel to Asia or Europe or anywhere to exploit and harm other kids in \nother lands.\n  The bill provides for the following: When the sex offender has been \nconvicted of a sex offense, the issuance of passports shall be refused. \nSecondly, if a passport has already been issued, the use of a passport \nmay be restricted if the passport was used in the furtherance of a sex \noffense. Lastly, any alien convicted of a sex offense shall be placed \nimmediately in removal proceedings.\n  The provisions of this bill are designed to protect our children by \nlocking up violent sexual predators. I doubt that the Members of this \nbody, many of whom have young children of their own, will have any \nobjection to ensuring that violators of crimes against children receive \ntougher penalties for their acts.\n  It is unfortunate that it took the murder of girls such as Jetseta \nGage for a law with severe penalties to be proposed, but I strongly \nbelieve a vote for this bill could save the lives of children in the \nfuture. We have an obligation as legislators to protect our citizens, \nincluding our most vulnerable populations, and we have an obligation as \nadults to protect our young people. We have a commitment as parents to \nprotect our children and ensure that they are given the opportunity to \ngrow up free from the dangers that violent sex offenders pose. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me and Senator Kyl and Senator Vitter in \nstrengthening our laws so that no child becomes a victim of a repeat \noffender.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Casey, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S.J. Res. 32. A joint resolution limiting the issuance of a letter of \noffer with respect to a certain proposed sale of defense articles and \ndefense services to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; read the first time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss rising energy prices. I \nremind President Bush, as he leaves for his trip to the Middle East, \nhis ally, Saudi Arabia, holds the key to reducing gasoline prices at \nhome in the short term.\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\n  I, along with my colleagues, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, Senator \nCasey of Pennsylvania, Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Senator \nSanders of Vermont plan to submit a Senate resolution that would block \nall four pending arms deals to Saudi Arabia, which together total $1.4 \nbillion, unless Saudi Arabia shows that our friendship is a two-way \nstreet and increases its oil production by 1 million barrels per day \nabove the January 2008 output levels.\n  Because these weapons have not yet been delivered to Saudi Arabia, \nCongress still has the power to block these four deals as leverage to \nget the world's larger oil producer to bring its production back to \nhistorical levels, an action that would have the single greatest impact \nof lowering gas prices in the short term.\n  I am very proud that we today voted to prevent continued oil going \ninto the SPR as Senator Dorgan, the sponsor and somebody who has pushed \nthis issue a long time and done it well, has noted that will probably \nreduce prices about a nickel. There is more. It is a good first step, \nas he would be the first to say, but we can do more.\n  If Saudi Arabia would increase production by 1 million barrels a day, \nthe price of gasoline would go down 50 cents a gallon almost \nimmediately. It is a short-term fix.\n  As my colleagues across the aisle and the administration continue to \nside with big oil, we have no other choice because, right now, it is \nBig Oil and OPEC that are benefitting and American families are losing. \nIt is unfortunate we are at this point. Eight years of poor stewardship \nover our Nation's energy policy has left us with alternatives. And my \nRepublican colleagues have blocked every attempt at real energy reform \nthat would help alleviate the rising energy prices in this country.\n  In the 110th Congress alone, my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have blocked four different attempts by Democrats to extend the \nalternative tax provisions, and not only for a year or two but many.\n  On June 21 of last year, the extension of energy credits received 57 \nvotes; on December 7, it received 53 votes; on December 13, it received \n59 votes; and on February 6, 58 votes.\n  Each time, Republicans put up roadblocks requiring 60 votes in order \nto pass the bill. Each time the overwhelming majority of Democrats \nvoted for the bill, the overwhelming majority of Republicans voted \nagainst.\n  President Bush opposed the bills because each would have ended tax \nbreaks for big oil, as if they needed more tax breaks given their \nrecord profitability.\n  Meanwhile, Americans continue to spend more and more on gasoline, as \nprices at the pump have skyrocketed upward to record heights. Although \nour President was not aware that gasoline prices were predicted to top \n$4 a gallon this summer, American households already faced with rising \nfiscal burdens incurred as a result of the subprime foreclosure crisis \nand the financial credit crunch are being squeezed further by record-\nhigh prices at the pump.\n  In a sign that high prices will continue unabated, the Department of \nEnergy recently forecasted that gasoline prices would average $3.66 per \ngallon across the U.S. this summer, 25 percent higher than last \nsummer's average.\n  So I, along with several of my colleagues, think it is time to get \nthe President's attention and the attention of the leaders of Saudi \nArabia. The resolution we have introduced today, which Senator Reid \nwill rule to move on to the calendar this afternoon, requires Saudi \nArabia to increase their oil production by 1 million barrels a day or \njeopardize their $1.4 billion of pending arms deals with the United \nStates.\n  One of those deals includes the sale of JDAMs, Joint Direct Attack \nMunitions, which makes conventional bombs into smart bombs that can be \naimed through the window of a house. The administration has warned us \nthat Saudi Arabia needs to use these weapons in their fight against \nterrorism.\n  But how are they going to use laser-guided bombs to fight terrorists \nin their midst? Saudi Arabia very much wants these smart bombs. So our \nresolution sends a strong signal to the administration and to Saudi \nArabia that friendship with the United States is a two-way street. If \nthe Saudis want to see their weapons, we need to see an increase in \ncrude oil production within the next 30 days. As we all know, the \nprincipal cause underlying the rise in gasoline prices has been a spike \nin crude oil prices, now over $120 a barrel, a 100-percent increase \nover the crude price at this point last year. A significant portion of \nthis price rise is due to supply decisions made by OPEC. The largest \nmember of OPEC, Saudi Arabia, controls one-fifth of the world's crude \nreserves and constitutes more than 10 percent of daily production of \ncrude oil.\n  In the past, Saudi Arabia has kept crude oil prices high by limiting \nsupply, producing anywhere from 1 to 5 million barrels per day below \ncapacity. Currently, they are producing 2 million barrels a day below \ncapacity. Why? Why right now, when crude prices are at an historic \nhigh, are the Saudis continuing to cut back on production? Does it make \nany sense? It does if you are a member of OPEC. It does if you are \nExxonMobil. But it doesn't if you are almost everybody else. With crude \noil at the highest price ever, Saudi Arabia and other members of OPEC \nare making record profits, and Saudi Arabia is not alone. Last month \nbig oil companies announced some of the best profits in recorded \nhistory. Exxon made almost $11 billion in profit last quarter. So we \nknow OPEC has no incentive to increase their production right now, \nsince that would decrease their profits. In fact, if Saudi Arabia were \nto increase its production by 1 million barrels per day, that \ntranslates to a reduction of 20 percent to 25 percent in the price of \ncrude oil. Crude oil prices would fall by more than $25 a barrel from \nthe current level of $126. In turn, that would lower the price of \ngasoline between 13 and 17 percent or by more than 62 cents off the \nexpected summer price, if the Saudis would simply produce the amount of \noil they used to produce when they were far more responsible. Yet Saudi \nArabia's oil minister said there was no need to increase supplies by \neven one barrel of oil.\n\n  But even as they are saying no, no, no to the United States, they are \nsaying yes, yes, yes to China. They are doubling oil production for \nChina. This is galling. When the President goes to Saudi Arabia and \nacts as if the Saudi King and the Saudi leadership are our good \nfriends, he ought to look the American family in the eye and say that \nand say Saudi Arabia is a loyal ally. To most Americans, a well-armed \nSaudi Arabia is far less important than a reasonable price for \ngasoline, heating oil, and all other products upon which oil is based.\n  The Saudis have to understand this is a two-way street. The President \nhas to understand that the one-way street relationship with Saudi \nArabia has to end. We provide them weapons. Our troops provide them \nprotection. Then they rake us over the coals when it comes to the price \nof oil. Just as Saudi Arabia feels a need to protect itself with high-\ntech, laser-guided missiles, American consumers and our economy need \nprotection from record high oil prices, exacerbated by OPEC's \nstranglehold on supply. The administration needs to use all of the \nleverage it has to influence the OPEC cartel to stop manipulating the \nworld's oil supply to its member nations' own wealth advantage. It is \ntime we stop treating a cartel that would be illegal in the United \nStates with kid gloves. That is what our resolution does. It reminds \nthe Saudis there are consequences for keeping oil prices high at a time \nwhen American families are hurting. It reminds Saudi Arabia that it \ncan't take American support for granted. They can choose record oil \nprofits or American weapons, but they can't have both.\n  I would like any Member of this Chamber and President Bush to look \nthe average American family in the eye and say: There is nothing we can \ndo to get Saudi Arabia to be responsible.\n  There are things we can do; we just refuse to do them. This \nresolution has us step to the plate. The resolution is not the final \nanswer, of course, to the problem of rising gas prices. That is why I \nam a proud cosponsor of S. 2991, the Consumer First Energy Act of 2008 \nthat we Democrats will offer on the floor before Memorial Day. That \nbill addresses underlying causes that are\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\ndriving up energy prices and forces big oil to reinvest some of their \nrecord-breaking profits into alternative and renewable sources of \nenergy that are both good for the environment, the consumer, and break \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n  Our bill will also attack the broader bill's speculation, punish \nprice gouging, and put additional pressure on the OPEC cartel. I urge \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. I am hopeful we \ncan move on this resolution as soon as possible so American consumers \nno longer have to carry the heavy burden of high energy prices all by \nthemselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4114-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 561--COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NORTH \n                   AMERICAN AEROSPACE DEFENSE COMMAND\n\n  Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nHagel, and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 561\n\n       Whereas, on May 12, 1958, the United States and Canada \n     signed an official agreement creating the bi-national North \n     American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and formally \n     acknowledged their mutual commitment to defending their \n     citizens from air attacks;\n       Whereas 2008 marks the 50th anniversary of the creation of \n     the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the \n     outstanding efforts of American and Canadian service men and \n     women defending North America;\n       Whereas the North American Aerospace Defense Command is a \n     unique and fully integrated bi-national United States and \n     Canadian command;\n       Whereas the North American Aerospace Defense Command is \n     headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, \n     Colorado, and administered by the United States Air Force, \n     with 3 subordinate regional centers located at Elmendorf Air \n     Force Base, Alaska, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and \n     Canadian Forces Base, Winnipeg, Manitoba;\n       Whereas the mission of the North American Aerospace Defense \n     Command is to ``prevent air attacks against North America, \n     safeguard the sovereign airspaces of the United States and \n     Canada by responding to unknown, unwanted, and unauthorized \n     air activity approaching and operating within those \n     airspaces, and provide aerospace and maritime warning for \n     North America'';\n       Whereas, through joint support arrangements with other \n     commands, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, \n     including United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force \n     Base, Nebraska, detects, validates, and warns of attacks \n     against North America whether by aircraft, missile, or space \n     vehicle;\n       Whereas the North American Aerospace Defense Command and \n     United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) joint command \n     center serves as a central collection and coordination site \n     for a worldwide system of sensors designed to provide the \n     commander and the governments of Canada and the United States \n     with an accurate picture of any aerospace threat;\n       Whereas the commander of the North American Aerospace \n     Defense Command provides integrated tactical warning and \n     attack assessments to the governments of the United States \n     and Canada;\n       Whereas the North American Aerospace Defense Command uses a \n     network of satellites, ground-based and airborne radar, \n     fighters and helicopters, and ground-based air defense \n     systems to detect, intercept, and, if necessary, engage any \n     air-breathing threats to North America;\n       Whereas North American Aerospace Defense Command assists in \n     the detection and monitoring of aircraft suspected of illegal \n     drug trafficking;\n       Whereas the Alaskan NORAD Region located at Elmendorf Air \n     Force Base is supported by both the Eleventh Air Force and \n     Air National Guard units;\n       Whereas the May 2006 North American Aerospace Defense \n     Command Agreement renewal added a maritime warning mission to \n     its slate of responsibilities, which entails a shared \n     awareness and understanding of the ongoing activities \n     conducted in United States and Canadian maritime approaches, \n     maritime areas, and inland waterways;\n       Whereas the horrific events of September 11, 2001, \n     demonstrated the North American Aerospace Defense Command's \n     continued relevance to North American security;\n       Whereas, since 2001, the Continental NORAD region, which is \n     divided into 2 defense sectors-the Western Defense Sector, \n     with its headquarters located at McChord Air Force Base, \n     Washington, and the Eastern Defense Sector, with its \n     headquarters located at Rome, New York-has been the lead \n     agency for Operation Noble Eagle, an ongoing mission to \n     protect the continental United States from further airborne \n     aggression from inside and outside of America's borders;\n       Whereas, in the spring of 2003, North American Aerospace \n     Defense Command fighters based at Tyndall Air Force Base, \n     Florida, intercepted 2 hijacked aircraft that originated in \n     Cuba and escorted them to Key West, Florida;\n       Whereas the continued service with valor and honor of \n     American and Canadian men and women serving at the North \n     American Aerospace Defense Command is central to North \n     America's ability to confront and successfully defeat threats \n     of the 21st century;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) State and local public safety officers play an \n     essential role in the efforts of the United States to detect, \n     prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and to respond to \n     natural disasters, hazardous materials, and other mass \n     casualty incidents. State and local public safety officers, \n     as first responders, are a component of our Nation's National \n     Incident Management System, developed by the Department of \n     Homeland Security to coordinate response to and recovery from \n     terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major \n     emergencies. Public safety employer-employee cooperation is \n     essential in meeting these needs and is, therefore, in the \n     National interest.\n       (3) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and the representatives of their employees to reach \n     and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and \n     working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts \n     through negotiations to settle their differences by mutual \n     agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such \n     methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement \n     for the settlement of disputes.\n       (4) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right of employees under the National Labor \n     Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) to choose whether to be \n     represented by a labor organization by way of secret ballot \n     election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board is \n     among the most important protections afforded under Federal \n     labor law.\n       (2) The right of employees to choose by secret ballot is \n     the only method that ensures a choice free of coercion, \n     intimidation, irregularity, or illegality.\n       (3) The recognition of a labor organization by using a \n     private agreement, rather than a secret ballot election \n     overseen by the National Labor Relations Board, threatens the \n     freedom of employees to choose whether to be represented by a \n     labor organization, and severely limits the ability of the \n     National Labor Relations Board to ensure the protection of \n     workers.\n\n     SEC. _03.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 561, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 561) commemorating the 50th \n     anniversary of the North American Aerospace Defense Command.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary \nof the signing of the North American Aerospace Defense Command \nAgreement between the United States and Canada. For my State of \nColorado, today is an especially proud and gratifying occasion as it is \nhome to the headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense \nCommand, located at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs.\n  On May 12, 1958, the United States and Canada signed an official \nagreement creating the unique and fully integrated binational North \nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command, commonly known as NORAD. \nAdministered by the United States Air Force in conjunction with \nCanadian Forces, NORAD is a premier military command that uses the most \ninnovative technology and equipment to secure our skies. Today, 50 \nyears after its inception, we honor NORAD and pay tribute to the men \nand women who have served and continue to serve NORAD's mission with \nhumility and distinction. To these American and Canadian \nservicemembers, I say thank you.\n  For five decades, NORAD's mission has been to prevent air attacks \nagainst North America and safeguard the sovereign airspaces of the \nUnited States and Canada by responding to unknown, unwanted and \nunauthorized air activity approaching or operating within our \nairspaces. In more recent years, NORAD's mission has evolved to include \ncollaborative efforts with civilian law enforcement officers to detect\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\nand monitor aircraft suspected of trafficking illegal drugs to North \nAmerica. In addition, NORAD has developed a system to help our homeland \ndefense and security partners observe North American seas and to warn \nof encroaching maritime threats. In pursuit of these missions, NORAD \nhas achieved remarkable success.\n  Over the years NORAD has strengthened the venerable relationship \nbetween the United States and Canada. It has been a source of stability \nfor our two nations during good times and bad. Throughout the turbulent \nCold War, and now in the midst of the war on terror, NORAD is \nresponsible for continually bringing together bright and courageous \nminds to help detect, deter and defend against lethal threats to the \nNorth American continent. Furthermore, NORAD has become a model for \ninternational defense cooperation. It has allowed for the necessary \nenhancement of information and intelligence sharing between Canadian \nand American militaries, intelligence agencies, and other security \norganizations. Twenty four hours a day, 7 days a week, NORAD units all \nover North America are alert, prepared and equipped to take action to \ndefend our continent and to safeguard our freedoms.\n  Throughout my nearly 18 years in the U.S. Congress, I have spent \nquite a bit of time with the commanders at NORAD, and each time we \nvisit I am encouraged by their efforts and reminded of why America is, \nand will always be, great. With the safety and security of America \nentrusted to institutions like NORAD and to the brave men and women of \nour armed forces, I am confident that America will be protected for \ngenerations to come.\n  Especially since the horrific events of September 11, 2001, and the \nlaunch of the war on terror, the continued resolve of the United States \nand Canada to pay any cost to face any foe is more relevant than ever. \nIf we are to remain sovereign and free, America and Canada must \ncontinue to adapt to a changing world and respond effectively to \nevolving threats. I am confident in our ability to do so. Through NORAD \nand other binational partnerships, America and Canada will jointly and \nefficiently combat any threat we confront in the 21st century.\n  Today, as a nation, we honor the legacy and achievements of the North \nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command, and we look forward to another half \ncentury of this successful partnership so that NORAD can continue to \nprovide for the protection of our airspace and our homeland. I offer my \nsincere congratulations to the North American Aerospace Defense Command \nfor 50 years of extraordinary service to the United States and Canada.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 561\n\n       Whereas, on May 12, 1958, the United States and Canada \n     signed an official agreement creating the bi-national North \n     American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and formally \n     acknowledged their mutual commitment to defending their \n     citizens from air attacks;\n       Whereas 2008 marks the 50th anniversary of the creation of \n     the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the \n     outstanding efforts of American and Canadian service men and \n     women defending North America;\n       Whereas the North American Aerospace Defense Command is a \n     unique and fully integrated bi-national United States and \n     Canadian command;\n       Whereas the North American Aerospace Defense Command is \n     headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, \n     Colorado, and administered by the United States Air Force, \n     with 3 subordinate regional centers located at Elmendorf Air \n     Force Base, Alaska, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, and \n     Canadian Forces Base, Winnipeg, Manitoba;\n       Whereas the mission of the North American Aerospace Defense \n     Command is to ``prevent air attacks against North America, \n     safeguard the sovereign airspaces of the United States and \n     Canada by responding to unknown, unwanted, and unauthorized \n     air activity approaching and operating within those \n     airspaces, and provide aerospace and maritime warning for \n     North America'';\n       Whereas, through joint support arrangements with other \n     commands, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, \n     including United States Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force \n     Base, Nebraska, detects, validates, and warns of attacks \n     against North America whether by aircraft, missile, or space \n     vehicle;\n       Whereas the North American Aerospace Defense Command and \n     United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) joint command \n     center serves as a central collection and coordination site \n     for a worldwide system of sensors designed to provide the \n     commander and the governments of Canada and the United States \n     with an accurate picture of any aerospace threat;\n       Whereas the commander of the North American Aerospace \n     Defense Command provides integrated tactical warning and \n     attack assessments to the governments of the United States \n     and Canada;\n       Whereas the North American Aerospace Defense Command uses a \n     network of satellites, ground-based and airborne radar, \n     fighters and helicopters, and ground-based air defense \n     systems to detect, intercept, and, if necessary, engage any \n     air-breathing threats to North America;\n       Whereas North American Aerospace Defense Command assists in \n     the detection and monitoring of aircraft suspected of illegal \n     drug trafficking;\n       Whereas the Alaskan NORAD Region located at Elmendorf Air \n     Force Base is supported by both the Eleventh Air Force and \n     Air National Guard units;\n       Whereas the May 2006 North American Aerospace Defense \n     Command Agreement renewal added a maritime warning mission to \n     its slate of responsibilities, which entails a shared \n     awareness and understanding of the ongoing activities \n     conducted in United States and Canadian maritime approaches, \n     maritime areas, and inland waterways;\n       Whereas the horrific events of September 11, 2001, \n     demonstrated the North American Aerospace Defense Command's \n     continued relevance to North American security;\n       Whereas, since 2001, the Continental NORAD region, which is \n     divided into 2 defense sectors--the Western Defense Sector, \n     with its headquarters located at McChord Air Force Base, \n     Washington, and the Eastern Defense Sector, with its \n     headquarters located at Rome, New York--has been the lead \n     agency for Operation Noble Eagle, an ongoing mission to \n     protect the continental United States from further airborne \n     aggression from inside and outside of America's borders;\n       Whereas, in the spring of 2003, North American Aerospace \n     Defense Command fighters based at Tyndall Air Force Base, \n     Florida, intercepted 2 hijacked aircraft that originated in \n     Cuba and escorted them to Key West, Florida;\n       Whereas the continued service with valor and honor of \n     American and Canadian men and women serving at the North \n     American Aerospace Defense Command is central to North \n     America's ability to confront and successfully defeat threats \n     of the 21st century; and\n       Whereas the continuation of the longstanding and successful \n     relationship between the United States and Canada through the \n     North American Aerospace Defense Command is paramount to the \n     future security of the people of the United States and \n     Canada: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the contributions made by the North American \n     Aerospace Defense Command to the security of North America; \n     and\n       (2) commemorates 50 years of excellence and distinctive \n     service to the United States and Canada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/13/senate-section/article/S4120-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4120-S4121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING CONCERNS OF POLICE SURVIVORS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 562, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 562) honoring Concerns of Police \n     Survivors as the organization begins its 25th year of service \n     to family members of law enforcement officers killed in the \n     line of duty.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, our Nation is blessed by the selfless \nservice of more than 26 million Americans who come to the aid of their \nfellow citizens through countless volunteer organizations at the \nnational, State and local levels. Some of these organizations are \nhousehold names, like the American Legion, Scouting, the American Red \nCross, and the American Cancer Society. Others perform their good work \nin relative obscurity.\n  This week, on the occasion of National Police Week, I rise to \nacknowledge the good work of a voluntary organization that few outside \nthe law enforcement community may ever have heard of. But for those in \nthe law enforcement community, it is the organization to which families \nturn in times\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\nof tragedy. I am referring to Concerns of Police Survivors, C.O.P.S. It \nserves some 15,000 surviving family members of law enforcement \ntragedies.\n  Last year, 181 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of \nduty. Their names are being added to the National Law Enforcement \nOfficers Memorial on Judiciary Square this week, bringing the total \nnumber of names on that memorial to 18,274. This evening, the annual \ncandlelight vigil is being held at the memorial to honor our fallen law \nenforcement officers and on Thursday, Peace Officers Memorial Day, \nanother ceremony will be held at the Capitol. These ceremonies are \nvisible to all of us. They are attended by law enforcement officers \nfrom around the Nation and the surviving family members of our fallen \nlaw enforcement officers.\n  But there is another event that occurs every year during National \nPolice Week that few know about. That event is the National Police \nSurvivors Seminar which is underway at a hotel in Alexandria, VA. I had \nthe privilege of visiting the National Police Survivors Seminar one \nSaturday morning in 2006. It is a peaceful place and a safe place where \nfamilies of fallen law enforcement officers can laugh, cry, grieve, and \nheal in the presence of others who have suffered similar losses. There \nare special programs for children of fallen law enforcement officers \nknown as ``C.O.P.S. Kids'' and ``C.O.P.S Teens.''\n  The National Police Survivors Seminar is the outgrowth of a dinner \nthat occurred 25 years ago on May 14, 2003. At this dinner 10 widows of \nfallen law enforcement officers came together to ask the question, \n``What about us?'' During the National Police Week gatherings, everyone \nfocuses on the loved one whose life is lost, but it also is important \nto focus on the needs of survivors who must rebuild their lives from \nthe ashes.\n  One year later, the first National Police Survivors Seminar was \nconvened. It drew 110 law enforcement survivors. Concerns of Police \nSurvivors was created at that first seminar. Suzie Sawyer was selected \nto be the first Executive Director of Concerns of Police Survivors, a \nposition she still holds today. Some things have changed though. The \nNational Police Survivors Seminar no longer draws hundreds now it draws \nthousands. That is both a tragedy and a blessing. It is a tragedy that \nso many law enforcement families have been touched by a line of duty \ndeath. It is a blessing that the volunteers of Concerns of Police \nSurvivors are there looking out for them. This is but one of many \nprograms that Concerns of Police Survivors offers to survivors \nthroughout the year.\n  Tomorrow marks the 25th anniversary of that dinner meeting that \nlaunched Concerns of Police Survivors. I rise today to offer a \nresolution commemorating the 25th anniversary of that meeting and to \nhonor Concerns of Police Survivors for the quarter century of service \nit has provided to law enforcement families that have suffered a line \nof duty death.\n  I know first hand of two Alaska families whose lives have been \ntouched by the good works of Concerns of Police Survivors. They have \ntouched families in every one of our States. Concerns of Police \nSurvivors does not seek recognition for its good works and it's not a \nhousehold name. But it has certainly earned our respect and admiration. \nOn the occasion of its 25th anniversary I am pleased to call this \norganization's fine work to the attention of the Senate and the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
