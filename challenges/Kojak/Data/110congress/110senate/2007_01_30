Mr. President, at long last, I believe we are on the \nverge of passing legislation that is long overdue. Soon we are going to \nvote on a procedural motion, known as a cloture motion, for the Fair \nMinimum Wage Act, which takes us one step closer to raising the minimum \nwage to $7.25 per hour over the next 2 years.\n  It has been 10 years since Congress has raised the minimum wage for \nthe lowest paid workers in America. Since we last raised the minimum \nwage, its value has eroded because of inflation, the rising cost of \nliving. Unlike our congressional pay raises, it has not kept pace with \nthe actual cost of living in America.\n  The Democrats have been trying for almost 10 years to convince the \nmajority party, then Republicans, that there\n\n[[Page S1300]]\n\nare millions of Americans who go to work every single day and still \ncan't make enough money to provide decent daycare for their kids, pay \ntheir medical and utility bills, and provide food and other essentials \nthat are part of every family's life.\n  Many of those people working for a minimum wage in Illinois make \nabout $6.50 an hour because we raised it on a State basis in my home \nState. Yet they understand the need to raise the minimum wage. One \nwoman wrote to me and said:\n\n       I can't support my daughter on the wages I have, and I have \n     to rely on my family. I won't get a significant increase in \n     my wages until you bump up the wages. I make about $14,000 a \n     year. I'm sure that's nothing to you but I have to live off \n     that.\n\n  This woman, by the way, is a college graduate trying to raise her \nchild, trying to do the right thing.\n  What help has she received from this Congress over the last 10 years? \nAlmost none. Keep in mind, she lives in a State where our minimum wage \nis higher than $5.15. I can't imagine, in the 21 States that are stuck \nat $5.15 an hour, how these folks get along.\n  I heard a lot of my colleagues stand up on the floor and make good \nspeeches about family values. Let's all agree on one thing: The most \nimportant family value is helping a parent raise a child and provide \nthe necessities of life, and $5.15 an hour will not do that.\n  So 6 million Americans are watching this debate. Those are the people \nliving on the minimum wage. I urge my colleagues to keep them in mind \nwhen we get a chance to vote this afternoon.\n\n\n                              the economy\n\n  Mr. President, I am honored that the President of the United States \nis in my home State of Illinois today. He is visiting Peoria, a great \ncity. It has a great major company, Caterpillar, which has had terrific \nsuccess. Caterpillar has shown increases in revenues and profits. It is \na great corporate citizen and neighbor in the Peoria area. We are proud \nit is doing well.\n  But I would like to talk for a minute about areas in Illinois that \nthe President will not be visiting. He will not be visiting Herod, IL, \nwhich lost 1,000 jobs recently when its Maytag manufacturing plant \nclosed; or DuQuoin, IL, where 356 manufacturing jobs were lost at \nArchway; and then Mount Vernon, where Joy Manufacturing lost 175 \nmanufacturing jobs; and Pinckneyville, where Technicolor Media Services \nwill be closing its plant on March 31, causing 444 people to lose their \njobs. I could go on.\n  Today President Bush comes to Peoria to talk about the state of the \nAmerica's economy. The reality of America's economy is that on his \nwatch, we have lost 3 million manufacturing jobs. Some have been \nreplaced with jobs in convenience stores, but we all know the harsh \nreality. A person working for a minimum wage in a convenience store is \nnot going to be able to take care of their family similar to someone \nworking in a manufacturing job.\n  We have to understand that America can do better. How can we do \nbetter? First, acknowledge that trade is part of our future; \nglobalization is as real as gravity. But make sure the trade agreements \nwe enter into are trade agreements that are sensible--sensible in terms \nof labor standards, environmental standards, and enforceable.\n  The one thing that troubles me the most is this Bush administration \nhas refused to enforce the trade agreements on the books. We all know \nwhat is going on in China--currency manipulation, dumping, unfair \nsubsidies. Under the Bush administration, in 6 years, they have only \nfiled two complaints against China for unfair trade practices.\n  As we lose good-paying jobs in America to China and other countries, \nwe need to stand up and enforce the trade agreements that this \nadministration and others have entered. The Bush administration needs \nto stand up for working families and fight off unfair trade practices \nthat steal good jobs from America.\n  We also have to understand another harsh reality. Most Americans \ntoday, when asked, don't believe their children will have as good a \nlife as they have had. That is such a sad commentary in America. It \nreflects the fact that 47 million Americans have no health insurance. \nIt reflects the fact that fewer and fewer Americans have a retirement \nplan on which they can count, and it shows us that the wages that are \nbeing paid to working families, middle-income families in America, are \nnot keeping up with the cost of housing, the cost of utility bills, the \ncost of gasoline for their cars, and the cost of putting their children \nthrough college.\n  If you want to know the real state of the economy, don't sit down and \ntalk to the economists. Talk to the real working families in Illinois \nand across America who are struggling each day to make ends meet, going \ndeeper in debt on their credit card bills and wondering if their kids \nwill have as good a chance in the America to come.\n  That is the reality of our economy. Oh, the stock market may be \nstrong. The heads of major corporations may be making tens of millions, \nhundreds of millions of dollars. The Tax Code may be crafted by this \nadministration to favor those who are doing so well. But the reality on \nMain Street in America is that people are struggling. We are losing \nmanufacturing jobs. We are not enforcing our trade agreements, and we \nare not giving the kind of hope which they need to working families \nacross America.\n  This Congress is going to start to turn that around. It will take \nsome time. First, we are going to raise the Federal minimum wage. Then \nwe are going to address the needs of the families who have kids in \ncollege, reduce the cost of those college student loans so kids don't \nend up with a mountain of debt when they finally graduate; find a way \nto make health care more affordable and bring down the cost of the \nprescription part of Medicare, Part D, so the seniors are not stuck \nwith the highest drug bills in America.\n  That I hope is the real state of the economy. I hope the President \nwill today acknowledge that reality.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  One last point I would like to make--the major issue on the minds of \nmost Americans is the situation in Iraq. The President now wants to \nsend 21,000 more troops to Iraq. Many of us feel this is a serious \nmistake; this is a strategy which has not been thought out.\n  This morning's Washington Post tells a story which is ominous. It is \nentitled ``Equipment for Added Troops is Lacking.'' It goes on to say:\n\n       New Iraq forces must make do, officials say.\n\n  And here is the grim reality. The 21,000 soldiers this President \nwants to send into Iraq to join the 144,000 there will go without the \nequipment and protection they need and deserve. This report, which \ncomes from the Pentagon, tells us that whether we are talking about \nvehicles, armor kits or basic equipment, our troops will not have what \nthey need. In fact, the statement in here is from LTG Stephen Speakes \nand suggests:\n\n       We don't have the [armor] kits, and we don't have the \n     trucks. . . . He said it will take the Army months, probably \n     until summer, to supply and outfit the additional trucks. As \n     a result, he said, combat units flowing into Iraq would have \n     to share the trucks assigned to units now there, leading to \n     increased use and maintenance.\n\n  I have to ask, before we put any more soldiers in harm's way, don't \nwe owe them the very best equipment they need so they can fight and \ncome home safely? Don't we owe that to them and their families?\n\n  Some argue that when we come to the floor and take exception to the \npolicies of this administration, it undermines the morale of the \ntroops. I couldn't disagree more. What undermines the morale of the \nNation's soldiers is the notion that they have to go into combat with \nless than the best equipment, that they have to go into combat without \nthe armor plate they need to come home safe and sound. That undermines \nmorale a lot more than any debate on the floor of the Senate, and it is \ntime for the White House and the Bush administration to answer honestly \nhow can we escalate this war in Iraq if we don't at least improve the \nequipment for the troops who are going into battle? That is the reality \nof what our soldiers face today and have faced throughout this war in \nIraq, and that is why we definitely need a new direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are in morning business at this time?\n\n[[Page S1301]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. We are in \nmorning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/30/senate-section/article/S1301-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1301-S1302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to, again, thank my friend from \nIllinois and also our leader for their strong support on the increase \nin the minimum wage. We will have more as we go on through the morning. \nWe expect to vote at noontime today on the increase on the minimum \nwage. This is day seven. We had five courageous Republicans who voted \nwith us to pass what we call a clean minimum wage law that would \nincrease the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25 without \nadditional kinds of tax provisions in there. The nine times we have \nincreased the minimum wage we have only added tax provisions on one \ntime. It is not necessary to add additional tax provisions, since we \nare restoring the purchasing power of the minimum wage to what it was \nsome 10 years ago.\n  But I raise another broader issue for a few moments and that is, What \nis it about these working families that so outrages our Republican \nfriends? What is it about providing a decent wage--some would say it is \nnot decent because it is still so low at $7.25 an hour--but what is it \nabout our Republican friends that they refuse to give us a vote in the \nSenate? It is true that 80 Republicans voted for an increase over in \nthe House of Representatives. But Republican leadership has been \nstrongly opposed to this over the last 10 years that I tried to bring \nup an increase in the minimum wage. It goes back a long period of time. \nWe are seeing it once again, here, as the President is against an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  I remind those who are watching the Senate deliberations this morning \nthat we do not have any amendments over here on our side. The Democrats \ndo not have any. They have more than 90 amendments over on the other \nside. I reminded the Senate, they have had amendments for over $200 \nbillion. Some are dealing with Social Security. There are $35 billion \nin tax cuts on education, but they didn't include any help or \nassistance for children on the IDEA, those with disabilities or, for \nthe neediest children, the Pell grants. We haven't had any \nconsideration on that. They dropped that amendment in on the minimum \nwage program, completely unrelated to the minimum wage program. They \nhad health savings accounts to benefit people with incomes of $133,000. \nWe have had all those kinds of amendments, and they continue, if you \nread through that list. I have gone through those amendments and they \ncontinue.\n  My question comes back to this. What is it that the Republican \nleadership has against working families? I have raised that over the \nperiod of the last few days and I raise it today. I was looking back at \nthe record of our Republican friends over the last year or so. They \neliminated 6 million workers from overtime. Do we understand that? In \nthe last 2 years, 6 million workers have had their overtime effectively \ncanceled.\n  Since the 1930s, under President Roosevelt, there was a recognition \nthat if people work more than 40 hours a week, they were going to be \nable to get overtime. The number of those individuals who work more \nthan 40 hours a week is significant. It is over 28 percent in our \ncountry today. But this administration eliminated that extra time and a \nhalf for 6 million workers.\n  We say: What is it about those 6 million workers? Then we think about \nthe opposition to the increase in the minimum wage. We take away their \novertime when we are seeing this extraordinary increase in executive \nsalaries, salaries which are exploding through the ceiling. Take away \nthat overtime for 6 million workers. All right.\n  Then we see the great tragedy we had with Katrina, and we saw the \nattempts to rebuild after Katrina. What was the first thing the \nadministration said? Eliminate any coverage or protection for workers \nin terms of their wages down there, what they call the Davis-Bacon \nprogram. It means they are not going to get paid what they get paid in \nthe various regions, eliminate that so you can drive wages down even \nfurther in New Orleans. What is the reason for that? It is a good way \nto drive wages down for workers.\n\n  What is it about people in the construction industry? They average, I \nthink it is $29,000 a year. That is too much for our Republican \nfriends? Or $10,712 for a working American, a man or woman at the \nminimum wage, and they refuse to give some increase in that to $7.25 an \nhour? Here you have the average construction worker at $29,000 a year, \nand you are saying that is too high. What is it about this Republican \nParty, against the working families?\n  What was in their minds when they eliminated safety positions and \nreduced the budget for mine safety, prior to the Sago and Alma mine \ndisasters? What was in their minds at that time, to reduce the kind of \nsafety provisions? Is the power of the mine companies so great they can \nincrease the risks for workers? Oh, yes, there are workers down there. \nThey are the ones we want to cut back on, in terms of their overtime. \nThey are the ones we are going to cut back on, in terms of safety.\n  I remember when this President Bush--after the first hearings we had, \nI think, in our committee--acted to eliminate the protections that had \nbeen recommended by President Clinton in the area of ergonomics, \nparticularly affecting women who spend a great deal of time on \ncomputers. It affects others--those in the meat-packing industry and \npoultry industry, workers who perform repetitive kinds of procedures. \nWe had extensive hearings. The Clinton recommendations were very \nmodest. He encouraged companies to get into this and work with \nindustry. Some people thought they were too weak, but they were \nprotecting workers, hard-working people doing some of the most \ndifficult work in America, protecting them so they are not going to get \nthe kinds of complicated health challenges that will disable so many of \nthose.\n  We know what the science is. We have had study after study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences that said do something in Congress. We did \nsomething. But oh, no, the Republican leadership said: No, we are not \ngoing to do that. We are not going to provide protection for those \nworkers. We are going to cut back on safety for those who work in the \nmines. We are going to cut back on overtime for 6 million. We are going \nto refuse to cover the workers down there in New Orleans who are \nworking, trying to rebuild, when this administration basically ignored \nthe problems there. Workers who were out there working, we are going to \ncut back and skimp on their salaries on this.\n  What is it about working people that this administration--the list \ngoes on. Look at the amendments that are lined up to weaken OSHA. We \nsee the number of lives that have been saved--tens of thousands of \nlives were saved. We have cut the death rate by more than 77 percent \nsince OSHA has been in effect. There are new problems, new challenges, \nin terms of toxic substances, we have to look at. What is the voice \nover there? We hear great speeches about what is happening to the \nmiddle class. Let's take a step that can make some difference--\ncertainly to 6 million children who will benefit if we increase the \nminimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25--6 million children's parents will \nbenefit. We will have that opportunity.\n  I don't know what has changed in productivity. We worked closely \ntogether, for years and years, for a decent wage. It shows back in the \n1960s, 1965 into the 1970s, we saw where our great American economy was \nmoving along, increasing productivity. That increase in productivity \nwas shared between the corporate world, the business world, and the \nworkers. That is what was happening. We will get the charts later on.\n  Evidently our friends on the other side want to prolong this debate. \nWe will get the charts to show that all America moved along in the \n1940s and the 1950s, all the way through the 1960s--each quintile moved \nalong virtually together. If you saw growth in the economy, it \nbenefited all the groups together.\n  What has come over this country, and particularly the Republican \nParty, to say that no longer works in the United States? We don't want \nan economy that is going to work for everyone. We want an economy that \nis going to work for some--a few. What is it about it? I termed it \n``greed.'' It is greed.\n\n[[Page S1302]]\n\n  We have seen now what has happened in the change, in the increase in \nproductivity. Still, the minimum wage goes down.\n  Mr. President, my excellent staff found that chart I was referring \nto--``Growing Together, 1947 to 1973.'' The lowest quintile, the \nsecond, third, right up to the very top--if you look at the different \ncolors, you will see that all America moved along together. Now look \nwhat has happened. Corporations get a $276 billion tax break, small \nbusiness a $36 billion tax break, and no increase in the minimum wage.\n  I hope somewhere during the course of this debate, our Republican \nfriends will come out and make at least some argument about either the \neconomics--it is an impossible one to make. You can't say it is the \nloss of jobs. We have dealt with that issue.\n  They will say you can't increase the minimum wage because it is \ninflationary in our economy. We show it is less than one-fifth of 1 \npercent of total wages paid over the course of the year. That argument \ndoesn't work.\n  They will try to say it is not what our country is about, we can't \nafford that in the richest country in the world, where people are \nworking. We demonstrate that the States which have an increase in \nminimum wage have grown faster and grown stronger and have a better \neconomic record. And most important, child poverty has gone down.\n  I imagine, over the period of this year, we will hear 100 speeches in \nthe different parts of our country about our children being our future. \nWe have an opportunity today at noontime to do something about that. \nYou don't have to make a speech, you have to vote right. You can vote \ntoday and, with that vote, hopefully, expedited process, that we can \nwind this legislation up and work out the differences with the House of \nRepresentatives and get it to the President to sign. Six million \nchildren will benefit.\n  So if you are talking about your concerns about middle class, if you \nare talking about working families, if you are talking about fairness \nand decency, if you are talking about children's issues, women's \nissues, civil rights issues, today at noon you have a chance to do \nsomething about it.\n  So I hope we will have more of an opportunity as we get closer to the \ntime to add some additional comments. But I would hope that finally \nthis basic, fundamental, and I think irrational, irresponsible, \nunacceptable, postured position our Republican friends have in terms of \nopposition--continued opposition, opposition, opposition--to the \nminimum wage would end. Today we are on the seventh day, but we debated \nthis 16 other days to try to get an increase in the minimum wage \nwithout the Republicans letting us have it. How many days? What is the \nprice? We don't even know what the price is. What are we supposed to \ndo--keep bidding it out and sweetening the pot until the Republicans \ncome along? Is that what the Americans want us to do? That is not what \nwe are prepared to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I assume we are proceeding as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I would just say that like many Members \non my side of the aisle, we pushed for a minimum wage bill last fall. \nRegrettably, it was filibustered, so we couldn't bring it to a vote. We \nare looking for and I intend to support a minimum wage bill if it has \nsome reasonable tax incentives for small businesses that would be \nseriously harmed in some instances by the cost of a very drastic rise \nin the minimum wage. But I am hoping we will be allowed and not be \nprevented from adding those tax breaks that I think everybody needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/30/senate-section/article/S1302-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1302-S1307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IRAQ AND RELATED ISSUES\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about Iraq and Iraq-\nrelated issues. I had the opportunity this past weekend and the \nprevious weekend to spend a good deal of time with the Missouri \nNational Guard men and women in Missouri who do a great job in \nproviding civil response to tremendous problems, whether it is floods \nor tornadoes or, in some instances, an ice storm that was devastating. \nMany of them have been to Iraq and Afghanistan and are going back, and \nthey are proud of what they do. They know they are doing the job the \nmilitary was assigned to do, and they are proud of it and we should \nsupport them.\n  Mr. President, it is noteworthy that I mention again my colleague and \nNational Guard Caucus Cochair Senator Pat Leahy and I will reintroduce \nthe National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act \nlater today.\n  This comprehensive legislation recognizes the paramount contributions \nthat our citizen soldiers and airmen have made not only in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, but all over the globe and particularly here at home.\n  The bill provides four central planks: the elevation of the Guard \nchief to the rank of general, a seat for the chief of the Guard Bureau \non the Joint Chiefs of Staff; mandates that the Deputy NorthCom \nposition be for an eligible National Guard officer; and it allows for \nthe National Guard Bureau to identify and validate equipment \nrequirements, particularly those unique to the Guard's homeland \nmissions.\n  When we went after the terrorists in Afghanistan, the Guard was \nthere. When we needed to establish order and stability in Iraq, the \nGuard was there. When Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf \nCoast, the Guard was there. When a natural or man-made disaster \nstrikes, the Governors call on the Guard, and the Guard is there. The \nnext time America needs military forces overseas, the Guard will be \nthere.\n  Unfortunately, when the Pentagon makes key decisions that impact the \nGuard, the Guard is still not there.\n  The need to empower the National Guard is not only still there but \ngrows each day. We need to give the Guard more bureaucratic muscle, so \nthat the force will not be continually pushed around in policy and \nbudget debates within the Pentagon.\n  Time and time again, the National Guard has had to rely on the \nCongress, not its total force partners in the active duty, to provide \nand equip fully the resources it needs to fulfill its missions.\n  Our legislation will end this nonsense. We will put the National \nGuard on an equal footing with other decision makers responsible for \nnational security and the transformation of the military forces.\n  As GEN Steve Blum, chief of the National Guard Bureau put it, they \nneed to be ``in the huddle'' at the Pentagon if they are to be in the \ngame. This will ensure that the next time the 430,000 National Guard \ncitizen-soldiers and airmen of the Guard are discussed at the senior \nlevels of the Pentagon, the Guard will be there.\n  Additionally, I remind my colleagues that the Fiscal Year 2007 \nMilitary Construction and Quality of Life Appropriations bill was not \npassed into law. As a result, approximately $17 billion in new \nconstruction and BRAC projects authorized by the Congress in 2007 \ncannot proceed.\n  The military service chiefs have urged the Congress to pass this \nlegislation\n  The projects funded by the Fiscal Year 2007 MILCON bill are necessary \nto sustain readiness and quality of life for U.S. service personnel. I \nalso ask that letter from the Navy and Army Secretaries and Service \nChiefs that raise concern about the risk by operating under a \ncontinuing resolution be printed in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters in support of this legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Naval Operations, \n           Commandant of the Marine Corps,\n                                Washington, DC, December 22, 2006.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: We are seeking your assistance in \n     lessening the severe burden placed on the Department of the \n     Navy in the absence of a Military Construction, Quality of \n     Life, and Veterans Affairs FY 2007 Appropriations bill, and \n     to offer our continued support for expeditious passage of \n     this important legislation.\n       Although the Continuing Resolution (CR) has provided some \n     initial relief, a CR in its\n\n[[Page S1303]]\n\n     current form of all of FY 2007 could severely impact Basic \n     Allowance for Housing (BAH) and Base Realignment and Closure \n     (BRAC) 05 accounts because funding has thus far been limited \n     to the smaller programs requested and enacted in FY 2006 as \n     compared to the larger programs requested in FY 2007. It \n     poses particularly acute problems in the Family Housing \n     Construction, Navy; Military Construction, Navy; and Military \n     Construction Naval Reserve accounts because of the \n     restriction on the award of ``new starts.''\n       BAH provides Sailors and Marines monthly cash payments for \n     their housing costs. Facilities, Sustainment, Restoration and \n     Modernization funds provide an immediate and visible \n     improvement to quality of life in the workplace. Both of \n     these accounts were moved from the Defense Bill to the \n     Military Construction, Quality of Life, and Veterans Affairs \n     for FY-07. It is important that the appropriations be made in \n     the traditional accounts with normal flexibilities. If we are \n     to manage under provisional levels for the full year, the \n     Department must be able to address execution issues that \n     inevitably will arise in these programs.\n       The CR is precluding our ability to provide modern, \n     government owned or privatized quality housing to our \n     Sailors, Marines and their families at a time when the Global \n     War on Terror is placing enormous stress on our military and \n     military families. The Department would be unable to complete \n     a long standing Department of Defense goal to obligate funds \n     needed to eliminate all inadequate housing by 2007. \n     Specifically, we would have to postpone construction of 250 \n     new homes at Naval Base Guam, and Marine Corps Logistics Base \n     Barstow CA. We would also have to postpone housing \n     privatization projects on over 8,000 homes at Navy and Marine \n     Corps installations in California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, \n     Massachusetts, Mississippi, North Carolina, South \n     Carolina, and Texas.\n       If we are providing funding for ``new starts,'' we can also \n     improve operational readiness with modernized facilities, \n     reduce national security threats at our nuclear weapons \n     facilities, and provide new training capabilities for our men \n     and women in uniform. Without funding, the Department would \n     be unable to award 44 ``new start'' military construction \n     projects in 11 states and four overseas locations totaling \n     $857 million. One example is the award of two $13 million \n     military construction projects for Mobile User Objective \n     System (MUOS) ground control and tracking stations--one in \n     Hawaii and another in Sigonella, Italy. MUOS is a $6.5 \n     billion narrowband UHF satellite communications capability \n     vital to our joint war fighters. There are operational \n     concerns as existing satellite communication systems are \n     failing as they reach the end of their service life. Without \n     these ground stations, planned launches of the MUOS \n     satellites already funded will be delayed, and the Department \n     faces additional costs for spacecraft and ground equipment \n     storage, contractual and additional fees, and other related \n     costs far greater than the cost of the construction.\n       With respect to BRAC 05, the CR can stymie our efforts to \n     construct facilities and move equipment and people to \n     receiver locations, and impede our ability to harvest savings \n     and organizational efficiencies already accounted for in the \n     budget. Delaying installation closures jeopardizes our \n     ability to proceed with the many joint recommendations that \n     require complex, sequential moves, all of which by statute \n     must be accomplished by September 2011. The Department of the \n     Navy's share of the Department of Defense BRAC account in FY \n     2007 is $690 million, compared to the FY 2006 enacted amount \n     of $247 million. While the Office of Management and Budget \n     has ruled that ``new starts,'' including BRAC construction, \n     is not a concern in the BRAC 05 account, the current CR is \n     limiting FY 2007 expenditures to the FY 2006 level. We will \n     have to delay an estimated $382 million of BRAC construction \n     and $61 million in civilian personnel moves, reductions, and \n     hiring actions, primarily for BRAC actions in New Orleans, LA \n     and southern California, until funding becomes available.\n       Prompt passage of an FY 2007 Military Construction, Quality \n     of Life, and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill would \n     resolve these difficulties. The appropriations bills endorsed \n     by the full House and Senate differed little from the \n     President's budget request for the Department of the Navy. \n     Should an FY 2007 bill prove unattainable, we would ask that \n     you expand the authority in the CR to allow funding to the \n     lower of the FY 2007 House and Senate appropriation bills, \n     and allow for ``new starts'' in military construction and \n     family housing accounts, subject as always to requirements of \n     the Authorization Act.\n       We appreciate your continued support for our country's \n     Sailors, Marines and their families. We stand ready to \n     respond to any questions or concerns that you may have.\n           Sincerely,\n     James T. Conway,\n       General, U.S. Marine Corps.\n     Michael G. Mullen,\n       Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n     Donald C. Winter,\n       Secretary of the Navy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Department of the Army,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 18, 2006.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Over the past several years, the \n     Army has executed an aggressive and carefully integrated plan \n     in support of our national security mission. Our plan \n     provides for simultaneous organizing, manning, training, \n     equipping, deploying and redeploying of units and Soldiers, \n     as well as the required materiel. It also lays the foundation \n     for retaining our position as the world's dominant land \n     force, to include base consolidation, restationing of troops, \n     and improvements essential to providing our Soldiers and \n     their families the standard of living they deserve.\n       Miltariy construction and quality of life initiatives \n     constitute large, crucial portions of this carefully \n     synchronized plan. Yet, the limitations imposed by the \n     Continuing Resolution (CR) are already causing our plan to \n     fray, and it is likely to unravel completely should we go \n     through the entire fiscal year under a CR. The potential \n     negative effects on operational readiness cannot be \n     overemphasized; the Army's ability to prosecute the Global \n     War On Terrorism and to prepare for future conflicts would be \n     severely hampered.\n       As an example, the Army's FY 2007 Military Construction \n     Plan includes almost $400 million to support the Army Modular \n     Force through construction of a battle command training \n     center, vehicle maintenance facility, several brigade complex \n     facilities, barracks and numerous child development centers. \n     Our force rotation plan to Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as \n     our overall readiness posture, relies on completing these \n     conversions to the Army Modular Force on time. We have \n     recruited and retained the Soldiers, purchased individual \n     force protection equipment, repaired and replaced weapons, \n     and established a training plan, but now we are faced with \n     the real possibility of not having facilities ready for \n     training, maintenance, communications and command activities. \n     We will have Soldiers at Fort Campbell, Fort Drum, and Fort \n     Stewart who are ready to fight, ready to lead and ready to \n     defend this country, but won't have adequate places to train, \n     work or sleep.\n       We will see similar situations in the Reserve Component. \n     The Army National Guard will be without aviation support \n     facilities, field maintenance shops and supply points. The \n     Army Reserve will lack several reserve centers, training \n     facilities and storage facilities. We will put at risk \n     funding or land provided by the states for many of these \n     projects. Citizens eager to serve this country will find a \n     lack of updated facilities.\n       Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) initiatives are quickly \n     coming apart at the seams, as the Army will be limited to \n     spending less than one-fourth of the amount needed to keep \n     approved BRAC moves on schedule. Imbedded in BRAC is the \n     movement of units from overseas back to the United States. \n     Delaying BRAC means we won't meet our the 1st Armored \n     Division from Germany to Fort Bliss and may hinder the \n     establishment of two critically needed modular brigade combat \n     teams. For every brigade combat team affected by these \n     delays, thousands of Soldiers will lack facilities to train \n     and work or, at best, will have only inadequate and outdated \n     facilities.\n       In summary, the Army will experience unacceptable delays in \n     constructing much needed facilities unless the Congress can \n     pass a full Military Construction/Quality of Life Bill for FY \n     2007 by February or expand and enhance the next Continuing \n     Resolution to permit the execution of all programs and \n     projects requested in the FY 2007 President's Budget.\n       The Army's leadership is prepared to answer any questions \n     you may have. We deeply appreciate your support of our men \n     and women in uniform.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Peter J. Schoomaker,\n\n                                      General, United States Army,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n                                                Francis J. Harvey,\n                                            Secretary of the Army.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, one of the big questions that is being \ndiscussed today is what the President's plans are in Iraq and whether \nwe should submit a resolution condemning the troop increases. I find it \npassing strange that many of the people pushing for a resolution to say \nwe shouldn't send troops just adopted by a unanimous vote the \nconfirmation of General Petraeus, who has said he believes he can do \nthe job if he has the additional troops. He says the number is 21,000. \nWho are we to second-guess an experienced general who knows what the \nneeds of his men and women in service are?\n  I have listened to many of the persuasive arguments on the other side \nabout their concerns about the Iraq war. There are some who want to cut \noff completely our involvement--cut and run. They have an argument; \nthey make a legitimate point. I hope we have a chance to vote on it \nbecause the intelligence community leaders from DNI to the military \nintelligence head to the CIA said cutting and running now would be a \ndisaster resulting in chaos, in additional killing of Iraqi citizens, \nand giving the entire area over to al-Qaida and probably bringing in a \nregion-wide conflict. So that is at\n\n[[Page S1304]]\n\nleast a position that I understand how they take it, but I will fight \nvery hard against it.\n  What I don't understand is the people who say they want to do several \nthings: They want to see a change in policy in Iraq. They want to see \nmore Iraqi responsibility. They want to change the rules of engagement \nso we can go after Shia death squads and there won't be any political \nrestrictions on it. And they want to adopt the strategy of the Baker-\nHamilton report. Many of these same people who are now urging the \nadoption of a resolution said we need to send more troops. Well, when \nyou look at it, the President is sending some more troops for a new \nstrategy which involves the Iraqi leadership, Prime Minister al-Maliki, \nthe Shia, as well as the Sunni and Kurdish leaders. They are now \nfighting without limitations on the rules of engagement. Our additional \nforces will be there at the request of al-Maliki to help him stabilize \nthe country. This is the last best chance. This is the chance to leave \na stable Iraq which will not become a terrorist ground for al-Qaida.\n  Sunday, I had the opportunity to talk to Jim Baker, the lead name on \nthe Baker-Hamilton report. I said: Jim, is the President's surge what \nyou recommend militarily? He said yes. That is precisely what the \nBaker-Hamilton commission recommended. He also recommended additional \ndiplomatic efforts. But in terms of the military effort, he said: This \nis what we recommended.\n  Now, how do we send troops over and then think maybe we can get some \npolitical cover back home by saying we don't really agree with it? I \ndon't think that does anything of real significance. There are some \nthings a resolution passed by this Congress expressing disapproval of \nthe President's plan would do, and I think they are significant and \nserious.\n  No. 1, it would send a message to those we fight against--al-Qaida, \nthe Baathists, Sunni insurgents--that we are not serious; we don't \nintend to support our men who are supporting the Iraqi military. It \ngives them cause to fight harder and stay longer.\n  No. 2, it sends a message to our friends whom Secretary Rice is \ntrying to bring in to help rebuild the economy of Iraq and provide jobs \nfor unemployed young Iraqis--essential if we want to win 80 percent of \nthe battle against radical Islam, which is ideological. It would tell \nthem: you probably better not put too much money on the Iraqis because \nthe U.S. Congress is going to pull the plug and then it will descend \ninto chaos and any dollars we invest will be gone.\n  Third, I would ask my colleagues to think about the message it sends \nto the troops who are there, to the troops who will be going there. \nThey are over there fighting. They are risking their lives every day. \nThey are willing to take on the fight because they believe it is an \nimportant fight. They believe it is a fight we can and we must win \nmilitarily. What message does it send to the families back home? I \nthink you can guess what that answer is.\n  I saw a very interesting article in the Washington Post on Sunday. \nRobert Kagan at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and a \nTransatlantic Fellow at the German Marshall Fund, has written a book. \nHe said:\n\n       Grand Delusion: Politicians in Both Parties Act as if They \n     Can Make the War Go Away Soon. It Won't.\n\n  He warns about all we are doing when we have laid out a plan and \nreinforcements for the Iraqi troops. He said:\n\n       Back in Washington, however, Democratic and Republican \n     Members of Congress are looking for a different kind of \n     political solution: The solution to their problems in \n     presidential primaries and elections almost two years off. \n     Resolutions disapproving the troop increase have proliferated \n     on both sides of the aisle. Many of their proponents frankly, \n     even proudly, admit they are responding to current public \n     mood. Those who think they were elected sometimes to lead \n     rather than to follow seem to be in the minority.\n\n  And he goes on to say that those who call for an end to the war don't \nwant to talk about the fact that the war in Iraq and in the region will \nnot end but will only grow more dangerous if and when we walk away.\n  As I said, our intelligence community leaders, in open testimony a \ncouple of weeks ago before the Senate Intelligence Committee, said if \nwe walk away, leaving Iraq without an army and a security force \nadequate to sustain general order, peace and order in that country, not \nonly will innocent Iraqis be slaughtered, there will be an open \ninvitation for others to come in. How long can the Shias oppress the \nSunnis without having the Jordanians and the Saudis and maybe the \nEgyptians come in to support them? We have already heard they would do \nthat, to protect the Sunnis. And if the Sunni supporters came in, it \nwould take about a New York minute for Iran to come in on behalf of the \nShia. What kind of conflagration would ensue? It would take a lot more \nAmerican troops to protect our ally Israel and to try to stop the \nkilling.\n  In addition, we know that al-Qaida would have a safe haven. And al-\nQaida is not mad because we are in Iraq; they just want to win in Iraq. \nMuqtada al-Sadr, the No. 2 man, has been very eloquent, and he has been \nbacked up by his boss, Osama bin Laden, who says: We have to win. Al-\nQaida needs to restore chaos to Iraq so they will have a safe haven in \nwhich to operate, train their suicide bombers, their jihadists, develop \nmeans of command and control once again, perhaps get weapons of mass \ndestruction. Well, that is what happens if we walk away and leave Iraq \nin chaos.\n  Back to Robert Kagan's piece:\n\n       Some people assume that if we can get the troops withdrawn, \n     then it won't be a problem for all of our Senators running \n     for President in 2008. Should any one of them win, they think \n     by getting out of Iraq now, it won't be a problem.\n\n  Bob Kagan says that:\n\n       That is a delusion. Not only a democratic delusion, but \n     some conservatives and Republicans have thrown up their \n     hands. And they think that if we walk away, somehow the whole \n     mess will simply solve itself and fade away.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Talk about a fantasy. The fact is the United States cannot \n     escape the Iraq crisis or the Middle East crisis of which it \n     is a part and will not be able to escape it for years. And if \n     Iraq does collapse, it will not be the end of our problems, \n     but the beginning of a new and much bigger set of problems.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, I think that sets it up very well. I hope our \ncolleagues will think about that. I hope they will consider that when \nthey are talking about passing a resolution. It sends the wrong message \nto the enemies, to our allies, and to our troops and their families at \nhome.\n  This war radical Islam has declared on us is a generational war, as \nthe President said. We best be laying plans to do our best to protect \nour country from repeated attacks such as September 11 by al-Qaida. \nThat is at stake. By being in Iraq, by having good intelligence at \nhome, we have been fortunate to avoid another September 11 attack. If \nal-Qaida had planned and regrouped, we would be much more likely to \nhave another.\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of the article by Mr. Kagan be printed \nin the Record after my remarks on Iraq.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 28, 2007]\n\nGrand Delusion: Politicians in Both Parties Act as if They Can Make the \n                      War Go Away Soon. It Won't.\n\n                           (By Robert Kagan)\n\n       It's quite a juxtaposition. In Iraq, American soldiers are \n     finally beginning the hard job of establishing a measure of \n     peace, security and order in critical sections of Baghdad--\n     the essential prerequisite for the lasting political solution \n     everyone claims to want They've launched attacks on Sunni \n     insurgent strongholds and begun reining in Moqtada al-Sadr's \n     militia. And they've embarked on these operations with the \n     expectation that reinforcements will soon be on the way: the \n     more than 20,000 troops President Bush has ordered to Iraq \n     and the new commander he has appointed to fight the \n     insurgency as it has not been fought since the war began.\n       Back in Washington, however, Democratic and Republican \n     members of Congress are looking for a different kind of \n     political solution: the solution to their problems in \n     presidential primaries and elections almost two years off. \n     Resolutions disapproving the troop increase have proliferated \n     on both sides of the aisle. Many of their proponents frankly, \n     even proudly, admit they are responding to the current public \n     mood, as if that is what they were put in office to do. Those \n     who think they were elected sometimes to lead rather than \n     follow seem to be in a minority.\n       The most popular resolutions simply oppose the troop \n     increase without offering much useful guidance on what to do \n     instead, other than perhaps go back to the Baker-Hamilton \n     commission's vague plan for a\n\n[[Page S1305]]\n\n     gradual withdrawal. Sen. Hillary Clinton wants to cap the \n     number of troops in Iraq at 137,500. No one explains why this \n     is the right number, why it shouldn't be 20,000 troops lower \n     or higher. But that's not really the point, is it?\n       Other critics claim that these are political cop-outs, \n     which they are. These supposedly braver critics demand a \n     cutoff of funds for the war and the start of a withdrawal \n     within months. But they're not honest either, since they \n     refuse to answer the most obvious and necessary questions: \n     What do they propose the United States do when, as a result \n     of withdrawal, Iraq explodes and ethnic cleansing on a truly \n     horrific scale begins? What do they propose our response \n     should be when the entire region becomes a war zone, when al-\n     Qaeda and other terrorist organizations establish bases in \n     Iraq from which to attack neighboring states as well as the \n     United States? Even the Iraq Study Group acknowledged that \n     these are likely consequences of precipitate withdrawal.\n       Those who call for an ``end to the war'' don't want to talk \n     about the fact that the war in Iraq and in the region will \n     not end but will only grow more dangerous. Do they recommend \n     that we then do nothing, regardless of the consequences? Or \n     are they willing to say publicly, right now, that they would \n     favor sending U.S. troops back into Iraq to confront those \n     new dangers? Answering those questions really would be honest \n     and brave.\n       Of course, most of the discussion of Iraq isn't about Iraq \n     at all. The war has become a political abstraction, a means \n     of positioning oneself at home.\n       To the extent that people think about Iraq, many seem to \n     believe it is a problem that can be made to go away. Once \n     American forces depart, Iraq will no longer be our problem. \n     Joseph Biden, one of the smartest foreign policy hands in the \n     Senate, recently accused President Bush of sending more \n     troops so that he could pass the Iraq war on to his \n     successor. Biden must assume that if the president took his \n     advice and canceled the troop increase, then somehow Iraq \n     would no longer be a serious crisis when President Biden \n     entered the White House in 2009.\n       This is a delusion, but it is by no means only a Democratic \n     delusion. Many conservatives and Republicans, including \n     erstwhile supporters of the war, have thrown up their hands \n     in anger at the Iraqi people or the Iraqi government. They, \n     too, seem to believe that if American troops leave, because \n     Iraqis don't ``deserve'' our help, then somehow the whole \n     mess will solve itself or simply fade away. Talk about a \n     fantasy. The fact is, the United States cannot escape the \n     Iraq crisis, or the Middle East crisis of which it is a part, \n     and will not be able to escape it for years. And if Iraq does \n     collapse, it will not be the end of our problems but the \n     beginning of a new and much bigger set of problems.\n       I would think that anyone wanting to be president in \n     January 2009 would be hoping and praying that the troop \n     increase works. The United States will be dealing with Iraq \n     one way or another in 2009, no matter what anyone says or \n     does today. The only question is whether it is an Iraq that \n     is salvageable or an Iraq sinking further into chaos and \n     destruction and dragging America along with it.\n       A big part of the answer will come soon in the battle for \n     Baghdad. Politicians in both parties should realize that \n     success in this mission is in their interest, as well as the \n     nation's. Here's a wild idea: Forget the political posturing, \n     be responsible, and provide the moral and material support \n     our forces need and expect. The next president will thank \n     you.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I start by telling the Senator from \nMissouri how much I appreciate his leadership on this issue. As the \nranking member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, he knows \nas well as anyone what is at stake in Iraq and in the global war on \nterror. I know his son, Sam, is a member of the Marine Corps and has \nserved in Iraq. I believe he is either back or headed back here very \nsoon, so this is a matter in which the Senator from Missouri has a \npersonal investment, in addition to the larger investment all Americans \nhave in making sure our security is protected to the extent possible. \nThat is what it boils down to.\n  Some say we have to do this for the Iraqis. I suggest, as laudable as \nthat is, we need to do this for us. What do I mean by ``this''? I mean \nwhat the Iraq Study Group--the bipartisan group created to look into \nthe challenge of the conflict in Iraq--recommended. They pointed out \nquite clearly that it is in America's vital security interests to leave \nIraq when we do. Of course, that is the goal we all share. We want to \nleave Iraq, but we must leave Iraq based on conditions where Iraq can \nsustain itself, defend itself, and govern itself.\n  It is bewildering to see a vote like we saw last Friday in the Senate \nwhere GEN David Petraeus, the new commander in Iraq, was confirmed \nunanimously by this Senate, yet there are those who say: Yes, we are \ngoing to confirm you, General, unanimously. We are going do say nice \nthings about you and your talents and dedication and patriotism that \nyou have demonstrated by your service, but the plan that you are the \narchitect of, we are not going to support it. We are going to pass a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution which, in his own words, undermines his \nability to be successful in America's ability to protect its national \nsecurity interests by leaving Iraq in a condition that it can sustain, \ngovern, and defend itself, and which sends a wrong message to our \nenemies.\n  The consequences of failure in Iraq are best summed up by the Iraq \nStudy Group on page 34. They said that a chaotic Iraq would provide a \nstill stronger base of operations for terrorists who seek to act \nregionally or even globally. Al-Qaida will portray any failure by the \nUnited States in Iraq as a significant victory that will be featured \nprominently as they recruit for their cause in the region around the \nworld.\n  It will surely be a failed state if we leave Iraq before conditions \non the ground permit the Iraqis to govern, sustain, and defend \nthemselves. It will likely lead to a failed state much as Afghanistan \nwas after the Soviet Union was run out of Afghanistan in 1979.\n  What was that condition? We know all too well on September 11, 2001, \nwhen America was hit by al-Qaida on our own shores, that what happened \nin the interim between the time the Soviet Union left Afghanistan was a \nrise of the Taliban and al-Qaida, including Osama bin Laden, who was \nplotting and planning and training and then exporting terror attacks \nagainst the United States and against our allies.\n  It is entirely probable, in my opinion, that if we leave Iraq \nprematurely, before it can sustain, govern, and defend itself, Iraq \nwill become another failed state like Afghanistan, another place where \nterrorists can train, recruit, and then export terrorist attacks \nagainst the United States and our allies.\n  It is also likely that if we leave Iraq prematurely, it would lead to \na broader regional conflict, probably involving Syria, Iran, Saudi \nArabia, and Turkey, and we may have to later return at a greater cost \nto our Nation.\n  This is another matter to which I don't think the people have paid \nenough attention: to leave Iraq prematurely would lead to massive human \nsuffering. The other day, the Judiciary Committee had a hearing on \nIraqi refugees. Of course, there are brave Iraqis who have worked \nalongside America and our allies to try to restore democracy to that \ncountry after Saddam's bloodthirsty reign. They are worried, as they \nshould be, that if America pulls out, along with our coalition \npartners, before Iraq is able to sustain, govern, and defend itself, \nthey will be slaughtered. It will be ethnic cleansing where Shia will \nkill Sunni. It will draw in, likely, the Sunni majority nations such as \nSaudi Arabia to defend the Sunnis against ethnic cleansing.\n  We are at a crossroads. The choices are not necessarily good ones, \nbut they are the choices with which our Nation is confronted. We can \neither stay with the status quo which, frankly, I don't know anyone who \nbelieves the status quo is working or, No. 2, we can, as some have \nsuggested, cut off funding for our troops and result in a precipitous \nwithdrawal from Iraq or, No. 3, we can devise a new strategy in an \neffort to succeed where the current strategy has not in Iraq.\n  I believe the obvious choice is No. 3. If we are going to confirm a \nnew Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, as we have done; if we are \ngoing to confirm a new general leading coalition forces in Iraq, like \nDavid Petraeus, as we have done; if we are going to confirm a new \ncommander of Central Command, Admiral Fallon, as I am confident we will \ndo; we need to ask for their advice, get their advice, and, frankly, \ntake their advice. I am afraid this has become far too political and \nnot focused, as it should be, on a bipartisan basis, on what is in \nAmerica's strategic and security self-interest.\n  The Washington Post summed it up in an editorial this way. They said \nlegislators need a better way to act on their opposition to the current \npolicy than passing a nonbinding resolution that may cover them \npolitically but have no practical impact other than\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\nperhaps the negative one suggested by the general--and they are talking \nabout General Petreaus. What are the negative impacts? General Petreaus \nmade that clear in the nomination hearings before the Senate Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Senator McCain asked:\n\n       Suppose we send you additional troops and we tell the \n     troops, while we support you, we are convinced you cannot \n     accomplish your mission, and we do not support the mission \n     that we are sending you on. What effect does that have on the \n     morale of the troops?\n\n  General Petraeus:\n\n       Well, it would not be a beneficial effect, sir.\n\n  Senator Lieberman:\n\n       A Senate-passed resolution of disapproval for this new \n     strategy in Iraq would give the enemy some encouragement, \n     some feeling that well, some clear expression that the \n     American people are divided?\n\n  General Petraeus:\n\n       That's correct, sir.\n\n  I understand as well as anybody the reservations that Members of the \nSenate have about the new plan. The question we all have is, Will it \nwork? Obviously, there are no guarantees. However, I know there is one \nsure plan for failure that will embolden our enemies, undermine our \nallies, and demoralize our troops, and that is to pass a resolution of \nno confidence in the only plan that has now been proposed for a new way \nforward in Iraq: working with the Iraqi Government, Prime Minister \nMaliki, making it clear there are benchmarks they need to meet; that it \nis their country, and they need to take the lead. We will support them. \nWe will help stiffen their spine, particularly when it comes to \npreventing sectarian violence and taking on the militias which have \nruled the streets in so much of Iraq. But this is the only chance and \nthe only alternative that has been offered by anyone, so far, as to the \nway forward.\n  I make an appeal to our colleagues on the Democratic side of the \naisle. On November 7, we had an election. As a result of that election, \nDemocrats no longer were a minority party but became the majority in \nthe Congress, both in the House and in the Senate. While I understand \nthat as a minority party frequently we do not have the opportunity to \nset the agenda or to provide the leadership and are left with \ncriticizing what the majority party does, my hope would be that the new \nmajority would rise to the occasion, would set partisanship aside as \nmuch as possible, particularly with regard to our national security \ninterests, would not focus on the 2008 election or worry about \nindividual political outcomes. My hope is the new majority would use \nthis as an opportunity to work with the new minority to send a vote of \nconfidence and to provide a plan, support for the plan that has been \ndrafted by General Petraeus and supported by all our military \nleadership for the possibility of a successful way forward in Iraq.\n  Frankly, for our friends on the other side of the aisle to merely \ncriticize and offer resolutions of no confidence that are not binding \nis not an act of encouragement. It is not an act of patriotism but, \nunfortunately, as General Petraeus said, it will undermine our troops' \nmorale and embolden our enemies. We all owe it to the troops who have \nrisked their lives, to the families who have paid the ultimate \nsacrifice in defense of freedom and to protect our security, to do our \nvery best to work together to try to support a way forward in Iraq \nwhich has the best chance of success.\n  My hope is, in the coming days, through this debate, we will agree to \ndo that, and we will avoid making political statements that have no \nbinding effect and which serve only to embolden our enemies and \nundermine our friends.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Arizona on the floor of the \nSenate, and I yield to him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I join my colleague, the Senator from Texas, \nin urging the Senate to think very carefully about passing what appears \nto be a nonbinding resolution, but what, in fact, has dramatic \nconsequences.\n  It is true that a nonbinding resolution would not change the policy \nof the President; he is the Commander in Chief. He has decided on a new \nstrategy after consultation with a lot of people, and that new strategy \nis now being implemented in Iraq as we speak.\n  The Senate, last Friday, confirmed GEN David Petraeus to carry out \nthat policy. By the way, it seems quite incongruous we would, on the \none hand, confirm General Petraeus, pat him on the back, and say: Go do \nthe mission in Iraq--by the way, we disagree with the mission. That is \none of the bad messages that is sent.\n  I would like to talk a little bit more about the sending of messages \nwith the nonbinding resolutions. That is obviously what the proponents \nof the resolutions would like to do. They have talked about sending a \nmessage. Mostly they are trying to send a message to the President. Of \ncourse, any Senator who wants to talk to the President has that \ncapability. We do not need to send messages to the President publicly \nin areas that cause harm. We should think about the consequences of \nsuch a message to our enemies, to our allies, and most especially to \nthe troops that we send in harm's way.\n  Think for a moment about the consequences of a message that says that \nwe disagree with the President's strategy, we disagree with the \nmission, and we don't believe that any more troops should be involved \nor that the United States should remain in Iraq beyond a very limited \nperiod of time. The message that sends to our enemies is a devastating \none.\n  As General Petraeus testified before the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices, war is about breaking the will of your opponent. He feared \nthe consequences of such a resolution which he said would not be \nhelpful because it would send a signal to our enemies that we don't \nhave the support in the United States Government necessary to break the \nwill of the opponent.\n  These terrorists well understand this is a contest of wills. Can they \noutlast us? Osama bin Laden thinks we are the ``weak horse,'' as he \nputs it, and he is the ``strong horse''; that we left Vietnam, that we \nleft Lebanon, that we left Somalia, and we will leave Iraq before the \njob is done as well. And he believes that. So there is a test of wills \ngoing on. And if the enemies come to believe they can outlast us, that \ntheir will is stronger than ours, then it is very difficult to defeat \nthem in this war against terrorism.\n  The message it sends to our allies is we are not necessarily a \nreliable ally. Certainly, to people in the neighborhood--the people in \nAfghanistan, in Pakistan, and elsewhere--you can imagine they would \nquickly begin to hedge their bets because of the neighborhood in which \nthey live. If we are going to leave, and they have to continue to live \nwith these bad actors, then, as before September 11, you will see them \nbegin to hedge their bets and provide support for, in one way or \nanother, terrorists who live in that neighborhood. That is against the \nnational security interest of the United States.\n  The message that is sent to our troops is perhaps the most \ndevastating because it says: We have sent you on a mission, and yet we \ndo not believe in the mission. We are putting you in harm's way. You \nmay, in fact, die trying to complete your mission, but it is not a \nmission that we believe in.\n  Think about the message that sends to the troops and to the families.\n  Very interestingly, last Friday, ``NBC Nightly News'' had an \ninterview with three soldiers from Iraq talking about this very point. \nIt was in the Brian Williams newscast. He called on Richard Engel, \nreporting from Baghdad, who had interviewed these three soldiers. I \nthink what they had to say should instruct us. He talked about the new \nmission they were on, and he said:\n\n       It's not just the new mission the soldiers are adjusting \n     to. They have something else on their minds:\n\n  This is David Engel, the reporter, speaking--\n\n     the growing debate at home about the war. Troops here say \n     they are increasingly frustrated by American criticism of the \n     war. Many take it personally, believing it is also criticism \n     of what they've been fighting for. Twenty-one-year-old \n     Specialist Tyler Johnson is on his first tour in Iraq. He \n     thinks skeptics should come over and see what it's like \n     firsthand before criticizing.\n\n  Then, this is what SPC Tyler Johnson said:\n\n       Those people are dying. You know what I'm saying? You may \n     support--``Oh, we support the troops,'' but you're not \n     supporting what they do, what they share and sweat for, what \n     they believe for, what we die for. It just don't make sense \n     to me.\n\n\n[[Page S1307]]\n\n\n  Engel then said:\n\n       Staff Sergeant Manuel Sahagun has served in Afghanistan and \n     is now in his second tour in Iraq. He says people back home \n     can't have it both ways.\n\n  Then SSG Manuel Sahagun said:\n\n       One thing I don't like is when people back home say they \n     support the troops but they don't support the war. If they're \n     going to support us, support us all the way.\n\n  Finally, Engel said:\n\n       Specialist Peter Manna thinks people have forgotten the \n     toll the war has taken.\n\n  SPC Peter Manna said:\n\n       If they don't think we're doing a good job, everything that \n     we've done here is all in vain.\n\n  Engel closed his report saying:\n\n       Apache Company has lost two soldiers and now worries their \n     country may be abandoning the mission they died for.\n\n  That is the message we send to our troops: that they may be dying in \nvain, that they may be putting their life on the line in vain because \nwe do not support the mission we put them in harm's way to accomplish. \nThat is a devastating blow to morale.\n  Just imagine what you would do if you were the parent or the spouse \nof one of those soldiers who got killed and came to believe the mission \nwe had sent them on was no longer a mission that we supported, and yet \nwe continue to keep them in harm's way.\n  My view is, if you think this war is lost or that we cannot win it, \nthat you have the courage of your convictions and vote to cut off the \nfunds and bring the folks home right now before any more die. But if \nyou believe, as the President does, that we must not leave Iraq a \nfailed state, that there is still an opportunity there to succeed, and \nthat his plan deserves a chance to succeed, then we should not support \nresolutions that send a different message.\n  That is why I want to urge my colleagues to think very carefully \nbefore supporting any of these resolutions which may be nonbinding on \nthe President but, nevertheless, have severe consequences to our \nenemies, to our allies, and to the troops we put into harm's way. This \nis serious business we are about. We need to consider it seriously and \nnot undercut the troops we put in harm's way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/30/senate-section/article/S1307-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes to speak on the \nminimum wage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, a little more than 2 years ago, Rev. Jim \nWallis and Rev. Bob Griswold--who was then-head of the Episcopal \nChurch--presented to Congress a document that\n\n[[Page S1308]]\n\nproved to be both prophetic and practical.\n  The basic tenets were that budgets are moral documents--these are \ncoming from two people of faith, religious leaders in our country--and \nour values are represented by how we craft those documents.\n  The same can be said for legislation, and the same values represented \nin the fight, for example, to raise the minimum wage.\n  As wages have stagnated in States such as Ohio, CEO salaries have \nskyrocketed. And while Congress voted time and again to raise its own \npay--six times in the 10 years since the minimum wage has been raised--\nit left behind millions of Americans who work hard, who play by the \nrules, and who too often have so little to show for their hard work.\n  In my home State of Ohio, voters in November echoed the national cry \nfor social and economic justice by voting in favor of a ballot \ninitiative to raise our State's minimum wage.\n  In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King said:\n\n       Equality means dignity. And dignity means a job and a \n     paycheck that lasts through the week.\n\n  It is unacceptable that someone can work full time--and work hard--\nand not be able to lift her family out of poverty or even pay her \nbills. For too long Government priorities rewarded a system that \nallowed a minimum wage worker to earn less than $11,000 a year. Yet \nsome CEOs in our great country make more than $11,000 an hour.\n  Those who vote against the minimum wage this week--those who have \nblocked a minimum wage increase in the House of Representatives and in \nthis Senate for a decade--are saying to minimum wage workers such as \nthe single mother working as a chambermaid in Cleveland and a farm \nworker outside Toledo and a janitor in Zanesville that they do not \ndeserve a fraction--not a fraction--of what we get.\n  While the cost of living has gone up, the investment in workers has \nslowly declined. Family budgets are strained because of stagnant wages \nbut pushed to the breaking point when you factor in soaring tuition \ncosts, health care costs, and energy costs.\n  Yet while wages have stayed stagnant or gone down, worker \nproductivity in this country, as Senator Kennedy showed a moment ago, \ncontinues to go up. Those workers are not sharing in the wealth they \nare creating for their employers. It is time Congress stood on the side \nof the working men and women in this country.\n  This issue is not just about workers. Raising the minimum wage \naffects entire families and communities. In my State, the minimum wage \nincrease will mean an increase for 500,000 wage earners, with 200,000 \nchildren living in those homes.\n  When workers earn a livable wage--and especially if we can expand the \nearned-income tax credit, a tax break for those workers--those \nfamilies, who are working hard and playing by the rules, will spend \nthat money locally, which supports small business and helps strengthen \nthe community.\n  When workers earn a livable wage, stress and burdens that often \ncripple families struggling to survive are eased.\n  When workers earn a livable wage, they are more productive at work, \nwhich means thriving companies that can compete in the global economy.\n  Raising the minimum wage means so much more than a few extra dollars \non Friday. It means a path out of poverty.\n  Raising the minimum wage is an affirmation that this Congress--\nfinally--values American workers. It is about the right family values, \nand it is about time.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the Baucus substitute to H.R. 2. At about \nthe noon hour today, we will be voting to end the debate on the minimum \nwage bill. Regardless of how that vote turns out, I believe the \ndirection this body has decided upon with regard to minimum wage is \nclear. And I appreciate it. The direction the Senate has taken is that \nraising the minimum wage without providing relief for small businesses \nwould be wrong. And now we have a cloture vote on a bill that includes \nrelief for small businesses, which will soften the impact that the \nminimum wage increase will have on small businesses.\n  We are trying to keep working families working. The people who run \nthese small businesses are working families, too. They are taking a lot \nof risk and providing a lot of jobs. In fact, they are the engine that \ndrives the United States. The big companies would like us to think they \nare. But small businesses create a lot of jobs.\n  Now, primarily, the jobs we are talking about are for people just \nentering the labor market, the ones often who dropped out of school, \nwho have very low employment skills. Those small businesses teach them \nsome skills and move them on up to the path of employment. They are a \nhuge part of the job training system in this country and they rarely \nget any credit for job training.\n  We have had debate over the last week--and it has just been one week. \nI would like to point out that on Monday we did not have any votes. On \nTuesday we were only allowed two votes. Through the whole week we only \nhad 11 votes. We were not allowed any votes after Thursday, which \nincluded all of Friday and all of yesterday. That is really not an open \nprocess. That is only three days of voting on amendments.\n  When we began this session, we talked about having an open process, a \nvery bipartisan process of doing things. I am not sure we got the \nmessage from the last election, which was that the American people want \nus to do these things, but they want us to do them in a bipartisan way. \nI am hearing some rhetoric on the Senate floor about the Republicans \nwant to do this; and the Democrats want to do that.\n  What we need to talk about is what we need to do for America. We need \nto work together on these things. Right now we have a proposal for \ncloture that includes what both sides have been talking about, that \ntakes care of the minimum wage worker and takes care of the businesses \nthat employ them and gives them the training.\n  We in the Senate recognize that small businesses have been the steady \nengine for growing the economy and that they have been the source of \nnew job creation. America's working families rely on small businesses, \nand small businesses rely on working families.\n  So I am proud this body has chosen a path that attempts to preserve \nthis segment of the economy which employs so many working men and \nwomen. The Senate has recognized that our economy is interdependent. \nOne simply cannot claim credit to be helping workers at the same time \nthey are hurting the businesses that employ them. Recognition of this \nsimple fact is the reason the bill before this body couples a raise in \nthe minimum wage with relief to those businesses and working families \nthat will face the most difficulty in meeting that mandate.\n  This body has also recognized the even simpler fact that raising the \nminimum wage is of no benefit to a worker without a job or a job seeker \nwithout a prospect.\n  I take this occasion to urge that these simple, real world truths be \nrecognized by our colleagues in the other Chamber. I have gone through \nthis process before on a number of bills and tried to figure out how it \nhappens. A lot of time there is more animosity between the two Houses \nthan there is between the two parties that serve in those Houses.\n  I know making any change to the minimum wage bill they sent over will \nupset them on that end, just as any change they make to a bill on their \nend upsets us. We send them perfect bills and they have to fiddle with \nit, and they send us perfect bills and we fiddle with it. There is some \nanimosity between the two Chambers. And then we have to get into the \nrules as well. All tax measures have to start in the House. That is \nfine as long as they start them. But there has to be a way to get the \nprocess moving.\n  This bill has a way to get that process moving. It is more cumbersome \nthan it probably ought to be, but I think with cooperation it will \nwork, and I think the House will join us in this effort. It isn't as \neasy as just taking a small piece of something that affects the economy \nand doing it in isolation. When we start going to the broader economy, \nit gets more complicated.\n  That is why our forefathers designed this great system of cumbersome \nGovernment. We have 100 people with 100\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\nviews--I don't know, maybe we have 100 people with 200 views, and the \nHouse has 435 people with at least an equal number of views. The beauty \nof our system is that it has to get through this maze of all of these \npeople with different backgrounds and different ideas and different \nways of seeing the world, which results in amendments which result \nusually in things getting better.\n  It is often complicated, and that slows the process down. That is \nsomething we have to work through, but I think any mechanism we have \nthat speeds things up usually results in us winding up with legislation \nwe have to go back and correct. It is a tough system, a long system, \nbut it works.\n  Unquestionably, as this Congress moves forward, we will need to \nconfront a range of issues facing working families. We have to face the \nrising cost of health insurance and the availability of that insurance, \nthe necessity and costs of education and job training, and the desire \nto achieve an appropriate balance between work and family life.\n  These are important issues, and the way this body has determined to \naddress the minimum wage should give us an outline as to the way such \nother issues could be approached as well. We need to listen to each \nother and include those issues that make a difference without upsetting \nthe whole world. It can be done. It has been done.\n  Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus work together on legislation. \nThey are the ones who put together this tax package. They said: No, \nthis isn't exactly what I like or you like, but it is something we can \nlike together, and it has a chance of passing this body.\n  I have been pleased that there hasn't been a rage against the tax \npackage they put together, just as there hasn't been a rage against \nraising the minimum wage. We appear to have two points on which there \nis agreement. I think that will be reflected later in today's vote, \ntoo.\n  There are other issues. Those other issues have been reflected in \namendments from our side. There have been a few, contrary to what has \nbeen said on the floor, amendments from the other side as well. When we \nwere in the majority, we didn't put in nearly as many amendments on \nbills as the Democrats did, and I recognize why offering amendments is \nimportant. It is important because we have issues we think are \nimportant, and the only chance you have to have them passed on the \nfloor is to put them in a bill as an amendment, if you are in the \nminority.\n  So on our side, we will likely offer more amendments to the bills \nthat come up this year than those who got to draft the bill to begin \nwith. They are ideas we want to have considered. We hope they will be \nconsidered in a reasonable way and in a reasonable amount of time.\n  I will be emphasizing to our side the need to keep those reasonable \nand to keep them within a reasonable timeframe. If we do that, we can \nprogress through a lot of issues, such as the ones I mentioned.\n  The rising cost and availability of health insurance in this country \nis at a crisis and we have to do something about it. There are a number \nof plans that are floating out there, and all of them--all of them--\nhave some good points to them. None of them is perfect. That bill will \nhave to go through the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \nIt probably will. There are ways it can be written, I suppose, where it \ncan be sent through the Judiciary Committee or sent through the Finance \nCommittee. But usually that bill goes through the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee.\n  The chairman of the committee and I as ranking member of that \ncommittee--and it doesn't matter what session of Congress we are \ntalking about or what decade of Congress you are talking about--the \nchairman and the ranking member in that committee often have a huge \ndisparity of views on how to solve the health, education, labor, and \npensions issues.\n  We adopted 2 years ago a little rule that I found to be very useful \nwhen I was in the Wyoming legislature, and that is the 80-20 rule. That \nis, people agree on 80 percent of the issues and 80 percent of any \nissue. This isn't just a philosophy for Congress, this is a philosophy \nfor one's daily life. If you are working with other people, you will \nprobably find you will agree on 80 percent of whatever you are talking \nabout. On any particular issue, you usually agree on 80 percent of that \nissue. If you concentrate on the 80 percent of agreement, there are a \nlot of possibilities for getting things done. If you concentrate on the \n20 percent on which you don't agree, there is very little likelihood \nthat you are going to progress on whatever it is you are talking about.\n\n  That is something we have instituted in this committee, and I think \nthat rule has moved it from the most contentious committee to the most \nproductive committee. I don't know if people noticed during the last \nsession of Congress, there were 35 bills brought out of that committee. \nWe got 25 of them considered in the Senate and even helped the House to \nget 2 of theirs through. So we helped to get 27 bills signed by the \nPresident. That is at least 20 more than usual for any committee and \nprobably about 24 more than usual for any committee.\n  There are disadvantages to that. The press likes a good fight, and \nthe press is more than willing to report on a good fight. We didn't \nhave fights on those 27 bills that were signed. The most contentious \none was the pension bill. The pension bill was 980 pages. It covers how \nto save people's pensions, how to make sure when they retire they will \nget what they have been promised, what they deserve, what they want, \nsomething that will give them quality of life in retirement. We made \nthe most significant change in pension law in 30 years.\n  I remember that we had an agreement before we ever brought it to the \nfloor that there would be 1 hour of debate, two amendments, and the \nfinal vote. I went to the Parliamentarian at that time and explained \nwhat we were doing and made sure it was getting written up properly so \nwe could do that the moment we began the debate.\n  I asked: When is the last time that complicated of a bill had that \nkind of an agreement?\n  The words I heard back were: Not in my lifetime.\n  So it is possible to take difficult bills and arrive at agreement \nthat will move the people's business forward.\n  The unfortunate thing for the people of America is that when they are \nwatching us on this floor, what they usually get to see is the 20 \npercent with which we disagree, the 20 percent we are not going to give \nin on, the 20 percent that defines us.\n  I will be urging my side, and I have said it several times, there are \nissues that define us, but every issue is not an issue that defines us. \nWe will probably be trying to figure out a way on every bill to make it \na defining bill. With the amendments we have done on this bill, there \nhas been some defining. But we have an opportunity today--I think it is \ngoing to happen at 12:15 p.m.--to invoke cloture on the package that \nincludes what was asked for by this side and delivered by the other \nside.\n  That is pretty landmark. That is pretty good. We do have the other \nbusiness that needs to get done. It doesn't have to be done on this \nbill. Maybe in the meantime there are some issues we can work on--the \nissues we talked about in some of these amendments--where we can reach \nthat 80 percent agreement and we can move on with those issues.\n  In addressing the minimum wage, we have rejected the notion that it \nwill be a clean bill. Ultimately, we did so because it is not a clean \nissue. By that, I mean neither the real world nor questions of national \neconomics nor social policy are as simple as we would like them to be. \nQuite the contrary. They are complex and they are interrelated. While \npretending that economic or social issues are simple, it often makes \nfor great rhetoric here, and it makes for great politics, but it seldom \nmakes responsible policy. Around here, clean more often than not simply \nmeans ``do it my way'' and does not respect the democratic process and \nallow the Senate to work its will.\n  I am pleased we rejected such false simplicity and chose the course \nof coupling an increased wage with provisions that will assist these \nsmall business employers who will be facing the greatest difficulties \nin paying these increased costs.\n  I hope we do not forget the wisdom of this approach as we address \nother workplace, economic, and social issues.\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\nNone of these are simple and none, no matter how laudable the end, are \nwithout costs or free from the danger of unintended consequences where, \nin an effort to do some good, we wind up causing great harm.\n  I am also heartened that in the course of this debate, this body has \nbegun to recognize what I know from my life to be true. Working \nfamilies are not only those who are employed by businesses, they are \nalso those who own the businesses.\n  I have noted many times that I was a small business owner, that my \nwife and I operated mom-and-pop shoe stores in Wyoming and Montana. My \nstory is not unique, particularly in today's economy. I know all small \nbusiness owners have two families: their own and the families of those \nwho work for them. I also know that business owners feel the pressure \nof rising costs, the dilemma of difficult options, and the \nuncomfortable squeeze of modern life in both of their families as much \nas many workers do on their own.\n  One will find that small business people are more connected to their \nworkers. They work with them shoulder to shoulder on a daily basis. \nThey know what is happening in their lives. I believe we have begun to \nrealize this reality in the way we approach the minimum wage \nlegislation. I do not think we should lose sight of it as it moves \nthrough this Congress.\n  I also note that while I am pleased with the overall approach this \nbody adopted, I am somewhat disappointed that it was not as complete as \nit could have been. In the event cloture is invoked, we would not have \naddressed a range of issues that were offered as early amendments and \nshould have been considered and voted on. In this respect, I mention \nagain those I mentioned late last week: Senator Gregg's amendment on \nemployee option time, something we allow Federal sector employees to \ndo; Senator DeMint's amendment dealing with the same matter, as well as \nSenator Burr's amendment on health insurance costs; and Senator \nVitter's amendment that would have provided measured monetary relief \nfor small businesses that make inadvertent paperwork errors in \nproviding Government-required information--first-time basis, corrected, \nno impact to the employee.\n  All of these were well reasoned, would have provided benefits in \naddition to or in counterbalance to a minimum wage hike, and all were \nentitled to due consideration and a vote in this Chamber. We were not \nallowed to have a vote. Many have charged the majority denied us a vote \non these amendments because they would have been adopted and that would \nhave somehow represented a win for Republicans. Therefore, goes the \ntheory, voting on these amendments was prevented.\n  Whether true or not, the lack of a vote on these amendments does \nnothing to lend credence to the view that Congress's partisanship too \noften trumps positive progress. The reality is good ideas do not simply \nfade away, and that if not here and now, then at some point in this \nCongress these and other good ideas must be given consideration and \nmust be voted on. Fairness demands it, and our responsibility to \nworking families and small businesses requires it.\n  A vote for cloture is a vote for small business and working families. \nIt is a vote for a well-balanced and bipartisan solution. I am pleased \nthat we are at this point. I will ask my colleagues to vote for \ncloture.\n  Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. There is 5 minutes left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, how much time is left on the majority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 minutes 48 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the bill before \nus today because it really does not do anything to help low wage \nworkers in this country in supporting families, buying health care, or \ngiving them the flexibility they need to deal with family issues as \nwell as hold a full-time job. I have consistently opposed a Federal \nwage mandate because I believe it is bad policy that hurts the very \npeople we are trying to help with this bill. Despite that, I have \nsought to engage in constructive debate on this bill and offer \namendments that would make it better. Unfortunately, over the course of \nthis discussion, I have been forced to conclude that this whole debate \nis--let's just say less than honest. What we are talking about here in \nthe Senate is not really about helping low-income workers; this is \nabout mandating a starting wage, not a minimum wage, in a select group \nof States. This is a mandated starting wage because the facts show that \ntwo-thirds of minimum wage workers earn a raise within a year. We also \nknow that most of these are working for restaurants and small \nbusinesses, and most of them are teenagers or young folks working part \ntime.\n  The Democratic proposal before us targets certain States \ndisproportionately while leaving many other States completely or \nrelatively unaffected. If passed, my home State of South Carolina would \nbe subjected to a 41-percent increase in the Federal mandate and the \ninevitable job loss that will come with this. However, States such as \nCalifornia, Vermont, Massachusetts, Oregon, and others would not be \nrequired to raise their minimum wage at all. This is because 28 States \nplus the District of Columbia have passed laws raising their minimum \nwage above the federally mandated $5.15 per hour. Some of those States, \nsuch as the ones I just mentioned, have gone well beyond the $7.25 \nwhich this Federal mandate will implement.\n  If we are to have a minimum wage at all, it is better to have a \nFederalist system of government and individual States could continue to \nset their own minimum wage levels, rather than the Federal Government. \nAfter all, different States have very different economies as well as \nvery different costs of living. We know that a dollar will go a lot \nfurther in San Antonio than in San Francisco, and we need to recognize \nthat. Mr. President, $7.25 in San Francisco is not a bit of help, but \nin another State that is a lot more money.\n  To that effect, I have offered an amendment to the current proposal \nthat would have raised the minimum wage $2.10 in every State across \nthis land. Had my amendment been adopted, this bill would have at least \nbeen more fair in the way it imposed its unfunded mandate. Ironically, \nthe motion to strike my amendment was based on the fact that it was an \nunfunded Federal mandate, which is precisely what the underlying bill \nis at this point.\n  We have tried to add some other provisions. There is some tax relief \nfor small businesses that mostly hire minimum wage workers, but we have \nnot gone nearly far enough.\n  I heard my dear colleague from Massachusetts oppose very vocally any \ntax relief for small businesses that will bear the brunt of an \nincreased minimum wage. I think it is just important to point out what \nwe are trying to do. This is a chart which compares the amount of, what \nsome of us would call porkbarrel spending for what we call the Boston \nBig Dig. The Federal Government's part of bailing this out is $8.5 \nbillion. What we are asking for, for thousands of businesses and \nmillions of low wage workers across this country, is tax relief of less \nthan that, that would help people keep more workers and be more \nprofitable.\n  I understand I am running out of time. I hope this whole debate about \nhelping low wage workers would include those areas which will really \nhelp people who are working full time at $8, $10, $12 an hour and \nhaving a difficult time getting by: If we could make that health care \nmore accessible and more affordable; if we could do for them what we do \nfor Federal Government workers and give them flexibility so if they \nneed an afternoon off to drive on a field trip one day on one week, \nthey can work an extra 4 or 5 hours the next week to make it up, then \nthey call it even--there is no overtime, there is no penalty. \nGovernment workers get it, but we will not give that same benefit to \nworkers all across this country.\n  I am going to vote against cloture on this bill because cloture is \ndesigned to cut off debate. Many of the amendments that would help low \nwage workers are being eliminated. What it comes down to is just an \nunfunded mandate on several States, leaving out others.\n\n[[Page S1311]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 20 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then I believe the leader's time has been reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, just to put this whole issue in some perspective, I \nthought I would just take a minute or two to refresh both this body and \nthose who are interested in this issue about increasing the minimum \nwage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour, about what has happened to workers \nand what has happened, basically, to the middle class over the period \nof the last years.\n  Looking at this chart here, from 1947 to 1973, this is when the \ncountry was moving along together. This shows the different incomes. It \ndivides the incomes of Americans into five different--effectively \nbuckets: the lowest 20 percent, the second 20 percent, the middle 20 \npercent, the fourth 20 percent, and the top.\n  If you look at this for a period of 26 years, you will see that all \nAmerica grew together. The economy worked for all Americans. As a \nmatter of fact, it worked a little bit better for those with the lowest \nincome, but the economy worked for all America. During that period of \ntime, we had Republicans and Democrats alike who voted for the increase \nin the minimum wage as we increased in productivity. America went along \ntogether.\n  What has happened in the last several years, from 2001 to 2004? Here \nwe have the lowest 20 percent. This represents the low-income groups, \nthe minimum wage workers, then the second, third, middle, fourth, and \nthe highest 20 percent is the gray area, and the top 1 percent is \ndemonstrated by the red area. See what has happened to the country, how \nwe have grown further and further apart--the explosion in wealth for \nthe very top and the collapse of the American promise at the very \nlowest; the cutting out of millions of Americans from the hopes and the \ndreams and the idea of a fair and just America.\n  Those are the statistics. Those are the facts. We had a minimum wage \nwhich reflected that progress for 26 years when America grew together. \nWe have now had 10 years of no growth in the minimum wage, and we see \nAmerica growing further apart. We have a chance to do something about \nit this noontime. I am hopeful that we will.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I don't know why it is our friends on the \nother side have really such a contemptuous attitude about low-income \nworking people. They eliminated the overtime program for 6 million \nAmericans last year--6 million Americans who otherwise would have \ngotten an increase in the minimum wage. They eliminated that. When we \nhad the crisis down in New Orleans, one of the first things the \nadministration did was eliminate what they call the Davis-Bacon \nprogram, which is to provide wages that will be pegged to what the \naverage wage is in that particular region, where construction workers \naverage $29,000 a year. What in the world is wrong with someone making \n$29,000 a year so that you want to reduce their pay while they are \nworking for the recovery from Katrina? But oh, no, they eliminated that \nkind of protection. Just as they cut back on the unemployment \ncompensation for workers who were coming out of Katrina, and after the \nNational Academy of Sciences said that with what is happening in the \npoultry business and the meat-cutting business, with computers, we need \nto do something primarily about women in the workplace on the issues of \nergonomics--no way. No way we are going to look out after workers.\n  It is difficult for me to understand. What is it about it? What \nreally gets our Republican friends that they just can't stand hard-\nworking people? We will hear a lot of comments and lectures about, \nlet's make work pay, that work paying is a real value. I hope we don't \nhear that lecture anymore around here from that side. I hope we are not \ngoing to hear anymore talk of values about it. The leaders of the great \nreligions are in strong support. I have put those comments into the \nRecord. They are in strong support of this. They believe it is a moral \nissue, to follow the admonition of Saint Matthew: What you do to the \nleast of these, you do unto me. Talk about poverty. Talk about the \npoor.\n  This is just about a wage, the minimum wage. But it is about a just \nwage. What is it about that?\n  I see my friend from Ohio on the Senate floor. I know he has been \ninterested in and has spoken about the issues of minimum wage and also \nabout what has been happening in the middle class. I am glad to \nentertain any questions he might have or yield for any comment that he \nmight wish to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I \nappreciate especially his discussion about honoring work in this \ncountry. We hear talk of family values. We hear talk of honoring people \nwho work hard and play by the rules. Yet, as the Senator recounted, the \nminimum wage hasn't been increased for 10 years. There has been almost \na hostility to workers in this body and down the hall in the House of \nRepresentatives, where 6 million workers, as Senator Kennedy pointed \nout, have lost their overtime or have had their overtime limited. There \nwere attempts to cut the prevailing wage in Louisiana when the average \nwage of workers in Louisiana in the building trades was only $29,000.\n  When you look at the charts Senator Kennedy pointed out, you see \nthere is an absolute stagnation or decline in wages in the last 5 years \nfor most Americans--for the 80 percent lowest paid Americans, if you \nwill. But the top 20 percent have seen their wages, their salaries, \njust skyrocket. That is coupled with the fact that 1 percent, the \nwealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country possess more of the \nwealth of this country than the 90 percent lowest of the rest of us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that issue?\n  Mr. BROWN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator understands. I have listened to him speak \nvery eloquently in his maiden speech about what has happened in the \nmiddle class of America. The Senator understands that when we saw \nproductivity increase in the 1960s and 1970s, all during this period \nwhen there was economic growth, we all went up together. The rising \ntide raised all the boats across the country. Then look at what \nhappened. Productivity went up, and the real minimum wage went down.\n  Does the Senator not share the belief with me that if workers are \ngoing to work hard and produce--we have the labor force that is the \nhardest working labor force in the industrial world. It works longer, \nharder, and has had the greatest increase in productivity. Does the \nSenator not agree with me that at least some of that increase in \nproductivity should have been passed on to working families?\n  Mr. BROWN. Absolutely. The real strength of our middle-class economy \nover the years, the opportunity through education, through hard work \nthat has built a very prosperous country, really has operated under the \nassumption that if you are more productive, you share in the wealth you \ncreate--whether you are a minimum wage worker, whether you are an \nengineer, whether you are a schoolteacher--whoever you are. You are \nadding to the wealth of your employer, the wealth of our country, \nmaking our country better off. Clearly, when you talk about a higher \nminimum wage, when the minimum wage has declined and wages have \ndeclined overall, these workers are creating wealth for their employer, \nbut simply are not sharing in that wealth. That is why one of the best \nselling books out there now is a book called ``War Against The Middle \nClass.''\n\n  As Senator Kennedy has said, it is clear that as productivity has \ngone up, as workers are working harder than ever before, only a \nrelatively small number of people are sharing in the wealth they create \nor sharing in the productivity gains that have always marked the \nsuccess of our country and of our economy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, can I ask the Senator another question. \nThis good Senator was in the House of Representatives last year when \nthe administration limited overtime pay for six million workers, and \ntens of thousands in my State of Massachusetts--tens of thousands. \nClose to 60,000 or 70,000\n\n[[Page S1312]]\n\nworkers lost overtime pay. Overtime pay--if you are going to work more \nthan 40 hours a week, you should be paid overtime. The administration \neliminated that overtime pay for workers. They cut back on the \nprotections of Davis-Bacon in the gulf and the recovery of the gulf. \nThe workers down there who were unemployed, they ended the unemployment \ncompensation for those workers who were otherwise eligible for it. This \nis unemployment compensation.\n  We want to remind everyone that the workers contribute to the \nunemployment compensation fund. They contribute as workers. If you \ndon't contribute, you don't get unemployment compensation. So these are \nworkers who have contributed to the fund. The fund was in surplus at \nthat time. These are workers who have worked hard and couldn't find the \njobs down there, and the administration cut back on those protections, \ncut back on the ergonomic protections. Even before the Sago mines, we \nfind out they cut back in the mine safety and on safety officials. What \nis it? What is it, if the Senator from Ohio can help me.\n  I know about the great loss of jobs because of the support for tax \nincentives that sent jobs overseas and the failure to try and turn off \nthat spigot. That means something for the middle-class workers. So if \nyou add all of those together--we will find a chance now at 12 \no'clock--if you add all of these together, we find the hostility--I \ncall it hostility, not indifference--but hostility to workers, and I \nhave difficulty understanding that.\n  Maybe the Senator could help me understand what has happened in his \nState that has been so adversely impacted, closing some of those \nprovisions that affected impacted workers in the trade program.\n  Mr. BROWN. Absolutely. One of our friends from the other side of the \naisle said this whole idea of raising the minimum wage is a less than \nhonest effort to help working families. I am nonplussed by that.\n  Senator Kennedy uses the term ``hostility'' toward workers. We are \nseeing more productivity and lower wages, except higher salaries for a \nrelatively small number of people. That is not the American way. It is \nnot the way we were taught in this country to honor work. It is not the \nway we were taught--to work hard and play by the rules.\n  Then, on top of that, we are now building more and more tax systems \nthat give the greatest tax benefits to the wealthiest, that 20 percent \nsqueezed out of that 1 percent who are absolutely doing the best, and \nwe do no significant tax relief for working families, no significant \ntax relief for minimum wage workers. We are not willing to address the \nearned income tax credit, we are not willing to address helping those \nmiddle-class workers who are playing by the rules.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for one more \nquestion, I appreciate him mentioning the earned income tax credit, \nbecause that can make a difference for families of three or more. They \nbenefit with the earned income tax credit more than the minimum wage. \nIf it is only an individual worker, an individual with a single child, \nthey will benefit more with the increase. But the Senator is right, we \nought to be trying to look at these issues in some harmony. But we \ndon't hear any voices on that side to say: OK, Senator, if you want an \nincrease in the minimum wage, we will give an increase in the earned \nincome tax benefit. We will sit down and work something out. We don't \nhear any of that.\n  I want to draw to the attention of the Senator the fact that it has \nbeen 10 years since we have had an increase in the minimum wage, and \nover that period of time we have provided $276 billion in tax breaks \nfor corporations, $36 billion in tax breaks for small businesses. We \nhear around here on the floor: Well, we haven't given the businesses \nenough and we have to put some more tax breaks on here in order to get \nan increase in the minimum wage.\n  Does the Senator buy that argument?\n  Mr. BROWN. No, I don't buy that argument. I came from the House of \nRepresentatives where I was for 14 years. I saw the minimum wage \nincrease basically in 1 day in the House of Representatives a couple of \nweeks ago. We are now on the eighth day of delaying this minimum wage \nvote. The people who oppose this minimum wage don't think minimum wage \nworkers should get a fraction of what we get in this body--the salary \nand benefits; they shouldn't even get a fraction of what we get. They \nare still unwilling to raise the minimum wage, just standing pure and \nsimple.\n\n  The elections last year showed how many voters feel this Government \nhas betrayed the middle class--betrayed them. They wanted to increase \nthe minimum wage straightforwardly. We should have been able to pass on \nan up-or-down vote quickly the minimum wage. We can deal with tax \nissues later as this body always does. This should have been done more \nquickly. But there is, as Senator Kennedy said, that hostility toward \nworkers, whether it is overtime, whether it is Katrina workers, whether \nit is the refusal to raise the earned income tax credit, or whether it \nis their reluctance over 10 years, their digging-in reluctance against \nraising the minimum wage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we are here on \nday seven now of this discussion. We had 16 days where we talked about \nthe minimum wage another time. And this past week, since we started \nthis debate, every Member of Congress has made $3,840 in the last week. \nMr. President, $3,840 is what a minimum wage worker would make in 4 \nmonths--4 months. Three thousand eight hundred dollars, every Member of \nthis Senate.\n  Does the Senator find it somewhat troublesome that we are getting \npaid $3,800 in this past week and we are standing here against an \nincrease in the minimum wage, from $5.15 to $7.25, over a 2-year \nperiod? Does the Senator not share with me this extraordinary \ninequality that is so evident here in this body? Does he find it, as do \nI, highly depressing in terms of the actions of this body--not in terms \nof our will to continue fighting, but I was thinking of appropriate \nwords and I kept rejecting the ones I was thinking about.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, let's look at the kind of work the minimum \nwage workers are doing. They are hotel workers in Cincinnati. They are \nfarm workers in western Ohio. They are people who are working every bit \nas hard, and many would argue much harder, at much more difficult jobs \nin many ways while, as Senator Kennedy said, we have made more in a \nweek than they have made in 2 or 3 months. That is what makes for this \nChamber's inability or unwillingness to pass this minimum wage increase \nmore quickly--rather than continued delay, continued delay, continued \ndelay, rather than having to do these tax breaks for some of their \ncontributors, rather than do a straight up-or-down vote on whether we \nshould increase the minimum wage for these workers who have worked hard \nand played by the rules. Don't they deserve a straight up-or-down vote?\n  Let's pass the minimum wage. Let's give them a chance, to bring up \nthe minimum wage, to make up for the decline in the real value of the \nminimum wage over the last 10 years.\n  Again, as Senator Kennedy has said, 6 times in the last 10 years \nwhile the House and Senate have refused to increase the minimum wage, 6 \ndifferent times, these 2 bodies increased our own pay. That is \nshameful. That is reprehensible, when I hear my friends in this body or \nin Government talk about family values. Let's talk about real family \nvalues. Let's talk about making it possible for families to take care \nof their children, give their children a chance, an opportunity for \neducation, an opportunity to find a decent job in the greatest country \nin the world.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just in that time, Ohio addressed the minimum wage, an \nincrease in the minimum wage. Could the Senator in the last minute or \nso tell us what you found in traveling around, what was on people's \nminds and why they wanted to vote for it?\n  Mr. BROWN. I found overwhelming support for the minimum wage. In \nOhio, 500,000 people got a raise because of what the voters in Ohio did \nin November, with overwhelming support of the minimum wage. Two hundred \nthousand children live in those 500,000 homes. Those are still families \nwho often don't have health insurance, who often have great problems \nfinding daycare for their children when they\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\nare holding their minimum wage jobs. Those are families who are \nstruggling to provide the opportunity for their children to go to \nschool. We know all that. At least one thing we can do here is increase \nthe minimum wage to give those families--not just in Youngstown and in \nRavenna, and not just in Springfield and in Xenia--a real chance to \nraise their children.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I believe our time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 10 minutes \nreserved for the Republican leader at this time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Republican leader has given me his time \nunless he should appear on the floor, and so I will do that.\n  I am a little disturbed about what I have heard here in the last \nseveral speeches this morning. The vote we are about to have is on \nwhether the minimum wage will increase and there will be tax breaks for \nsmall businesses.\n  When we returned for this session of Congress, we had a number of \nbipartisan meetings, and I was pleased we had bipartisan meetings and \ntalked about how we could work together and why we needed to work \ntogether for America. We talked about minimum wage a little bit, and I \neven saw newspaper articles where the majority leader and others on the \nDemocratic side talked about the importance of having tax breaks for \nsmall business to take care of the impact from the increase in the \nminimum wage. I was encouraged by that. I thought: We are having some \nbipartisanship here. We are having some working together. I am \nencouraged.\n  Now, of course, the minimum wage came to the floor and I felt for a \nwhile it was a bait and switch. After Senator Baucus, the Senator from \nMontana, and Senator Grassley, the Senator from Iowa, worked together \nto come up with this tax package and the tax package was introduced as \na substitute to the bill, I said: I think we are making progress. I \nthink this is going to work. I think it can happen. I think we can work \ntogether. I think we can get it done.\n  Then, of course, we had the cloture vote on the straight minimum wage \nand I thought: What is going on here? Was that to get our attention and \nmake us feel good and then rip it away? Rip away the comments that were \nmade about the need to help small business? We don't need class warfare \nin this country.\n  I keep hearing about a book that was mentioned here, ``The War \nAgainst The Middle Class.'' Well, I am trying to figure out how the \nminimum wage worker made it into the middle class. I think we are \ntalking about the small businessmen, who are being scrunched in from \nall angles, who are in the middle class, who are employing the people, \nsometimes at minimum wage, usually at a minimum skills position, and \nthey train them to get better skills, and when they get better skills \nand can do more, they get paid more.\n  I always mention the McDonald's in Cheyenne, WY. A guy there starts \npeople at minimum wage. Now, if they have to be at minimum wage more \nthan about 3 weeks, they are probably not learning the job, probably \nnot showing up on time. But the main point is he has had 3 people who \nstarted at minimum wage who now own 21 McDonald's. So there are \nopportunities out there, but you have to learn and improve to get more \nwages. We can raise the minimum wage and we are going to raise the \nminimum wage. And that will take the bottom step out of the ladder and \npeople will be able to step up one more. Then, as we increase prices to \nhelp pay for that, unless we have the tax breaks, all we did was raise \nprices.\n  I hope we do not get into a class warfare. We do not need hostility \nto workers and between parties. It is 2 years until we have an election \nagain. We do not need to start campaigns right now. We need to solve \nproblems right now.\n  We have said one of the problems is the minimum wage, and we are \ngoing to solve it. They said we debated this six times in the last 10 \nyears. We have. And every time it was brought up, we needed to do some \ndecreases in taxes for the small businesses to take care of the impact \nthis will have. That part got ignored every time. Consequently, raising \nof the minimum wage got ignored each time. Hopefully, we will not \nignore either message and we will do both. The vote we will have this \nmorning will be in regard to that.\n  Now, I will have to take some time after the vote and talk about some \nof the things that were raised because we cannot discuss them in a \nshort period of time. There was talk about overtime taken away. We need \nto have debate on that. There was talk about unemployment. We need to \nhave a little debate on it. When we are talking about safety officials \nat mines being cut back, we need to have a talk about that.\n  Senator Kennedy, I, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Isakson went to \nWest Virginia and looked at the Sago mine and talked to the people \nthere. We talked to the mine officials. We talked to union officials. \nWe talked to the families. We did a bill in 3 months that changed mine \nsafety for the first time in 28 years because we worked together. We \ndid not try to find divisions. We tried to find places we could come \ntogether.\n  Now, safety officials were cut back. They were cut back all over the \nNation. The production of coal went down decidedly. Mines were closed. \nThere were less mines. Of course, then the price of coal came back up \nand the mines opened again, and everything lags with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  There are problems we need to solve, but we do not need to make them \ninto a war. We need to solve the problems that are involved in these \ninstances and keep moving on for America. That is the vote we will take \nlater today: a chance to move on for America. We will raise the minimum \nwage, and we are going to help out the small businesses, those people \nwith all the risk out there who are employing people and training \npeople so that they can continue to hire those people and pay those \npeople so we can have the jobs and the training that the small business \nprovides.\n  I hope that is the track we will go down. I know it will not be \nunanimous on either side, but we can get there if we work together.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The leader has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when we opened the Senate today, we asked \nthat 10 minutes be divided between Senator Kennedy and Senator Reid. I \nyield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And would the Chair let me know when there is 1 minute \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In the last few minutes, let me discuss what this issue \nis about. This issue is about John Hosier from Oklahoma who works at \nthe Salvation Army for $6 an hour. He provides the family's sole \npaycheck. John and his wife Tina and their two children live on barely \n$200 a week. The family receives Government aid in the form of Medicare \nand food stamps but is still living on the verge of poverty. He said:\n\n       It's hard on a small income . . . if it wasn't for the \n     Salvation Army, I don't know where I'd be.\n\n  This is a vote on John Hosier.\n  This is a vote for Elizabeth Lipp of Missouri, a 21-year-old single \nmom. Elizabeth works two jobs, which, prior to a Missouri ballot \ninitiative, paid $5.15. On weekdays Elizabeth worked as a housekeeper, \nand on the weekends she worked as a nurse's aide at a convalescent and \nretirement home. She lives with her mother and says:\n\n       Getting by on $5.15 was a struggle. I pay out $75 a week \n     alone for child care.\n\n  Extra money would help her mother with the bills, help pay off the \ncar, and help her put aside some savings.\n  This is about Peggy Fraley from Wichita, KS, a 60-year-old \ngrandmother. Her daughter, Karla, has five children, ages 6 to 17. \nPeggy works as a receptionist. Karla is a food service worker. Both \nwomen are working $5.15-an-hour jobs. The family is struggling to get \nby. Peggy explains:\n\n       We can barely make it . . . but we've got each other. \n     That's richer sometimes.\n\n  There it is. Those are the people we are fighting for and standing \nwith. Those are the people we believe ought to get an increase from \n$5.15 to $7.25.\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\nYou can call that a paycheck. It is just a paycheck. What Democrats are \nfighting for is a just paycheck.\n  Finally, we have to understand at the end of this debate, these are \nour fellow citizens, our brothers and sisters, citizens in the United \nStates of America. These are men and women of dignity, who take pride \nin the job they do. It is a difficult job, but they still do it. They \ncare about their children, they have hopeful dreams for their children.\n  We are a Nation of many faiths, but all of the faiths talk about, and \nthe Bible teaches the evilness of exploitation of the poor to profit \nthe rich. All faiths say that is wrong. They all say that is wrong.\n  St. Matthew's Gospel says: Whatever you have done unto the least of \nmy brethren, you have done unto me.\n  It is time we reach out to these men and women of dignity, these men \nand women--primarily women--who have children. This is a women's issue, \nit is a children's issue, it is a fairness issue. It is an issue of \nbasic moral fairness. It is a civil rights issue because so many of \nthose men and women are men and women of color. And, most of all, it is \na fairness issue. In the United States of America, the richest country \nin the world, we are saying to those people who work 40 hours a week, \n52 weeks of the year: You shouldn't have to live in poverty. The other \nside says no. The other side says no.\n  We stand for those individuals. It is the right thing to do. It is a \ndefining issue of fairness and decency, and it is an indication of what \nwe as Americans feel about our fellow citizens. I hope we will get a \nstrong vote in favor.\n  Just remember, if there is any question in your mind, in the last \nweek, the last 7 days, Senators have made $3,800. Every Member of this \nSenate has earned that, and Members are going to vote no? Members are \ngoing to vote no to increase the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 over \n2 years? And we have just earned $3,800 in 1 week?\n  Opposing the increase in the minimum wage is wrong. It is wrong. Six \nmonths after an election and 2 years before an election, it is wrong. \nIt is wrong every single day of the year.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished minority manager of this \nbill is easy to get along with. I want the record spread with the fact \nthat he is a gentleman. I wish every Member in this Senate was as easy \nto work with as the Senator from Wyoming.\n  However, I do have some regard for how we have conducted ourselves on \nthis bill in the majority. I have a memory. I know how things have \nhappened in the past. No amendments, few amendments, or, if cloture was \ninvoked on a bill, those amendments that were germane postcloture did \nnot get a vote.\n  That is not how we are doing things. They may not have gotten all the \nvotes they wanted, but it is interesting to note that the Members \noffering the amendments are not going to vote for the bill anyway.\n  We have a procedure. There are amendments germane postcloture, and we \nwill vote on as many of those as we can. I prefer a straight minimum \nwage bill. The people of America deserve this raise after 10 years. \nHowever, the Republicans have said they want these $8 billion in tax \ncuts for business. If that is the only way we can get this bill out of \nhere, I am willing to do that for the 13 million Americans who depend \non minimum wage.\n  How could someone in the minority vote against what they asked for? \nWe gave them what they asked for. They got all the business tax \ndeductions, tax cuts, and then they are going to vote against cloture? \nI don't understand.\n  Raise the minimum wage to $7.25 for 13 million Americans--why can't \nwe do that--and 5.5 million will have wages raised directly, and the \nother 7.5 million who make near the minimum wage will benefit when the \nlowest wages are lifted.\n  As Business Week magazine said a month ago, raising the minimum wage \nlifts the boat for everybody. I don't think Business Week magazine is \nseen as a bastion of liberality.\n  Of the 13 million Americans who stand to get a raise, more than 60 \npercent are women. For the majority of those women, that is the only \nmoney they get for them and their families. Almost 40 percent of the \npeople who draw minimum wage are people of color. Eighty percent of the \npeople who draw minimum wage are adults, many of them senior citizens. \nThey are not all kids at McDonald's flipping hamburgers.\n  Mr. President, $7.25 may not seem like a lot of money in Washington, \nbut it would mean almost $4,500 a year for the Nation's poorest people, \nthe poorest working people in America. Do we want to drive those poor \nworking people into welfare? The answer is, no.\n  Mr. President, $4,500 is a lot of money: 15 months of groceries for a \nfamily of three; 19 months of utilities; 8 months of rent. It helps \nwith childcare and additional things they simply do not have the money \nto splurge on now.\n  After 10 years, it is time to stop talking about this issue and give \nthe working poor of this country a raise after 10 years. I also advise \nmy friends the majority believes this raise in the minimum wage is way \noverdue.\n  Everyone should understand, if cloture is not invoked, we are through \nwith minimum wage. We are going to go to other matters. The first thing \nwe go to is Iraq. We have to start debating Iraq this afternoon. \nEveryone should understand we are not going to come back in a day or \ntwo or 2 or 3 weeks. We have a lot of things to do. We have to allow \nMedicare to negotiate for lower priced drugs for the people who are \nMedicare recipients. We want to do something about stem cell. We want \nto implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations. We want to pass \nappropriations bills. And we want to pass immigration reform this year. \nMinimum wage is dead this year because of the minority. If they do not \nvote for cloture, it is over with.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired. There is still \n2 minutes remaining under the minority's control.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Reid (for \n     Baucus) substitute amendment No. 100 to Calendar No. 5, H.R. \n     2, providing for an increase in the Federal minimum wage.\n         Ted Kennedy, Barbara A. Mikulski, Daniel K. Inouye, Byron \n           L. Dorgan, Jeff Bingaman, Frank R. Lautenberg, Jack \n           Reed, Barbara Boxer, Daniel K.

Schumer, Richard \n           Durbin.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 100, offered by the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, an \namendment in the nature of a substitute, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 87, the nays are \n10. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senate. That was an \nextraordinarily strong vote. It certainly indicates that important \nprogress is going to be made on this issue. I hope the sooner the \nbetter. We do have eight pending amendments that are germane. We are \nhopeful we can consider the DeMint amendment or a vote in relation to \nthat. I understand there is a budget point of order on that that might \nbe made. We look forward to trying to dispose of other amendments \nthrough the course of the afternoon.\n  For the benefit of the Members, we have 30 hours now on this \nparticular proposal. We will have, unless the leaders are able to work \nsomething out tomorrow, another cloture vote on the underlying \nlegislation.\n  We are prepared to move ahead on these amendments. I will talk to my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Enzi, about them. Of the eight pending \namendments, I believe six are under the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee. We will work that out with the members of the Finance \nCommittee and inform the Senate as soon as possible thereon.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the manager, how many days have we been on the \nbill? I know this is legislation to increase the minimum wage. It has \nbeen on the floor for some long while. I understand there is a 30-hour \npostcloture period. I am curious: How long we have been on this bill \nand might we expect, for example, tomorrow to be able to complete \nlegislation that would increase the minimum wage after 10 long years?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. To answer the Senator, this is the seventh day we have \nbeen on the minimum wage legislation. During this debate we have had 16 \ndays where the Senate has addressed an increase in the minimum wage \nwhere we were unable to get a successful outcome. This is a subject \nthat Members can understand quite readily. In one week since we started \nthis, we have all received over $3,800 in pay ourselves, but we haven't \nincreased the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 over a 2-year period. I \nshare the Senator's frustration about progress, the time it has taken \nus to get to this point. I hope our leaders can find a pathway that can \nexpedite the process. Of the remaining issues, one is a DeMint \namendment, which we have already addressed, that is adding the minimum \nwage on to all of the States rather than following the minimum wage \nstandard. The other is a Chambliss amendment that ought to be on an \nimmigration bill that deals with the AgJOBS payment. That is suitable \nfor that rather than being on the minimum wage bill. But we are going \nto deal with these issues and do it in an expeditious way and continue \nto move forward.\n  Minimum wage workers ought to understand, though, that this was an \nimportant vote we have taken. I don't wish to be overly hopeful or \noptimistic, but I think help is on its way.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for one more \nquestion, this vote was encouraging. It gives us an opportunity to take \nanother step. It has been a long and tortured trail because this \nsubject has been discussed not just this year but in the last session \nand the session before that. This has been a long and tortured trail to \nget an increase in the minimum wage after 10 long years. My hope is \nthat this cloture vote will give us an understanding that there is good \nwill on all sides and a desire to move forward and get this completed. \nMy hope is that we can complete this tomorrow. We have a lot of other \nissues Senator Reid and others have suggested we ought to be moving to.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, over the lunch hour, or shortly after that, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts and I will work together to see what we \ncan do on the amendments, to see if they can be voted on as \nexpeditiously as possible. I, too, feel compelled to address the \nquestion of the Senator from North Dakota about the number of days we \ncounted on this. The minority will always count the days on a bill as \nthose days we are allowed to vote. We only voted three out of seven, \nuntil today when we got the second cloture vote. We will insist we get \nvotes on amendments as we proceed through this bill and other bills.\n  I am pleased the Senator from Massachusetts is willing to work with \nus to see what we can do on the outstanding amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator should be advised that there is an \norder to recess. Further debate would require unanimous consent.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order to \nrecess be extended by 2 minutes so I may respond to some of the \nquestions that have been raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me point out that was an important vote \nwe had. It was overwhelming. The Senate voted for cloture 87 to 10. So \nthere is not going to be any prolonged, dilatory action here. \nRepublicans and Democrats want to get this bill to conclusion. People \non both sides of the aisle want to make sure that we don't act on this \nlegislation in such a way that we wind up costing people jobs or \ncosting small business men and women the opportunity to provide jobs.\n  We are making progress. The Finance Committee came out with a \nunanimous, bipartisan package which is now going to be a part of what \nwe do here. We are going to get through this process in a reasonable \nperiod of time.\n  Our leaders, I am sure, are talking about how exactly we can get to \nconclusion and what we will go to next. But we have only had about 3 \ndays, as was pointed out, on which we were actually dealing with \namendments and making progress.\n  There have been 76 amendments filed. There are still 26 pending. We \nhave disposed of 17 amendments. So we are making progress. But the vote \nthat just took place did block some Members who had legitimate \namendments which are relevant, although they are not germane \npostcloture, and there are a few amendments that are germane \npostcloture. So I assume we will get to a conclusion after some of \nthose amendments are considered, and we will complete this legislation \nbefore this week is out and then we can move on to the next issue which \nis of concern to everybody, and that is the Iraq resolution.\n  I wanted the Record to reflect we are making progress and that there \nis not an action out of the ordinary to delay this bill. We have been \nthrough this before, and actually we are going to complete action in \nwhat is probably about a normal period of time for this type of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/30/senate-section/article/S1315-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1315-S1316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are prepared to move ahead on the \namendments. We have some that are in the Finance Committee, some in our \nHELP Committee. We are prepared to move ahead on the Chambliss \namendment. We would hope that the Senator might come to the floor to \ndebate it. We are prepared to proceed. Senator Feinstein is prepared to \nspeak on it. I am prepared to debate it. The Finance Committee is in \nthe process of working with Senator Kyl on some of the other matters. \nIt is 3:15 in the afternoon, and we are prepared to move ahead.\n  As I understand it, Senator DeMint chose not to offer his amendment. \nSo the Chambliss amendment would be the one amendment that is germane \npostcloture. We are prepared to deal with that at this time. We invite \nthe Senator to come and debate the amendment.\n  We heard a great deal about how we want to move ahead, how we want to \ndeal with the amendments. We are prepared to do so. I hope the good \nSenator will choose to come to the floor so we could continue to \nproceed with this legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise today to talk about a subject \nthat involves common decency and economic fairness--raising the minimum \nwage. In my State of Montana, thousands of workers struggle just to \nmake ends meet with less than the State's current minimum standard. \nTwelve counties in Montana have 9 percent of their workforce making \nless than the State's current minimum wage standard. That makes it \nvirtually impossible for those folks to try to obtain the middle class.\n  Raising the minimum wage is the first step to empowering the middle \nclass, to making the middle class all it can be. We have talked about \nand for the last 6, 7 days we have heard about how important it is to \nraise the minimum wage. Let me tell my colleagues, if we are going to \nmake this country all it can be, we need to show some attention to the \nmiddle class. This raising of the minimum wage, make no mistake about \nit, is the first step to empowering the middle class to make it vibrant \nonce again. There are many things that can be done and I hope will be \ndone when this 110th Congress goes forward. We are doing the right \nthing.\n  The fact is, people deserve a fair wage for the work they do. The \ncurrent minimum wage at $5.15 an hour translates into less than $11,000 \nper year. One can't pay the bills with that kind of income.\n  I can tell my colleagues that as I drove around the State of Montana \nover the last year and a half, one of the fellows who made one of the \nbiggest impressions on me was at a truck stop, when he asked me what I \nwas going to do for average workers in the State of Montana. I said: \nWhat do you have in mind? He said: Currently, I work three jobs, and I \nstill have difficulty making ends meet. What kind of quality of life \ncan a person have working three jobs, struggling every day just to pay \nbasic bills like heating, lights, and insurance?\n  The fact is that around this country, many States have passed minimum \nwage laws that have increased the minimum wage. Unfortunately, the \nleadership has not come from Washington, DC, on this issue; it has come \nfrom the States. And I think it is high time that this Congress--and it \nis unfortunate it hasn't happened before, but it is high time and it is \nwelcomed that this Congress would step to the plate to increase the \nminimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour. It is the right thing to do, \nand it is a good first step. I will applaud the Senators if we, in \nfact, get this job done, which I think is entirely appropriate, to \nincrease the minimum wage.\n  My State of Montana is one of six States that passed initiatives last \nNovember raising the minimum wage to a wage higher than the Federal \nstandard. It passed with 73 percent of Montana's voters favoring this \nminimum wage increase. It is now at $6.50 an hour, indexed for \ninflation with no tip credit, meal credit, or training wage. This means \nemployers may not count tips or benefits as part of the employee's wage \nfor minimum wage purposes. This is a significant step forward for our \nworkforce, and I hope the Federal Government will follow suit with \npassing this bill to make the economic struggles of almost 15 million \nAmericans, including 7.3 million children, a little easier.\n  Raising the minimum wage is long overdue. It is about time, and it is \nabout time we showed an appreciation for America's workforce.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I thank the \nSenator from Montana for his statement in support of the minimum wage. \nHe comes from a very special part of this Nation, the northern part of \nthe Rockies. It has great agriculture and farmlands. It has a number of \ncommunities--Butte, MT--where there is mining and a number of smaller \ncommunities where people have worked in manufacturing.\n  I thank the Senator for his statement and for his support. He has \nbeen on the floor a good deal of the time during the course of this \ndebate, and having been just elected he brings to the Senate that fresh \nperspective of what people are thinking about in the heartland of the \nNation. His comments bring additional strength to the argument in \nsupport of the increase. I express my appreciation to him for his good \ncomments and statement in support of an increase. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMontana is no different from any other State in this Union. We have a \nlot of hard-working folks who work for every penny they get. Quite \nfrankly, sometimes they feel pretty unappreciated. It wasn't many years \nago that we talked about American-made products and how proud we were \nof them and how proud we were of the workers who made those American-\nmade products. We need to get back on that road once again.\n  I will say, as I said a few minutes earlier, this is long overdue and \nis something on which I wish the Federal Government would have taken \nthe lead. But better late than never.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 118 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I have amendment No. 118 which is \nunder consideration. After consultation with the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I am going to withdraw that amendment, but as I withdraw \nit, I want to say, as we move into the immigration debate, which we \nwill do on the floor of the Senate hopefully sooner rather than later, \nthis amendment will come up again. The importance of this amendment \ncannot be overstated. There are farmers and ranchers all across America \nwho use a legal workforce versus an illegal workforce.\n\n  Between now and the time this debate comes up on immigration, I am \nafraid that by not moving ahead with the adoption of this amendment, we \nare going to encourage farmers and ranchers in the use of illegal \nimmigrants. But the fact is, we have been debating this minimum wage \nbill now for 2 weeks or more. It is time to conclude it. This amendment \nhas stirred up some controversy--for the right reasons, because we do \nneed to talk about the amount of money we pay to our workforce in the \nagricultural sector. But I do appreciate the Senator from \nMassachusetts, in his conversations and his commitment to me, that as \nwe move into the immigration debate we will talk about this once again, \nas we did last year.\n  Madam President, at this time I withdraw that amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n\n[[Page S1317]]\n\n  This is not a new issue. I know my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia is going to speak to the substance of it. The Senator from \nGeorgia raised this during the last debate on the immigration bill. He \nhas spoken about it a number of times earlier in the debate. These are \ncomplicated questions and issues that have enormous impact, these wage \nrate issues, in terms of agriculture across this country. He speaks for \nhis State on this issue.\n  I am grateful he is going to withdraw this amendment at this time. I \nam very hopeful we are going to get to the immigration issue in a \ntimely way. We have it as a high priority on our side to address it. We \nare very hopeful we are going to get to it in March, this year, and we \nwill have an opportunity both in the committee and on the floor to come \nto grips with the substance of this issue.\n  I say, finally, the adverse wage goes back some 43 or 44 years. It \ngoes back to a time when it was implemented and we had what they call \nthe bracero program, which was a dark side of exploitation of workers \nfrom Mexico. It has been in effect, but the Senator is asking now that \nwe get another look at this issue.\n  I know the Senator from California will speak on the substance of it. \nThis wage rate has been frozen at a level for the last few years as \npart of another bill, the AgJOBS bill. But this is an immigration-\nrelated issue because we are talking about workers who are going to \ncome from overseas. The Senator has spoken about it. I know he feels \nstrongly about it. We know we are going to consider it in the course of \nthat discussion and debate. But I appreciate the fact that he is not \npressing it on this minimum wage bill. I thank him for it, and we look \nforward to trying to find a solution to it in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I listened carefully to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, and I very much agree with his remarks. I also \nthank the Senator from Georgia for withdrawing this amendment.\n  This amendment muddies churning waters even more. I think it would be \nvery difficult if put in at this time. The way to go about this is \nthrough something called the AgJOBS bill. I have seen the Senator from \nIdaho on the floor. The Senator from Idaho, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and myself have all played a role in the AgJOBS bill.\n  If I understand what the Senator from Georgia was trying to do, it \nwas to substantially change the H-2A program, which is the temporary \nagricultural worker program. That is a visa program, codified under \nsection 218 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Under current \nlaw, employers of H-2A guest workers must pay the State minimum wage, \nthe Federal minimum wage, the State's adverse effect wage rate--which \nis the market rate or the local prevailing wage, whichever is highest.\n  The Chambliss amendment would have required that H-2A employers pay \nthe greater of either the Federal minimum wage or a newly defined \nprevailing wage.\n  My staff called both departments mentioned on line 6 at page 2 of his \namendment--that is the Occupational Employment Statistics Program and \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics--neither of which had a prevailing rate \nthey could certify.\n  This amendment, if promulgated, would have presented serious problems \nfor our agricultural workers. For example, in my home State, the \nadverse effect wage rate is $9. This rate is higher than the Federal \nminimum wage. Because we do not know what the prevailing wage would \nmean in the Chambliss amendment, it would most likely result in a major \ncut of wages for agricultural workers.\n  Now, in AgJOBS, we have negotiated a 3 year freeze of the adverse \nwage rate so that a study could take place. It would give us a period \nof time to work this issue out. I think to do this as an amendment, \nwithout negotiation, without a real hearing, is a tremendous mistake. \nSo I am very pleased the Senator chose to withdraw his amendment. I \nwould have spoken as strongly as I possibly could against it had he not \nwithdrawn it. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me join with my colleagues on this \nissue in thanking the Senator from Georgia for withdrawing the \namendment. It is possible to say that the concept of adverse wage is an \nanomaly unto itself, specific to the H-2A program. That is not to \nsuggest it is right. It is to suggest that it was there and it \nratcheted up on an automatic basis to establish the wage base for H-2A \nworkers in the guest worker program.\n  The Senator from California is right. As we began to negotiate and \ncreate what is now known as AgJOBS, which she and I reintroduced \nearlier this year, in that was a back-off from the adverse wage and a \nholding of the line for a period of time to level out. What the Senator \nfrom Georgia is attempting to do is establish a new wage rate. I think \nthe Senator from California is right; we are not sure where it would go \nor what it would mean.\n  I am going to stand here and say that is not to suggest a new wage \nrate is not the right way to go, to establish equity between H-2A and \nnon-H-2A workers who are doing the same job in the field, or somewhere \nelse in agriculture. But there ought to be a consistency. If we are \ngoing to bring large groups of guest workers in--and we will, we always \nhave; there are certain types of work only they will do--then I think \nwe have to be sensitive to the uniqueness of that situation.\n  But at the same time, it is important that we are sensitive to all of \nthe other requirements we put upon the employer as a part of the total \nemployment package. Is it housing? Certain other conditions along with \nthe wage that they necessarily would not have to pay to a domestic \nworker who was doing comparable wage but was outside the H-2A program?\n  There is a disparity today. That is why we backed it off in the \nnegotiations. H-2A workers, by their definition, were becoming \nnoncompetitive. Of course, in the environment in which we were working, \nthey were becoming noncompetitive to the illegal who was in the market. \nSo you have disparity across the board. I don't dispute what the \nSenator from Georgia is attempting to do. I visited with some labor \nattorneys who found it very problematic. If you are going to do this, \nwe ought to work collectively, review it appropriately, apply it \nagainst a variety of workforces to see that it is uniform and just for \nall employees and employers who may, because of their uniqueness, \nprovide certain conditions for the worker that otherwise would not be \nnecessary to provide.\n  I used to be in agriculture. We paid a certain wage. We provided a \nhouse and we provided fuel for the rig. We also provided certain \ngrocery and food supplies. That was all viewed as a factor of \nemployment with the employee. There are a variety of things we have to \nget correct. The Senator from California said it would have muddied the \nwater a great deal. I think it would have frustrated it. I think it \nwould have taken out part of the force that it is valuable that we keep \ntogether as we try to reform the H-2A program, deal with the problem we \ncurrently have to secure and stabilize a legal, transparent workforce \nfor American agriculture, treat foreign nationals right who come here \nlegally for the purpose of that kind of employment.\n  I don't know that this would have accomplished it. Withdrawing it, \ncoming together with us, trying to resolve this problem I think offers \nus an opportunity to get our work done on this portion of immigration \nreform this year. I hope and I know the Senator from California agrees \nwith me. I hope we can accomplish that by the end of the year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, Madam President, I would make a statement \nand then ask the Senator from Idaho a question. This morning I was \nvisited by a delegation from Tulare County, which is an agricultural \ncounty in the central valley of California. These were city and county \nofficials who pointed out the enormous loss from the frost and the fact \nthat it looks as though the citrus loss is going to be at least $800 \nmillion and the total loss will be over $1 billion. Nobody knows the \ntree loss yet, let alone the avocado or nursery plant loss or the row \ncrop loss of strawberries and lettuce and other crops. But this will \nalso have an impact on\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\nthe ability to find agricultural labor, and I think the Senator agrees, \nI know I agree, that we must pass the AgJOBS bill.\n  Madam President, an estimated 90 percent of agricultural labor in \nthis country--the picker part of it, not necessarily the processing and \ncanning part of it, but the picking part, the field work--an estimated \n90 percent is by undocumented people. What we have tried to do is \ndevelop a plan, which actually passed the Senate once before as part of \nthe comprehensive immigration bill, called AgJOBS. This also reformed \nthe H-2A program.\n  We have been trying to get that bill up before this body for a vote. \nThis next year is going to be a singularly difficult year for \nagriculture, and with the inability to get a consistent workforce, \nfarmers don't know if they can plant, they don't know if they can \nprune, they don't know if they can pick, because they don't know if \nthey will have enough labor.\n  My question to the Senator from Idaho through the Chair is, Do you \nagree with the statement I made?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I agree totally and I agree for all the reasons the \nSenator from California put forward--and a couple more. One of the \nthings the Congress is committed to--both the Senators on the floor at \nthis moment have voted for it--is to secure our Southwest border. We \nare investing heavily on that at this moment, and we should be. There \nis no question about that. We may argue about how many miles of fence, \nbut we all recognize an unsecured border is a very problematic thing. \nIt is closing. It is becoming secure and we are going to continue to \ninvest in it. As we are doing that, all of these other problems are \nbeginning to happen because that workforce is moving around and they \nare not staying with agriculture. The Senator lost a tremendous amount \nthis year in the San Joaquin, in the greater agricultural area of \nCalifornia.\n\n  I spoke with young farmers and ranchers of the Idaho Farm Bureau this \nweekend. We have lost hundreds of millions--nowhere near what the \nSenator from California has lost, but we have a different kind of \nagriculture. The intensity of ours, the hand labor of ours is simply \nnot as great as the Senator's. But there is a real problem and that \nproblem is quite simple. If we don't get this corrected, we may well be \nlooking at $5 billion worth of agricultural loss this year, and half of \nthat or more will come from California alone, let alone all the other \nareas, and I may even be conservative in my guesstimate.\n  So the Senator is absolutely right. Now we are coupled with the \nnatural weather disasters that have hit California and could hit my \nState at some time in the future. That is typical of agriculture. But, \nif we provide a stable and secure workforce that is legal, then we have \nhelped our agriculture a great deal in knowing that when they do \nproduce a crop, they have the people there to help them get it out of \nthe field, get it to the processor and ultimately to the retail shelves \nof America.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho. My \nplea, and I know the Senator joins with me, is that the people of \nAmerica will weigh in and say: Get this bill passed; that agricultural \nlabor will weigh in, corn and citrus, potatoes, apples, wherever it is \nin the United States, wherever they need a consistent, legal workforce, \nwill please weigh in and say to this body: Get that bill up and get it \npassed, and will say to the other body: Get that bill up and get it \npassed. Senator Craig and I have been coming to the floor from time to \ntime to plead to give us time. I believe the majority leader will give \nus time--I am uncertain as to when, but I believe it is going to \nhappen. My hope is that it happens sooner rather than later because the \npredictability is so important. Here we are, we are at the end of \nJanuary, we are going into February. People are getting their loans to \nplant and that kind of thing, and they need to know they can deliver a \ncrop. They need to know they can get the workforce to deliver that \ncrop. So this is a huge issue economically for America and for the \nagricultural industry.\n  So I wish to say to the Senator from Idaho and to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I thank them so much for their work on this issue. I \nwish that the Senator from Georgia would be with us on AgJOBS, because \nI believe it is the right way to go, and I believe his State--Georgia--\nwill also be benefited by the H-2A reforms in the bill. For California, \nthe H-2A reforms mean that this program, which hasn't been used by \nagriculture because it was so cumbersome, will now be used by \nagriculture. It, in effect, is the guest worker program. So passing \nAgJOBS secures a legal guest worker program for agriculture and also a \npath to legalization for those who have engaged in agricultural labor \nwho will pay a fine, who will pay their taxes, who will commit to work \nin agricultural labor for another 3 years, thereby providing that \nconsistent workforce.\n  So I very much hope that the day will not be far distant when the \nSenator from Idaho and I will be on the floor and will, hopefully, be \nable to mount a substantial vote for this important bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Madam President, I come to the floor today to support a \nlong overdue raise for America's lowest paid workers from $5.15 an hour \nto $7.25 an hour.\n  As you know, more than 6 million hourly workers currently earn less \nthan $7.25 an hour. They work hard, they pay taxes, they try to raise \nstrong families. For a few them, it is a first job, they are young, and \nthey do not have to support anyone else. But 80 percent of them are \nadults, and about half of them are their household's primary \nbreadwinner. Forty-seven percent of them are poor, and many have to \nwork two or three jobs just to make ends meet.\n  Work should keep Americans out of poverty. It should make it possible \nfor you to live with dignity and respect, to have a comfortable place \nto live in a safe neighborhood, to see a doctor, to have a shot at \neducation, to save a little money, to enjoy the opportunities of this \ngreat country. But that's out of reach for most people at $5.15 and \nhour. It is time that we do better by those in our workforce who make \nthe least.\n  The Federal minimum wage is at its lowest inflation-adjusted level \nsince 1955, and it has been stagnant for almost a decade. That does not \nreflect well on our country and Americans are overwhelmingly supportive \nof an increase. In fact 29 States and countless cities have taken \naction and set higher minimums of their own. It is time for the Federal \nGovernment to do the same. And I know we can achieve that in a \nbipartisan way.\n  We have had a vigorous debate about the impact of the minimum wage on \nemployment levels and on small businesses. And I agree that all policy \ndecisions must be made with full consideration of possible unintended \nconsequences. But the evidence clearly indicates that raising the \nminimum wage is good for workers and that the effects on small \nbusinesses are negligible.\n  Following the most recent increase in the Federal minimum wage in \n1997, the low-wage labor market actually performed better than it had \nin decades, with lower unemployment rates, higher average hourly wages, \nhigher family income and lower rates of poverty. And most studies of \nState minimum wage increases have found no measurable negative impact \non employment.\n  A group of 650 economists, including several Nobel laureates, \nrecently issued a statement, saying: ``We believe that a modest \nincrease in the minimum wage would improve the well-being of low-wage \nworkers and would not have the adverse effects that critics have \nclaimed.''\n  They further note:\n\n       While controversy about the precise employment effects of \n     the minimum wage continues, research has shown that most of \n     the beneficiaries are adults, most are female, and the vast \n     majority are members of low-income working families.\n\n  But raising the minimum wage is not just good economics, it is also a \nstatement of our commitment to each other as Americans. I am convinced \nthat most Americans agree that the person who serves your food or \nhandles your checkout at the grocery store deserves to be paid a decent \nwage. Most people agree that parents working full time--no matter what \ntheir job or occupation--should not have to raise their children in \npoverty.\n  In fact, I think that most Americans worry, as I do, that even $7.25 \nan hour\n\n[[Page S1319]]\n\nis not enough in many parts of the country where a living wage that \nwould cover housing, schooling and healthcare needs might have to be \ntwice as high or more.\n  But the increase to $7.25 would restore the value of the minimum wage \nthat inflation has eroded since the last increase nearly a decade ago. \nIt would mean an additional $4,200 in annual earnings for a full-time, \nminimum wage worker. It would trigger additional increases in the \nearned-income tax credit for low-income parents.\n  Today, a family of four with one minimum-wage earner lives in \npoverty. With the increase in the minimum wage, that family would be \nlifted 5 percent above the poverty line instead of being 11 percent \nbelow the poverty line in 2009, as it would be under current law.\n  The minimum wage cannot be the end of our commitment to help working \nfamilies. But it is an important place to start.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I voted in opposition to the Gregg \namendment, No. 101, which he said would establish a legislative line-\nitem veto.\n  However, the Gregg amendment is not a line-item veto at all. It is an \nenhanced rescission proposal that would give the President \nunprecedented powers to wait for up to 1 full year before unilaterally \ndeciding to rescind areas of spending that Congress has previously \ndetermined are in the public interest.\n  That is not what I call a line-item veto.\n  A line-item veto would give the President short term authority when \nhe is signing legislation to extract certain portions of that \nlegislation. But to suggest the President should have the power to \ndecide, up to 1 year after the appropriations process has been \ncompleted, that he wishes to withhold certain areas of expenditures is \none of the most unusual transfers of power from the legislative branch \nto the President that I have ever seen proposed.\n  The power of the purse belongs to the legislative branch, and I am \nwilling to work with the legislative branch and the White House to try \nto find a way to reduce inappropriate Federal spending. But I am not \nwilling to give the President the authority that would allow him to use \na fast track process or enhanced recission authority to undermine \nSocial Security or take any number of other actions that would give a \nPresident virtually unlimited powers of the purse.\n  That is not the way the Constitution intended the separation of \npowers to work and I could not support the overreaching amendment \noffered by Senator Gregg.\n\n\n                           order of procedure\n\n  Madam President, if I may, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:10 p.m., \nthe Senate proceed to executive session to consider en bloc Executive \nCalendar nominations 6 and 7; that there be 10 minutes for debate \nequally divided between Senators Leahy and Specter or their designees; \nand that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed \nto vote on the nomination of Lisa Godbey Wood to be United States \nDistrict Judge, to be followed immediately by a vote on the nomination \nof Philip S. Gutierrez to be a United States District Judge; that \nmotions to reconsider be laid on the table, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return \nto legislative business; that all time consumed in executive session \ncount postcloture; and that there be 2 minutes between each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Lisa Godbey Wood\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, one of these judges, Philip \nGutierrez, is for the central district of California. Vice Judge Terry \nHatter, who at one point was the chief judge, a very good chief judge, \nhas retired. Mr. Gutierrez is one of two judicial emergencies we need \nto fill. His nomination went through the special commission that we \nhave, which is Republicans and Democrats who screen these judicial \nnominations. He has served on the Los Angeles County Superior Court. He \nalso served on the municipal court. He is a Los Angeles native. He \ngraduated from Notre Dame and UCLA Law School. I strongly support his \nnomination.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   nomination of philip s. gutierrez\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, in a few moments the Senate will be \nconsidering the vote on the confirmation of Lisa Godbey Wood as a judge \nin the State of Georgia. First of all, I wish to thank the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for all the commitments he made \nlast year as ranking member and that he has followed through on this \nyear as chairman to bring this judge's confirmation to the full Senate \nfor a vote. Senator Leahy has been a gentleman. He has been diligent. \nHe has lived up to every responsibility he accepted. I, personally, \nalong with Senator Chambliss, am very grateful for the opportunity to \nconfirm this outstanding jurist.\n  I also wish to say that Lisa Godbey Wood brings to the bench for the \nFederal courts of the United States of America the integrity, the \nintellect, the sense, and the judgment that all of us seek in a fine \njudge. I am pleased to stand before the Senate today to commend her to \neach and every Member of the Senate, and my sincerest hope is that her \nconfirmation will be a unanimous vote.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/30/senate-section/article/S1319-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1319-S1321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n LISA GODBEY WOOD TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN \n                          DISTRICT OF GEORGIA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nPHILIP S.

Gutierrez, of California, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the Central District of California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate is considering the first \njudicial nominations of the year. If these nominees are confirmed, it \nwill be the 101st and 102nd while I have served as Judiciary Committee \nChairman under this President. If confirmed, these nominees will bring \nthe total number of President Bush's nominees confirmed during his \ntenure to 260.\n  Last Thursday, the Judiciary Committee held its first business \nmeeting of the year. We were delayed a few weeks by the failure of the \nSenate to pass organizing resolutions on January 4, when this session \nfirst began. The Republican caucus had meetings over several days after \nwe were in session before finally agreeing on January 12 to S. Res. 27 \nand S. Res. 28, the resolutions assigning Members to Senate committees.\n  The Judiciary Committee has traditionally met on Thursday. \nRegrettably, the delay in Senate organization meant that I could not \nnotice or convene a meeting of the Committee the morning of January 11, \nas I had hoped. We devoted the intervening Thursday to our oversight \nhearing with the Attorney\n\n[[Page S1320]]\n\nGeneral. January 18 was the date the Attorney General selected as most \nconvenient for him, and we accommodated him in that.\n  Accordingly, it was last Thursday that we were first able to meet. At \nour first meeting, I included on our agenda the nominations of five men \nand women to lifetime appointments as federal judges. Three were for \nvacancies that have been designated judicial emergencies by the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. Before proceeding, I inquired of \neach Member of the Committee whether a hearing was requested on these \nnominations this year. They were each nominees we had considered in the \nCommittee last year. They were returned to the President without Senate \naction when Republican Senators objected to proceeding with certain \nnominees in September and December last year. Last week I thanked the \nMembers of the Judiciary Committee for working with me to expedite \nconsideration of these nominations this year. In particular, I extend \nthanks to our new Members, the Senators from Maryland and Rhode Island.\n  All five nominations were not sent to the Senate until January 9. We \nhave moved promptly to vote to report them on January 25 and now begin \nthe process of final Senate consideration. I know from last year that \nSenators Chambliss and Isakson are strong supporters of Ms. Wood's \nnomination to fill the emergency vacancy in Georgia. I appreciate that \nthey have both worked with me and am delighted that hers is the first \nnomination to be considered by the Senate this year.\n  The second nomination we will consider is that of Philip S. \nGutierrez, another nominee to a seat deemed to be a judicial emergency. \nHe has been nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California after a distinguished career in private practice \nand as a Los Angeles County Superior and Municipal Court judge. While \non the Superior Court, Judge Gutierrez served as a founding member of \nthe Judicial Ethics Committee, which developed a curriculum for ethics \ntraining for every California judicial officer, and devoted significant \ntime to improving the court system statewide. Judge Gutierrez, a Los \nAngeles native, is a graduate of the University of Notre Dame and UCLA \nLaw School.\n  This new Congress presents an opportunity for a fresh start on \njudicial nominations, one that emphasizes qualifications and bipartisan \nconsensus over political game-playing by the other side. President Bush \nmade the right decision in not resubmitting this year several \ncontroversial and troublesome nominees who failed to win confirmation \nfrom a Republican-controlled Senate. Of course it is unfortunate that \nwe lost many months of valuable time on those failed nominations. We \nspent far too much time engaged in political fights over a handful of \nnominees in the last Congress, time the Senate could have spent making \nprogress on filling vacancies with qualified consensus nominees.\n  I do wish the President had gone further and renominated three \nnominees for vacancies in the Western District of Michigan who were \nreported out of Committee, but left pending on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar when some on the other side of aisle blocked the nomination of \nJudge Janet Neff for one of those seats. All three nominations were for \nvacancies that are judicial emergency vacancies--three in one federal \ndistrict. The Senators from Michigan had worked with the White House on \nthe President's nomination of three nominees to fill those emergency \nvacancies. The Judiciary Committee proceeded unanimously on all three. \nWorking with then-Chairman Specter, the Democratic Members of the \nCommittee cooperated to expedite their consideration. On September 16, \nwe held a confirmation hearing for those three nominees on an expedited \nbasis and reported them out of Committee on September 29.\n  Regrettably, rather than meet to work out a process to conclude the \nconsideration of judicial nominations last session, the Republican \nleadership apparently made the unilateral decision to stall certain of \nthese nominations, including those for the judicial emergencies in the \nWestern District of Michigan and, in particular, the President's \nnomination of Judge Janet Neff. After the last working session in \nOctober, I learned that several Republicans were objecting to Senate \nvotes on some of President Bush's judicial nominees. According to press \naccounts, Senator Brownback had placed a hold on Judge Neff's \nnomination, even though he raised no objection to her nomination when \nshe was unanimously reported out of Judiciary Committee. Later, without \ngoing through the Committee, Senator Brownback sent questions to Judge \nNeff about her attendance at a commitment ceremony held by some family \nfriends several years ago in Massachusetts. Senator Brownback spoke of \nthese matters and his concerns on one of the Sunday morning talk shows.\n  I wondered at the end of the last Congress whether it could really be \nthat Judge Neff's attendance at a commitment ceremony of a family \nfriend failed some Republican litmus test of ideological purity, that \nher lifetime of achievement and qualifications were to be ignored, and \nthat her nomination was to be pocket filibustered by Republicans.\n  I do not know why the President has not chosen to renominate Judge \nNeff or the other two Western District nominees. But the approach to \nnominations we saw in the last Congress, of using nominations to score \npolitical points rather than filling vacancies and administering \njustice, has led to a dire situation in the Western District of \nMichigan. Judge Robert Holmes Bell, Chief Judge of the Western \nDistrict, wrote to me and to others about the situation in that \ndistrict, where several judges on senior status--one over 90 years \nold--continue to carry heavy caseloads to ensure that justice is \nadministered in that district. Judge Bell is the only active judge. If \nnot for Republican objections, these nominations would be filled by \nnow.\n  I urge the President to fill these and other outstanding vacancies \nwith consensus nominees. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \nlist 59 judicial vacancies, 28 of which have been deemed to be judicial \nemergencies. So far in this Congress, the President has sent us 30 \njudicial nominations. There remain 17 judicial emergency vacancies--\n17--now without any nominee at all.\n  We continue to make progress today towards filling longstanding \njudicial vacancies. If the President consults with us and works with us \nto send consensus selections instead of controversial nominations for \nimportant lifetime appointments, we can make good progress filling \nvacancies.\n  The American people expect the federal courts to be fair forums where \njustice is dispensed without favor to the right or the left. I intend \nto do all that I can to ensure that the federal judiciary remains \nindependent and able to provide justice to all Americans. These are the \nonly lifetime appointments in our entire government, and they matter. I \nwill also continue in the 110th Congress to work with Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle, as I have with Senators Chambliss and Isakson \nas well as Senators Feinstein and Boxer. I congratulate Ms. Woods and \nJudge Gutierrez on their confirmations today.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Lisa Godbey Wood, of Georgia, to be U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Southern District of Georgia? The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Gutierrez\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Gutierrez nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Philip S. Gutierrez is the second \nnomination we consider today to a seat deemed to be a judicial \nemergency. We considered his nomination in the Judiciary Committee late \nlast week and the two Senators from California have urged we move this \nnomination without further delay. I am pleased that we are able to do \nso today. As I said earlier before the vote to confirm Lisa Godbey Wood \nto fill an emergency vacancy in Georgia, Judge Gutierrez's nomination \nwill be the 102nd to be confirmed while I have served as Judiciary \nCommittee chairman and the 260th nominee of President Bush to be \nconfirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the majority leader and \nChairman Leahy for bringing up the nomination of Philip Gutierrez. He \nhas an outstanding academic record. His bachelor's degree is from the \nUniversity of Notre Dame. He has a law degree from UCLA. He has been \nrated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association.\n  Judge Gutierrez was nominated during the last Congress and his \nnomination reported out of the Judiciary Committee with a favorable \nrecommendation on September 21, 2006. The Senate, however, did not act \non his nomination prior to adjournment of the 109th Congress.\n  President Bush renominated Judge Gutierrez in the 110th Congress and \nhis nomination reported out of the Judiciary Committee on January 25, \n2006.\n  Judge Gutierrez received his BA degree from the University of Notre \nDame in 1981 and a JD from the UCLA School of Law in 1984.\n  Judge Gutierrez's substantial experience both in private practice and \non the California Superior Court have prepared him to serve on the \nFederal bench.\n  He began his legal career as an associate with the Los Angeles firm \nWolf, Pocrass & Reyes from 1984 to 1986 and then worked as an associate \nwith Kern & Wooley from 1986 to 1988. At both firms, Judge Gutierrez \nworked on civil tort liability litigation.\n  In 1988, Judge Gutierrez joined the law firm of Cotkin & Collins in \nSanta Ana as managing partner. At Cotkin, he focused his practice on \nbusiness litigation with an emphasis in professional liability and \ninsurance coverage.\n  In 1997, Judge Gutierrez was appointed to serve on the Whittier \nMunicipal Court where he presided over misdemeanors, felony \narraignments, and civil matters.\n  In 2000, he was elevated to the Los Angeles County Superior Court \nwhere he currently sits in the Pomona division. He presides over a \nrange of significant civil and criminal matters, including felony \ncases.\n  Active in judicial governance and education, Judge Gutierrez \ncurrently serves on the Los Angeles County Superior Court Executive \nCommittee and the California Judges Association's Committee on Judicial \nEthics, of which he is a former chair.\n  He serves on several committees of the California Center for Judicial \nEducation and Research.\n  The American Bar Association has rated Judge Gutierrez unanimously \n``well qualified.''\n  Madam President, I know the Members on the Senate floor would like to \nhave a detailed description of his resume, but they will have to read \nit in the Congressional Record.

Mr. President, today in Iraq we sadly find ourselves at \nthe very point I feared when I opposed giving the President the open-\nended authority to wage this war in 2002, an occupation of undetermined \nlength and undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences in the \nmidst of a country torn by civil war.\n  The American people have waited. The American people have been \npatient. We have given chance after chance for a resolution that has \nnot come and, more importantly, watched with horror and grief at the \ntragic loss of thousands of brave young American soldiers.\n  The time for waiting in Iraq is over. The days of our open-ended \ncommitment must come to a close. The need to bring this war to an end \nis here.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Iraq War De-escalation Act of \n2007. This plan would not only place a cap on the number of troops in \nIraq and stop the escalation; more importantly, it would begin a phased \nredeployment of United States forces with the goal of removing all \nUnited States combat forces from Iraq by March 31, 2008, consistent \nwith the expectations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group that the \nPresident has so assiduously ignored.\n  The redeployment of troops to the United States, Afghanistan, and \nelsewhere in the region would begin no later than May 1 of this year, \ntoward the end of the timeframe I first proposed in a speech more than \n2 months ago.\n  In a civil war where no military solution exists, this redeployment \nremains our best leverage to pressure the Iraqi Government to achieve \nthe political settlement between its warring factions, that can slow \nthe bloodshed and promote stability. My plan allows for a limited \nnumber of United States troops to remain as basic force protection, to \nengage in counterterrorism, and to continue the training of Iraqi \nsecurity forces.\n  If the Iraqis are successful in meeting the 13 benchmarks for \nprogress laid out by the Bush administration itself, this plan also \nallows for the temporary suspension of the redeployment, provided \nCongress agrees that the benchmarks have actually been met and that the \nsuspension is in the national security interest of the United States.\n  The United States military has performed valiantly and brilliantly in \nIraq. Our troops have done all we have asked them to do and more, but \nno amount of American soldiers can solve the political differences at \nthe heart of somebody else's civil war, nor settle the grievances in \nthe hearts of the combatants.\n  It is my firm belief that the responsible course of action for the \nUnited States, for Iraq and for our troops, is to oppose this reckless \nescalation and to pursue a new policy. This policy I have laid out is \nconsistent with what I have advocated for well over a year, with many \nof the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and with \nwhat the American people demanded in the November election.\n\n  When it comes to the war in Iraq, the time for promises and \nassurances, for waiting and for patience, is over. Too many lives have \nbeen lost and too many billions of dollars have been spent for us to \ntrust the President on another tired and failed policy that is opposed \nby generals and experts, Democrats and Republicans, Americans, and many \nof the Iraqis themselves.\n  It is time for us to fundamentally change our policy. It is time to \ngive the Iraqis back their country. And it is time to refocus America's \nefforts on the challenges we face at home and the wider struggle \nagainst terror yet to be won.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez).

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the U.S. trade \nagenda. There are a number of important items on this year's trade \nagenda, including reauthorization of Trade Promotion Authority for the \nPresident and reauthorizing our trade adjustment assistance programs \nfor workers who are displaced by trade. I will speak on those \npriorities another day.\n  Today I want to focus on our trade relations with our neighbors in \nCentral and South America. During my chairmanship of the Finance \nCommittee, Congress passed implementing bills for trade agreements \ncovering 12 countries. Out of these 12 countries, over half--7--are \nlocated in Latin America. I am pleased that Congress acted to \nstrengthen our economic relations with Chile, the Dominican Republic, \nGuatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, by \nimplementing our trade agreements with these neighbors to the south. \nAnd I think we should all be pleased that these seven countries made it \na priority to develop closer economic ties with us and to further \ncommit themselves to transparency and the rule of law.\n  I hope that the current Congress will continue working to strengthen \neconomic relations between the United States and Latin America. \nFortunately, we already have a roadmap for doing so. We have concluded \nfree trade agreements with Peru and Colombia, and we are about to sign \nan agreement with Panama. It is up to this Congress to pass \nimplementing legislation for these agreements. Failure to do so would \nonly damage our relations with these important allies and embolden \nother southern neighbors who are increasingly hostile to the United \nStates.\n  Moreover, by implementing our trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, \nand Panama, we would provide an important boost for U.S. exporters. \nDuring my time in the Senate, I have heard many of my colleagues \ncomplain that the global trade situation reflects an uneven playing \nfield. To some extent, I agree. In too many cases, the duties imposed \non U.S. exports by our trading partners are much higher than our \nduties. That is certainly the situation with Peru, Colombia, and \nPanama. Right now, almost all imports from those three countries enter \nthe United States duty free. Ninety percent of the value of our imports \nfrom Colombia enter duty-free. With respect to Panama, it is over 95 \npercent, and with respect to Peru it is 97 percent.\n  On the other hand, our exports to these countries face significant \nduties. Colombia's tariffs generally range from 10 to 20 percent, while \nthose of Peru range from 12 to 25 percent. After Panama acceded to the \nWorld Trade Organization in 1997 its tariffs averaged 8 percent, but \nsince then Panama has raised tariffs on certain agricultural products. \nFor example, Panama's tariff on pork--a major Iowa product--is \ncurrently 74 percent, while its tariff on chicken imports is 273 \npercent. Now that is what I call a one-way street.\n  This imbalance is largely the result of unilateral trade benefits \nthat we extend to these nations. Panama gets duty-free access to our \nmarkets under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, while Peru and Colombia \nare eligible under the Andean Trade Preference Act. And all three are \neligible under our Generalized System of Preferences.\n  The nonpartisan U.S. International Trade Commission, ITC, analyzed \nour trade agreements with Peru and Colombia. The ITC concluded that \nthese agreements will help to level the playing field that is currently \ntilted against U.S. exporters.\n  Here is what the ITC has to say about our trade promotion agreement \nwith Peru:\n\n       Given the substantially larger tariffs faced by U.S. \n     exporters to Peru than Peruvian exporters to the United \n     States, the TPA is likely to result in a much larger increase \n     in U.S. exports than in U.S. imports.\n\n  The ITC goes on to state that the agreement will likely increase U.S. \nexports to Peru by 25 percent, while Peruvian exports to the United \nStates will grow by 8 percent.\n  The ITC's analysis of our trade promotion agreement with Colombia \ndraws similar conclusions. The ITC report states that:\n\n       Colombian exporters generally face substantially lower \n     tariffs in the U.S. market\n\n[[Page S1323]]\n\n     than do U.S. exporters in the Colombian market. . . . The TPA \n     is likely to result in a much larger increase in U.S. exports \n     to Colombia than in U.S. imports from Colombia.\n\n  The ITC predicts that after implementing the agreement, U.S. exports \nto Colombia will be $1.1 billion higher than today, and U.S. imports \nfrom Colombia will be $487 million higher.\n  The ITC has not yet completed its analysis of our trade agreement \nwith Panama. But given the disparity in tariff levels between the \nUnited States and Panama, I think it is safe to assume that the ITC \nwill reach similar conclusions regarding the likely economic impact of \nthat agreement as well. And the benefits of these three trade \nagreements will be spread across all major sectors of our economy. U.S. \nagricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers all stand \nto gain.\n  According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, our trade agreement \nwith Peru could increase U.S. agricultural exports by over $705 million \nannually. With respect to Colombia, the Farm Bureau predicts that full \nimplementation of our trade agreement will have an annual net benefit \nof over $660 million for the U.S. agricultural sector. The Farm Bureau \nhasn't finished its analysis of the impact of our trade agreement with \nPanama, but I am confident that it will find major benefits for U.S. \nfarmers.\n  Our manufacturers stand to gain as well. According to the \nInternational Trade Commission, U.S. producers of machinery, chemicals, \nrubber, and plastic products will be among the biggest beneficiaries of \nthese agreements. And Panama will eliminate tariffs on manufactured \nproducts within 10 years of implementing our trade agreement.\n  U.S. service providers will also gain from increased trade with Peru, \nColombia, and Panama. Under their respective agreements, each of those \ncountries agree to exceed the commitments they made on services in the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n\n  In addition, Panama is scheduled to initiate a $5.25 billion \nexpansion project for the Panama Canal in 2008. Our trade agreement \nwith Panama will help ensure market access for U.S. service providers \nfor this major project.\n  So to those of my colleagues who complain that the current world \ntrading situation is unfair, here is a chance to help fix the problem. \nBy implementing trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, and Panama, \nCongress will level the playing field for U.S. farmers, manufacturers, \nand service providers in these important markets. These agreements will \nboost U.S. exports and help create jobs. I think it is ironic that some \nof my colleagues oppose these free trade agreements and yet at the same \ntime complain the loudest about the trade deficit and how the deck is \nstacked against U.S. exporters.\n  These agreements level the playing field. It is beyond me as to how \nsomeone could oppose that. Now, I understand that there is rising \nprotectionism in Congress. But let's look at the facts. Take as an \nexample the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement, \notherwise known as CAFTA.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, our exports to the \nCAFTA countries were up 17 percent in the period January through \nNovember 2006, while our imports from the CAFTA countries were up 3 \npercent. As a result, our trade balance swung from a $1.2 billion \ndeficit 2 years ago to an annualized surplus of $1 billion last year. \nThat is what happens when you level the playing field.\n  And we are not the only ones who stand to benefit. Peru, Colombia, \nand Panama will also benefit from implementing our trade agreements. \nThe leaders of these countries are to be commended. By pursuing trade \nagreements with the United States, they have demonstrated a commitment \nto locking in economic reforms, increasing economic freedoms, and \nenhancing transparency and respect for the rule of law.\n  That leadership and foresight will be rewarded once our trade \nagreements are implemented. I read recently in the Wall Street Journal \nof a joint study conducted by the Journal and the Heritage Foundation. \nAccording to the article, their study found that ``economically free \ncountries enjoy significantly greater prosperity than those burdened by \nheavy government intervention.''\n  We certainly see examples of heavy-handed government intervention in \nsome other Latin American countries. Instead of fostering individual \nand economic liberty, these governments are embracing the failed policy \nof statism. Chief among them is the Government of Venezuela.\n  President Chavez has announced plans to turn Venezuela into a \n``socialist republic.'' To that end, he announced this month that he \nplans to nationalize Venezuela's telecommunications and electricity \nindustries. That decision will directly impact U.S. companies with \ninvestments in those sectors of the Venezuelan economy.\n  President Chavez also might nationalize Venezuela's mining sector, \nand he intends to increase state control over the oil industry as well. \nSignificantly, President Chavez is demonstrating that those who \nwithdraw economic rights often seek to withdraw political rights, and \nthat those who centralize economic power tend to centralize political \npower. For example, he has stated that he plans to pull the \nbroadcasting license of one of Venezuela's oldest television \nbroadcasters, which also happens to be one of his major critics. \nPresident Chavez is also proposing changes in Venezuelan laws that will \nenable him to rule by decree for 18 months, permit his indefinite \nreelection as President, and reduce the power of state governors and \nmayors.\n  Unfortunately, President Chavez is not alone. Two other countries in \nthe region are moving toward increased state control of their \neconomies. Bolivia and Ecuador each currently enjoy duty-free access to \nthe U.S. market under the Andean Trade Preference Act. Yet last year \nBolivia undertook a de facto nationalization of its natural gas \nindustries, forcing companies to renegotiate their contracts with the \nstate. Bolivian President Morales is also considering nationalizing the \ncountry's mining, electricity, and telecommunications sectors. In the \ncase of Ecuador, last year the government revoked the operating license \nof a U.S. oil company and seized $1 billion of the company's assets.\n  So Latin America is clearly divided. Some countries, led by \nVenezuela, are consolidating economic power in the state. President \nChavez is also clearly seeking to centralize political power, and has \ndemonstrated an active hostility to the United States.\n  That stands in stark contrast to our allies and trading partners, \nPeru, Colombia, and Panama. The governments of these three countries \nhave gone out on a limb. They have demonstrated they want closer \neconomic ties with the United States. They appreciate that, by working \nwith us, by building more links between businesses in their countries \nand ours, they can better improve the lives of their citizens. We need \nto reward that leadership. We should do so by implementing our \nrespective trade agreements as soon as possible. If we don't, we will \nbe turning our backs on allies in the region. We will be sending a \nsignal to Latin America that we don't really care about opening markets \nand enhancing the rule of law. Instead, we'd help build the clout of \nChavez and other leaders in the region who see the failed policy of \nstatism as Latin America's future. And we would be shooting ourselves \nin the foot by giving up a chance to level the playing field. Why would \nwe want to do that?\n  Before concluding, I would like to address two other sets of issues \nthat have arisen with respect to our trade agreements with Peru, \nColombia, and Panama. First are the labor and environment chapters of \nthe agreements, and second is the Andean Trade Preference Act.\n  I understand that some in Congress would like to see the labor and \nenvironment chapters of these agreements renegotiated. I disagree. I \nbelieve that the provisions on labor and the environment are strong. \nAnd I note that renegotiation would effectively preclude implementation \nof these agreements under the current Trade Promotion Authority, which \nis set to expire on July 1.\n  I question whether those who would insist on renegotiation aren't \nreally trying to kill the agreements outright. In my view, the best \nthing we can do to advance labor rights and environmental protections \nin these countries is to implement our trade agreements with them. \nImplementation will increase the rate of economic growth and\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\nprosperity in these countries. It will increase business activity and \nawareness of labor rights. It will create new bodies for more active \noversight of labor and the environment.\n  As important as labor and the environment are to some of my \ncolleagues, I don't see how they can justify holding back these trade \nagreements that are so good for the United States. They should be \nembarrassed for holding them up. The sooner we implement these \nagreements, the sooner our farmers, manufacturers, and service \nproviders will benefit from them. That being said, I understand that \nU.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab is in discussions with some of \nmy colleagues to explore ways to address their concerns regarding labor \nand the environment. I am willing to listen to any constructive \nproposals that are put forward.\n  Separately, I note that the Andean Trade Preference Act has been \nextended until June 30. That leaves Congress sufficient time to \nimplement our trade agreements with Peru and Colombia, so that their \npreferential access to the U.S. market does not terminate.\n  But with respect to Bolivia and Ecuador, their preferential access to \nthe U.S. market will terminate after June 30 because we don't have \ncomprehensive trade agreements lined up with those two countries.\n  Some of my colleagues are already talking about extending the Andean \nTrade Preference Act beyond June 30. I see no reason to do so. If \nCongress acts responsibly and implements our trade agreements with Peru \nand Colombia by June 30, neither of those countries will need \nunilateral preferential trade benefits.\n  As far as Bolivia and Ecuador go, I see no reason to extend \npreferential trade benefits to them. Not only are they withholding \nmarket access from U.S. exporters, they are actively engaged in \nnationalizing industries and expropriating foreign assets.\n  It wouldn't be right to treat imports from Bolivia and Ecuador the \nsame as products from Peru and Colombia. Why should Congress be in the \nbusiness of rewarding bad behavior? So I disagree with my colleagues \nwho favor extending the Andean Trade Preference Act past June 30.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I hope that the administration will soon be in \na position to send implementing legislation for the U.S-Peru Trade \nPromotion Agreement to Congress. And I urge my colleagues to work with \nme to implement not only that agreement, but also our agreements with \nColombia and Peru as soon as possible. Our agricultural producers, \nmanufacturers, and service providers are counting on us. Our allies are \ncounting on us. It is in our economic interest, and it is in our \nnational interest. Now it is up to Congress. We have to execute our \nresponsibilities without delay. We cannot let the opportunities \nembodied in these trade agreements slip us by.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise to \nrecognize our 32nd President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. One hundred \nand twenty-five years ago today, FDR was born at Hyde Park, NY. During \nhis childhood, Franklin developed a lifelong love for the natural \nbeauty and history of the Hudson River Valley.\n  Like his famous cousin, President Theodore Roosevelt, FDR enjoyed a \nrapid rise in politics. A graduate of Harvard College and Columbia Law \nSchool, FDR was first elected to the New York State Senate in 1910. \nFollowing service as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the Woodrow \nWilson administration, he was the Democratic Party's unsuccessful \nnominee for Vice President of the United States in 1920.\n  Just months later, his personal and political world was upended when \npolio left him paralyzed below the waist. Most assumed his public life \nwas over. Yet Roosevelt turned aside all thought of retreat. With the \nhelp of his wife Eleanor, he maintained his political contacts and was \ndetermined to continue serving his State and country.\n  Roosevelt's resolve was rewarded in 1928 when he triumphantly \nreentered political office, winning election as Governor of New York. \nTwo years later, with America now in the grip of the Great Depression, \nhe was reelected in a landslide. He set out to make New York a \nlaboratory for aggressive efforts to use government to provide economic \nrelief and put people back to work.\n  In 1932, the darkest year of the Depression, the Democratic Party \nturned to FDR as its nominee for President. His resounding victory gave \nhim a mandate for fundamental change. When he took the oath of office \non March 4, 1933, our Nation was on the brink of economic collapse, \nwith 13 million Americans unemployed. FDR quickly sprang into action to \nmeet this challenge. Declaring that the only thing the Nation had to \nfear was ``fear itself,'' he created Federal programs that put millions \nof people back to work and provided aid for others so that they could \nfeed their families. He reformed banking, aided organized labor, \ninvested in the Nation's infrastructure, and established social \nprograms, including Social Security, that changed the way in which \nAmericans and their government interact. Most important, he restored \npeople's hope and self-respect.\n  On December 7, 1941--a date that Roosevelt said would live ``in \ninfamy''--America entered the war. During the daunting years that \nfollowed, FDR led the Nation as Commander in Chief. He directed a \nmassive effort to convert America's economy to wartime production, \nencouraged his fellow citizens to sacrifice for the common good, and \nhelped lead an international coalition in a global war to defeat the \nAxis Powers. Roosevelt envisioned a postwar world shaped by four \nfundamental human freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, \nfreedom from want, and freedom from fear. To help achieve this vision, \nhe was a forceful advocate for a postwar United Nations Organization.\n  In 1944, with the war still underway, FDR faced a decision on whether \nto run for an unprecedented fourth term as President. ``All that is \nwithin me,'' he declared, ``cries out to go back to my home on the \nHudson River, to avoid public responsibilities, and to avoid also the \npublicity which in our democracy follows every step of the Nation's \nChief Executive.'' Yet despite his yearning to retire to the quiet of \nHyde Park, FDR answered the call of duty to finish the job of winning \nthe war. In November 1944 he was elected President once again.\n  In March 1945, with the war nearly won, an exhausted Roosevelt made \nwhat would be his final visit to Hyde Park. Worn down by heart disease \nand the stresses of wartime leadership, he then departed for a brief \nstay in Washington, DC, before heading to his retreat at Warm Springs, \nGA for a short vacation. Two weeks later, on April 12, 1945, he died \nthere of a cerebral hemorrhage. On April 15, 1945, he came home to his \nbeloved Hyde Park for the last time and was buried in a large rose \ngarden just steps from his home and library.\n  Today, as we mark the 125th birthday of a great 20th century \nPresident, we also remember his special connection to New York State. \nIn the Roosevelt Library, among millions of documents preserved for \nhistorians, is the draft of a speech FDR was working on the day before \nhis death. The speech outlined his hopes for the postwar world. The \nfinal lines of that speech, handwritten\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\nin pencil by the President, speak eloquently of Franklin Roosevelt's \nunconquerable optimism and idealism: ``The only limit to our \nrealization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move \nforward with strong and active faith.''\n  So today let us remember our 32nd President, and let us also honor \nhis memory by dedicating ourselves to overcome our own doubts of today \nin order to realize our visions of tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/30/senate-section/article/S1326-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   AWARDS FOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Rodney Kraft, Eric \nAnderson, Nick Hodgin, and Cecilia Cedeno, all of whom received the \nFounder's Award for Outstanding Achievement from the Black Hills \nWorkshop in Rapid City, SD. This is a prestigious award that reflects \nthe recipients' hard work and dedication to achieving independent \nliving. It also reflects the valuable role they have played in giving \nback to their local community.\n  Rodney Kraft has worked as a clerk at Ellsworth Air Force Base's \nsupply store for the past 10 years. He is a dependable worker who is \nwell liked by his fellow staff members and customers. Rodney also has a \nvast knowledge of computers which makes him an excellent resource for \nhis coworkers.\n  Eric Anderson is a food service attendant at Ellsworth Air Force \nBase's Bandit Inn. He has been an excellent addition to their staff and \nhas been rewarded for his hard work by receiving the Employee of the \nMonth and Employee of the Quarter awards. He has recently completed his \nfirst degree brown belt in jujitsu and hopes to someday earn his black \nbelt.\n  Nick Hodgin is an enthusiastic member of the janitorial team at \nEllsworth AFB. In the past year, Nick has been promoted from a being a \nmember of a supervised crew to working independently. Nick also loves \nworking on diesel engines and is currently preparing to take the \nentrance exam for Western Dakota Technical Institute. In his spare \ntime, he volunteers with the Black Hills Humane Society.\n  Cecelia Cedeno has recently retired from her work as a dishwasher at \nthe Corn Exchange Restaurant in Rapid City, SD. As a dishwasher, \nCecelia was praised by her employer for her strong work ethic and her \nkindness to the other staff members. Since her retirement, she has been \nspending part of the year visiting family in Arizona and the rest of \nher time enjoying her time in Rapid City.\n  It gives me great pleasure to rise with Rodney Kraft, Eric Anderson, \nNick Hodgin, and Cecilia Cedeno to congratulate them on receiving these \nwell-earned awards and wish them continued success in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/30/senate-section/article/S1326-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMANDER LEDA MEI LI CHONG\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate \nCommander Leda Mei Li Chong upon the completion of her career of \nservice in the U.S. Navy. Throughout her 20-year military career, \nCommander Chong served with distinction and dedication.\n  As the first member in her family to serve in the military, Commander \nChong received her commission from the United States Navy in 1987. She \nwent on to teach math, chemistry, materials, and radiological controls \nat the Naval Nuclear Power School in Orlando, FL. From there, Commander \nChong served in various technical positions always providing vital \noperational and training support to the naval fleet. Highlights include \nhaving been the Department of Defense military satellite communications \nliaison to the U.S. Coast Guard where she provided expert technical and \npolicy guidance on ultra high frequency satellite capabilities. She was \nalso deputy J6 to the commander, Iceland Defense Force where she \nprovided critical command, control, and communications in support of \nNATO defense. Commander Chong volunteered as a White House social aide \nwhere she provided support to the President of the United States during \nimportant State events. Her most recent assignments were as a Navy \ncongressional liaison to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees \nas well as to the Senate and House Defense Appropriations \nsubcommittees. As a congressional liaison, her straightforward approach \nand complete grasp of all facets concerning C4ISR, information \ntechnology, and space programs have been of great benefit to my staff, \nthe U.S. Congress and our national security. Commander Chong ensured \nthat the U.S. congress had the information necessary to determine how \nto best equip, maintain and support the U.S. Navy.\n  Her family and her fellow shipmates can be proud of her distinguished \nservice. Her parents Paul and Su and her husband Kevin have given her \nstrong support during her naval career. As she departs the Pentagon to \nstart her second career, I call upon my colleagues to wish Commander \nChong and her family every success, and the traditional Navy ``fair \nwinds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/30/senate-section/article/S1326-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 10:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 188.

A bill to provide for additional section 8 vouchers, to \nreauthorize the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Affordable \nHousing Expansion and Public Safety Act to address some of the housing \naffordability issues faced by my constituents and by Americans around \nthe country, including unaffordable rental burdens, lack of safe and \naffordable housing stock, and public safety concerns in public and \nfederally assisted housing. My legislation is fully offset, while also \nproviding $2.69 billion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years.\n  Increasing numbers of Americans are facing housing affordability \nchallenges, whether they are renters or homeowners. But the housing \naffordability burden falls most heavily on low-income renters \nthroughout our country. Ensuring that all Americans have safe and \nsecure housing is about more than just providing families with \nsomewhere to live, however. Safe and decent housing provides children \nwith stable environments, and research has shown that students achieve \nat higher rates if they have secure housing. Affordable housing allows \nfamilies to spend more of their income on life's other necessities \nincluding groceries, health care, and education costs as well as save \nmoney for their futures. I have heard from a number of Wisconsinites \naround my State about their concerns about the lack of affordable \nhousing, homelessness, and the increasingly severe cost burdens that \nfamilies have to undertake in order to afford housing.\n  This bill is especially needed now, given the breakdown in the fiscal \nyear 2007 appropriations process. This week, the House is scheduled to \npass a joint funding resolution to fund federal agencies through the \nrest of fiscal year 2007. I have heard from Wisconsinites concerned \nthat the funding levels in the resolution could affect the ability of \nvarious local housing authorities to serve the same number of \nindividuals as were assisted last year, never mind trying to serve the \nincreasing numbers of individuals around the State who need housing \nassistance. Yesterday, the House Appropriations Committee filed the \njoint funding resolution and I am pleased to see the Committee included \na boost in funding for Section 8 tenant-based and project-based \nvouchers, allowing HUD to renew the vouchers that are currently in use \nby families. In addition to maintaining the current level of vouchers, \nI hope that we in Congress can work together this year to fund new \nSection 8 vouchers to help address the critical rental assistance needs \nthroughout the country.\n  My bill does not address every housing need out there, but I believe \nit is a good, necessary first step. My legislation does address a \nnumber of different issues that local communities in my State and \naround the country are facing, including the need for more rental \nassistance, the creation and preservation of more affordable housing \nunits, and the ability to more adequately address public safety \nconcerns of residents of federally assisted housing.\n  Congress needs to act on other vital housing needs this year \nincluding addressing the large shortfall in the public housing \noperating fund. I have heard from housing authorities ranging in size \nfrom Menomonie Housing Authority to Milwaukee Housing Authority about \nthe shortfall in operating funds and the negative impact it is having \non the communities these housing agencies are serving. This shortfall \nin operating subsidies impacts public housing authorities and the \npeople they serve by reducing funding for maintenance costs associated \nwith running buildings and limiting the services that housing \nauthorities can provide, such as covering utility cost increases. The \njoint funding resolution filed yesterday also included an increase of \n$300 million for public housing authorities to pay for these important \noperating costs, including the increases in utility costs. This is a \ngood start and we must continue working this year to provide much-\nneeded assistance to these housing authorities and the individuals and \nfamilies they serve.\n  Unfortunately, affordable housing is becoming less, not more, \navailable in the United States. Research shows that the number of \nfamilies facing severe housing cost burdens grew by almost two million \nhouseholds between 2001 and 2004. Additionally, one in three families \nspends more than 30 percent of their earnings on housing costs. The \nNational Alliance to End Homelessness reports that at least 500,000 \nAmericans are homeless every day and two million to three million \nAmericans are homeless for various lengths of time each year. Cities, \ntowns, and rural communities across the country are confronting a lack \nof affordable housing for their citizens. This is not an issue that \nconfronts just one region of the Nation or one group of Americans. \nDecent and affordable housing is so essential to the well-being of \nAmericans that the Federal Government must provide adequate assistance \nto our citizens to ensure that all Americans can afford to live in safe \nand affordable housing.\n  Congress has created effective affordable housing and community \ndevelopment programs, but as is the case with many of the Federal \nsocial programs, these housing programs are inadequately funded and do \nnot meet the need in our communities. We in Congress must do what we \ncan to ensure these programs are properly funded, while taking into \naccount the tight fiscal constraints we are facing.\n  The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, originally created in \n1974, is now the largest Federal housing program in terms of HUD's \nbudget with approximately two million vouchers currently authorized. \nYet the current number of vouchers does not come close to meeting the \ndemand that exists in communities around our country. In my State of \nWisconsin, the city of Milwaukee opened up their Section 8 waiting list \nfor the first time since 1999 earlier this year for twenty four hours \nand received more than 17,000 applications. The city of Madison has not \naccepted new applications for Section 8\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\nin over three years and reports that hundreds of families are on the \nwaiting list.\n\n  Unfortunately, situations like this exist around the country. \nAccording to the 2005 U.S. Conference of Mayors Hunger and Homelessness \nSurvey, close to 5,000 people are on the Section 8 waiting list in \nBoston. Detroit has not taken applications for the past two years and \ncurrently has a waiting list of over 9,000 people. Phoenix closed its \nwaiting list in 2005 and reported that 30,000 families were on its \nwaiting list. In certain cities, waiting lists are years long and \naccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the typical \nwaiting period for a voucher was two and a half years in 2003. Given \nthese statistics, it is clear there is the need for more Section 8 \nvouchers than currently exist.\n  While there are certainly areas of the Section 8 program that need to \nbe examined and perhaps reformed, a number of different government \nagencies and advocacy organizations all cite the effectiveness of \nSection 8 in assisting low-income families in meeting some of their \nhousing needs. In 2002, the Government Accountability Office determined \nthat the total cost of a one-bedroom housing unit through the Section 8 \nprogram costs less than it would through other federal housing \nprograms. The same year, the Bipartisan Millennial Housing Commission \nreported to Congress that the Section 8 program is ``flexible, cost-\neffective, and successful in its mission.''\n  The Commission further stated that the vouchers ``should continue to \nbe the linchpin of a national policy providing very low-income renters \naccess to the privately owned housing stock.'' The Commission also \ncalled for funding for substantial annual increments of vouchers for \nfamilies who need housing assistance. This recommendation echoes the \ncalls by advocates around the country, many of whom have called for \n100,000 new, or incremental, Section 8 vouchers to be funded annually \nby Congress.\n  My bill takes this first step, calling for the funding of 100,000 \nincremental vouchers in fiscal year 2008. I have identified enough \nfunds in my offsets to provide money for the renewal of these 100,000 \nvouchers for the next decade. While this increase does not meet the \ntotal demand that exists out there for Section 8 vouchers, I believe it \nis a strong first step. My legislation is fully offset and if it were \npassed in its current form, would provide for the immediate funding of \nthese vouchers. I believe Congress should take the time to examine \nwhere other spending could be cut in order to continue to provide \nsizeable annual increases in new vouchers for the Section 8 program. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, incremental vouchers \nhave not been funded since fiscal year 2002. During the past three to \nfour years, the need for Federal housing assistance has grown and it \nwill continue to grow in future years. We need to make a commitment to \nfind the resources in our budget to ensure continued and increased \nfunding for Section 8 vouchers.\n  We should examine doing more than just providing more money for \nSection 8. There have been numerous stories in my home State of \nWisconsin about various concerns with the Section 8 program, ranging \nfrom potential discrimination on the part of landlords in declining to \nrent to Section 8 voucher holders to the administrative burdens \nlandlords face when participating in the Section 8 program. \nAdditionally, there are substantial concerns with the funding formula \nthe Bush Administration is currently using for the Section 8 program. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in this Congress to address \nthese and other issues and make the Section 8 program more effective, \nmore secure, and more accessible to citizens throughout the country.\n  But providing rental assistance is not the only answer to solving the \nhousing affordability problem in our country. We must also work to \nincrease the availability of affordable housing stock in our \ncommunities through facilitating production of housing units affordable \nto extremely low and very low income Americans. The HOME Investments \nPartnership Program, more commonly known as HOME, was created in 1990 \nto assist states and local communities in producing affordable housing \nfor low income families. HOME is a grant program that allows \nparticipating jurisdictions the flexibility to use funds for new \nproduction, preservation, and rehabilitation of existing housing stock. \nHOME is an effective federal program that is used in concert with other \nexisting housing programs to provide affordable housing units for low \nincome Americans throughout the country.\n  According to recent data from HUD, since fiscal year 1992, over $23 \nbillion has been allocated through the HOME program to participating \njurisdictions around the country. There have been over 800,000 units \ncommitted, including over 200,000 new construction units. HUD reports \nthat over 700,000 units have been completed or funded. Communities in \nmy State of Wisconsin have received over $370 million since 1992 and \nhave seen over 20,000 housing units completed since 1992. Cities and \nStates around the country are able to report numerous success stories \nin part due to the HOME funding that has been allocated to \nparticipating jurisdictions since 1992. The Bipartisan Millennial \nHousing Commission found that the HOME program is highly successful and \nrecommended a substantial increase in funding for HOME in 2002.\n  Unfortunately, for the past two fiscal years, the HOME program has \nseen a decline in funding. In fiscal year 2005, HOME was funded at $1.9 \nbillion and in fiscal year 2006, HOME was funded at a little more than \n$1.7 billion. As a result of this decline in funding, all participating \njurisdictions in Wisconsin saw a decline in HOME dollars, with some \njurisdictions seeing a decline of more than six percent. We need to \nensure these funding cuts to HOME do not continue in the future and we \nmust provide more targeted resources within HOME for the people most in \nneed.\n  But, as successful as the HOME program is, more needs to be done to \nassist extremely low income families. My legislation seeks to target \nadditional resources to the Americans most in need by using the HOME \nstructure to distribute new funding to participating jurisdictions with \nthe requirement that these participating jurisdictions use these set-\naside dollars to produce, rehab, or preserve affordable housing for \nextremely low income families, or people at 30 percent of area median \nincome or below.\n  As we all know, extremely low income households face the most severe \naffordable housing cost burdens of any Americans. According to data \nfrom HUD and the American Housing Survey, 56 percent of extremely low \nincome renter households deal with severe affordability housing issues \nwhile only 25 percent of these renters are not burdened with \naffordability concerns. HUD also found that half of all extremely low \nincome owner households are severely burdened by affordability \nconcerns. Data shows more than 75 percent of renter households with \nsevere housing affordability burdens are extremely low income families \nand more than half of extremely low income households pay at least half \nof their income on housing. The Bipartisan Millennial Housing \nCommission has stated that ``the most serious housing problem in \nAmerica is the mismatch between the number of extremely low income \nrenter households and the number of units available to them with \nacceptable quality and affordable rents.'' The Commission also noted \nthat there is no federal program solely for the preservation or \nproduction of housing for extremely low or moderate income families.\n  Because of these severe burdens and the high cost of providing safe \nand affordable housing to families at 30 percent or below of area \nmedian income, my bill would provide $400 million annually on top of \nthe money that Congress already appropriates through HOME. I have heard \nfrom a number of housing advocates in Wisconsin that we have effective \nhousing programs but the programs are not funded adequately. This is \nwhy I decided to administer this funding through the HOME program; \nlocal communities are familiar with the requirements and regulations of \nthe HOME program and I think it is important not to place unnecessary \nand new administrative hurdles on local cities and communities.\n  Participating jurisdictions will be able to use this new funding \nunder the eligible uses currently allowed by HOME to best meet the \nneeds of the extremely low income families in their\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\nrespective communities. But participating jurisdictions must certify \nthat this funding is going to extremely low income households and must \nreport on how the funds are being utilized in their communities. Funds \nare intended to be distributed on a pro-rata basis to ensure \nparticipating jurisdictions around the country receive funding. I also \nrequire that the Secretary notify participating jurisdictions that this \nnew funding for extremely low income households in no way excuses such \njurisdictions from continuing to use existing HOME dollars to serve \nextremely low income families. It is my hope that this extra funding \nwill provide an increased incentive to local cities and communities to \ndedicate more resources to producing and preserving affordable housing \nfor the most vulnerable Americans.\n  My bill would also reauthorize a critical crime-fighting grant \nprogram: the Public and Assisted Housing Crime and Drug Elimination \nProgram, formerly known as ``PHDEP.'' Unfortunately, the PHDEP program \nhas not been funded since 2001, and its statutory authorization expired \nin 2003. It is time to bring back this important grant program, which \nprovided much-needed public safety resources to public housing \nauthorities and their tenants. My legislation would authorize $200 \nmillion per year for five years for this program.\n  After more than a decade of declining crime rates, new FBI statistics \nindicate that 2005 brought an overall increase in violent crime across \nthe country, and particularly in the Midwest. Nationwide, violent crime \nincreased 2.3 percent between 2004 and 2005, and in the Midwest, \nviolent crime increased 5.6 percent between 2004 and 2005. Housing \nauthorities and others providing assisted housing are feeling the \neffects of this shift, but just as the crime rate is rising, their \nresources to fight back are dwindling. We need to provide them with \nfunding targeted at preventing and reducing violent and drug-related \ncrime, so that they can provide a safe living environment for their \ntenants.\n  Reauthorizing the Public and Assisted Housing Crime and Drug \nElimination Program should not be controversial. The program has long \nenjoyed bipartisan support. It was first sponsored by Senator \nLautenberg in 1988, and first implemented in 1989 under then-Housing \nand Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp. When in effect, it funded \nnumerous crime-fighting measures in housing authorities all over the \ncountry.\n  In Milwaukee, grants under this program funded a variety of important \nprograms. It provided funding to the Housing Authority of the City of \nMilwaukee to hire public safety officers who are on site 24 hours a day \nto respond to calls and intervene when problems arise, and who work \ncollaboratively with local law enforcement agencies. According to the \nHousing Authority, by the time the PHDEP program was defunded, public \nsafety officers were responding to more than 8,000 calls per year, \ndealing quickly and effectively with thefts, drug use and sales, and \nother problems. Grants under the program also allowed the Housing \nAuthority in Milwaukee to conduct crime prevention programs through the \nBoys and Girls Club of Greater Milwaukee and other on-site agencies, \nproviding youths and others living in public housing with a variety of \neducational, job training and life skill programs.\n\n  When the PHDEP program was defunded during the fiscal year 2002 \nbudget cycle, the Administration argued that crime-fighting measures \nshould be funded through the Public Housing Operating Fund and promised \nan increase in that Fund to account for part of the loss of PHDEP \nfunds. That allowed some programs previously funded under PHDEP to \ncontinue for a few years. But now there is a significant shortfall in \nthe Operating Fund and HUD is proposing limits on how capital funds can \nbe used, and housing authorities nationwide--including in Milwaukee--\nhave been faced with tough decisions, including cutting some or all of \ntheir crime reduction programs.\n  It is time for Congress to step in and reauthorize these grants. \nEveryone deserves a safe place to live, and we should help provide \nhousing authorities and other federally assisted low-income housing \nentities with the resources they need to provide that to their tenants.\n  But we can do more than just provide public housing authorities with \ngrant money. The Federal Government also needs to provide more \nresources to help housing authorities spend those funds in the most \neffective way possible. That is why my legislation also contains \nseveral provisions to enhance the effectiveness of this grant program. \nIt would: Require HUD's Office of Policy Development & Research (PD) \nto conduct a review of existing research on crime fighting measures and \nissue a report within six months identifying effective programs, \nproviding an important resource to public housing authorities; require \nPD to work with housing authorities, social scientists and others to \ndevelop and implement a plan to conduct rigorous scientific evaluation \nof crime reduction and prevention strategies funded by the grant \nprogram that have not previously been subject to that type of \nevaluation, giving housing authorities yet another source of \ninformation about effective strategies for combating crime; and require \nHUD to report to Congress within four years, based on what it learns \nfrom existing research and evaluations of grantee programs, on the most \neffective ways to prevent and reduce crime in public and assisted \nhousing environments, the ways in which it has provided related \nguidance to help grant applicants, and any suggestions for improving \nthe effectiveness of the program going forward.\n  As with any grant program, it is essential that HUD monitor the use \nof the grants and that grantees be required to report regularly on \ntheir activities, as was required by HUD regulations when the program \nwas defunded. The bill also clarifies the types of activities that can \nbe funded through the grant program to ensure that funds are not used \ninappropriately.\n  My bill also includes a sense of the Senate provision calling on \nCongress to create a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. At the \noutset, I want to commend my colleagues in the Senate, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Reed, Senator Sanders and others for all their work on \nadvancing the cause of a National Affordable Housing Trust fund. I look \nforward to working with them and others in the 110th Congress to push \nfor the creation of such a trust fund.\n  I agree with my colleagues that such a trust fund should have the \ngoal of supplying 1,500,000 new affordable housing units over the next \n10 years. It should also contain sufficient income targeting to reflect \nthe housing affordability burdens faced by extremely low income and \nvery low income families and contain enough flexibility to allow local \ncommunities to produce, preserve, and rehabilitate affordable housing \nunits while ensuring that such affordable housing development fosters \nthe creation of healthy and sustainable communities.\n  Hundreds of local housing trust funds have been created in cities and \nstates throughout the country, including recently in the city of \nMilwaukee. I want to commend the community members in Milwaukee for \nworking to address the housing affordability issues that the city faces \nand it is my hope that we in Congress can do our part to help \nWisconsin's communities and communities around the country provide safe \nand affordable housing to all Americans.\n  This Nation faces a severe shortage of affordable housing for our \nmost vulnerable citizens. Shelter is one of our most basic needs, and, \nunfortunately, too many Wisconsinites and people around the country are \nstruggling to afford a place to live for themselves and their families. \nThis legislation does not solve all the affordable housing issues that \ncommunities are facing, but I believe it is a good first step. This \nissue is about more than providing a roof over a family's head, \nhowever. Good housing and healthy communities lead to better jobs, \nbetter educational outcomes, and better futures for all Americans. \nLocal communities, States, and the Federal Government must work \ntogether to dedicate more effective resources toward ensuring that all \nAmericans have a safe and decent place to live. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in this new Congress to advance my bill and \nother housing initiatives and work towards meeting the\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\ngoal of affordable housing and healthy communities for all Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Senator \nAkaka joins me in sponsoring this measure.\n  The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act was enacted into law \nin 1988, and has been reauthorized several times throughout the years.\n  The Act provides authority for a range of programs and services \ndesigned to improve the health care status of the native people of \nHawaii.\n  With the enactment of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act \nand the establishment of Native Hawaiian health care systems on most of \nthe islands that make up the State of Hawaii, we have witnessed \nsignificant improvements in the health status of Native Hawaiians, but \nas the findings of unmet needs and health disparities set forth in this \nbill make clear, we still have a long way to go.\n  For instance, Native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality \nrates in the State of Hawaii--rates that are 22 percent higher than the \nrate for the total State male population and 64 percent higher than the \nrate for the total State female population. Nationally, Native \nHawaiians have the third highest mortality rate as a result of breast \ncancer.\n  With respect to diabetes, in 2004 Native Hawaiians had the highest \nmortality rate associated with diabetes in the State--a rate which is \n119 percent higher than the statewide rate for all racial groups.\n  When it comes to heart disease, the mortality rate of Native \nHawaiians associated with heart disease is 86 percent higher than the \nrate for the entire State, and the mortality rate for hypertension is \n46 percent higher than that for the entire State.\n  These statistics on the health status of Native Hawaiians are but a \nsmall part of the long list of data that makes clear that our objective \nof assuring that the Native people of Hawaii attain some parity of good \nhealth comparable to that of the larger U.S. population has not yet \nbeen achieved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 429\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native Hawaiian Health Care \n     Improvement Reauthorization Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE NATIVE HAWAIIAN HEALTH CARE \n                   IMPROVEMENT ACT.\n\n       The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act (42 U.S.C. \n     11701 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the \nnational defense through empowerment\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\nof the Chief of the National Guard Bureau and the enhancement of the \nfunctions of the National Guard Bureau, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation about the \nNational Guard with Senator Kit Bond, my fellow co-chair of the \nSenate's National Guard Caucus, and Senator Ben Nelson, a longtime \ncaucus member and a subcommittee chair of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. The National Guard Empowerment Act of 2007 would improve the \nmanagement of the National Guard, and it will give the Guard more \nresponsibility in improving our defense arrangements at home, where the \nGuard works in tandem with the Nation's governors to help keep our \ncommunities safe. This legislation will strengthen the National Guard, \nthe military, and our Nation, and I believe it is something that \ndeserves our attention and approval.\n  As Senators, we know all too well the many ways in which our \ncommunities rely on the National Guard. The soldiers of the National \nGuard, like their active duty counterparts, have expended an \nextraordinary amount of will and sacrifice in the wars in Afghanistan \nand Iraq. The National Guard comprised almost 50 percent of the forces \non the ground in Iraq less than 2 years ago, and now, as the Pentagon \nplans to implement the President's plans for a troop escalation, the \npercentage of Guard troops on the ground is set to rise once again.\n  At the same time, we are constantly witness to the equally heralded \nwork that the National Guard has done to increase security at home. \nAlong with efforts to increase security along both the northern and \nsouthern borders, the Guard has bolstered security at special events \nacross the country, including the Olympics, the national political \nparty conventions, and events here in our Nation's capital. Most \nimportantly, the National Guard provided the best--the very best--\nresponse of any agency, Federal, State or local, in the disastrous \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina, sending tens of thousands of troops to \nthe hardest-hit communities in relatively short order.\n  When you look at these examples, it is indisputable that the National \nGuard is only limited in what it can do for us by the authorities, \npolicies, available equipment, responsibilities, and support that we \ngive them.\n  It is time to give the Guard more tools and support to effectively \ncarry out these responsibilities.\n  With the knowledge that the use of the National Guard is sure to \nincrease in the future, the President, the Secretary of Defense, and \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs need unfettered and unmediated advice \nabout how to utilize the force, whether balancing both the domestic and \noverseas missions of the National Guard or using the Guard to support \nthe Nation's governors in domestic emergencies. Given this need for \ngreater input on Guard matters, it is only logical that the leadership \nwithin the National Guard should be the ones doing the advising. And, \nas the Guard becomes more active within the military's total force, it \nonly makes sense to increase the number of Guard generals at the \nhighest reaches of the military command, where key force management \ndecisions are made.\n  At the same time, the National Guard is in a position to deal with \nsome of the basic missions at home that are simply not being address by \nthe Department of Defense. We have some real heroes at the recently \nestablished Northern Command, which is working with various civilian \nagencies to prevent another attack at home. Yet, the processes to deal \nwith the mission of having military support of civilian authorities in \ndomestic emergencies are as yet undefined.\n\n  Northern command, meanwhile, is taking only perfunctory input from \nthe nation's governors who, along with local officials, will bear much \nof the responsibility in disaster situations. Five years after \nSeptember 11, we cannot wait to give more definition to how the \nmilitary will support civil authorities in an emergency, and we cannot \nwait until an actual emergency to inform State governors about what \nresources are available to them. With some new authorities, we can give \nthe Guard the mission of leading the effort to support civilian \nauthorities at home and in working with the States and governors to \nplan for such disasters.\n  Elevating the National Guard bureaucratically, increasing the quality \nadvice on the Guard to the senior command, and improving response to \ndomestic emergencies are exactly what the provisions of the National \nGuard Empowerment Act will accomplish.\n  First, the National Guard Empowerment Act elevates the Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau from the rank of lieutenant general to general \nwith four-stars, with a seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This move \nwill give the Nation's governors and adjutants general a straight line \nof communication to the Joint Chiefs Chairman, the Secretary of \nDefense, and the President. Having personnel with more knowledge and \nexperience with the Guard involved in key budget and policy \ndeliberations, the branches of the active duty services will be less \nwilling to try to balance budgets on the back of the reserve forces \nlike the Guard, which only goes against our overall ability to respond.\n  Second, the act gives the National Guard the responsibility of \nworking with the States to identify gaps in their response \ncapabilities, of setting equipment requirements, and procuring these \nmuch needed items. The act will ensure that a National Guard commander \nis the deputy commander of Northern Command and that the Guard--and \nthus, in turn, the governors--work in tandem with the command to set \nout specific plans to support our elected and civilian leaders in an \nemergency.\n  Let me be clear about what this legislation does not do. The Guard \nEmpowerment Act does not make the National Guard a separate armed \nservice. The Guard will remain an integral partner of the Army and the \nAir Force. Nor is the act some kind of wanton power grab. Instead, the \nact would bring the National Guard's bureaucratic position in line with \nwhat it is already doing and what we will expect of it in the future. \nPassage of the act will, utmost, not disturb or undermine our defense \narrangements. Rather, it will empower the entire military to deal with \ncritically important problems that it is simply not addressing.\n  This legislation has been carefully crafted over the past year and a \nhalf, and it incorporates the input we received from the adjutants \ngeneral, the National Guard leadership, the governors, and key officers \nacross the defense establishment. I would like to submit for the Record \nletters of support from the National Guard Association of the United \nStates, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United \nStates, and the Adjutants General Association of the United States.\n  This drive to empower the Guard is also gaining momentum in Congress. \nSince 9/11 we have been asking the Guard to do more and more, and they \nhave superbly handled their dual role at home and abroad. But strains \nare showing in the system. The Guard is a 21st century military \norganization that has to operate under a 20th century bureaucracy. The \nGuard's ability to help the Nation is limited only by the resources, \nauthorities, and responsibility we give it. Let us put the trust in the \nmen and women of the Guard that they have deserved and earned, by \ngiving them the seat at the table that they need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        National Guard Association\n\n\n                                   of the United States, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Guard Association of the \n     United States continues to support the critical changes that \n     were included in the National Defense Enhancement and \n     National Guard Empowerment Act of 2006. We appreciate your \n     efforts, along with Senator Bond, in introducing a new bill \n     in the Senate that incorporates these same areas of concern.\n       S. 2658 was a bold step in the last session to provide the \n     National Guard with an adequate voice in the deliberations of \n     the Department of Defense as together we meet the future \n     threats to the nation, both here at home and overseas.\n       As you know, NGAUS worked vigorously in 2006 to secure \n     passage of S. 2658 and we have continued that aggressive \n     support in hearings before the Commission on the National \n     Guard and Reserve. While we regret that their deliberations \n     have created some delay\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\n     in implementing these key solutions to National Guard issues \n     we remain hopeful that they too will recognize the wisdom \n     contained in the National Guard Empowerment Act of 2007.\n       Thank you for your assistance on behalf of the National \n     Guard. Please let us know how we may be of further assistance \n     in this endeavor.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Stephen M. Koper,\n\n                                          Brigadier General (Ret),\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 30, 2007.\n     Hon. Ben Nelson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       As you are most certainly aware the Adjutants General of \n     the 54 states, territories, and District of Columbia have \n     provided trained and ready National Guard forces to protect \n     the nation inside and outside of its borders in unprecedented \n     numbers since 9/11. Since then we have sought reform within \n     the Department of Defense for the National Guard to fully \n     transform from a strategic reserve to an operational reserve.\n       We are united in support of the National Guard Empowerment \n     Act of 2007. The legislation contains key elements that will \n     enhance the ability of the National Guard to equip and train \n     for its dual role missions. Elevating the Chief, National \n     Guard Bureau to four-star rank is needed to ensure \n     representation at the highest levels when addressing homeland \n     security and National Guard usage. Making the National Guard \n     Bureau a joint activity in DoD responds directly to White \n     House recommendations contained in its report on Hurricane \n     Katrina. A greater National Guard presence is needed at \n     USNORTHCOM. Your legislation does this by requiring the \n     deputy commander to be a National Guard general. Other \n     provisions deal with expanding opportunities for National \n     Guard leaders to compete for top level assignments. Finally, \n     the legislation focuses on identifying and correcting \n     critical gaps in resources needed to protect U.S. citizens.\n       Recent events have demonstrated again what we all already \n     know that the National Guard will continue to be needed at \n     unprecedented levels for missions impossible to contemplate. \n     The National Guard will be part of the build up in Iraq to \n     finally defeat terrorist and sectarian elements which will \n     require extraordinary sacrifices by families and employers. \n     The National Guard continues to assist in securing the \n     nation's southwest border.\n       The National Guard Empowerment Act of 2007 is comprehensive \n     and visionary. It acknowledges how the nature of warfare and \n     national security has changed and offers bold changes to \n     reshape military leadership to meet new threats. Testimony \n     from DoD's highest leaders to the Commission on National \n     Guard and Reserve in December indicates that no other plan is \n     in work to strengthen the voice of the National Guard in the \n     halls of the Pentagon.\n       You can count on support from the Adjutants General \n     Association of the United States in seeking critical changes \n     that will assure a strong National Guard ready to serve this \n     great nation domestically and fighting terrorism.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Roger P. Lempke,\n     Major General, President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       Eangus,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, January 25, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       The Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the \n     United States (EANGUS) is the only military service \n     association that represents the interests of every enlisted \n     soldier and airmen in the Army and Air National Guard. With a \n     constituency base of over 414,000 soldiers and airmen, their \n     families, and a large retiree membership, EANGUS engages \n     Capitol Hill on behalf of courageous Guard persons across \n     this nation.\n       On behalf of EANGUS, and the soldiers and airmen it \n     represents, I'd like to communicate our support for \n     legislation to elevate the position of Chief National Guard \n     Bureau to General, to place the Chief on the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, and to enhance the responsibilities of the Chief of \n     the National Guard Bureau and the functions of the National \n     Guard Bureau. For years, the Chief of the National Guard \n     Bureau, and the National Guard as a whole, has deliberately \n     been in the shallow end of the resource pool, bearing the \n     brunt of budget cuts to the Army and Air Force, and having to \n     ``take it out of hide'' to accomplish federal and state \n     missions that were required by statute but not fully funded \n     by the services or Department of Defense.\n       Our association stands firm in support of Congressional \n     action to remedy this long-endured and untenable situation. \n     The lack of trust and respect of the National Guard by DOD \n     political and military leaders, as well as the service \n     secretaries, the consistent under-funding of National Guard \n     appropriations accounts, and the intentional lack of \n     communication and coordination all have the probability of \n     being rectified by this legislation by making the National \n     Guard a full player in the decision-making and appropriations \n     process.\n       Thank you for taking legislative action that is not only \n     timely, but unfortunately necessary, and long overdue. We \n     look forward to working with your staff as this legislation \n     works its way into law.\n       Working for America's Best!\n                                  MSG Michael P. Cline, USA (Ret),\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 431. A bill to require convicted sex offenders to register online \nidentifiers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nSchumer, in sponsoring the ``Keeping the Internet Devoid of Sexual-\nPredators Act of 2007,'' otherwise known as the KIDS Act. This bill \nwould require a convicted sex offender to register any e-mail address, \ninstant message address or other similar Internet identifying \ninformation the sex offender uses or may use with the Department of \nJustice's National Sex Offender Registry. This information would then \nbe made available to commercial social networking websites for the \npurpose of screening the website's user database to ensure convicted \nsex offenders are not using the website to prey on innocent children.\n  The Internet is likely the greatest invention of the 21st century; \nhowever, it has also brought ready access to millions of children by \nwould be pedophiles. There are thousands of social networking websites \nand chat rooms where children post personal information about \nthemselves hoping to connect with other children. Many children who \naccess the Internet in a safe environment, such as their home or \nschool, combined with the natural trust of a child, forget that they \nare sharing personal information with complete strangers. This allows \nstrangers that a child would likely never speak with in the ``real \nworld'' to prey on children more easily.\n  In a Pew Internet and American Life survey released earlier this \nmonth, 55 percent of adolescents polled said they have posted a profile \non a social networking website, and 48 percent of adolescents polled \nsay they visit a social networking website every day. These statistics \nprove that the fight to protect our children from sexual predators has \nmoved from the playground to the Internet.\n  For this reason, Senator Schumer and I are introducing legislation \nthat would enable social networking websites to protect their young \nusers from convicted sex offenders. By requiring sex offenders to \nregister e-mail addresses and other Internet identifying information \nwith the Department of Justice, and allowing the Department to offer \nthis information to commercial social networking websites, Congress is \nproviding websites with the tools to come forth with innovative \nsolutions to protect children. A similar proposal was included in S. \n4089, the Stop the Exploitation of Our Children Act of 2006, which I \nintroduced on December 6, 2006.\n  According to the same Pew Internet and American life survey, fully 85 \npercent of adolescents who have created an online profile say the \nprofile they use or update most often is on MySpace, while 7 percent \nupdate a profile on Facebook. Consequently, I am pleased to report that \nboth MySpace and Facebook endorse the KIDS Act. I look forward to other \ncommercial social networking websites endorsing the bill and using the \nregistry information after the bill is signed into law. Additionally, \nthe bill is endorsed by the American Family Association. We all know \nthat engaged parents are the best deterrent against sexual predators \nlooking to prey on our children on the Internet. Parents that monitor \ntheir children's access to the Internet or are present when the child \nor adolescent is on-line are able to better ensure their children are \nnot drawn into inappropriate online conversations with sexual \npredators.\n  Last week I received an e-mail from a police detective who \ninvestigates Internet sex crimes in Ohio. The detective gave his full \nendorsement for this legislation stating, ``What a great idea . . . \n[Congress] continues to arm us with great legislation to help protect \nour nation's children.'' I agree and\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\nhope my colleagues will join with Senator Schumer and me in supporting \nthis bill to give websites and law enforcement this important tool in \ntheir fight to protect our children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA:\n  S. 433. A bill to state United States policy for Iraq, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, there are countless reasons that the \nAmerican people have lost confidence in the President's Iraq policy, \nbut chief among them has been the Administration's insistence on making \npromises and assurances about progress and victory that have no basis \nwhatsoever in the reality of the facts on the ground.\n  We have been told that we would be greeted as liberators. We have \nbeen promised that the insurgency was in its last throes. We have been \nassured again and again that we were making progress, that the Iraqis \nwould soon stand up, that our brave sons and daughters could soon stand \ndown. We have been asked to wait, and asked to be patient, and asked to \ngive the President and the new Iraqi government six more months, and \nthen six more months after that, and then six more months after that.\n  Despite all of this, a change of course still seemed possible. Back \nin November, the American people had voted for a new direction in Iraq. \nSecretary Rumsfeld was on his way out at the Pentagon. The Iraq Study \nGroup was poised to offer a bipartisan consensus. The President was \nconducting his own review. After years of missteps and mistakes, it was \ntime for a responsible policy grounded in reality, not ideology.\n  Instead, the President ignored the counsel of expert civilians and \nexperienced soldiers, the hard-won consensus of prominent Republicans \nand Democrats, and the clear will of the American people.\n  The President's decision to move forward with this escalation anyway, \ndespite all evidence and military advice to the contrary, is the \nterrible consequence of the decision to give him the broad, open-ended \nauthority to wage this war in 2002. Over four years later, we cannot \nrevisit that decision or reverse its outcome, but we can do what we \ndidn't back then and refuse to give this President more open-ended \nauthority for this war.\n  The U.S. military has performed valiantly and brilliantly in Iraq. \nOur troops have done all we have asked them to do and more. But no \nquantity of American soldiers can solve the political differences at \nthe heart of somebody else's civil war, nor settle the grievances in \nthe hearts of the combatants.\n  I cannot in good conscience support this escalation. As the \nPresident's own military commanders have said, escalation only prevents \nthe Iraqis from taking more responsibility for their own future. It's \neven eroding our efforts in the wider war on terror, as some of the \nextra soldiers could come directly from Afghanistan, where the Taliban \nhas become resurgent.\n  The course the President is pursuing fails to recognize the \nfundamental reality that the solution to the violence in Iraq is \npolitical, not military. He has offered no evidence that more U.S. \ntroops will be able to pressure Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds towards the \nnecessary political settlement, and he's attached no conditions or \nconsequences to his plan should the Iraqis fail to make progress.\n  In fact, just a few weeks ago, when I repeatedly asked Secretary Rice \nwhat would happen if the Iraqi government failed to meet the benchmarks \nthat the Administration has called for, she could not give me an \nanswer. When I asked her if there were any circumstances whatsoever in \nwhich we would tell the Iraqis that their failure to make progress \nwould mean the end of our military commitment, she still could not give \nme an answer.\n  This is not good enough. When you ask how many more months and how \nmany more lives it will take to end a policy that everyone knows has \nfailed, ``I don't know'' isn't good enough.\n  Over the past four years, we have given this Administration chance \nafter chance to get this right, and they have disappointed us so many \ntimes. That is why Congress now has the duty to prevent even more \nmistakes. Today, I am introducing legislation that rejects this policy \nof escalation, and implements a comprehensive approach that will \npromote stability in Iraq, protect our interests in the region, and \nbring this war to a responsible end.\n  My legislation essentially puts into law the speech I gave in \nNovember, 2006, and is, I believe, the best strategy for going forward.\n  The bill implements--with the force of law--a responsible \nredeployment of our forces out of Iraq, not a precipitous withdrawal. \nIt implements key recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. \nIt applies real leverage on the Iraqis to reach the political solution \nnecessary to end the sectarian violence that is tearing Iraq apart. It \nholds the Iraqi government accountable, making continued U.S. support \nconditional on concrete Iraqi progress. It respects the role of \nmilitary commanders, while fulfilling Congress's responsibility to \nuphold the Constitution and heed the will of the American people.\n  First, this legislation caps the number of U.S. troops in Iraq at the \nnumber in Iraq on January 10, 2007--the day the President gave his \n``surge speech'' to the nation. This cap could not be lifted without \nexplicit authorization by the Congress.\n  Yet our responsibilities to the American people and to our servicemen \nand women go beyond opposing this ill-conceived escalation. We must \nfashion a comprehensive strategy to accomplish what the President's \nsurge fails to do: pressure the Iraqi government to reach a political \nsettlement, protect our interests in the region, and bring this war to \na responsible end.\n  That is why my legislation commences a phased redeployment of U.S. \ntroops to begin on May 1, 2007 with a goal of having all combat \nbrigades out of Iraq by March 31, 2008, a date that is consistent with \nthe expectation of the Iraq Study Group. The legislation provides \nexceptions for force protection, counterterrorism, and training of \nIraqi security forces.\n  To press the Iraqi government to act, this drawdown can be suspended \nfor 90-day periods if the President certifies and the Congress agrees \nthat the Iraqi government is meeting specific benchmarks and the \nsuspension is in the national security interests of the United States. \nThese benchmarks include: Meeting security responsibilities. The Iraqi \ngovernment must deploy brigades it promised to Baghdad, lift \nrestrictions on the operations of the U.S. military, and make \nsignificant progress toward assuming full responsibility for the \nsecurity of Iraq's provinces. Cracking down on sectarian violence. The \nIraqi government must make significant progress toward reducing the \nsize and influence of sectarian militias, and the presence of militia \nelements within the Iraqi Security Forces. Advancing national \nreconciliation. The Iraqi government must pass legislation to share oil \nrevenues equitably; revise de-Baathification to enable more Iraqis to \nreturn to government service; hold provisional elections by the end of \nthe year; and amend the Constitution in a manner that sustains \nreconciliation. Making economic progress. The Iraqi government must \nmake available at least $10,000,000,000 for reconstruction, job \ncreation, and economic development as it has promised to do. The \nallocation of these resources, the provision of services, and the \nadministration of Iraqi Ministries must not proceed on a sectarian \nbasis.\n  These benchmarks reflect actions proposed by the President and \npromised by the Iraqi government. It is time to hold them accountable.\n  Recognizing that the President has not been straightforward with the \nAmerican people about the war in Iraq, my legislation allows the \nCongress--under expedited procedures--to overrule a Presidential \ncertification and continue the redeployment.\n  Time and again, we have seen deadlines for Iraqi actions come and \ngo--with no consequences. Time and again we have heard pledges of \nprogress from the administration--followed by a descent into chaos. The \ncommitment of U.S. troops to Iraq represents our best leverage to press \nthe Iraqis to act. And the further commitment of U.S. economic \nassistance to the Government of Iraq must be conditional on Iraqi \naction.\n  As the U.S. drawdown proceeds, my legislation outlines how U.S. \ntroops\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\nshould be redeployed back to the United States and to other points in \nthe region. In the region, we need to maintain a substantial over-the-\nhorizon force to prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider \nwar, to reassure our allies, and to protect our interests. And we \nshould redeploy forces to Afghanistan, so we not just echo--but \nanswer--NATO's call for more troops in this critical fight against \nterrorism.\n  Within Iraq, we may need to maintain a residual troop presence to \nprotect U.S. personnel and facilities, go after international \nterrorists, and continue training efforts. My legislation allows for \nthese critical but narrow exceptions as the redeployment proceeds and \nis ultimately completed.\n  My legislation makes it U.S. policy to undertake a comprehensive \ndiplomatic strategy to promote a political solution within Iraq, and to \nprevent wider regional strife. This diplomatic effort must include our \nfriends in the region, but it should also include Syria and Iran, who \nneed to be part of the conversation about stabilizing Iraq. Not talking \nis getting us nowhere. Not talking is not making us more secure, nor is \nit weakening our adversaries.\n  The President should appoint a special envoy with responsibility to \nimplement this regional engagement. And as we go forward, we must make \nit clear that redeployment does not mean disengagement from the region. \nOn the contrary, it is time for a more comprehensive engagement that \nskillfully uses all tools of American power.\n  Finally, my legislation compels the President to formulate a strategy \nto prevent the war in Iraq from becoming a wider conflagration.\n  Let me conclude by saying that there are no good options in Iraq. We \ncannot undo the mistake of that congressional authorization, or the \ntragedies of the last four years.\n  Just as I have been constant in my strong opposition to this war, I \nhave consistently believed that opposition must be responsible. As \nreckless as we were in getting into Iraq, we have to be as careful \ngetting out. We have significant strategic interests in Iraq and the \nregion. We have a humanitarian responsibility to help the Iraqi people. \nAbove all, we have an obligation to support our courageous men and \nwomen in uniform--and their families back home--who have sacrificed \nbeyond measure.\n  It is my firm belief that the responsible course of action--for the \nUnited States, for Iraq, and for our troops--is to oppose this reckless \nescalation and to pursue a new policy. This policy is consistent with \nwhat I have advocated for well over a year, with many of the \nrecommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and with what the \nAmerican people demanded in November.\n  When it comes to the war in Iraq, the time for promises and \nassurances, for waiting and patience, is over. Too many lives have been \nlost and too many billions have been spent for us to trust the \nPresident on another tried and failed policy opposed by generals and \nexperts, Democrats and Republicans, Americans and even the Iraqis \nthemselves. It is time to change our policy. It is time to give Iraqis \ntheir country back. And it is time to refocus America's efforts on the \nwider struggle against terror yet to be won.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Reed, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 434. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \npermit qualifying States to use a portion of their allotments under the \nState children's health insurance program for any fiscal year for \ncertain Medicaid expenditures; to the Committee on Finance.\n   Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since the passage of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, or CHIP, in 1997, a group of States that \nexpanded coverage to children in Medicaid prior to the enactment of \nCHIP has been unfairly penalized for that expansion. States are not \nallowed to use the enhanced matching rate available to other States for \nchildren at similar levels of poverty under the act. As a result, a \nchild in the States of New York, Florida, and Pennsylvania, because \nthey were grandfathered in the original act or in Iowa, Montana, or a \nnumber of other States at 134 percent of poverty is eligible for an \nenhanced matching rate in CHIP but that has not been the case for \nStates such as New Mexico, Vermont, Washington, Rhode Island, Hawaii, \nand a number of others, including Connecticut, Tennessee, Minnesota, \nNew Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Maryland.\n  As the health policy statement by the National Governors' Association \nreads, ``The Governors believe that it is critical that innovative \nstates not be penalized for having expanded coverage to children before \nthe enactment of S-CHIP, which provides enhanced funding to meet these \ngoals. To this end, the Governors support providing additional funding \nflexibility to states that had already significantly expanded coverage \nof the majority of uninsured children in their states.''\n  For 6 years, our group of States have sought to have this inequity \naddressed. Early in 2003, I introduced the ``Children's Health Equity \nof 2003'' with Senators Jeffords, Murray, Leahy, and Ms. Cantwell and \nwe worked successfully to get a compromise worked out for inclusion in \nS. 312 by Senators Rockefeller, and Chafee. This compromise extended \nexpiring CHIP allotments only for fiscal years 1998 through 2001 in \norder to meet budgetary caps.\n  The compromise allowed States to be able to use up to 20 percent of \nour State's CHIP allotments to pay for Medicaid eligible children about \n150 percent of poverty that were part of our State's expansions \nprior,to the enactment of CHIP. That language was maintained in \nconference and included in H.R. 2854 that was signed by the President \nas Public Law 108-74. Unfortunately, a slight change was made in the \nconference language that excluded New Mexico and Hawaii, Maryland, and \nRhode Island needed specific changes so an additional bill was passed, \nH.R. 3288, and signed into law as Public Law 108-107, on November 17, \n2003. This second bill included language from legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Domenici, S. 1547, to address the problem \ncaused to New Mexico by the conference committee's change. \nUnfortunately, one major problem with the compromise was that it must \nbe periodically reauthorized. Most recently, this authority was renewed \nthrough Fiscal Year 2007 in Section 201(b) of the National Institutes \nof Health Reform Act of 2006, Pub. L. No 109-482. Without future \nauthority, the inequity would continue with CHIP allotments.\n  This legislation would address that problem and ensure that all \nfuture allotments give these 11 States the flexibility to use up to 20 \npercent of our CHIP allotments to pay for health care services of \nchildren. In order to bring these requirements in-line with those of \nother states, it also would lower the threshold at which New Mexico and \nother effected states could utilize the funds from 150 percent of the \nFederal poverty level to 125 percent.\n  This rather technical issue has real and negative consequences in \nStates such as New Mexico. In fact, due to the CHIP inequity, New \nMexico has been allocated $266 million from CHIP between fiscal years \n1998 and 2002, and yet, has only been able to spend slightly over $26 \nmillion as of the end of last fiscal year. In other words, New Mexico \nhas been allowed to spend less than 10 percent of its federal CHIP \nallocations.\n  This legislation would correct this problem.\n  The bill does not take money from other States's CHIP allotments. It \nsimply allows our States to spend our States' specific CHIP allotments \nfrom the Federal Government on our uninsured children--just as other \nStates across the country are doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 434\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to preserve the \nessential air service program; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with 12 other senators to \nintroduce the bipartisan Essential Air Service Preservation Act of \n2007. I am pleased again to have my colleague Senator Snowe as the \nprincipal cosponsor of the bill. Senator Snowe has been a long-time \nchampion of commercial air service in rural areas, and I appreciate her \ncontinued leadership on this important legislation. Senators Dorgan, \nEnzi, Collins, Hagel, Harkin, Schumer, Leahy, Levin, Specter, Ben \nNelson, and Sanders are also cosponsors of the bill.\n  Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to \nensure that communities that had commercial air service before airline \nderegulation would continue to receive scheduled service. Without EAS, \nmany rural communities would have no commercial air service at all.\n  Our bill is very simple. It preserves Congress' intent in the \nEssential Air Service program by repealing a provision in the 2003 FAA \nreauthorization bill that would for the first time require communities \nto pay for their commercial air service. The legislation that imposed \nmandatory cost sharing on communities to retain their commercial air \nservice had been stricken from both the House and Senate versions of \nthe FAA reauthorization bill, but was reinserted by conferees. I \nbelieve that any program that forces communities to pay to continue to \nreceive their commercial air service could well be the first step in \nthe total elimination of scheduled air service for many rural \ncommunities.\n  In response, every year since mandatory cost sharing was enacted \nCongress has blocked it from being implemented. Since 2003, a \nbipartisan group of senators have included language in each of the \nDepartment of Transportation's appropriations acts that bars the use of \nfunds to implement the mandatory cost sharing program. Our bill would \nsimply make Congress' ongoing ban permanent.\n  All across America, small communities face ever-increasing hurdles to \npromoting their economic growth and development. Today, many rural \nareas lack access to interstate or even four-lane highways, railroads \nor broadband telecommunications. Business development in rural areas \nfrequently hinges on the availability of scheduled air service. For \nsmall communities, commercial air service provides a critical link to \nthe national and international transportation system.\n  The Essential Air Service Program currently ensures commercial air \nservice to over 100 communities in thirty-five States. EAS supports an \nadditional 39 communities in Alaska. Because of increasing costs and \nthe continuing financial turndown in the aviation industry, \nparticularly among commuter airlines, about 40 additional communities \nhave been forced into the EAS program since the terrorist attacks in \n2001.\n  In my State of New Mexico, five cities currently rely on EAS for \ntheir commercial air service. The communities are Clovis, Hobbs, \nCarlsbad, Alamogordo and my hometown of Silver City. In each case \ncommercial service is provided to Albuquerque, the State's business \ncenter and largest city.\n  I believe this ill-conceived proposal requiring cities to pay to \ncontinue to have commercial air service could not come at a worse time \nfor small communities already facing depressed economies and declining \ntax revenues.\n  As I understand it, the mandatory cost-sharing requirements could \naffect communities in as many as 22 states. These communities could be \nforced to pay as much s $130,000 per year to maintain their current air \nservice. Based on an analysis by my staff, the individual cities that \ncould be affected are as follows:\n\n       Alabama, Muscle Shoals; Arizona, Prescott, Kingman; \n     Arkansas, Hot Springs, Harrison, Jonesboro; California, \n     Merced, Visalia; Colorado, Pueblo; Georgia, Athens; Iowa, \n     Fort Dodge, Burlington; Kansas, Salina; Kentucky, Owensboro; \n     Maine, Augusta, Rockland; Maryland, Hagerstown; Michigan, \n     Iron Mt.; Mississippi, Laurel; Missouri, Joplin, Ft. Leonard \n     Wood; New Hampshire, Lebanon; New Mexico, Hobbs, Alamogordo, \n     Clovis; New York, Watertown, Jamestown, Plattsburgh; \n     Pennsylvania, Johnstown, Oil City, Bradford, Altoona, \n     Lancaster; South Dakota, Brookings, Watertown; Tennessee, \n     Jackson; Vermont, Rutland; West Virginia, Clarksburg/\n     Fairmont, Morgantown.\n\n  This year the Senate Commerce Committee and its Aviation Subcommittee \nwill be taking up the reauthorization of aviation programs. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues Chairmen Inouye and Rockefeller \nand Ranking Members Stevens and Lott to improve commercial air service \nprograms for rural areas. I do believe our bill is one important step \nin that process.\n  As I see it, the choice here is clear: If we do not preserve the \nEssential Air Service Program today, we could soon see the end of all \ncommercial air service in rural areas. The EAS program provides vital \nresources that help link rural communities to the national and global \naviation system. Our bill will preserve the essential air service \nprogram and help ensure that affordable, reliable, and safe air service \nremains available in rural America. Congress is already on record \nopposing any mandatory cost sharing. I hope all senators will once \nagain join us in opposing this attack on rural America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nBingaman, to introduce the bipartisan Essential Air Service \nPreservation Act. I am proud to join with Senator Bingaman, who has \nbeen a steadfast and resolute guardian of commercial aviation service \nto all communities, particularly rural areas that would otherwise be \ndeprived of any air service.\n  I have always believed that reliable air service in our Nation's \nrural areas is not simply a luxury or a convenience. It is an \nimperative. It is a critical element of economic development, vital to \nmove people and goods to and from areas that may otherwise have \ndramatically limited transportation options. Quite frankly, I have long \nheld serious concerns about the impact deregulation of the airline \nindustry has had on small- and medium-size cities in rural areas, like \nMaine. That fact is, since deregulation, many small- and medium-size \ncommunities, in Maine and elsewhere, have experienced a decrease in \nflights and size of aircraft while seeing an increase in fares. More \nthan 300 have lost air service altogether.\n  This legislation will strike a detrimental provision in the 2003 \nFederal Aviation Reauthorization. This provision, which would require \ncommunities to actually pay to continue to participate in a program \nthat already acknowledges their economic hardship, is patently unfair. \nIgnoring the promise of the EAS, to protect these communities after \nderegulating the airlines in 1978, is not an option. Our colleagues \nhave clearly greed with our position, as this provision has been struck \ndown in every appropriations bill since the passage of the 2003 \nreauthorization. Our bill would make this prohibition permanent.\n  EAS-eligible communities typically have financial problems of their \nown and rely heavily on the program for economic development purposes. \nIt is obvious to me, Senator Bingaman, and many of my colleagues, that \nif the 2003 proposal were enacted, it would mean the end of EAS service \nin dozens of cities and towns across the country. In Maine, which has \nfour participants in the integral EAS program, we would suffer the \npossible loss of half of our EAS airports. In a small, rural State like \nMaine, such a reduction would be disastrous to our economy. That is why\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nI feel compelled to reintroduce this legislation.\n  In closing, the truth is, everyone benefits when our Nation is at its \nstrongest economically. Most importantly in this case, greater \nprosperity everywhere, including in rural America, will, in the long \nrun, mean more passengers for the airlines. Therefore, it is very much \nin our national interests to ensure that every region has reasonable \naccess to air service. And that's why I strongly believe the Federal \nGovernment has an obligation to fulfill the commitment it made to these \ncommunities in 1978 to safeguard their ability to continue commercial \nair service.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 435\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Essential Air Service \n     Preservation Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF EAS LOCAL PARTICIPATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 417 of title 49, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking section 41747, and \n     such title shall be applied as if such section 41747 had not \n     been enacted.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The chapter analysis at the \n     beginning of such chapter is amended by striking the item \n     relating to section 41747.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 436. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reform \nthe system of public financing for Presidential elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will introduce a bill to repair \nand strengthen the presidential public financing system. The \nPresidential Funding Act of 2007 will ensure that this system will \ncontinue to fulfill its promise in the 21st century. The bill will take \neffect in January 2009, so it will first apply in the 2012 presidential \nelection.\n  The presidential public financing system was put into place in the \nwake of the Watergate scandals as part of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct of 1974. It was held to be constitutional by the Supreme Court in \nBuckley v. Valeo. The system, of course, is voluntary, as the Supreme \nCourt required in Buckley. Every major party nominee for President \nsince 1976 has participated in the system for the general election and, \nprior to 2000, every major party nominee had participated in the system \nfor the primary election, too. In the last election, President Bush and \ntwo Democratic candidates, Howard Dean and the eventual nominee John \nKerry, opted out of the system for the presidential primaries. \nPresident Bush and Senator Kerry elected to take the taxpayer-funded \ngrant in the general election. President Bush also opted out of the \nsystem for the Republican primaries in 2000 but took the general \nelection grant.\n  It is unfortunate that the matching funds system for the primaries \nhas become less practicable. The system protects the integrity of the \nelectoral process by allowing candidates to run viable campaigns \nwithout becoming overly dependent on private donors. The system has \nworked well in the past, and it is worth repairing so that it can work \nin the future. If we don't repair it, the pressures on candidates to \nopt out will increase until the system collapses from disuse.\n  This bill makes changes to both the primary and general election \npublic financing system to address the weaknesses and problems that \nhave been identified by participants in the system, experts on the \npresidential election financing process, and an electorate that is \nincreasingly dismayed by the influence of money in politics. First and \nmost important, it eliminates the State-by-State spending limits in the \ncurrent law and substantially increases the overall spending limit from \nthe current limit of approximately $45 million to $150 million, of \nwhich up to $100 million can be spent before April 1 of the election \nyear. This should make the system much more viable for serious \ncandidates facing opponents who are capable of raising significant sums \noutside the system. The bill also makes available substantially more \npublic money for participating candidates by increasing the match of \nsmall contributions from 1:1 to 4:1.\n  One very important provision of this bill ties the primary and \ngeneral election systems together and requires candidates to make a \nsingle decision on whether to participate. Candidates who opt out of \nthe primary system and decide to rely solely on private money cannot \nreturn to the system for the general election. And candidates must \ncommit to participate in the system in the general election if they \nwant to receive Federal matching funds in the primaries. The bill also \nincreases the spending limits for participating candidates in the \nprimaries who face a nonparticipating opponent if that opponent raises \nmore than 20 percent more than the spending limit. This provides some \nprotection against being far outspent by a nonparticipating opponent. \nAdditional grants of public money are also available to participating \ncandidates who face a nonparticipating candidate spending substantially \nmore than the spending limit.\n  The bill also sets the general election spending limit at $100 \nmillion, indexed for inflation. And if a general election candidate \ndoes not participate in the system and spends more than 20 percent more \nthan the combined primary and general election spending limits, a \nparticipating candidate will receive a grant equal to twice the general \nelection spending limit.\n  This bill also addresses what some have called the ``gap'' between \nthe primary and general election seasons. Presumptive presidential \nnominees have emerged earlier in the election year over the life of the \npublic financing system. This has led to some nominees being \nessentially out of money between the time that they nail down the \nnomination and the convention where they are formally nominated and \nbecome eligible for the general election grant. For a few cycles, soft \nmoney raised by the parties filled in that gap, but the Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 fortunately has now closed that loophole. \nThis bill allows candidates who are still in the primary race as of \nApril 1 to spend an additional $50 million. In addition, the bill \nallows the political parties to spend up to $25 million between April 1 \nand the date that a candidate is nominated and an additional $25 \nmillion after the nomination. The total amount of $50 million is over \nthree times the amount allowed under current law. This should allow any \ngap to be more than adequately filled.\n  Obviously, these changes make this a more generous system. So the \nbill also makes the requirement for qualifying more difficult. To be \neligible for matching funds, a candidate must raise $25,000 in \nmatchable contributions--up to $200 for each donor--in at least 20 \nStates. That is five times the threshold under current law.\n  The bill also makes a number of changes in the system to reflect the \nchanges in our presidential races over the past several decades. For \none thing, it makes matching funds available starting six months before \nthe date of the first primary or caucus, that's approximately 6 months \nearlier than is currently the case. For another, it sets a single date \nfor release of the public grants for the general election--the Friday \nbefore Labor Day. This addresses an inequity in the current system, \nunder which the general election grants are released after each \nnominating convention, which can be several weeks apart.\n  The bill also prohibits federal elected officials and candidates from \nsoliciting soft money for use in funding the party and requires \npresidential candidates to disclose bundled contributions. Additional \nprovisions, and those I have discussed in summary form here, are \nexplained in a section-by-section analysis of the bill that I ask \nunanimous consent to be printed in the Record, following my statement. \nI will also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill itself be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The purpose of this bill is to improve the campaign finance system, \nnot to advance one party's interests. In fact, this is an excellent \ntime to make changes in the Presidential public funding system. The \n2008 presidential campaign, which is already underway, will undoubtedly \nbe the most expensive in history. It is likely that a number of \ncandidates from both parties will once again opt out of the primary \nmatching funds system, and some experts predict that one or both major \nparty nominees will even refuse public grants for the\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\ngeneral election period. It is too late to make the changes needed to \nrepair the system for the 2008 election. But if we act now, we can make \nsure that an updated and revised system is in place for the 2012 \nelection. If we act now, I am certain that the 2008 campaign cycle will \nconfirm our foresight. If we do nothing, 2008 will continue and \naccelerate the slide of the current system into irrelevancy.\n  Fixing the presidential public financing system will cost money, but \nour best calculations at the present time indicate that the changes to \nthe system in this bill can be paid for by raising the income tax \ncheck-off on an individual return from $3 to just $10. The total cost \nof the changes to the system, based on data from the 2004 elections, is \nprojected to be around $360 million over the 4-year election cycle. To \noffset that increased cost, this bill caps taxpayer subsidies for \npromotion of agricultural products, including some brand-name goods, by \nlimiting the Market Access Program to $100 million per year.\n  Though the numbers are large, this is actually a very small \ninvestment to make to protect our democracy and preserve the integrity \nof our presidential elections. The American people do not want to see a \nreturn to the pre-Watergate days of unlimited spending on presidential \nelections and candidates entirely beholden to private donors. We must \nact now to ensure the fairness of our elections and the confidence of \nour citizens in the process by repairing the cornerstone of the \nWatergate reforms.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Presidential Funding Act of 2006--Section by Section Analysis\n\n\n                         SECTION 1: SHORT TITLE\n\n    SECTION 2: REVISIONS TO SYSTEM OF PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY MATCHING \n                                PAYMENTS\n\n       (a) Matching Funds: Current law provides for a 1-to-1 \n     match, where up to $250 of each individual's contributions \n     for the primaries is matched with $250 in public funds. Under \n     the new matching system, individual contributions of up to \n     $200 from each individual will be matched at a 4-to-l ratio, \n     so $200 in individual contributions can be matched with $800 \n     from public funds.\n       Candidates who remain in the primary race can also receive \n     an additional 1-to-1 match of up to $200 of contributions \n     received after March 31 of a presidential election year. This \n     additional match applies both to an initial contribution made \n     after March 31 and to contributions from individuals who \n     already gave $200 or more prior to April 1.\n       The bill defines ``contribution'' as ``a gift of money made \n     by a written instrument which identifies the person making \n     the contribution by full name and mailing address.''\n       (b) Eligibility for matching funds: Current law requires \n     candidates to raise $5,000 in matchable contributions \n     (currently $250 or less) in 20 states. To be eligible for \n     matching funds under this bill, a candidate must raise \n     $25,000 of matchable contributions (up to $200 per individual \n     donor) in at least 20 states.\n       In addition, to receive matching funds in the primary, \n     candidates must pledge to apply for public money in the \n     general election if nominated and to not exceed the general \n     election spending limits.\n       (c) Timing of payments: Current law makes matching funds \n     available on January 1 of a presidential election year. The \n     bill makes such funds available six months prior to the first \n     state caucus or primary.\n\n\n    SECTION 3: REQUIRING PARTICIPATION IN PRIMARY PAYMENT SYSTEM AS \n        CONDITION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR GENERAL ELECTIONS PAYMENTS\n\n       Currently, candidates can participate in either the primary \n     or the general election public financing system, or both. \n     Under the bill, a candidate must participate in the primary \n     matching system in order to be eligible to receive public \n     funds in the general election.\n\n\n               SECTION 4: REVISIONS TO EXPENDITURE LIMITS\n\n       (a) Spending limits for candidates: In 2004, under current \n     law, candidates participating in the public funding system \n     had to abide by a primary election spending limit of about \n     $45 million and a general election spending limit of about \n     $75 million (all of which was public money). The bill sets a \n     total primary spending ceiling for participating candidates \n     in 2008 of $150 million, of which only $100 million can be \n     spent before April 1. State by state spending limits are \n     eliminated. The general election limit, which the major party \n     candidates will receive in public funds, will be $100 \n     million.\n       (b) Spending limit for parties: Current law provides a \n     single coordinated spending limit for national party \n     committees based on population. In 2004 that limit was about \n     $15 million. The bill provides two limits of $25 million. The \n     first applies after April 1 until a candidate is nominated. \n     The second limit kicks in after the nomination. Any part of \n     the limit not spent before the nomination can be spent after. \n     In addition, the party coordinated spending limit is \n     eliminated entirely until the general election public funds \n     are released if there is an active candidate from the \n     opposing party who has exceeded the primary spending limits \n     by more than 20 percent.\n       This will allow the party to support the presumptive \n     nominee during the so-called ``gap'' between the end of the \n     primaries and the conventions. The entire cost of a \n     coordinated party communication is subject to the limit if \n     any portion of that communication has to do with the \n     presidential election.\n       (c) Inflation adjustment: Party and candidate spending \n     limits will be indexed for inflation, with 2008 as the base \n     year.\n       (d) Fundraising expenses: Under the bill, all the costs of \n     fundraising by candidates are subject to their spending \n     limits.\n\n\n SECTION 5: ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS AND INCREASED EXPENDITURES LIMITS FOR \n     CANDIDATES PARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC FINANCING WHO FACE CERTAIN \n                       NONPARTICIPATING OPPONENTS\n\n       (a) Primary candidates: When a participating candidate is \n     opposed in a primary by a nonparticipating candidate who \n     spends more than 120 percent of the primary spending limit \n     ($100 million prior to April 1 and $150 million after April \n     1), the participating candidate will receive a 5-to-1 match, \n     instead of a 4-to-1 match for contributions of less than $200 \n     per donor. That additional match applies to all contributions \n     received by the participating candidate both before and after \n     the nonparticipating candidate crosses the 120 percent \n     threshold. In addition, the participating candidate's primary \n     spending limit is raised by $50 million when a \n     nonparticipating candidate raise spends more than the 120 \n     percent of either the $100 million (before April 1) or $150 \n     million (after April 1) limit. The limit is raised by another \n     $50 million if the nonparticipating candidate spends more \n     than 120 percent of the increased limit. Thus, the maximum \n     spending limit in the primary would be $250 million if an \n     opposing candidate has spent more than $240 million.\n       (b) General election candidates: When a participating \n     candidate is opposed in a general election by a \n     nonparticipating candidate who spends more than 120 percent \n     of the combined primary and general election spending limits, \n     the participating candidate shall receive an additional \n     grant of public money equal to the amount provided for \n     that election--$100 million in 2008. Minor party \n     candidates are also eligible for an additional grant equal \n     to the amount they otherwise receive (which is based on \n     the performance of that party in the previous presidential \n     election).\n       (c) Reporting and Certification: In order to provide for \n     timely determination of a participating candidate's \n     eligibility for increased spending limits, matching funds, \n     and/or general election grants, non-participating candidates \n     must notify the FEC within 24 hours after receiving \n     contributions or making expenditures of greater than the \n     applicable 120 percent threshold. Within 24 hours of \n     receiving such a notice, the FEC will inform candidates \n     participating in the system of their increased expenditure \n     limits and will certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that \n     participating candidates are eligible to receive additional \n     payments.\n\n\n SECTION 6: ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIFORM DATE FOR RELEASE OF PAYMENTS FROM \n      PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO ELIGIBLE CANDIDATES\n\n       Under current law, candidates participating in the system \n     for the general election receive their grants of public money \n     immediately after receiving the nomination of their party, \n     meaning that the two major parties receive their grants on \n     different dates. Under the bill, all candidates eligible to \n     receive public money in the general election would receive \n     that money on the Friday before Labor Day, unless a \n     candidate's formal nomination occurs later.\n\n\n     SECTION 7: REVISIONS TO DESIGNATION OF INCOME TAX PAYMENTS BY \n                          INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS\n\n       The tax check-off is increased from $3 (individual) and $6 \n     (couple) to $10 and $20. The amount will be adjusted for \n     inflation, and rounded to the nearest dollar, beginning in \n     2009.\n       The IRS shall require by regulation that electronic tax \n     preparation software does not automatically accept or decline \n     the tax checkoff. The FEC is required to inform and educate \n     the public about the purpose of the Presidential Election \n     Campaign Fund (``PECF'') and how to make a contribution. \n     Funding for this program of up to $10 million in a four year \n     presidential election cycle, will come from the PECF.\n\n\n       SECTION 8: AMOUNTS IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN FUND\n\n       Under current law, in January of an election year if the \n     Treasury Department determines that there are insufficient \n     funds in the PECF to make the required payments to \n     participating primary candidates, the party conventions, and \n     the general election candidates, it must reduce the payments \n     available to participating primary candidates and it cannot \n     make up the shortfall from any other source until those funds \n     come in. Under the bill, in making that determination the \n     Department can include an estimate of the amount that will be \n     received by the PECF during that election year, but the \n     estimate cannot exceed the past three years' average \n     contribution to the fund. This will allow primary candidates \n     to receive their\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\n     full payments as long as a reasonable estimate of the funds \n     that will come into the PECF that year will cover the general \n     election candidate payments. The bill allows the Secretary of \n     the Treasury to borrow the funds necessary to carry out the \n     purposes of the fund during the first campaign cycle in which \n     the bill is in effect.\n\n\nSECTION 9: REPEAL OF PRIORITY IN USE OF FUNDS FOR POLITICAL CONVENTIONS\n\n       Current law gives the political parties priority on \n     receiving the funds they are entitled to from the PECF. This \n     means that parties get money for their conventions even if \n     adequate funds are not available for participating \n     candidates. This section would make funds available for the \n     conventions only if all participating candidates have \n     received the funds to which they are entitled.\n\n\n             SECTION 10: REGULATION OF CONVENTION FINANCING\n\n       Federal candidates and officeholders are prohibited from \n     raising or spending soft money in connection with a \n     nominating convention of any political party, including funds \n     for a host committee, civic committee, or municipality.\n\n\n            SECTION 11: DISCLOSURE OF BUNDLED CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n       (a) Disclosure requirement: The authorized committees of \n     presidential candidate committee must report the name, \n     address, and occupation of each person making a bundled \n     contribution and the aggregate amount of bundled \n     contributions made by that person.\n       (b) Definition of bundled contribution. A bundled \n     contribution is a series of contributions totaling $10,000 or \n     more that are (1) collected by one person and transferred to \n     the candidate; or (2) delivered directly to the candidate \n     from the donor but include a written or oral communication \n     that the funds were ``solicited, arranged, or directed'' by \n     someone other than the donor. This covers the two most common \n     bundling arrangements where fundraisers get ``credit'' for \n     collecting contributions for a candidate.\n\n\n                           SECTION 12: OFFSET\n\n       This section provides an offset for the increased cost of \n     the presidential public funding system. It caps taxpayer \n     subsidies for promotion of agricultural products, including \n     some brand-named goods, by limiting the Market Access Program \n     to $100 million per year.\n\n\n                       SECTION 13: EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n       Provides that the amendments will apply to presidential \n     elections occurring after January 1, 2009.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 436\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of an A-12 Blackbird \naircraft to the Minnesota Air National Guard Historical Foundation; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to transfer \nownership of a 1960s A-12 Blackbird spy plane to the Minnesota Air \nNational Guard Historical Foundation.\n  The legislation will allow the A-12 to stay in the Minnesota Air \nNational Guard Museum and to be displayed for educational and other \nappropriate public purposes.\n  The A-12 Blackbird planes were in many ways the apex of jet design. \nNo known jet is believed to have flown faster--three times the speed of \nsound, or higher--above 90,000 feet. It is a landmark in the history of \naviation that will never be repeated again.\n  The Minnesota A-12, retired in 1968 and rescued by Minnesota \nvolunteers from a California scrap heap more than a decade ago, is \nhoused at the 133rd Airlift Wing of the Minneapolis-St. Paul \nInternational Airport. Almost fifteen thousand Minnesotans contributed \nto the restoration of the A-12 and the creation of the Blackbird \nprogram. Ever since, it has been the centerpiece of the Minnesota Air \nNational Guard Museum. The aircraft is the only A-12 currently used as \na hands-on educational resource with a group of highly trained \ninstructors who provide meaningful insight for the general public into \nthe aircraft's history and meaning.\n  This aircraft is of great significance not only to the volunteers who \nsacrificed time and resources to restore a great remnant of American \nhistory, but also to the citizens of Minnesota and around the country \nwho have benefited greatly from this knowledge of our military history.\n  Unfortunately, the A-12 is considered to be ``on loan'' from the U.S. \nAir Force, which recently has decided to transfer the plane to the CIA \nHeadquarters as part of the agency's 60th anniversary celebration. If \nthis plan goes ahead, the plane will no longer be available for public \nviewing.\n  Over the years, volunteers throughout Minnesota have generously \ndevoted their time and resources to maintaining this plane. To transfer \nthe plane away from the very people whose hard work has made the \naircraft what it is today is simply unfair. It is necessary that we \nretain this piece of Minnesota history, and keep the Blackbird in a \nplace where it will always be accessible to the public. I hope the \nSenate will be able to act on this legislation and help to save a \nsignificant piece of history.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill I introduce today, to provide \nfor the conveyance of an A-12 Blackbird aircraft to the Minnesota Air \nNational Guard Historical Foundation, be printed in the record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprohibit the marketing of authorized generic drugs; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Schumer,\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\nKohl and Leahy to reintroduce an important bill for all Americans. The \nbill that we are reintroducing today would reduce barriers to \naffordable prescription drugs by eliminating one of the prominent \nloopholes brand name drug companies use to limit access to generic \ndrugs.\n  Our bill, the Fair Prescription Drug Competition Act of 2007, would \nend the marketing of so-called ``authorized generics'' during the l80-\nday period Congress created exclusively for true generics to enter the \nmarket. I have spoken with my colleagues many times about this \nimportant issue.\n  In an effort to balance the need for returns on research facilitated \nby brand name prescription drug companies with the need for more \naffordable prescription drug options for consumers, Congress passed the \nHatch-Waxman law in 1984. This law provided brand name companies with a \nnumber of incentives for investing in the research and development of \nnew medications. These included a 20-year patent on drugs, 5 years of \ndata exclusivity, 3 years of exclusivity for clinical trials, up to 5 \nyears of patent extension, 6 months exclusivity for conducting \npediatric testing, and a 30-month automatic stay against generic \ncompetition if the generic challenges the brand patent. Generic \nprescription drug manufacturers, on the other hand, received a l80-day \nexclusivity period, awarded to the first company to successfully \nchallenge a brand name patent and enter the market.\n  This 6-month exclusivity period has been crucial to encouraging \ngeneric drug companies to make existing drugs more affordable. \nChallenging a brand name drug's patent takes time, money, and involves \nabsorbing a great deal of risk. Generic drug companies rely on the \nadded revenue provided by the 180-day exclusivity period to recoup \ntheir costs, fund new patent challenges where appropriate, and \nultimately pass savings onto consumers.\n  Since 1984, there have been many attempts to exploit loopholes in the \nlaw in order to delay generic entry to the market and extend brand \nmonopolies. The 2003 Medicare law addressed many of these loopholes. \nHowever, brand name manufacturers have found another loophole in \ncurrent law, so-called ``authorized generics.''\n  An authorized generic drug is a brand name prescription drug produced \nby the same brand manufacturer on the same manufacturing lines, yet \nrepackaged as a generic in order to confuse consumers and shut true \ngenerics out of the market. Because it is not a true generic and does \nnot require an additional FDA approval, an authorized generic can be \nmarketed during the federally mandated 6-month exclusivity period for \ngenerics. This discourages true generic companies from entering the \nmarket and offering lower-priced prescription drugs.\n  As I have said many times, authorized generics are a sham. This \npractice of re-labeling a brand product and placing it on the market to \nundermine the 180-day exclusivity period will only serve to reduce \ngeneric competition and lead to longer brand monopolies and higher \nhealthcare costs over the long-term.\n  Brand name drug companies are expected to lose as much as $75 billion \nover the next 5 years as some of their best sellers go off-patent and \ngeneric competition increases. So, not surprisingly, these big \npharmaceutical companies are desperately trying to protect their market \nshare and prevent consumers from cashing in on savings from generic \ndrugs,\n  Today, generic medications comprise more than 56 percent of all \nprescriptions in this country, and yet they account for only 13 percent \nof our nation's drug costs. In fact, generic drugs provide 50 to 80 \npercent cost-savings over brand name drugs. These savings make a big \ndifference in the lives of working families. That is why we must \nprotect the true intent of Hatch-Waxman.\n  The bill we are introducing today eliminates the authorized generic \nloophole, protects the integrity of the 180 days, and improves consumer \naccess to lower-cost generic drugs. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis timely and important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 438\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Prescription Drug \n     Competition Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF AUTHORIZED GENERICS.\n\n       Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 355) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(o) Prohibition of Authorized Generic Drugs.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, no holder of a new drug application approved under \n     subsection (c) shall manufacture, market, sell, or distribute \n     an authorized generic drug, direct or indirectly, or \n     authorize any other person to manufacture, market, sell, or \n     distribute an authorized generic drug.\n       ``(2) Authorized generic drug.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term `authorized generic drug'--\n       ``(A) means any version of a listed drug (as such term is \n     used in subsection (j)) that the holder of the new drug \n     application approved under subsection (c) for that listed \n     drug seeks to commence marketing, selling, or distributing, \n     directly or indirectly, after receipt of a notice sent \n     pursuant to subsection (j)(2)(B) with respect to that listed \n     drug; and\n       ``(B) does not include any drug to be marketed, sold, or \n     distributed--\n       ``(i) by an entity eligible for exclusivity with respect to \n     such drug under subsection (j)(5)(B)(iv); or\n       ``(ii) after expiration or forfeiture of any exclusivity \n     with respect to such drug under such subsection \n     (j)(5)(B)(iv).''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senators \nRockefeller, Kohl and Schumer in introducing legislation to end the use \nof so-called ``authorized generics'' during the 180-day period that \nCongress intended for true generic market exclusivity. Authorized \ngenerics are nothing more than repackaged brand name drugs purporting \nto be a generic, but without the benefit of a true generic's lower \ncost. This practice is anticompetitive and anti-consumer.\n  Amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, enacted as part of the \nMedicare Modernization Act (Title XI, PL 108-173) in 2003, generally \ngrant a generic company that successfully challenges the patent of a \nname brand pharmaceutical company 180 days of marketing exclusivity on \nthat generic drug. Having co-sponsored those amendments, I know that \nthey were designed to give greater incentives for generic manufacturers \nto bring generic drugs quickly to the market, thus promoting \ncompetition and lowering prices for consumers.\n  In 2005, Senators Grassley and Rockefeller and I raised concerns \nabout the practice of manufacturing authorized generics. We feared that \npractice could have a negative impact on competition for both \nblockbuster and smaller drugs, because the generic industry would be \nless inclined to invest in their production. According to a recent \nGeneric Pharmaceutical Association study, our fears were well founded: \nAuthorized generics diminish Hatch-Waxman incentives for generic firms \nto challenge brand name patents, resulting in higher consumer prices.\n  The legislation we introduce today bars brand name drug firms from \nproducing ``authorized generics.'' Slapping a different name on a \npatented drug and calling it generic is not real competition, and it \nsaps incentives from real generic drug makers to compete by making \nlower-cost generic drugs. Consumers deserve the lower costs and real \nchoices of truly generic medicines.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to make this good bill into a good law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/30/senate-section/article/S1352-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1352-S1353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 46--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                      ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works; which was referred to the Committee on \nRules and Administration:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, we are \nnow close to completing action on all germane amendments that are \npending to H.R. 2. It is my understanding that Senator Kyl will be here \nin the morning, and we will resume the bill to debate his amendments. \nTherefore, Members should be advised to expect rollcall votes tomorrow, \nand the votes could occur prior to noon.\n  Does the distinguished Republican leader have anything to say?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No. Let me say to my friend, the majority leader, I \nthink we have gotten off to a good start this year. We are close to \naccomplishing two important pieces of legislation with overwhelming \nbipartisan support. We look forward to moving ahead with a rather \ncontentious debate next week but a debate we obviously ought to have. \nIt is the most important issue in the country with a lot of passionate \nfeelings on both sides of the issue, and\n\n[[Page S1358]]\n\nwe will have a grand debate in the tradition of the United States \nSenate next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/30/senate-section/article/S1358-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
