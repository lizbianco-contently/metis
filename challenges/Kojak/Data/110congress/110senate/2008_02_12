Mr. President, today the Senate will finish the \nbipartisan Rockefeller-Bond bill. This bill is the product of months of \npainstaking negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democrats and \nbenefitted from the participation of intelligence experts in the \nexecutive branch.\n  The overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Intelligence Committee \nreflected the care, concern, and good faith that went into crafting the \nbill. The final vote was not 15 to 0, but it was 13 to 2, which around \nhere is pretty close.\n  The Rockefeller-Bond bill contained the two main ingredients that are \nneeded to sign this bill into law. It will allow intelligence \nprofessionals to do their jobs, and it will not allow trial lawyers to \nsue the telecommunications companies that may have participated and, \naccording to the intelligence, acted in good faith to help protect our \ncountry.\n  A bill that does not satisfy these two requirements will not become \nlaw, nor should it. And, in fact, Mr. President, I know the Senator \nfrom Missouri, our ranking member, is going to make the point that all \nof these amendments need to be defeated if, in fact, we are going to \nget a signature on this bill. It will be the only way in the end to \nprotect our country.\n  Last week was a great example of what we can accomplish when we work \nwith each other instead of against each other. We were able to pass an \neconomic growth package on an overwhelming bipartisan basis which the \nPresident will sign tomorrow.\n  We have another chance this week to put up a bipartisan win by \npassing the Rockefeller-Bond bill, a bill that is critical to \nprotecting the homeland from attack and protecting our forces fighting \noverseas.\n  I am confident that with the help of friends on the other side of the \naisle, we can work through the pending amendments, send it over to the \nHouse, and then send it on to the President for his signature this \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S879-9", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S879-S880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN BICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today on February 12, America \ncelebrates the birthday of the greatest\n\n[[Page S880]]\n\nleader our country has ever produced. And my home State of Kentucky has \na front-row seat in the celebration.\n  Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, in a log cabin 3 miles \nsouth of Hodgenville, KY. The one-room cabin measured 16 by 18 feet, \nhad a dirt floor, and no glass in the windows.\n  The future President was born with no advantages in life except for a \nstrong curiosity and a sterling character. By the end of his life, this \nman of humble background had united our country by demonstrating \nleadership during America's time of greatest crisis, and he showed our \ncountry the true value of the Declaration of Independence by asserting \nthat there must be no exceptions to the ideal that all men are created \nequal.\n  Two centuries later, America looks back with gratitude at our 16th \nPresident by celebrating the Lincoln Bicentennial. The Commonwealth of \nKentucky can take special pride in the fact that Lincoln was one of our \nown, and the Lincoln Bicentennial's opening ceremonies will take place \nin Hodgenville. So begins a 2-year event celebrating the great \nemancipator's life and legacy. All across the country, from the State \ncapital in Springfield, IL, where Lincoln served as a legislator, to \nhere in Washington, DC, where Lincoln served as a wartime Commander in \nChief, Americans will celebrate this important figure in our national \nstory.\n  This time will be exciting for teachers, students, and any adult who \nloves American history. I know Kentucky's friendly neighbors to the \nnorth in Illinois often claim Lincoln as their own. Their license \nplates even say so. But Lincoln was born and spent his formative years \nin Kentucky, which surely must have shaped the man he became, and he \nwould never have denied his Kentuckian heritage.\n  In fact, in 1861, as he traveled east to Washington to begin his term \nas President, Lincoln wrote a speech that he intended to deliver in \nKentucky but never got a chance to do. In it, he crafted these words: \n``Gentlemen, I too, am a Kentuckian.''\n  So it is appropriate that the Lincoln Bicentennial celebration begins \nin the same State that the man himself did. I hope every Kentuckian and \nevery American will take advantage of this opportunity to explore this \nexciting chapter in American history.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S880-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the order before the Senate allows me and \nthe Republican leader 10 minutes any time during this debate to make a \npresentation. I will do that later. I do want to say, based on the \nremarks of the distinguished Republican leader, I, too, appreciate the \nwork of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond, but I also appreciate the \nwork done by the Judiciary Committee and Senator Leahy. As a result of \nthat work, the bill has already been made better and, hopefully, we can \nadopt some of these amendments today.\n  We, for example, have as a result of the work done by the Judiciary \nCommittee a compromise reached on a number of amendments that have made \nthis bill better, including a Feingold amendment providing Congress \nwith FISA Court documents that will facilitate congressional oversight \nand enable Congress to better understand the court's interpretation of \nthe laws we passed; a Whitehouse amendment giving the FISA Court the \ndiscretion to stay lower FISA Court decisions pending appeal rather \nthan requiring a stay; a Kennedy amendment providing that under the new \nauthority provided by this bill the Government may not intentionally \nacquire communications when it knows ahead of time that the sender and \nall intended recipients are in the United States.\n  The bill has been made better. The bill that Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Bond did is not a bill that is perfect in nature, and I hope \nthey will acknowledge that point. The bill has been made better as a \nresult of work done by the Judiciary Committee. We have members of the \nIntelligence Committee who also serve on the Judiciary Committee. Two \nwho come to my mind are Senator Feinstein and Senator Whitehouse. They \nhave worked very hard in the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary \nCommittee to improve this legislation.\n  We should understand where we are. We are now doing different \nwiretaps, and I think the situation today that is so concerning to most \nof us is the President has been advised by his lawyers that he does not \nhave to follow the law anyway. Whatever we do here, he has been told by \nhis lawyers that he need not follow the law. He can do whatever he \nwants; he is the boss; he is someone who does not have to follow the \nlaw, does not even have to give a signing statement saying he rejects \nit. He can just go ahead and do it.\n  I do not think this should be a day of celebration. This should be a \nday of concern for the American people. I am very happy we have been \nable to improve the product that came out of the Intelligence \nCommittee. Hopefully, by the voting today we can improve it more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S880-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, first of all, we thank all our colleagues \nfor coming to this point where we can have votes and finally get this \nbill out, which we started in December. It is a very important bill. We \nhave worked together on a bipartisan basis and resolved almost all \nissues.\n  The amendment offered by our colleague from Rhode Island has been \nmodified in a way that I believe improves it, makes it effective, makes \nit work for the intelligence community, and achieves the very important \ngoals that the Senator from Rhode Island has sought to achieve.\n  I ask that I be added as a cosponsor to this modified amendment. I \nbelieve, Mr. President, we can accept it by voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I simply would also like to be added \nas a cosponsor, and I congratulate Senator Whitehouse, Senator Bond, \nand others for doing an outstanding piece of work in resolving the \ndifferences on this extremely important enforcement mechanism.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3920, as Modified\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have at the desk a modification to \namendment No. 3920.\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 69, after line 23, add the following:\n       (d) Authority of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.--\n     Section 103 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803), as amended by this Act, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h)(1) Nothing in this Act shall be considered to reduce \n     or contravene the inherent authority of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court to determine, or enforce, \n     compliance with an order or a rule of such Court or with a \n     procedure approved by such Court.\n       ``(2) In this subsection, the terms `Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court' and `Court' mean the court established by \n     subsection (a).''.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, much of the FISA battle in which we \nhave been engaged over the weeks that it has taken to resolve this \nissue has been over trying to do two things: one, to fit this program \nwithin the separation of powers principles of the American system of \ngovernment and, two, to make the rights of Americans consistent with \nwhat they enjoy stateside in law enforcement investigations.\n  This amendment is a valuable step in both of those directions, and it \nsolves the minimization issue that had been in dispute.\n  I appreciate very much the roles of Chairman Rockefeller, Vice \nChairman Bond, FBI Director Mueller, and DNI counsel Powell in getting \nus to a voice vote on this bipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3920, as \nmodified, be adopted by voice vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection it is so ordered. \nIf there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3920, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3920), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3910\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is now on amendment \nNo. 3910 offered by the Senator from California.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is 2 \nminutes evenly divided; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to \nstrengthen the legal requirement that FISA is the exclusive authority \nfor the electronic surveillance of Americans. When FISA was written in \n1978, it followed 30 years of warrantless surveillance of \ncommunications and telegrams of hundreds of thousands of Americans \nsending messages outside the country. This would stress that FISA is \nthe legal way for the collection of electronic surveillance against \nAmericans.\n  In 2001, the administration decided they would not take the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program to the FISA Court, that they would perform this \nprogram outside of FISA, and it took until January of 2007 to bring \nthis within the confines of FISA where it is to this day.\n  I think we need to make a strong statement in this bill that FISA is \nthe exclusive authority for the electronic surveillance of all \nAmericans, and this amendment aims to do that. It provides penalties \nfor moving outside of the law, and I believe it would strengthen the \nopportunity to prevent the Chief Executive, either now or in the \nfuture, from moving outside of this law.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the bill before us, S. 2248, already has an \nexclusive means provision that simply restates the congressional intent \nback in 1978 when FISA was enacted to place the President at his lowest \nebb of authority under the Constitution, which gives him power over \nforeign intelligence. Unfortunately, this amendment is a significant \nchange of the bipartisan provision in the Intelligence Committee bill, \nand therefore I would urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  During the next attack on our country or in the face of an imminent \nthreat, Congress may not be in a position to legislate an \nauthorization. Yet the bottom line is, we just don't know what tomorrow \nwill bring. This provision would raise unnecessary legal concerns that \nmight impede the effective action of our intelligence community to \nprotect this country.\n  Further, because this amendment does not address warrantless \nsurveillance in times of war and national emergency following an attack \non our country, it does not provide enough flexibility for intelligence \ncollectors. I am concerned this will cause operational problems.\n  Mr. President, I urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on \nthis amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. I \nthink it has very good delineation between how decisions are made. The \nFISA Court needs to be a part of this. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment.\n  I thank the senior Senator from California for offering this \namendment, and for all of her work on ensuring that we have an \nappropriately drafted exclusivity provision. Senator Feinstein's \namendment is critical to both our work on this bill and to our \noversight of the intelligence community.\n  To understand the importance of the Feinstein amendment, we must look \nat both existing statutes and recent events.\n  There is already an exclusivity provision in the United States Code. \nIt was enacted as part of the original Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act in 1978 and placed, where it exists now, in title 18, \nthe criminal law title of the United States Code.\n  That provision makes the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and \ncertain criminal wiretapping provisions the ``exclusive means by which \nelectronic surveillance . . . and the interception of domestic wire, \noral and electronic communications may be conducted.'' Although the \nintent of Congress is clear from this language, recent history raises \nconcerns about the adequacy of this provision.\n  In December of 2005, the American people and most of Congress learned \nfor the first time that, shortly after the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2007, the President had authorized the National Security \nAgency to conduct certain surveillance activities within the United \nStates.\n  In publicly justifying the legality of this program, the White House \nasserted that Congress had authorized the President's program by \nenacting an authorization for use of military force after September 11.\n  The authorization passed on September 14, 2001, did not mention \nelectronic surveillance. Nor did it mention any domestic intelligence \nactivities. Given the nature of both the authorization and the time in \nwhich it was passed, it is very unlikely that it occurred to anyone in \nCongress that the President might use this authorization to justify his \nposition that the existing statute making FISA the exclusive means for \nconducting electronic surveillance no longer applied.\n  I have expressed my dismay in the past about the legal arguments that \nthe President used to justify the surveillance program. We are still \nworking through the many problems caused by the President's decision to \ngo forward without input from Congress or the courts.\n  But no matter what the President should have done at the time, \nCongress now has an obligation to act to prevent this misuse of \nlegislation. Having finally made the right decision in early 2007 to \nbring his entire program under the FISA Court, the President is no \nlonger using the 2001 Authorization for the Use of military force as a \njustification to disregard FISA. But we must ensure that neither this \nPresident nor a future one resurrects the discredited argument that the \n2001 authorization for the use of military force is a blank check for \nsuch lawlessness.\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\n  Section 102 of the Intelligence Committee bill prevents that abuse. \nSection 102 enacts an exclusivity provision as a new section 112 of \nFISA, and lists all statutes now in effect that constitute authority \nfor electronic surveillance. This list is a clear statement of \ncongressional intent: Congress did not intend any other presently-\nexisting statutes to constitute an exception to FISA.\n  Conspicuously absent from the exclusive list is the 2001 \nauthorization for the use of military force. The omission of the 2001 \nauthorization from the complete list that will now be enacted in 2008 \nis a conclusive statement that the 2001 authorization may never again \nbe used to circumvent FISA.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment takes exclusivity one important step \nfurther. It is designed to ensure that no future President interprets a \nstatute that does not explicitly mention electronic surveillance as an \nexception to the FISA exclusivity requirement. This would be an \nabsolutely incorrect interpretation of existing law. Senator \nFeinstein's amendment ensures that no President will again make this \nmistake.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment addresses the possible impact of future \nstatutes by adding language to the exclusivity section that states that \nonly an express statutory authorization for electronic surveillance \nwill constitute an additional exclusive means for electronic \nsurveillance.\n  By requiring ``express statutory authorization,'' Congress \nanticipates that a statute will only constitute an exception to FISA if \nit explicitly discusses electronic surveillance. Only those statutes \nlisted in the FISA exclusivity section of the Intelligence Committee \nbill currently meet that standard.\n  The amendment therefore ensures that general statutes enacted in the \nfuture do not become the basis for exceptions to the FISA exclusivity \nprovision. It also applies criminal and civil penalties for any \nelectronic surveillance done outside of the list of authorized \nstatutes.\n  The Feinstein amendment being offered today also resolves the \noperational concerns raised by the Director of National Intelligence \nabout the exclusivity provision in the Judiciary Committee's amendment \nto the bill. Senator Feinstein's amendment does not include the \nundefined term ``communications information'' and therefore does not \nbar the acquisition of information that is currently authorized under \nother statutes.\n  Existing statutes as well as the current bill provide the \nintelligence community with mechanisms to obtain the intelligence the \ncountry needs in a legal manner, with the oversight of the courts. \nThere is no need for this President, or any future President, to set \naside the lawful, well-overseen procedures of FISA in favor of a secret \nintelligence program.\n  Both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees have done a \nsignificant amount of work, on a bipartisan basis, to draft a bill that \nallows the collection of needed intelligence while still protecting the \ncivil liberties of U.S. persons. Senator Feinstein's amendment helps to \nmake sure that this work will not simply be ignored by this President \nor any future President.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would note that the Intelligence Committee \ndebated this and accepted a return to the original FISA exclusive means \nprovision, which I think we should maintain, and I urge opposition.\n  S. 2248 already has an exclusive means provision that is identical to \nthe first part of this amendment. That provision simply restates \nCongress's intent back in 1978 when FISA was enacted to place the \nPresident at his lowest ebb of authority in conducting warrantless \nforeign intelligence surveillance.\n  The current exclusive mean provision in S. 2248 was acceptable to all \nsides because it maintains the status quo with respect to the dispute \nover the President's constitutional authority to authorize warrantless \nsurveillance.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment is a significant expansion of the \nbipartisan provision in the Intelligence Committee's bill.\n  It goes further by stating that only an express statutory \nauthorization for electronic surveillance, other than FISA or the \ncriminal wiretap statutes, shall constitute additional exclusive means.\n  This attempts to prohibit the President's exercise of his judicially \nrecognized artic1e II authority to issue warrantless electronic \nsurveillance directives.\n  It also would require that future authorizations for the use of \nmilitary force, AUMFs, expressly state that they authorize the use of \nadditional electronic surveillance.\n  I am concerned that this amendment would tie the President's hands \nfollowing a national emergency or imminent threat of attack on our \ncountry--and prevent actions or intelligence collection that may be \nnecessary for our safety and survival.\n   While FISA currently has provisions that allow the President to \nconduct electronic surveillance, physical searches, or install pen \nregister/trap and trace devices for 15 days following a declaration of \nwar, these authorities are simply insufficient against the current \nterrorist threats our country faces.\n  Let's think this through for a minute. During the next attack on our \ncountry, or in the face of an imminent threat, the Congress may not be \nin a position to legislate an express authorization of additional \nmeans. We may not be in a position to formally declare war against an \nunknown enemy.\n  What if there is intelligence information about an imminent threat of \nattack, but Congress is in a lengthy recess, over a holiday? What if \nthere are simultaneous terrorist attacks across the country, impeding \nair travel so that Members cannot return to Washington, DC?\n  The bottom line is, we just don't know what tomorrow will bring. Yet \nthis provision would raise unnecessary legal concerns that might impede \neffective action by the executive branch to protect this country.\n  I have the utmost respect for Senator Feinstein. She has played a key \nrole in this FISA modernization process.\n   While our views on the President's constitutional authority may \ndiffer, she did convince me that a bipartisan FISA bill should restate \nthe exclusive means concept in the originally enacted FISA statute.\n   And over the past several weeks, Senator Feinstein and I tried to \ncome up with a further compromise, one that would expand this simple \nrestatement but would also allow the President to act in the event of a \nnational emergency, or following an AUMF or declaration of war.\n  Unfortunately, we could not reach an agreement. I believe that if we \nare going to declare that the President should follow the current FISA \nframework, then we need to make sure that that framework is flexible \nenough to address the grave threats of terrorism that threaten our \ncountry--and that means giving the President the ability to conduct \nwarrantless electronic surveillance, physical searches, or installing \npen register/trap and trace devices, for a reasonable period of time. \nThis amendment does not provide this flexibility.\n  I have other concerns with this amendment. It would make members of \nthe intelligence community who conduct electronic surveillance at the \ndirection of the President subject to the FISA criminal penalty \nprovisions of a $10,000 fine and imprisonment for not more than 5 \nyears. Also, it is likely these criminal penalties would apply to any \nservice provider who assisted the government in conducting such \nelectronic surveillance.\n  I don't care what the skeptics and critics have said about the \nPresident's Terrorist Surveillance Program; the Constitution trumps the \nFISA statute.\n  If a government employee--or a provider--acts under the color of the \nPresident's lawful exercise of his constitutional authority, that \nemployee should not be subject to criminal penalty.\n  In my opinion, the current restatement of exclusive means is fair and \nkeeps the playing field level.\n  Ultimately, the Supreme Court will decide whether Congress has the \nauthority to limit the President's authority to intercept enemy \ncommunications.\n  Until then, it is my hope that we don't try to tilt the balance in a \nway that we may someday come to regret.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this exclusive means amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order requiring \n60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3979\n\n  There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided on amendment \nNo. 3979 offered by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Feingold-Webb-Tester amendment lets \nthe Government get the information it needs about terrorists and about \npurely foreign communications, while providing additional checks and \nbalances for communications between people in the United States and \ntheir overseas family members, friends, and business colleagues.\n  It has the support of nine cosponsors. All this amendment does is \nrequire the Government to take extra steps to protect the privacy of \nAmericans on U.S. soil when it knows it has collected their \ncommunications.\n  This amendment in no way hampers our fight against al-Qaida and its \naffiliates. This is not about whether we will be effective in \ncombatting terrorism. This is about whether Americans at home deserve \nmore privacy protections than foreigners overseas.\n  This is about separation of power, whether anyone outside the \nexecutive branch will oversee what the Government is doing with all the \ncommunications of Americans it collects inside the United States. I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the purpose of this bill is to make sure we \nare able to get information when we target a foreign terrorist \noverseas.\n  This applies a different standard to someone in the United States who \nmay be picked up on one of those calls than we apply within our own \ncountry. If the FBI gets a warrant to listen in on a drug dealer and \nthat drug dealer has lots of conversations, if the drug dealer is \ntalking about a criminal operation, then the FBI acts on it. If it is \ninnocent, the FBI, the interceptors minimize or suppress that evidence, \nthey do not sequester it, they do not have to go through the hoops that \nare required for a recipient of a telephone call from a foreign \nterrorist overseas.\n  There is no reason why, when we have no challenges and no question \nthat minimization is adequate to protect innocent Americans, that they \nneed a higher level of protection when they are talking to a foreign \nterrorist than when they are talking to a U.S. drug dealer.\n  I urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment.\n  This amendment would prohibit the Government from acquiring any \ncommunication under title VII of the bill if the Government knows \nbefore or at the time of acquisition that the communication is to or \nfrom a person reasonably believed to be located in the United States, \nunless the Government follows the sequestration procedures set forth in \nthe legislation.\n  I see a number of problems with this amendment and I strongly oppose \nit.\n  I am afraid that the practical effect of this amendment would be to \nrestrict the scope of the collection authority under the bill to \ninternational terrorism. Under the terms of this amendment, no other \nimportant foreign policy or national security target could be pursued \nunless the Government goes through a process that appears to be \nbasically unworkable.\n  Neither the Intelligence Committee nor the Judiciary Committee \nlimited the scope of the authority in this bill to international \nterrorism. Both committees anticipated that the flexibility provided by \nthis bill could be used against the gamut of foreign targets overseas \nwith respect to proliferation, weapons development, the clandestine \nintelligence activities of our enemies, and other priorities. The full \nSenate should not limit the scope of this bill to one area of foreign \nintelligence.\n  A second problem with this amendment is the new, cumbersome \nprocedures it would impose involving the sequestration of information \nif the communication is to or from a person in the United States. The \namendment seems to require that the Attorney General must make an \napplication to the FISA Court to have access to this information for \nmore than 7 days, even if the communication, for instance, concerns \ninternational terrorist activities directed against the United States.\n  While I share the Senator's goal of protecting the privacy interests \nof Americans, I am afraid this amendment is unworkable.\n  It bears repeating that what we are trying to do in S. 2248 is \nmodernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act so that FISA Court \norders are not required when the Government is targeting non-U.S. \npersons overseas to collect foreign intelligence information. And we \nare trying to do this in a way that protects the privacy interests of \nU.S. persons.\n  We thus have included in S. 2248 numerous protections for U.S. \npersons--both when they are the specific targets of Government \nsurveillance and when their communications are intercepted as the \nincidental result of the Government acquiring the communications of a \nforeign target.\n  The Feingold sequestration amendment does not achieve the appropriate \nbalance of privacy and national security. It appears to me that \nrequirements already in S. 2248, including the requirement that \nminimization procedures for this collection activity be approved by the \nFISA Court, represent a much better approach for balancing the national \nsecurity and the privacy interests of U.S. persons.\n  I urge the amendment be defeated.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3907 offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd. \nThere are 2 minutes of debate time equally divided, and the time on the \nremaining amendments will be strictly enforced.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, for his cosponsorship of this \namendment, along with a number of other Members of this body who have \njoined us in this effort.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member. My colleagues should know, \ninitially the administration sought to grant immunity to all \nparticipants in this telecommunications surveillance program. The \nchairman and ranking member disagreed with that. However, they have \nprovided retroactive immunity to some 16 phone companies. One of the \nphone companies refused, of course, to comply with this 5-year \nsurveillance program that was granted without a warrant, without a \ncourt order.\n  I believe it is dangerous in setting a precedent for us today to \ngrant that retroactive immunity without insisting the courts--as they \nare designed to do--should determine the legality or illegality of this \nprogram.\n  There are four committees of the U.S. Congress that have considered \nthis issue. Three of the committees have rejected retroactive immunity. \nOnly the Intelligence Committee of this body has decided to include it. \nI believe we ought to strike that provision and allow the court to do \nits job. That is what this amendment does, and I urge its adoption.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this carrier liability provision is an \nessential part of this bill. If we permit lawsuits to go ahead against \ncarriers alleged to have participated in the program, there will be \nmore disclosures in discoveries and pleadings of the means of \ncollecting information, disclosing our most vital methods of collecting \ninformation.\n  Secondly, if we permit the carriers that may or may not have \nparticipated to be sued in court, then the most important partners the \nGovernment has--the private sector--will be discouraged from assisting \nus in the future.\n  The Intelligence Committee--the one committee that has looked at \nthis--reviewed it and said these companies acted in good faith and, \ntherefore, we should give them retroactive immunity.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished chairman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. It \nis, of course, the whole shooting match. Substitution was brought up in \nthe Judiciary Committee, and it was defeated. This, I believe, is the \nright way to go for the security of the Nation.\n  Mr. President, Senators Dodd and Feingold have offered an amendment \nto strike title II of the Intelligence Committee bill.\n   Title II addresses, in the narrowest way possible, a number of \ndifferent underlying issues related to the past and future cooperation \nof providers. Any suggestion that it deals only with liability \nprotection for providers related to the President's program fails to \nconsider the title of the bill as a whole.\n  Unlike the Government's initial immunity proposals, title II does not \ntry to address all of the different kinds of problems in one sweeping \nimmunity provision that might provide immunity in situations where it \nis not deserved. Instead, it addresses each problem individually.\n   Let's look at the first problem. Under existing law, providers are \nentitled to protection from suit if they act pursuant to a FISA court \norder or if they receive a particular certification from the Attorney \nGeneral. Senators Dodd and Feingold point to this existing immunity \nprovision-- which may be based solely on the certification of the \nAttorney General--to suggest that no further immunity is needed. But \nthis suggestion ignores the situation in the current lawsuits.\n   The Government has not allowed the providers who have been sued to \npublicly disclose whether or not they assisted the Government. \nProviders, therefore, cannot reveal whether they are already entitled \nto immunity, or even whether they declined to cooperate with the \nintelligence community.\n   In other words, even those providers who were not involved in the \nPresident's program or who acted only pursuant to a valid court order \ncannot extricate themselves from these lawsuits.\n  Section 203 of the Intelligence Committee bill, therefore, creates a \nmechanism within FISA that allows courts to review whether providers \nshould be entitled to immunity under existing law, without revealing \nwhether or not the provider assisted the intelligence community. The \nDodd-Feingold amendment to strike title II strikes this provision, \nwhich protects those providers who indisputably complied with existing \nlaw.\n  There is a second problem that has not been widely discussed. \nProviders are currently subject to investigations by State public \nutilities commissions, which seek information about the relationship \nbetween the providers and Federal Government.\n   These State investigations essentially seek to force disclosure of \nclassified information about the nature and extent of the information \nobtained by the intelligence community from communication providers. \nThis inquiry into the conduct of the Federal Government is not an \nappropriate area for State regulation.\n   Section 204 of the Intelligence Committee bill, therefore, creates a \nnew section of FISA that preempts State investigations that seek to \nforce disclosure of classified information about the conduct of the \nFederal intelligence relationship between the provider and the \nintelligence community.\n   Finally, section 202 provides retrospective immunity for the \nparticipation of telecommunication companies in the President's \nwarrantless surveillance program. We need to be very clear on the \nparameters of this section. It does not simply clean the slate for the \nactions of communications providers in the aftermath of 9/11.\n   In order for a provider to obtain liability protection, the Attorney \nGeneral must certify that a company's actions were based on written \nassurances of legality, and were related to a communications \nintelligence activity authorized in the relevant time period.\n   Because these certifications require the Attorney General to have \ndetermined that legal requirements have been met and that the program \nwas designed to detect or prevent a terrorist attack, an area where \nassistance would clearly be required, they parallel existing statutory \nrequirements for immunity. Before immunity can be granted, the bill \nalso requires the court to conduct a case-by-case review to ensure that \nthe Attorney General did not abuse his discretion.\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\n   It is important to understand why the Intelligence Committee \nincluded this provision in our bill. After hearing from witnesses and \nreviewing documents, the committee concluded that the providers who \nassisted the Government acted in good faith, with a desire to help the \ncountry prevent another terrorist attack like those committed on \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  Even more importantly, however, the committee recognized that, \nbecause of the ongoing lawsuits, providers have become increasingly \nreluctant to assist the Government in the future. Given the degree to \nwhich our law enforcement agencies and intelligence community need the \ncooperation of the private sector to obtain intelligence, this was \nsimply an unacceptable outcome.\n  Senators Dodd and Feingold have suggested that including the \nprovision on liability protection as part of the bill is a sign of \nsupport for the President's program. It is not. It is simply a \nmechanism to ensure that accountability for the President's program \nlies with those who are truly responsible for it: The Government \nofficials who represented to these companies that their actions were in \naccordance with the law. And it is a way to ensure that the \nintelligence community obtains the assistance it needs from the private \nsector to keep us safe.\n  The question of whether the President's warrantless surveillance \nprogram was legal, or whether it violated constitutional rights, can \nand must be answered. Likewise, if administration officials improperly \nviolated the privacy of innocent U.S. persons by conducting this \nwarrantless surveillance, they should be held accountable.\n  But suing private companies who may have cooperated with the \nGovernment is neither an appropriate accountability mechanism nor the \nbest way to obtain answers to questions about the legality of the \nprogram, nor is it the appropriate way to encourage public disclosure \nof information about the program.\n  The Intelligence Committee's bill does not prevent Congress from \nconducting its own oversight of these issues, or even from creating \nalternative mechanisms to seek those answers. It also allows suits \nagainst the Government to go forward.\n  I encourage my colleagues to come up with appropriate alternatives \nfor review of the President's program; alternatives that will ensure \nboth that the story of the President's program is made available to the \npublic in a manner consistent with the protection of national security \ninformation and that Government officials are held accountable for any \nwrongdoing in which they may have been involved.\n  What we must not do, however, is to make companies that cooperated \nwith the Government in good faith bear the brunt of our anger towards \nthe President and other Government officials about the warrantless \nsurveillance program; our intelligence community's future relationship \nwith the private sector is simply too important.\n  Protection from liability is simply a way to ensure that the next \nPresident has the cooperation of these companies both to obtain \nintelligence to protect the country and to protect the privacy \ninterests of U.S. persons.\n  I, therefore, urge you to oppose the Dodd-Feingold amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?

The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3912, offered by Mr. Feingold of Wisconsin. There are 2 \nminutes of debate evenly divided.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment was approved by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. It ensures that in implementing the new \nauthorities provided in the bill, the Government is acquiring the \ncommunications of targets from whom it seeks to obtain foreign \nintelligence information and that it is not indiscriminately collecting \nall communications between the United States and overseas.\n  This amendment is necessary because of the vast and overbroad \nauthorities provided by the PAA in this bill. In public testimony, the \nDNI stated that the PAA could authorize this type of bulk collection \nand could cover every communication between Americans inside the United \nStates, in Europe, in South America, or the entire world. He also said \nthat the Government is not actually engaging in this type of broad bulk \ncollection but that it would be ``desirable.''\n  This amendment would not impede in any way collection in support of \nmilitary operations, as the opponents continue to falsely assert. This \nextremely modest amendment would, however, oppose a massive bulk \ncollection dragnet, which Chairman Rockefeller has even acknowledged \nwould violate the Constitution.\n  I urge support for the amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is offering an amendment that he argues \nwill prevent what he calls ``bulk collection.'' The amendment is \nintended, as described by the Senator from Wisconsin, to ensure that \nthis bill is not used by the Government to collect the contents of all \nthe international communications between the United States and the rest \nof the world. The Senator argues that his amendment will prevent ``bulk \ncollection'' by requiring the Government to have some foreign \nintelligence interest in the overseas party to the communications it is \ncollecting.\n  I regret to say that I must oppose this amendment. I do not believe \nit is necessary. I do believe as drafted the amendment will interfere \nwith legitimate intelligence operations that protect the national \nsecurity and the lives of Americans.\n  In considering amendments today, we need to consider whether an \namendment would provide additional protections for U.S. persons and \nwhether it would needlessly inhibit vital foreign intelligence \ncollection. I do not believe the amendment as drafted provides \nadditional protections. Furthermore, intelligence professionals have \nexpressed their concern that this amendment would interfere with vital \nintelligence operations and there are important classified reasons \nunderlying that concern.\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\n  Let us review the reasons why the amendment is unnecessary: first, \nbulk collection resulting in a dragnet of all of the international \ncommunications of U.S. persons would probably be unreasonable of the \nfourth amendment. No bill passed by the Senate may authorize what the \nfourth amendment prohibits. What is more, the committee bill, in fact, \nexplicitly provides that acquisitions authorized under the bill are to \nbe conducted in a manner consistent with the fourth amendment.\n  Second, the committee bill stipulates that acquisitions under this \nauthority cannot intentionally target any person known to be located in \nthe United States. And, to target a U.S. person outside the United \nStates, the government must get approval from the FISA Court.\n  Third, the committee bill increases the role of the FISA Court in \nsupervising the acquisition activities of the Government. The bill \nrequires Court approval of minimization procedures that protect U.S. \nperson information. It maintains the prior requirement of Court \napproval of targeting procedures.\n  In the unlikely event that the FISA Court would give its approval to \ntargeting procedures and minimization procedures that allowed the \nGovernment to engage in unconstitutional bulk collection, the committee \nbill also strengthens oversight mechanisms in the executive and \nlegislative branches. These mechanisms are intended to ensure such \nactivity is detected and prevented.\n  The sponsor of the amendment says that his amendment only requires \nthe Government to certify to the FISA Court that it is collecting \ncommunications of targets for whom there is a foreign intelligence \ninterest.\n  But the committee bill already requires the Attorney General and the \nDirector of National Intelligence to certify to the FISA Court that the \nacquisition authorized under the bill is targeted at persons outside \nthe United States in order to obtain foreign intelligence information.\n  Because the remedy does not improve upon the protections in the bill \nfor Americans, and places new burdens on the surveillance of foreign \ntargets overseas, I thus oppose the amendment and urge it be rejected.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there is a clear delineation in this bill. \nWe permit targeting of foreign terrorists overseas, or Americans, with \na court order. This doesn't permit listening in on bulk collections of \ncommunications involving innocent Americans. The only American who is \ngoing to be listened in on is one calling to or receiving a call from a \nterrorist.\n  I urge defeat of this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3912.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3938\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3938 offered by the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, with the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, we offer this amendment responding to a request made by the \nDirector of National Intelligence when he sent up his recommendations \nto us last April. He and the Attorney General strongly support this \namendment because it adds proliferators of weapons of mass destruction \nto the definition in FISA of agent of a foreign power, foreign \nintelligence information, use of information, and physical searches. \nThis amendment applies only to non-U.S. persons.\n  Making these definitional changes will allow the Government to target \nfor surveillance those who seek to spread this dangerous technology and \nwill enable the intelligence community to share information with other \nagencies. It remains a central concern for our national security, \nwhether done by terrorists, criminals or other nations.\n  I believe we can accept this amendment on a voice vote. I turn to my \ndistinguished chairman for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I support this amendment.\n  It closes a gap in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The \namendment expands the definition of certain key terms in the law in \norder to enhance the Government's ability to obtain FISA coverage of \nindividuals involved in the international proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Although the international proliferation of WMD is one of the most \nserious threats facing the nation, the Government cannot now get a FISA \nCourt order for individuals believed to be engaged in international \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction unless the Government can \nalso show a close link between the trafficker and a foreign Government \nor an international terrorist organization.\n  Too often, this connection only becomes clear at the completion of \nthe target's proliferation activity. With this amendment, the \nGovernment will be able to conduct electronic surveillance and physical \nsearches, with a FISA Court order, at a much earlier stage in an \nindividual's proliferation activities.\n  It should be understood that this amendment is intended to broaden \nFISA coverage only in those instances in which the individual is \ninvolved in international proliferation activities. The amendment is \nintended to cover those who are engaged in activities involving \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, which include under the \nterms of the amendment biological, chemical and radiological weapons \nand destructive devices that are intended to or that actually do have a \ncapability to cause death or serious bodily injury to a significant \nnumber of people.\n  This amendment will enhance our efforts to acquire foreign \nintelligence information to detect and disrupt the international \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The vice chairman is to be applauded for addressing this issue and I \nurge passage.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I must oppose Bond amendment No. 3938. I \ndo not object to expanding FISA to cover dangerous individuals involved \nin the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nwhich is the primary goal of this amendment.\n  But this amendment is drafted in such a way that its effect would be\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\nmuch broader and could result in wiretaps issued by the secret FISA \nCourt being directed at U.S. companies and U.S. universities that are \nengaged in perfectly legal research efforts or that are legally and \nlegitimately working with materials that have multiple purposes and \nthat aren't intended to be used for weaponry at all.\n  In fact, the American Library Association and the Association of \nResearch Libraries have expressed serious concern about this amendment. \nHere is what they said: ``While we can appreciate the concerns for \nthose wanting FISA to address the issues of international proliferation \nof WMDs, the language appears to also expose to secret wiretaps those \nU.S. academic researchers, universities and companies doing legal \nresearch into conventional and chemical/biological weapons.'' Mr. \nPresident, that is simply not acceptable.\n  Let me be clear: This amendment expands the core provisions of FISA \nthat authorize wiretaps and secret searches of the homes and offices of \npeople inside the United States. This is not about extending the new \nauthorities provided in the Protect America Act and reauthorized by the \nIntelligence Committee bill.\n  It is one thing to permit secret court-ordered foreign intelligence \nwiretaps of people in this country who are intentionally engaged in the \ninternational proliferation of WMD. But because of the way this \namendment is drafted, it would go far beyond just authorizing wiretaps \nfor these types of dangerous criminals.\n  The biggest problem with the amendment is that it does not require \nthat the people being wiretapped be involved in any criminal activity. \nThis means that companies and individuals engaged in perfectly legal \nand legitimate biological, chemical, nuclear or other research could be \nwiretapped under this provision.\n  I don't understand this. Under FISA today, while foreign government \nofficials can be surveilled to gain foreign intelligence even if they \nare not breaking the law, foreign terrorist suspects not associated \nwith a government who are in the United States can only be wiretapped \nif they are involved in criminal activities. That requirement helps \nensure that innocent people engaged in, say, legal protest activities \naren't subject to FISA. And I know of no complaints about that \nrequirement.\n  This amendment, on the other hand, doesn't require any suspicion of \ncriminal wrongdoing. It does not even require that the target know that \nthey might be contributing to proliferation. Worse yet, it does not \neven define international proliferation. So how can we know what \nactivity might trigger the use of this most intrusive of investigation \ntechniques against an individual in the United States? What does \ninternational proliferation mean for purposes of this authority?\n  I certainly don't know the answer to that, and there is nothing in \nthis amendment to answer it. And without a requirement that the \nproliferation must be illegal under U.S. law, I am seriously concerned \nthat this could cover entities doing perfectly legal, academic, \nchemical, biological or nuclear research, or even research on \nconventional weapons like grenades and bombs. It could also cover \nlegitimate companies manufacturing dual-purpose goods, component parts \nor precursors that could be used for weapons if they fell into the \nwrong hands.\n  We can easily fix this problem with the amendment. It would be quite \nsimple to add language virtually identical to that already included in \nFISA with respect to international terrorism, simply stating that \ninternational proliferation of WMD only covers activities that violate \nU.S. criminal laws or would be criminal if committed within U.S. \njurisdiction. I even proposed language to this effect to the Senator \nfrom Missouri, hoping that we could work out our differences on this \namendment and not require the full Senate to vote on it. But my modest \nproposal was rejected, for reasons I fail to understand. What I do \nunderstand is that if the proponents of this amendment refuse to \ninclude language limiting it to people committing crimes, that makes me \neven more concerned about what is intended and how this is going to be \nused. There are other changes, as well, that could bring the scope of \nthe amendment into line with the justification for it, but none of my \nsuggestions were accepted.\n  Some may argue that we should not worry about this expansion of FISA \nbecause it only applies to foreigners visiting the United States, \nsometimes referred to as ``non-U.S. persons.'' But on the face of the \namendment, that is not at all clear. This is because the amendment \nexpands the definition of ``foreign power'' under FISA to cover any \nentity involved in international proliferation of WMD, regardless of \nwhether it is incorporated in the United States or how many Americans \nwork there. And any foreign power can be wiretapped or searched under \nthe plain provisions of FISA, regardless of whether it is breaking the \nlaw.\n  Even if the amendment were limited to non-U.S. persons, U.S. \ncompanies, and universities hire any number of people who are here on \nwork or study visas and who are not considered ``U.S. persons.'' When \nthose people are here in the United States, they are fully protected by \nthe fourth amendment. So why should those individuals be subject to \nsecret court-ordered wiretaps and searches of their offices when they \nhave done nothing illegal? And won't this affect the ability of U.S. \ncompanies and universities to recruit the best foreign talent to come \nand work for them?\n  I realize this all may seem very technical, but let me repeat the \nupshot: What all of this means is that, under this amendment, U.S. \ncompanies and U.S. universities conducting perfectly legal and \nlegitimate activities--meaning they are doing nothing wrong--could be \nconsidered ``foreign powers'' under FISA and subject to court-ordered \nsecret wiretaps in this country without any suspicion of wrongdoing. \nThis has left organizations like the American Library Association and \nthe Association of Research Libraries with very serious concerns about \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would have been willing to adopt this amendment if \nit could have been modified to address some of these concerns. But it \nwould be my preference not to address this complex issue in this \nlegislation. The responsible thing to do would be to engage in further \nstudy so we know we have the right solution to this problem. But if we \nare going to take on this issue here, today, let's at least do it in a \nresponsible, targeted way.\n  We have heard a lot about unintended consequences throughout the \ndebate on this bill. I believe this amendment will have serious \nunintended consequences, and I think it would benefit all of us to \nstudy the issue further. But if that is not possible, we should at a \nminimum try to limit the effect of the amendment to the dangerous \ncriminals who are the reason for this expansion of FISA. The Bond \namendment does not do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3938.\n  The amendment (No. 3938) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3927\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3927 offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment substitutes the Government \nfor the party defendant in place of the telephone companies. It is \ndesigned to maintain some check and balance on the executive because \nCongress has been totally ineffective to do so.\n  It accomplishes both purposes. It keeps the program going to gain \nintelligence information necessary for national defense, but it \nmaintains the courts being open as a check and balance.\n  I yield to Senator Whitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if we vote for retroactive immunity, \nwe violate the rule of law taking away legitimate claims in legitimate \nlitigation in a manner that is unprecedented and unconstitutional. If \non the other hand we do nothing, we leave American companies gagged by \nthe state secrets privilege in ongoing litigation.\n  This amendment is a sensible, fair, bipartisan alternative that takes \naway\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\nno rights, that follows the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, that \nhonors the separation of powers principles and leaves no litigant \ngagged by the Government.\n  Please support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Who yields time in \nopposition? The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter, has offered an amendment \nproposing to substitute the government for the providers in the ongoing \ncivil lawsuits.\n  I appreciate and agree with the sentiment of Senator Specter and \nSenator Whitehouse that the government--not the providers who operated \nin good faith with them--should be held responsible for the legal \nfallout from the President's warrantless surveillance program. But this \namendment lays out a remarkably complicated litigation procedure that \nis unlikely to achieve any meaningful review of the President's \nprogram.\n  Under this amendment, if the Attorney General submits a certification \nto the district court that an individual carrier provided assistance in \nconnection with the President's program or did not provide assistance, \nthe district court certifies a question to the FISA Court.\n  The FISA Court is then required to determine whether the carrier \ncooperated with existing law, or acted in good faith and pursuant to an \nobjectively reasonable belief that the written request was legal. If \nthe FISA Court makes that finding, the government is substituted for \nthe carrier in the district court.\n  At that point, litigation continues against the government under \nseveral different possible statutes, and the provider is dismissed from \nthe suit. The plaintiffs may, however, seek discovery--that is, \ndocuments, witness testimony, and other information--from the providers \nwho were originally named in the lawsuit.\n  This complicated procedure raises a number of concerns both about the \ndetermination by the FISA Court and the resolution of the lawsuits \nafter the government is substituted.\n  As an initial matter, it is unclear why the cases would need to be \ntransferred to the FISA Court for a determination of good faith. The \nIntelligence Committee has already made an assessment of the good faith \nof the cooperating providers. The possibility of a court--rather than \nthe Congress--making the good faith determination is particularly \nrelevant to an amendment offered by Senator Feinstein, and I am sure we \nwill discuss it further.\n  But even if Congress seeks to have a court, rather than Congress, \nmake a determination of good faith, having that.determination made in \nthe FISA Court unnecessarily complicates the process. The FISA Court is \nnot a standard factfinding trial court; it does not hear from \nwitnesses, take evidence, or assess the ``good faith'' of private \nparties. The FISA Court is simply not set up to make factual \ndeterminations that impact civil lawsuits.\n  Nor does transferring the cases to the FISA Court help the plaintiffs \nin these cases. They are not entitled to hear the classified \ninformation concerning the good faith of the providers, and they will \nnot be involved in the debate.\n  In addition, although a finding of good faith would normally result \nin dismissal of the lawsuits, under this proposal, the providers would \nstill potentially have the burden of producing documents and witnesses. \nThus, because providers who acted in good faith will continue to have a \nrole in the litigation, even if they are no longer the named \ndefendants, this proposal does not relieve the cost and reputational \nburdens of the litigation. It therefore is unlikely to encourage the \nproviders to cooperate with the government in the future.\n  It is also unclear what substituting the government in these cases \nseeks to accomplish. The proposal would involve changing the nature of \nthe claims filed against telecommunications companies to causes of \naction against the government under a number of statutes, including the \nFederal Tort Claims Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, or FISA. \nSuits under these statutes, however, can be, and in some cases, have \nalready been brought against the government.\n  If it is already possible to sue the government under thee statutes \nfor possible violations, and indeed, if the government has already been \nsued under these statutes, why do we need to create a new procedure to \nconvert claims against private companies into these claims against the \ngovernment?\n  Finally, we should look at what is actually happening in the current \nlitigation. Many of my colleagues have suggested that allowing the \nlitigation to continue--with either the government or the providers as \nthe defendant--will allow the court to resolve the issue of whether the \nproviders acted in accordance with the law. But this is not presently \nthe debate in the litigation.\n  Right now, the parties in the approximately 40 civil lawsuits are \narguing about access to classified information about the President's \nprogram. The government has refused to publicly reveal the classified \ndocuments and information that would allow litigation to proceed. \nBecause classified information is needed to address even threshold \nlitigation issues, having the government or a particular provider as \ndefendant in the suit is unlikely to change this aspect of the \nlitigation.\n  In other words, whether or not we substitute the government for the \nprovider, no court is likely to resolve the question of whether the \nPresident, or any private company, violated the law in the near future. \nGiven that the administration is unlikely to declassify information \nabout the program while the lawsuits are ongoing, it is also unlikely \nthat litigation will ever tell the story of what happened with the \nPresident's program. So what benefit is there to substituting the \ngovernment in the providers' stead?\n  Providers who acted in good faith should be removed from ongoing \nlitigation, without having the burden of responding to discovery and \nlitigation requests and without the reputational harm of having suits \nin their name go forward against the government. Ongoing reminders of \nthe potential pitfalls of cooperating in good faith with the government \nwill not encourage these companies--whose assistance the intelligence \ncommunity and law enforcement agencies desperately need--to cooperate \nwith the government in the future.\n  If plaintiffs in any ongoing suit want to bring claims against \ngovernment officials, those suits can be brought directly, without the \ncomplicated substitution procedure described in this amendment.\n  Although no member of the Intelligence Committee offered an amendment \non this issue, the committee considered whether it would be more \nappropriate to substitute the government for particular providers in \nongoing lawsuits as part of the work done in preparing this bill. For \nall of the reasons I have discussed, the committee ultimately decided \nthat substitution was not the right approach to address the ongoing \nlawsuits.\n  I, therefore, cannot support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nto oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for all the reasons we voted down striking \nretroactive immunity, this amendment must be defeated as well because \nit would continue to disclose all the methods of collection in \nelectronic surveillance and it would put at risk the private parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3919\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 3919 offered by the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, FISA has a law within it as to how you \ndo electronic surveillance, and that law has specific provisions of \nwhat companies seeking to assist the Government must do. Essentially, \nwhat this amendment does is ask the FISA Court to review that \ncompliance by the telecom companies to see that they complied with the \nelements of that part of FISA.\n  I think some Members have been able to look at the certification \nletter sent to telecoms, but most Members have not, and I think it is \nvery important that the court have an opportunity to review these \ncertifications and see if they are adequate under the provisions of the \nFISA law, and this is exactly what this amendment does.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the FISA Court was not set up to make \njudgments about the operation of foreign intelligence. As a matter of \nfact, they said specifically, in a case released in December, that is a \nmatter for the executive branch.\n  Now, there are some people who say there ought to be a court \nchallenge to the President's terrorist surveillance program. Let me \nremind my colleagues that there are seven cases proceeding against the \nGovernment and Government employees which will not be impacted by this \nbill. Every day that litigation continues, whether it be in a FISA \ncourt or in open court, there is a danger of leaking of information.\n  There could be disclosure of our methods, and there could be risks to \nemployees of the companies in areas of the world. Certainly their \nbottom line could be impacted. As Senator Durbin pointed out last week, \nleaks of classified information caused severe harm to a company in his \nState.\n   I urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia has offered an amendment to modify the procedures in the \nIntelligence Committee bill on dismissal of civil actions against \ntelecommunications companies that assisted an element of the \nintelligence community with regard to the President's warrantless \nsurveillance program.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment preserves the basic idea of the \nIntelligence Committee bill; namely, that narrowly crafted immunity for \nprivate companies is an appropriate way of resolving dozens of lawsuits \narising from the President's program. But the amendment makes one \nsignificant change in the procedure proposed by the Intelligence \nCommittee. Rather than Congress deciding that each and every company \nacted in good faith, the question of whether individual carriers relied \nin good faith on representations made by the Government would be made \nby the FISA Court.\n  I understand and appreciate the Senator from California's desire to \nhave a court make this good faith determination. But in this particular \ncase, I think that Congress is better able to assess the context in \nwhich companies cooperated with the Government in order to determine \nwhether they acted in good faith.\n  As members of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein and I \nhave had access to the letters sent to the telecommunications \ncompanies. We have heard from the companies who were told after 9/11 \nthat their assistance was ``required'' and that the request for \nassistance was based on a Presidential order, the legality of which was \ncertified by the Attorney General.\n  In addition, the committee understands the threats faced by the \nUnited States in the years after September 11, and the effect that \nthreat environment had on all American citizens.\n  The committee also understands exactly how critical the private \nsector is to all of our intelligence collection efforts, and what \neffect the pending lawsuits have had on the private sector's continued \ncooperation with the Government.\n  The policy question that is at the heart of the Feinstein amendment--\nwhether companies that cooperated with the intelligence community after \nSeptember 11 should be protected from liability for their actions--is \nnot a question than can truly be addressed in an individual court case. \nUnlike the fact-intensive, good faith determinations that would be made \nin a court case, this question is not about how a company reacted to \neach individual piece of correspondence it received, or its discussions \nwith the Government. The question should not be answered on a piecemeal \nbasis, based on whether each of the individual actions taken by any \nparticular company was in good faith.\n  Knowing how to address this policy issue instead depends on \nunderstanding the circumstances that surrounded the requests, the full \ndimension of the threat, and the historical relationship between the \nGovernment and the companies. Because Congress has the ability to look \nat the totality of the circumstances in a way that a court evaluating \nan individual company's good faith cannot, I feel that it is our \nresponsibility to assess the reasonableness of the response of all of \nthe companies.\n  Given the circumstances involved in this sensitive matter, I believe \nCongress, not the courts, should make the determination as to whether \ncompanies acted in good faith and should be protected from liability.\n  Apart from disagreeing as to who should make the decision about good \nfaith, there are also a number of significant procedural concerns with \nthe Feinstein amendment. I fear that these problems would make the \namendment unworkable.\n  Under Senator Feinstein's amendment, the first step in the immunity \nprocess would be the same as under the Intelligence Committee's bill. \nThe Attorney General would make a certification to a court in which a \ncase against a telecommunication company is being heard. The \ncertification would say one of two things.\n  First, if the company assisted the government, the certification \nwould have to indicate that any assistance provided had been for an \nintelligence activity involving communications that had been authorized \nby the President between September 11, 2001, and January 2007.\n  The certification would also have to state that the assistance had \nbeen described to the company in a written request or directive from \nthe Attorney General or the head or deputy head of an intelligence \ncommunity element which indicated that the activity was authorized by \nthe President had determined to be lawful.\n  Alternatively, the certification could indicate that the \ntelecommunications company did not provide the alleged assistance.\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\n  The court would then have the opportunity to review the Attorney \nGeneral's certification for abuse of discretion. To protect national \nsecurity information, only the judge would be entitled to review the \ncertification; the plaintiffs would not have access to it.\n  Under the committee's bill, such a certification would be the end of \nthe process, except for the issuance of the court's order dismissing \nthe action if the Attorney General's certification met these \nrequirements.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment, in contrast, uses that certification \nto trigger a transfer of the case to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court. This amendment also specifically provides that the \nFISA Court will permit any plaintiff in an applicable covered civil \naction to appear before the Court.\n  This transfer of the case to the FISA Court seriously complicates the \nexisting lawsuits, and poses a number of significant procedural \nproblems that are not resolved in the amendment.\n  As an initial matter, the type of analysis in the amendment is \noutside the longstanding scope and jurisdiction of the FISA Court.\n  Under the Feinstein amendment, the FISA Court would be required to \ndetermine, acting as a body of all judges, whether immunity would be \ngranted under current law, whether the company had an objectively \nreasonable belief under the circumstances that compliance with the \nwritten request or directive was lawful, or whether the company did not \nprovide the alleged assistance.\n  None of these determinations involve the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, the statute on which the FISA Court has expertise. \nIndeed, the point of the litigation is that the President's program was \nconducted outside of FISA.\n  In addition, the FISA Court is not generally set up for adversarial \ncivil litigation; it does not usually hear from witnesses or take \nevidence. Although Congress has granted the Court the ability to hear \nchallenges to certain FISA directives, it has never before been asked \nto make factual determinations that affect the outcome of civil \nlawsuits.\n  Sending the case to the FISA court therefore raises all sorts of \nquestions. For example, would the FISA Court, acting en banc, hear \ntestimony from witnesses? If so, who would examine the witnesses? What \nrules of evidence would apply? What role would the plaintiffs play in \nthe proceeding?\n  The FISA Court would have to come up with an entirely new set of \nprocedures just to handle this litigation. This new proceeding--\nparticularly as the Court would have to act en banc--would \nsignificantly strain the resources of the Court that oversees our \nelectronic surveillance of terrorists and foreign powers and protects \nthe privacy of U.S. persons.\n  Nor does transferring the cases to the FISA Court necessarily help \nthe plaintiffs in these cases. As they do not currently have security \nclearances, the Government is unlikely to provide the plaintiffs with \naccess to classified information about the proceeding. Thus, most \nlikely, they will not be involved in the debate.\n  I commend the Senator from California for her efforts to come up with \na mechanism by which the court can consider and determine the good \nfaith of the companies. But, because of all of the procedural problems \nwith this amendment I have described, as well as a more fundamental \nbelief that Congress has a unique ability in this circumstance to \nassess the good faith of the companies, I cannot support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse.)

Mr. President, as I have said repeatedly on the Senate \nfloor, I strongly oppose granting unjustified retroactive immunity to \ncompanies that allegedly participated in the President's illegal \nwiretapping program, which went on for more than 5 years. It is \nunnecessary because under current law, companies already have immunity \nfrom civil liability if they comply with a court order or with a \ncertification from the Attorney General that a court order is not \nrequired and all statutory requirements have been met. Congress should \nleave it to the courts to evaluate whether the companies alleged to \nhave cooperated with the program would deserve immunity under this \nexisting law rather than changing the rules of the game after the fact. \nThat is why I have been a staunch supporter of the Dodd amendment to \nstrike the immunity provision from this bill entirely.\n  Given my strong opposition to any retroactive immunity for \ntelecommunications companies, I want to explain why I voted in favor of \ntwo amendments that proposed alternatives to but did not entirely \neliminate retroactive immunity. Amendment No. 3927, offered by Senators \nSpecter and Whitehouse, would have substituted the Government for the \ncompanies in the pending litigation, and amendment No. 3919, proposed \nby Senator Feinstein, would have directed the FISA Court to evaluate \nwhether companies complied with the existing immunity provision or \notherwise acted in good faith.\n  I do not believe that either of these proposals is necessary. In \nfact, when Senator Specter offered his substitution proposal as a \nstand-alone bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I opposed it. I \nfirmly believe that Congress should allow the courts to evaluate \nwhether the companies deserve immunity under the law that applied to \nthem at the time, and we should not be\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\nmeddling in this area at all. However, unlike the Specter bill, these \ntwo amendments were offered to replace the broad grant of retroactive \nimmunity in the FISA bill, and they were offered after the Senate had \nvoted not to adopt the Dodd-Feingold amendment. Each of them was an \nimprovement, however slight, to the underlying immunity provision, in \nthat they would have left open the possibility that the lawsuits could \ncontinue, thus permitting the courts to rule on the legality of the \nwarrantless wiretapping program. Therefore, I voted in favor of both of \nthese amendments, even though I would have much preferred to see \nretroactive immunity stricken entirely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on S. \n2248, an original bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct of 1978, to modernize and streamline the provisions of that act, \nand for other purposes, shall be brought to a close.\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing Senator Feingold's 15 minutes on FISA, I be recognized for 10 \nminutes and that the time be taken from Senator Dodd's 4 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly oppose S. 2248. This bill is \ndeeply flawed in ways that will have a direct impact on the privacy of \nAmericans. Along with several other Members of this body, I have \noffered modest amendments that would have permitted the government to \nobtain the intelligence it needs, while providing the checks and \nbalances required to safeguard our constitutional rights. \nUnfortunately, under intense administration pressure marked by \ninaccurate and misleading scare tactics, the Senate has buckled. And we \nare left with a very dangerous piece of legislation.\n  The railroading of Congress began last summer, when the \nadministration rammed through the so-called Protect America Act, vastly \nexpanding the government's ability to eavesdrop without a court-\napproved warrant. That legislation was rushed through this Chamber in a \nclimate of fear--fear of terrorist attacks, and fear of not appearing \nsufficiently strong on national security. There was very little \nunderstanding of what the legislation actually did.\n  But there was one silver lining: The bill had a 6-month sunset to \nforce Congress to do its homework and reconsider the approach it took. \nUnfortunately, with far too few exceptions, the damage has not been \nundone.\n  This new bill was intended to ensure that the government can collect \ncommunications between persons overseas without a warrant, and to \nensure that the government can collect the communications of \nterrorists, including their communications with people in the United \nStates. No one disagrees that the government should have this \nauthority. But this bill goes much further, authorizing widespread \nsurveillance involving innocent Americans--at home and abroad.\n  Proponents of the bill and the administration don't want to talk \nabout what this bill actually authorizes. Instead, they repeatedly and \ninaccurately assert that efforts to provide checks and balances will \nimpede the government's surveillance of terrorists. They launched these \nattacks against the more balanced bill that came out of the Judiciary \nCommittee. And they have attacked and mischaracterized amendments \noffered on the floor of this body. This is fear-mongering, it is wrong, \nand it has obscured what is really going on.\n  What does this bill actually authorize? First, it permits the \ngovernment to come up with its own procedures for determining who is a \ntarget of surveillance. It doesn't need advance approval from the FISA \nCourt to ensure that the government's targets are actually foreigners, \nand not Americans here in the United States. And, if the Court \nsubsequently determines that the government's procedures are not even \nreasonably designed to wiretap foreigners, rather than Americans, there \nare no meaningful consequences. All that illegally obtained information \non Americans can be retained and used.\n  Second, even if the government is targeting foreigners outside the \nU.S., those foreigners need not be terrorists. They need not be \nsuspected of any wrongdoing. They need not even be a member or agent of \nsome foreign power. In fact, the government can just collect \ninternational communications indiscriminately, so long as there is a \ngeneral foreign intelligence purpose, a meaningless qualification that \nthe DNI has testified permits the collection of all communications \nbetween the United States and overseas. Under this bill, the government \ncan legally collect all communications--every last one--between \nAmericans here at home and the rest of the world. Even the sponsor of \nthis bill, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, acknowledges \nthat this kind of bulk collection is probably unconstitutional, but the \nDNI has said it would be not only authorized but ``desirable'' if \ntechnically possible. Technology changes fast in this area. We have \nbeen forewarned, yet the Senate failed to act.\n  One of the few bright spots in this bill is the inclusion of an \namendment, offered by Senators Wyden, Whitehouse and myself in the \nIntelligence Committee, to prohibit the intentional targeting of an \nAmerican overseas without a warrant. That is an important new \nprotection. But that amendment does not rule out the indiscriminate \nvacuuming up of all international communications, which would allow the \ngovernment to collect the communications of Americans overseas, \nincluding with friends and family back home, without a warrant. And \nthose communications can be retained and used. Even the \nadministration's illegal warrantless wiretapping program,\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\nas described when it was publicly confirmed in 2005, at least focused \non the communications of particular terrorists. What we are talking \nabout now is potentially a huge dragnet that could sweep up the \ncommunications of countless innocent Americans.\n  Third, the Senate failed to prohibit the practice of reverse \ntargeting; namely, wiretapping a person overseas when what the \ngovernment is really interested in is an American here at home with \nwhom the foreigner is communicating. The underlying bill simply does \nnot stop this practice and, if there was any doubt, the DNI has \npublicly said that the bill merely ``codifies'' the administration's \nview that surveillance of an American is fine, so long as the \ngovernment is technically wiretapping the foreigner. Even the DNI has \nsaid this is unconstitutional, but there is nothing in this bill to \nstop it.\n  Fourth, the Senate has failed to protect the privacy of Americans \nwhose communications will be collected in vast new quantities. The \nadministration's mantra has been: ``don't worry, we have minimization \nprocedures.'' Minimization procedures are nothing more than unchecked \nexecutive branch decisions about what information on Americans \nconstitutes ``foreign intelligence.'' As recently declassified \ndocuments have again confirmed, the ability of government officials to \nfind out the identity of Americans and use that information is \nextremely broad. Moreover, even if the administration were correct that \nminimization procedures have worked in the past, they are certainly \ninadequate as a check against the vast amounts of Americans' private \ninformation that could be collected under these new authorities.\n  This legislation is particularly troubling because we live in a world \nin which international communications are increasingly commonplace. \nThirty years ago it was very expensive, and not very common, for \nmost Americans to make an overseas call. Now, particularly with email, \nsuch communications are commonplace. Millions of ordinary, and \ninnocent, Americans communicate with people overseas for entirely \nlegitimate personal and business reasons. Parents or children call \nfamily members overseas. Students email friends they have met while \nstudying abroad. Business people communicate with colleagues or clients \noverseas. Technological advancements combined with the ever more \ninterconnected world economy have led to an explosion of international \ncontacts.\n\n  We often hear from those who want to give the government new powers \nthat we just have to bring FISA up to date with new technology. But \nchanges in technology should also cause us to take a close look at the \nneed for greater protections of the privacy of our citizens. If we are \ngoing to give the government broad new powers that will lead to the \ncollection of much more information on innocent Americans, we have a \nduty to protect their privacy as much as we possibly can. And we can do \nthat without sacrificing our ability to collect information that will \nhelp protect our national security.\n  But, the Senate has once again fallen for administration tactics that \nhave become so depressingly familiar. ``Trust us,'' they say. ``We \ndon't need judicial oversight. The courts will just get in our way. You \nnever know when they might tell us that what we're doing is \nunconstitutional, and we would prefer to make that decision on our own. \nChecks and balances, judicial and congressional oversight, will impede \nour ability to fight terrorism.'' And, sadly, these grossly misleading \nefforts at intimidation have apparently worked.\n  I have been speaking for some time now about my strong opposition to \nthis bill, and I haven't even addressed one of the most outrageous \nelements of that bill: the granting of retroactive immunity to \ncompanies that allegedly participated in an illegal wiretapping program \nthat lasted for more than 5 years.\n  This grant of automatic immunity is simply unjustified. There is \nalready an immunity provision in current law that has been there since \nFISA was negotiated--with the participation of the telecommunications \nindustry--in the late 1970s. The law is clear. Companies have immunity \nfrom civil liability when they cooperate with a Government request for \nassistance--as long as they receive a court order, or the Attorney \nGeneral certifies that a court order is not required and all statutory \nrequirements have been met.\n  This is not about whether companies had good intentions. It is about \nwhether they complied with this statutory immunity provision, which has \napplied to them for 30 years. If the companies followed that law, they \nshould get immunity. If they did not follow that law, they should not \nget immunity. And a court should make that decision, not Congress. It \nis that simple.\n  Congress passed a law laying out when telecom companies get immunity \nand when they don't for a reason. These companies have access to our \nmost private communications, so Congress has subjected them to very \nprecise rules about when they can provide that information to the \ngovernment. If the companies did not follow the law Congress passed, \nthey should not be granted a ``get out of jail free'' card after the \nfact.\n  Proponents of retroactive immunity have said repeatedly that immunity \nis necessary if the government is going to have the cooperation of \ncarriers in the future. We do need that cooperation. But we also need \nto make sure that carriers don't cooperate with illegitimate requests. \nWe already have a law that tells companies when they should and when \nthey shouldn't cooperate, so they are not placed in the position of \nhaving to evaluate independently whether the government's request for \nhelp is legitimate.\n  Instead of allowing the courts to apply that law to the facts--\ninstead of allowing judges to decide whether the companies deserve \nimmunity for acting appropriately--this bill sends the message that \ncompanies need not worry about complying with questionable government \nrequests in the future because they will be bailed out after the fact.\n  This is outrageous. Even more outrageous is that fact that if these \nlawsuits are dismissed, the courts may never rule on the NSA \nwiretapping program. This is an ideal outcome for an administration \nthat believes it should be able to interpret laws alone, without \nworrying about how Congress wrote them or what a judge thinks. For \nthose of us who believe in three independent and co-equal branches of \ngovernment, it is a disaster.\n  In the 1970s, Congress learned that the executive branch had been \nusing its immense powers and the advance of technology to spy on its \ncitizens. By passing FISA, Congress faced up to the fact that we can't \njust trust the executive branch, including the President of the United \nStates, to do the right thing, that judicial oversight of the power to \nspy was needed, that checks and balances are the best way to ensure \nliberty, and security.\n  I have spent a great deal of time on the floor over the past several \nweeks discussing the details of the bill, offering amendments, and \ndebating the possible effects of the fine print of the statute. But \nthis isn't simply about fine print. In the end, my opposition to this \nbill comes down to this: This bill is a tragic retreat from the \nprinciples that have governed government conduct in this sensitive area \nfor 30 years. It needlessly sacrifices court oversight and protection \nof the privacy of innocent Americans. It is an abdication of this \nbody's duty to stand up for the rule of law.\n  We know what is wrong with this legislation. We know that it \nauthorizes unconstitutional surveillance of Americans. We have been \nforewarned. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the FISA bill \ncurrently being considered by the Senate. I believe it is our duty to \nprovide all the tools necessary to fight terrorism. We also have \nanother duty--I would say a simultaneous duty, a sworn duty--to protect \nthe constitutional rights of our citizens.\n  So we have two duties. One is to protect the American people and give \nthe Government the tools it needs to do that; two, to protect the \nconstitutional rights of Americans. If we lose those rights, then the \nbasic freedoms of our people are at risk.\n  I believe we have fallen far short. We have fallen far short of the \nbalance that we always need to look for, ever since the beginning of \nour Republic--\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\nthe balance between security and freedom. I think we missed it here.\n  It is not the Government's job to scare our people; it is the \nGovernment's job to protect our people. It is not the Government's job \nto endanger the privacy of law-abiding Americans, but to protect the \nprivacy of law-abiding Americans. Sadly, we had a number of amendments \nto this bill which would have brought that balance I talked about into \nbeing, the balance between security and freedom.\n  Senator Feingold had an amendment limiting the use and dissemination \nof information unlawfully obtained through foreign surveillance on U.S. \ncitizens. His amendment would have protected the rights of innocent \nU.S. citizens and provided a necessary balance to the bill. I was proud \nto support it because the bill, obviously, needed some more checks and \nbalances.\n  Senator Feingold also had an amendment to provide protection against \nbulk collection of foreign communications that could include \ncommunications of innocent Americans. Again, this measure would have \nprovided additional protection for the rights of American citizens, and \nI was proud to support it because I believe we need, again, additional \nchecks on enhanced Government surveillance authority.\n  My colleague and friend from California, Senator Feinstein, had an \namendment that stated a very important principle: that FISA, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, is the exclusive authority for \nconducting foreign intelligence surveillance.\n  Why is that important? It is important because this administration \nargues time and again that ``it has inherent authority'' to conduct \nwarrantless surveillance, or that Congress somehow gave them the \nauthority when it authorized the use of military force in Iraq--a \nridiculous claim. The Feinstein amendment was a very important \namendment because it would have made it clear that FISA is the \nexclusive authority, pure and simple.\n  Why was that important going forward? We don't want to have this \nadministration or another one in the future--I don't care which party \nthey are from--spying on the American people and then saying: It is \ntrue, we didn't obey FISA, but we thought it was important to go \noutside the law. If we had adopted the Feinstein amendment, we would \nhave clearly stated that FISA is the law when it comes to conducting \nsurveillance on our own people.\n  The Feinstein amendment--which failed, sadly by only 1 or 2 votes \nshort of the 60-vote hurdle--said we are not going to lose our \nfreedoms, we are not going to allow another administration to spy on \nus; FISA is going to be the one and only law that pertains here.\n  Finally, there is the issue of immunity for telecommunications \ncompanies that cooperated with the administration's warrantless \nsurveillance program. We know that American law did not give these \ntelephone companies the authority to do what they did, but they were \nsomehow persuaded by the administration to go along with them. Not \nevery telephone company, not every communications company did go along. \nAt least one said: Look, we think this is not legal; show us the \nlegality. And they stood, I think, in firm support of their consumers.\n  Here is the problem with granting immunity. Congress has not been \ngiven complete information on this program. We do not know the level of \ninvolvement by the telephone companies and the telecom companies. We \nneed complete information; we have incomplete information. How can I be \na good Senator, how can I do a good job if I don't have the facts \nsurrounding this whole matter of the warrantless surveillance program? \nWhen you put out that immunity, you basically stop the court cases, and \nif you stop the court cases, we will never get to the bottom of this \nissue and our citizens will never know who was spied on, why were they \nspied on, what happened, what went wrong, what went right, and how much \npower this Government tried to exercise over its people illegally.\n  Granting immunity without fully understanding whether our people were \nillegally spied upon and to what extent, I find that irresponsible. \nWhere is our pride? We wrote a law that said phone companies cannot do \nthis, and they went ahead and did it. Not all of them. Now we are \nsaying: Never mind, President Bush and Vice President Cheney write the \nlaw, they make the decision. It is not right. It is not American. It is \nanti-American. It is not what we do in this great country.\n  President Bush says we are sending our troops overseas to fight for \nfreedom, fight for democracy, and at home they ask the telecom \ncompanies to break the law. They spied on Americans, and we cannot find \nout what they did, how they did it, the details of the program, and now \nwe are going to now grant immunity. I cannot believe that we didn't do \nbetter on that particular amendment. That amendment failed. Again, I \nwas proud to stand with Senator Dodd and Senator Feingold on the \namendment.\n  In closing, I don't believe this bill strikes the kind of balance we \nneed between broadening the Government's authority to conduct \nsurveillance and protecting the rights of our citizens. We did have \nmany chances today to increase the oversight of FISA surveillance \nprograms. We had many opportunities to hold this administration \naccountable and future administrations accountable while giving them \nwhat they need to go after the bad actors, those who would harm us. I \nvoted to get bin Laden. I voted to go to war against al-Qaida. I voted \nno on the Iraq war because that was a diversion. I want to get the \nterrorists who perpetrated 9/11. I want to give any administration the \ntools they need, but I do not want to expose my constituents and the \npeople of America who are law-abiding and caring and all they live for \nis for their families--I don't want to subject them to being spied \nupon.\n  Unfortunately, those amendments all went down. It is sad for me to \nsay that we have a bill that steps on the rights of the freedoms of our \npeople, of the law-abiding Americans in our country and, therefore, I \ncannot support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I ask that the time be taken equally off both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is clear now that this body is going to \napprove retroactive immunity for the telecom industry, which may have \nhelped the President to illegally spy on millions of Americans.\n  I have spoken on this issue now for I think in excess of 20 hours, \ngoing back 2\\1/2\\ months ago when this issue first came to the floor in \nDecember. Just to recall the history of the last couple of months \nbriefly, if I may: Two committees of the Senate, appropriately, had \njurisdiction over this matter--the Intelligence Committee and the \nJudiciary Committee. In fact, the House of Representatives similarly \nhad two committees with jurisdiction over this matter, the matter being \nthe amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  I have talked at length about the history of that act and commended \nour previous colleagues who served in this body for having crafted a \nrather ingenious piece of legislation that architecturally created the \nbalance between security and liberty in the wake of the Watergate \nscandal in the mid-1970s. Democrats and Republicans came together and \nsaid: How can we guarantee that we can gather information to keep our \nNation safe and secure from those who would do us harm and \nsimultaneously protect the more than two centuries of liberties and \nrights that Americans have come to associate with our Constitution--the \nrule of law?\n  This was not an easy matter, striking that balance, that tension \nwhich has existed for more than 220 years in our country, and I would \nbe the first to admit that. So I have great admiration for those who \nstruggled with it.\n  In 1978, the FISA--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--Court \nwas established, a secret court, the members of which are appointed by \nthe Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The members of that court \nare sitting Federal judges across the land. No one can ever know who \nthese judges are. They are anonymous in that sense, and they are called \nupon at a moment's\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\nnotice to determine whether probable cause exists for a warrant to be \nissued to allow our Government to require institutions, public or \nprivate, to provide information that could affect the safety and \nsecurity of our country. That has been the history.\n  Since 1978, time and again the Congress of the United States has \namended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Usually, it was \namended in order to keep pace with the ability of those who would do us \nharm to utilize new technologies, new sources of information that could \nprove to be dangerous for our country; but simultaneously, legislation \nwas upgraded so that the new means of gathering information, of \ndetermining who would do us harm, were also improving. In almost every \ninstance, the amendments and the changes to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act were adopted unanimously by members of both political \nparties.\n  That brings us, of course, to this year, with the amendments being \noffered to this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n  Events occurred either prior to 9/11 or shortly thereafter which have \ncaused the most significant debate yet on FISA. There are those who \nhave argued that, in fact, the surveillance activity that is the \nsubject of the retroactive immunity actually began prior to the attacks \nof 9/11. The bulk of the evidence seems to point to the fact that this \nsurveillance began shortly thereafter.\n  I would not be standing here, as I have said before, had this been a \nmomentary lapse of judgment, considering the emotions of the attacks \nhere on our country. I could understand why a President, why a telecom \nindustry, in the wake of 9/11, would have responded to a request to \ngather information quickly to determine not only who did us harm but \nwhat additional dangers they posed to us. I would not be standing here \nif this had been an administration that had not engaged in a pattern of \nbehavior over the years that suggested they had less than a high regard \nfor the rule of law. But as we have now learned, this was not a matter \nof a week or a month or a year. This warrantless invasion of our \nprivacy went on for 5 long years, without any rule of law behind it \nexcept the word of an American President and apparently the sanction of \nthe Attorney General of the United States.\n  FISA specifically said in 1978 that you must have a warrant to do \nthis. We even changed the law, as you know, Mr. President, to say that \nyou could even get the warrant after the fact if the emergency was such \nthat you didn't have the opportunity to get the warrant but went after \nthe fact, immediately thereafter.\n  I would point out, Mr. President, as I did in some detail last \nevening for almost 3 hours on this floor, that the President's \nwarrantless wiretapping program was not a selective or focused \nsurveillance merely on those who were outside the country or those who \nwere suspected or might be involved in threatening activities. This \ndecision to gather information included literally every phone call, \nevery fax, every e-mail, every image that went through 16 phone \ncompanies of our country, using what they call splitters to literally \nvacuum up everything that came in. If the allegations are true, it was \none of the single largest invasions of privacy in the history of our \ncountry, all done without a warrant and without a court order.\n  We discovered this because of a whistleblower and a report in the \nmedia that revealed the program. Otherwise, I suspect it would be going \non as I speak, without any interruption whatsoever. In fact, the only \ninterruption that occurred, I might point out--because the argument has \nbeen made that these companies were acting out of patriotism--came, \naccording to some reports when the Federal Government stopped paying \nthe phone companies for collecting it.\n\n  I would also point out that not every phone company complied. I know \nthe argument has been made: Look, everyone did it. It is a common \nargument, one we made to our parents, usually: Everyone was doing it. \nWe all remember the answer we received from our parents. Well, the \nargument here is: Almost everyone was doing it. Quest decided not to. \nWhen the request was made of them to gather information without a \nwarrant, they said: Give us a court order, and we will comply. A court \norder was never forthcoming, of course, and they never participated.\n  So this December, we arrived at this debate about whether to grant \nthe telecoms retroactive immunity. Three other committees had examined \nthis issue, and all three of the committees, in the House and in this \nbody, had determined that retroactive immunity was not warranted. Only \none committee decided it was, but that committee has prevailed in the \nlast several days, weeks, and months in this debate, and as such we are \nnow confronted with cloture being invoked, cutting off debate here \nabout the subject matter. And given the votes today, in all likelihood \nthis body is not going to change its mind on this issue. Our only hope, \nthose of us who feel strongly about this, is that the other body, the \nHouse of Representatives, which has taken a very different point of \nview, will be able to prevail in the conference between these two \nbills, and deny retroactive immunity.\n  Let me point out quickly that denying retroactive immunity does not \nmean the phone companies will necessarily be found guilty of doing \nsomething wrong. All it means is that the coequal branch of Government, \nthe judicial branch, will get a chance to look at whether what they did \nwas legal. I have my own opinions about this, but my opinions should \nnot prevail, nor should the opinions of 51 Members of this body. We are \nnot the judicial branch, we are the legislative branch.\n  The Founders of this great Republic of ours created three coequal \nbranches of Government, and the judicial branch was designed and \ncreated to check the actions of the executive and legislative branches \nand determine whether things we did were constitutional--legal--or not. \nThat is why they exist. So the debate about whether what the companies \ndid or did not do is legal is not a matter for this body to determine, \nany more than it is for the executive branch. It is the judicial branch \nthat should make that determination. Yet, by the action we took earlier \ntoday, we are now going to close the door on determining whether the \naction taken by the phone companies was legal.\n  Sweep it under the carpet, close the door, and we will set the \nprecedent for some future Congress, which will point to this debate and \nits conclusion and decide that the Congress of the United States found \nthat the FISA Court was not needed or, that in fact the President could \ncollect whatever data and information he wanted--maybe medical records, \nmaybe financial records, maybe personal histories of families.\n  I feel passionately about this issue. This is the first time in my \nquarter of a century service here that I have engaged in what might be \ncalled some ``extended debate''--that is how deeply I care about this \nissue.\n  Nothing is more important, in my view, than the rule of law and the \nConstitution. No threat is so urgent that we should be willing to \nabandon the rule of law. But that is exactly what we have done. And it \nis a false and phony argument to claim that failing to do so would \njeopardize our security. There is a long history of the judicial branch \nof Government in this country dealing with sensitive national security \nmatters in camera, without revealing state secrets. The suggestion that \nwe cannot possibly let the courts look at the use of warrantless \nwiretapping is so false on its face it is hardly worthy of an argument \nto the contrary.\n  In fact, Judge Walker, a Republican appointee to the Federal bench, I \nmight point out, has ridiculed the argument that these matters could \nnot go before the judicial branch for review. There is no longer a \ndebate about whether the wiretapping program is in the public--it is. \nAnd the means and technology used to do it have publicly been discussed \nand debated.\n  This decision deprives us of the opportunity to determine exactly \nwhat happened. I would further point out that but for the insistence of \nthe chairman of this committee and the ranking member, and I suspect \nothers, the administration would have succeeded in immunizing everyone \ninvolved with this, everyone within the executive branch, the White \nHouse, the Justice Department.\n  The chairman and the ranking member said that was going too far. But \nthat request is instructive. What do we\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\nlearn from it? Why did the administration demand of the Intelligence \nCommittee that everyone associated with this matter be immunized \nagainst any further legal action? What was the motive behind it? \nDoesn't that suggest that something else must be going on?\n  That is where we are in all of this. Again, I apologize to my \ncolleagues and others for taking so much time to talk about this. But \nas I mentioned last evening, I grew up in a family with a father who \nwas deeply involved in the rule of law. He was a prosecutor at the \nNuremberg trials in 1945 and 1946, a rather unique moment in American \nhistory, where because of an American President, because of a Secretary \nof War, because of a Supreme Court Justice and a handful of others, \nAmerica did not yield to the vengeance, even for those enemies we hated \nthe most: Nazis who had incinerated 6 million Jews and 5 million others \ntargeted for their politics, religion, and otherwise. Why would you \npossibly give that crowd a trial? A handful of Americans, Republicans \nand Democrats, got together and said: America is different. We believe \nin the rule of law in the United States. And we believe the rule of law \nis something that does not necessarily belong to one Nation or \nsovereignty; it belongs to all people, reaching back to our own \nfounding documents that tell us that the rule of law, not the rule of \nman, ought to prevail.\n  So the United States, along with our very reluctant allies, created \nthe Nuremberg trials, which established the moral high ground for the \nUnited States in so many ways. As a result, 21 defendants in the first \ntrial got a lawyer and got to present evidence and defend themselves--\nbecause we followed the rule of law.\n  It was the moral high ground and the basis for so much else that was \ncreated in the post World War II period: The international courts, the \nU.N. system, the NATO system, the Marshall Plan. All these institutions \nsprang from that what we helped create in the wake of World War II and \nthe Nuremberg trials.\n  So I grew up around a dining room table where the rule of law was \ntalked about all the time. I was taught that our Constitution did not \nbelong to a political party, it did not belong to politicians or \ncandidates.\n  And I remember that great scene in the movie ``A Man For All \nSeasons,'' where Thomas More is asked if he would not be willing to cut \ndown all the laws in England to get his hands on the devil.\n  And More responds, and I am paraphrasing his quote: When I have cut \ndown every law in England to get to the devil and the devil comes after \nme, what laws will stand there to protect me?\n  So while some may feel comfort that they are being protected by this \ndecision we have made, they should remind themselves the worm does \nturn, and someday they may find themselves on the opposite side of this \nquestion.\n  So this debate should not be framed as the issue of the hour; rather, \nit is about the principle behind it, and that is the rule of law. The \npower of courts to decide the legality and illegality of actions is so \ndeeply imbedded in our Constitution, so deeply imbedded in the fabric \nof how we conduct ourselves, that it ought not to be the subject of a \npartisan discussion and debate.\n  That is why I have fought to keep this day from coming with \neverything I had in me. I have not fought alone. Many average Americans \nhave given me strength for this fight, strength that comes from the \npassion and eloquence of citizens who do not have to be involved, but \nchoose to be involved. I thank them for it.\n  But today when I speak in this body against this immunity and for the \nrule of law, I am speaking for a minority. And respecting the rule of \nlaw anywhere means respecting it everywhere, even when it means we do \nnot win. The rule of law says we, the minority, cannot stand forever; \nand having made our case with all the fire in us, we stand down and \nwait for a different day and a different set of circumstances.\n\n  I will say this, though. I have seen some dark days in this Chamber; \nin my mind, one of the worst was September 28, 2007. That was the day \nthe Senate voted to strip habeas corpus and tolerate torture.\n  Today, February 12, 2008, is nearly as dark: the day the Senate voted \nto ensure secrecy and to exempt corporations from the rule of law. \nFrankly, I have seen a lot of darkness in recent years, as one by one \nour dearest traditions of constitutional governance have been attacked.\n  At each new attack, millions of Americans have stood up in outrage; \nbut millions more have answered with patience. One might fault them for \nthat, but I do not. More than two centuries of democratic tradition \nhave nurtured that patience; it speaks well of our Democratic faith \nthat so many take the rule of law in America as a given.\n  If millions have not yet noticed the rule of law falling, that is \nbecause it has so far to fall. But fall it will, if we remove our \nsupport for it. The law in America is not a gift or an inheritance; it \nis the active work of every generation to preserve and protect it.\n  As America's patience wears thinner and thinner, and as more and more \ncitizens take up that active work, our minority will--I have faith that \nit will--make itself a majority.\n  But today was not that day. And so the Senate has signed its name to \nthis immunity, this silencing of our courts, this officially sanctioned \nsecrecy, without a majority of us evening laying eyes on the secret \npapers that are supposed to prove the President's case.\n  Retroactive immunity is a disgrace in itself. And in the last months \nI believe we have proved that beyond a reasonable doubt. But it is even \nmore disgraceful in all it represents. It is the mindset that the \nChurch Committee summed up so eloquently three decades ago.\n\n       The view that the traditional American principles of \n     justice and fair play have no place in our struggle against \n     the enemies of freedom.\n\n  That view created the Nixonian secrecy of the 1970s, and the Church \nCommittee wrote those words, in part, as a rebuke to our predecessors \nin this Chamber who for years let secrecy and executive abuses slide. \nBut today those words take on a new meaning. Today they rebuke us. They \nshame us for our lack of faith that we can, at the same time, keep our \ncountry safe and our Constitution whole.\n  When the 21st century version of the Church Committee convenes to \ninvestigate the abuse of the past years, how will it judge us? What \nwill it say about us when they look back on our actions? When it reads \nthrough the records of our debate--not if, but when--what will it find?\n  When the President asked us to repudiate the Geneva Conventions and \nstrip away the right of habeas corpus, how did we respond?\n  When images of American troops tormenting detainees were broadcasted \naround the world, how did we protest?\n  When stories of secret prisons and outsourced torture became \nimpossible to deny, how did we resist?\n  And on February 12, 2008, when we were asked to put corporations \nexplicitly outside the law and accept at face value the argument that \nsome are literally too rich to be sued, how did we vote?\n  All of those questions are coming for us. All of them and more. And \nin the quiet of his or her own conscience, each Senator knows what the \nanswers are.\n  I fought so long against retroactive immunity because, in this huge \nfabric of lawlessness, it was the closest thread to grab. I believed if \nwe grabbed hold and pulled, it would begin to unravel. That has not \nhappened.\n  But if we believe that each assault against the rule of law was an \naccident, that each was isolated, we are deluding ourselves. If the \npast is any guide, there will be another one. And hope, as they say, \nsprings eternal. I hope we will stand up then.\n  And perhaps we will have the chance to do so very soon. As I \nmentioned a few minutes ago, the House of Representatives has passed a \nversion of this bill without retroactive immunity. It will be the job \nof the conference between the House of Representatives and the Senate \nto reconcile the two versions of this bill.\n  And before I stand down, I wish to implore the members of that \ncommittee, in the strongest terms I can find, to strip retroactive \nimmunity from this bill once and for all. Remember, this is about more \nthan a few telephone calls, a few companies, a few lawsuits. If the \nsupporters of retroactive immunity keep this small, they win. In truth, \nthe issue we have debated for the last few months, the issue\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\nthat will finally come to a head in this conference committee, is so \nmuch more. At stake is our latest answer to the defining question: The \nrule of law or the rule of men?\n  That question never goes away. As long as there are free societies, \ngenerations of leaders will struggle mightily to answer it. Each \ngeneration must answer for itself; and just because our Founders \nanswered it correctly does not mean they are bound by their choice. In \nthat, as in all decisions, we are entirely free; the whole burden falls \non us.\n  But we can take counsel. We can listen to those who came before us, \nwho made the right choice, even when our Nation's very survival was at \nrisk. They knew that the rule of law was far more rooted in our \ncharacter than any one man's lawlessness.\n  I do not think that has changed at all. Secure in that faith, I will \nsit down now and end my part in this conversation. But when the \nquestion of the rule of law or the rule of men comes again, which it \nsurely will, I will be proud to stand up once more. And if this bill \ncomes back with retroactive immunity, I will speak against that \ntravesty--the denial of the rule of law in favor of the rule of men.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I rise today to express concerns about the FISA \nAmendments Act S. 2248 before us. This morning, the Senate lost an \nopportunity to strengthen this bill. And, unfortunately, without those \ncritical provisions, I will have to oppose the bill before us. I thank \nthe Senator from Connecticut for his leadership in fighting against \nthis bill. I know he will be back on this issue at every opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I rise to join this debate. I have been, over many \nyears, interested and involved in privacy rights issues in a variety of \ncapacities. Certainly, the residents of my state care passionately \nabout their rights to privacy.\n  This administration has done a lot to blur the line between foreign \nintelligence gathering and spying on U.S. citizens. Now, the \nlegislation before us today could have been improved to better protect \nthe rights of U.S. citizens by passing amendments proposed by my \ncolleague Senator Feingold, but we turned those down.\n  Instead what has been a delicate balance in the United States to \nprotect the rights of privacy of U.S. citizens and national security is \ngoing to be further eroded.\n  Congress has limited powers and so does the President. The President \ndoes not and should not have unchecked power in this or any other area. \nIt would be contrary to our American values and our system of \ngovernment, which has endured for more than 231 years.\n  When strengthening national security, we must also safeguard civil \nliberties and the privacy rights of American citizens. I cannot support \na bill that fails to strike this critical balance, as the original \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) did. We didn't allow the \ngovernment to have unchecked unlimited authority then, and we shouldn't \nallow it now. There have been times in the past when both Democratic \nand Republican administrations lost sight of the need to protect U.S. \ncitizens' privacy rights.\n  We all want to protect the United States, but how good is this \napproach if the end result is that everyone thinks that there is a back \ndoor to our computer operating systems, a back door to our \ntelecommunication systems? Who will want to do business in the United \nStates if they think there are no secure systems, only systems to which \nthe U.S. government will have access? Communications over the Internet, \nregardless of country of origin or country of destination, know no \nnational boundaries, and travel by the most efficient route. If the Act \nas currently drafted goes forward, it may lead to an international \nreexamination of how the Internet should operate. FISA has been a very \nimportant part of our checks and balances.\n  In our country, a Senator cannot pick or choose what laws they follow \nand neither should the President nor telecommunication companies. \nCongress should not be providing blanket immunity for \ntelecommunications companies that cooperated with the Administration's \nwarrantless wiretapping programs. We don't know precisely what those \ncompanies did or the full extent of what they did.\n  I believe the Federal courts should be allowed to rule on the \nlegality of the companies' conduct. Congress should not move to preempt \njudicial decisions. Special procedures can be put in place that could \nallow such cases to move ahead without revealing classified information \nor damaging U.S. national security. Specifically, I want to touch on \nthe lawsuit the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed against a \nlarge telecom company, accusing it of violating FISA, on behalf of a \nclass of its customers. If retroactive immunity is granted to telecom \nproviders, the lawsuit will be dismissed, and the public will never get \nan opportunity of getting even a glimpse of what happened.\n  The issue of the Federal Government and telecoms possibly violating \nFISA came to light in part as a result of the actions of a brave \nwhistleblower. According to media reports and internal AT documents \nprovided by this whistleblower, Mark Klein, the telecom company \nallegedly splits off a copy of all of the Internet traffic transported \nover fiber-optic cables running though its San Francisco office and \ndiverts it all--e-mails, IMs, web browsing, everything--to a secure \nroom under the control of the National Security Agency that contains \nsophisticated data-mining equipment capable of monitoring all the \ncommunications' content in real-time. What appears to have happened is \na major change in how electronic surveillance is conducted in this \ncountry. Surveillance used to be particularized--investigators would \npick a target and then intercept the communications of that target. But \nnow, it appears the Administration is using advances in technology to \nmove to a wholesale surveillance regime, where everything is \nintercepted and then investigators sift through the hay to pick their \ntargets. In other words, the Administration is seizing millions of \nAmericans' communications--billions of phone calls and e-mails and \nmore--in a 21st century high-tech equivalent of the King's general \nwarrants that our Founders fought a revolution to avoid.\n  The Electronic Frontier Foundation wants a court to be able to decide \nwhether this new mode of surveillance is or can ever be legal, under \nFISA or the fourth amendment. Letting the courts decide that question \nis critical to checks and balances, critical to ensuring that Congress' \nprivacy laws are followed and the fourth amendment respected, and \ncritical to preventing abuses of power. Therefore, I urge my colleagues \nto allow this case to move forward. I urge them to allow the Federal \ncourts to rule on the legality of the companies' conduct. These are the \nissues, I believe, that must be reviewed by the courts. I think passing \nthis legislation really preempts what is critical judicial review and \nundermines the fundamental principle of checks and balances in our \nsystem.\n  I know these are challenging times. But we have to remember our \nConstitution and to remember what is effective policy. Everybody in \nAmerica wants to be safer and we want to use technology to protect our \nnational security. But, technology can be used in a way that protects \nprivacy rights. This all goes back to checks and balances. Instead of \nrushing to dismantle them, Congress needs to maintain and strengthen \nthese checks and balances in order to prevent abuses of power. This \nmodel has worked for our country.\n  I encourage my colleagues to make sure we remember the fourth \namendment and we remember our citizens' rights to privacy as well in \nconsidering this legislation, which I hope the Senate will turn down \nthis afternoon.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, under a unanimous Consent agreement, \nthe Senate has accepted three amendments to the FISA Amendments Act of \n2008. I would like to say a word about each.\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts has authored a helpful \namendment to ensure that the Government will not intentionally acquire \ncommunications where the sender and all intended recipients are known \nat the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States.\n  Our bill, S. 2248, is not intended to authorize the intelligence \ncommunity to acquire purely domestic communications.\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\n  Electronic surveillance of purely domestic communications requires a \ncourt order under title I of FISA. In addition, S. 2248 explicitly \nprohibits the targeting of persons known at the time of acquisition to \nbe located inside the United States.\n  The importance of the Kennedy amendment is that it reinforces our \nintent. It should put to rest any doubts about what the Senate intends \nwith respect to protecting the communications of persons within the \nUnited States. I am grateful for the willingness of the Senator Kennedy \nto work with the committee on this amendment.\n  I would also like to acknowledge his leading role in the history of \nFISA as the sponsor of the original FISA legislation, first in 1976, \nand then when FISA was enacted in 1978. Senator Kennedy helped the \nCongress then to enact legislation that protects both our national \nsecurity and the rights of Americans. We are grateful that he has \nstepped forward again to help us achieve those goals.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement, the Senate has accepted an \namendment by Senator Whitehouse that resolves an important question \nabout the status, pending appeal, of an order by the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court requiring correction of deficiencies in \nintelligence collection procedures under the new title VII of FISA.\n  The amendment requires the FISA Court of Review to determine, within \n60 days of the Government's appeal, whether all or part of a FISA Court \norder requiring correction will be implemented during the appeal. The \nGovernment may continue collection until the appellate court makes that \ndetermination, and longer if the Court so determines. The 60-day \nrequirement ensures that the matter will receive appellate attention \nwithout undue delay.\n  We appreciate Senator Whitehouse's successful effort to resolve this \nmatter.\n  Finally, under the unanimous consent agreement, the Senate has \naccepted an amendment by Vice Chairman Bond to delete a statutory \nrequirement that appeals in cases either challenging or seeking to \nenforce directives to companies be filed within 7 days. The amendment \nleaves it to the FISA Court or the Court of Review to establish that \ndeadline as they do for all other appeals under FISA.\n  The amendment recognizes the responsibility of those courts to \nestablish rules. And it recognizes that both the Government and \ncarriers may require additional time to evaluate whether an appeal \nshould be filed.\n  I appreciate the vice chairman's effort to resolve this matter.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Senate has \nrejected several commonsense improvements to the Intelligence \nCommittee's FISA proposal. I commend my colleagues, Senators Dodd, \nFeingold, Tester, Webb, Whitehouse, Leahy, Specter and others, for \nproposing these solutions, and I welcome the outpouring of interest on \nthis issue from informed and concerned citizens around the country.\n  News last week from the Intelligence Committee hearing underscored \nthe importance of ensuring that our surveillance laws protect our \nsecurity, just as we must vigilantly safeguard our civil liberties. \nDirector of National Intelligence McConnell warned that al-Qaida \ncontinues to train and recruit new adherents to attack within the \nUnited States, and such reports should serve to unite us in common \npurpose against the terrorists that threaten our homeland. Instead, \nPresident Bush is using this debate once again to divide us through a \npolitics of fear.\n  I was disappointed to learn of the President's threat to veto any \nFISA bill that does not include an unprecedented grant of immunity for \ntelephone companies that cooperated with the President's warrantless \nwiretapping program. Why the President continues to try to hold this \nimportant legislation captive to that special interest provision defies \nexplanation.\n  I was proud to cosponsor the Dodd-Feingold amendment to strike the \nimmunity provision from the bill. However, with the defeat of this \namendment, telephone companies will not be held accountable even if it \ncould be proven that they clearly and knowingly broke the law and \nnullified the privacy rights of Americans. This is a matter for the \ncourts to decide, not for preemptive action by the Senate.\n  We can give our intelligence and law enforcement community the powers \nthey need to track down and take out terrorists without undermining our \ncommitment to the rule of law or our basic rights and liberties. That \nis why I cosponsored the Feingold amendment, which would have prevented \nthe Government from using these extraordinary warrantless powers to \nconduct ``bulk collection'' of American information. I also supported \nthe Feingold-Webb-Tester amendment to protect the privacy of Americans' \ncommunications by requiring court orders to monitor American \ncommunications on American soil, unless there is reason to believe that \nthe communications involve terrorist activities directed at the United \nStates or the monitoring is necessary to prevent death or serious \nbodily harm. Unfortunately, these amendments were defeated as well. \nThese are the types of narrowly tailored, commonsense fixes that would \nhave allowed the Government to conduct surveillance without sacrificing \nour precious civil liberties.\n  For over 6 years since the attacks of 9/11, this administration has \napproached issues related to terrorism as opportunities to use fear to \nadvance ideological policies and political agendas. It is time for this \npolitics of fear to end.\n  We need durable tools in this fight against terrorism--tools that \nprotect the liberties we cherish and the security we demand. We are \ntrying to protect the American people, not special interests like the \ntelecommunications industry. We are trying to ensure that we don't \nsacrifice our liberty in pursuit of security, and it is past time for \nthe administration to join us in that effort.\n  There is no need for the goals of security and liberty to be \ncontradictory.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last year Congress passed a temporary bill \nwith a 6-month time limit that would give us the opportunity to carry \nout a thorough, thoughtful examination of how to utilize complicated \nnew technologies in the surveillance of suspected terrorists without \ninvading the privacy of innocent Americans. In the months since we \npassed that temporary act, we have worked in a bipartisan manner to \nconsider the best course forward for permanent changes to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act. Despite the enormous complexity of these \nissues, we reached a bipartisan consensus on the key provisions \ncontained in title I of the bill we are considering today.\n  I believe that title I of the bill before us appropriately provides \nthe intelligence community the authority it needs to collect \nintelligence information on suspected terrorists. The collection of \nthat intelligence is important to our national security and merits \ncongressional support. That is why I helped write the Rockefeller-Levin \nsubstitute amendment that we voted on last summer, why I voted in favor \nof the Leahy substitute amendment that we considered in January, and \nwhy I support title I of the bill before us today. In my view, the \nRockefeller-Levin substitute, the Leahy substitute, and title I of this \nbill all provide for the appropriate collection of intelligence \ninformation on suspected terrorists.\n  Title I of this bill would provide the needed authority for \ncollection of that information in a responsible manner.\n  Title I of this bill, unlike the temporary act which we passed last \nsummer, would not authorize the targeting of U.S. persons for \nelectronic surveillance without probable cause.\n  Title I of this bill, unlike the temporary act, would not authorize \nthe administration to collect communications--including communications \nto and from U.S. persons--for months without even submitting the \ncollection program for court approval.\n  Title I of this bill, unlike the temporary act, would not authorize \nthe administration to continue to collect such communications for an \nextended period even after the FISA Court has specifically rejected an \napplication for approval.\n  Title I of this bill, unlike the temporary act, would expressly \nauthorize judicial review of the targeting and so-called minimization \nprocedures in order to protect the privacy rights of U.S. persons.\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\n  Title I of this bill, unlike the temporary act, would require regular \ninspector general reviews and regular reports to Congress on any \nauthorized collection program.\n  I congratulate Senator Rockefeller and other colleagues on their \nsuccess in achieving the administration's support for these well-\ncrafted title I provisions, which are significant improvements over the \ntemporary bill hastily adopted last year.\n  Title II of the bill is a different story. Title II would eliminate \naccountability by granting retroactive immunity for telecommunications \nproviders that disclosed communications and other confidential \ninformation of their customers at the behest of Government officials. \nThey did this despite a law specifically making it illegal to do so. \nUnlike title I, there is no bipartisan agreement on title II.\n  Title II would require dismissal of lawsuits brought by persons \nclaiming injury from interception and disclosure of their \ncommunications, even if the activity resulting in the injury was \nillegal. It would require dismissal of lawsuits, even if the disclosure \nviolated the constitutional rights of individuals whose personal \ninformation was illegally disclosed. It would require dismissal of \nlawsuits, even if innocent U.S. citizens were damaged by the disclosure \nor compromise of confidential personal information.\n  Retroactive immunity is not fair. It is not wise. And it is not \nnecessary.\n  Retroactive immunity is not fair because it leaves American citizens \nwho may have been harmed by the alleged unlawful conduct of these \nproviders without any legal remedy.\n  Retroactive immunity is not wise because it precludes any judicial \nreview of that conduct. I am deeply concerned that if we act here to \nimmunize private parties who participated in a program that appears to \nhave been clearly illegal, we may encourage others to engage in such \nillegal activities in the future. In a free society, illegal activity \ncannot be excused on the grounds that Government officials asked you to \ncarry it out. There must be accountability for illegal acts. As \nwritten, title II eliminates some critically required accountability.\n  Nor is retroactive immunity necessary. Congress has already ensured \nthe future cooperation of the telecommunications providers with the \nintelligence community in the Protect America Act adopted last August. \nThat act authorizes the Attorney General or the Director of National \nIntelligence to direct telecommunications providers to disclose certain \ninformation and provides prospective immunity to telecommunications \nproviders that cooperate with such directives.\n  Title I of the bill before us appropriately continues to provide \nprospective immunity to telecommunications providers. Title I states:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other law, no cause of action shall lie \n     in any court against any electronic communication service \n     provider for providing any information, facilities, or \n     assistance in accordance with a directive issued by the \n     Attorney General or the Director of National Intelligence \n     pursuant to the act.\n\n  In light of the prospective immunity in title I, which is \nappropriately in this bill, the retroactive immunity of title II is not \nnecessary to ensure the future cooperation of telecommunications \nproviders that receive legitimate requests for information from the \nintelligence community.\n  The argument has been made that we must provide retroactive immunity \nto the telecommunications providers to ensure the cases against them \nare immediately dismissed because if the cases are permitted to \nproceed, vital national security information will be disclosed. But the \ncourts have numerous tools at their disposal to protect such \ninformation and have successfully used these tools throughout our \nhistory. They can review evidence in a classified setting; they can \nredact documents; they can even dismiss a case for national security \nreasons if they deem it necessary to do so.\n  Some have even taken the position that the mere existence of this \nlitigation, even without the disclosure of any information, will \nsomehow help the terrorists. But the President has already disclosed \nthe existence of the collection program at issue. It has been discussed \nin Congress and in the press. The Director of National Intelligence has \npublicly discussed the program.\n  There is a way to properly immunize from legal liability \ntelecommunications providers that acted in good faith based on the \nassurances of appropriate administration officials. The way to do that \nis by substituting the United States for the telecommunications \nproviders as the defendant in lawsuits based on the actions of those \nproviders. That substitution would safeguard telecommunications \nproviders from liability just as effectively as the retroactive \nimmunity language in title II of the bill. But unlike the retroactive \nimmunity language of title II, it would not leave persons who can prove \nthey were victims of unlawful actions without a remedy.\n  We can ensure that any such innocent victims retain whatever legal \nrights they have under applicable law, except that the U.S. Government \nwould be substituted for the telecommunications providers as the \ndefendant in such lawsuits. And it is appropriate that the Government \nbe liable rather than the telecommunications providers, since the \ndisclosures were allegedly made by the providers in these cases at the \nrequest of senior executive branch officials based on appeals to help \nsafeguard U.S. security and assurances that the providers would be \nprotected from liability regardless of the requirements of law.\n  We had a number of opportunities to provide equity both to the \ntelecommunications providers and to any injured citizens.\n  We had the opportunity to adopt the Dodd-Feingold amendment, which \nwould have struck title II from the bill, allowing us to adopt a new \napproach that protects both the equities of telecommunications \nproviders that acted in good faith and those of people who were \nallegedly injured by their illegal actions.\n  We had the opportunity to adopt the Specter-Whitehouse substitution \namendment, which would have fully protected telecommunications \nproviders, without depriving American citizens who were harmed by \nunlawful collection of their personal information of a legal remedy. It \ndid so by substituting the United States for the telecommunications \nproviders as the defendant in lawsuits based on the actions of those \nproviders. That substitution would safeguard telecommunications \nproviders from liability just as effectively as the retroactive \nimmunity language in title II of the bill.\n\n       And we had the opportunity to adopt the Feinstein \n     amendment, which would have limited immunity to those \n     telecommunications providers that are found by a court to \n     have acted in reasonable, good-faith reliance on assurances \n     from executive branch officials.\n\n  The adoption of these amendments would have made a significant \nimprovement to the bill. With their rejection, I cannot support this \nbill despite my support for title I, which again, appropriately, \nauthorizes the collection of intelligence. But it is my hope that a \nbill comes from conference with the House of Representatives that \nincludes appropriate changes to eliminate unfair, unwise, and \nunnecessary retroactive immunity provisions.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nFISA is intended to protect our national security. It is also intended \nto protect the privacy and civil liberties of Americans. The law was \npassed to protect the rights of Americans after the excesses of an \nearlier time.\n  We are debating amendments to this important law. I had hoped the \nSenate would act to improve the bill reported by the Select Committee \non Intelligence. It has not. I had hoped the Senate would incorporate \nimprovements included in the House-passed RESTORE Act and the bill \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. It has not.\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\n  I had hoped the administration would work with us. It has not. \nInstead, having gotten exactly the bill they want, in the way they \nwant, from the Intelligence Committee, they have threatened a \nPresidential veto if we improve this bill in any way or fix its flaws.\n  I had hoped that Republican Senators would work with us as we have \nworked together to amend FISA dozens of times over the last 30 years \nand to update it in more than a dozen ways even since September 11, \n2001. But instead of working in a bipartisan fashion, as I have seen \nbefore in my 34 years in the Senate, in an unprecedented way, \nRepublicans voted lockstep to table the Judiciary Committee \nimprovements and virtually lockstep against every individual amendment \nand improvement.\n  Worse, the Republican leadership has stalled action on the measure \nfor weeks. They continue to insist it is their way or no way. Sadly, \nwith the acquiescence of even some on this side of the aisle, they have \ncontrolled the debate, the bill, and the final result in the Senate.\n  Working together we could have done so much better. I look forward to \nworking with the House to make improvements that are needed to this \nmeasure before I can support it.\n  The process has been, in large part, a repeat of that which led to \nthe so-called Protect America Act last summer. That ill-conceived \nmeasure was rushed through the Senate in an atmosphere of fear and \nintimidation just before the August recess, and after the \nadministration had broken their word and reneged on agreements reached \nwith congressional leaders. The bill was hurriedly passed under intense \npartisan pressure from the administration. It provided sweeping new \npowers to the Government to engage in surveillance, without a warrant, \nof calls to and from the United States involving Americans, and it \nprovided no meaningful protection for the privacy and civil liberties \nof Americans who were on those calls.\n  I was here when we first passed FISA because we knew what happened \nwhen we had an out-of-control administration. We saw it during the \nWatergate years. We saw it with J. Edgar Hoover. We saw those who \nwiretapped people because they didn't like what they said, they \ndisagreed with the administration; they actually raised questions about \nthe Vietnam war. Sometimes it would help if everybody read a history \nbook every now and then around here. Some seem too willing to give up \nthe liberties for which we fought.\n  The Senate should have considered and incorporated more meaningful \ncorrections to the so-called Protect America Act. Before that flawed \nbill passed, Senator Rockefeller and I and several others in the House \nand Senate had worked hard and in good faith with the administration to \ncraft legislation that solved an identified problem but also protected \nAmericans' privacy and liberties.\n  We all want to protect our security. We all want the ability to go \nafter those who would do this country harm. And we drafted legislation \nthat would have taken care of the problem they told us about.\n  But just before the August recess, we got a call. Basically, the \nDirector of National Intelligence told us they could not keep their \nword, they could not keep the administration's word, and the \nadministration decided to ram through its version of the so-called \nProtect America Act, with excessive grants of Government authority and \nwithout accountability or checks and balances. They refused to consider \nany other way.\n  After almost 6 years of breaking the law and violating FISA through \nsecret warrantless wiretapping programs, that was wrong. A number of us \nsupported a better balanced alternative, and we voted against the \nProtect America Act as drafted by the administration and passed by the \nSenate.\n  Ironically, the reason we were even voting on it is that the press \nfound out how the administration was breaking the law. Even though the \nadministration was required by statute to tell leaders in Congress what \nthey were doing, which was a clear violation of the law, they had \nfailed to do that. Fortunately, we still have some remnant of a free \npress in this country and they found it out.\n  Because of a sunset provision, we had a chance to revisit that matter \nand correct it. The Judiciary Committees and the Intelligence \nCommittees of the Senate and the House spent the past months \nconsidering changes to FISA. In the Senate Judiciary Committee, we held \nopen hearings and countless briefings and meetings to consider new \nsurveillance legislation, including classified meetings. We considered \nlegislative language in a number of open business meetings of the \ncommittee, and we reported a good bill to the Senate. This was before \nlast Thanksgiving.\n  Instead of that bill, a good bill, the Senate is poised to pass a \nbill that will permit the Government to review more Americans' \ncommunications with little in the way of meaningful court supervision.\n  I support surveillance targeting foreign threats, but I wanted to \nmake sure we protect those American liberties that, after all, we \nfought a Revolutionary War to protect and a civil war and two World \nWars and not just give it away because some people around here get cold \nfeet when threatened by the administration.\n  Attorney General Mukasey said at his nomination hearing that \n``protecting civil liberties, and people's confidence that those \nliberties are protected, is a part of protecting national security.'' I \nagree with him about that. That is what the Senate judiciary bill would \nhave done.\n  The administration insists on avoiding accountability by including \nblanket retroactive immunity in their bill. It would grant blanket \nretroactive immunity to telecommunications carriers for their \nwarrantless surveillance activities from 2001 through earlier this year \ncontrary to FISA and in violation of the privacy rights of Americans.\n  The administration violated FISA by conducting warrantless \nsurveillance for more than 5 years. They got caught. Frankly, if they \nhad not gotten caught, they would probably still be doing it. When the \npublic found out about the President's illegal surveillance of \nAmericans, the administration and telephone companies were sued by \ncitizens who believed their privacy and their rights were violated.\n\n  So now the administration is trying to get this Congress to terminate \nthose lawsuits. But don't believe the crocodile tears of this \nadministration, saying they are doing it to protect these telephone \ncompanies. This is, after all, the same administration that owed the \ntelephone companies millions of dollars in unpaid bills for \nwiretapping. They will not even pay their bills.\n  No, the reason they want this provision is to protect those in the \nadministration who broke the law. They don't want anybody to find out \nwhich members of the Department of Justice so thwarted the law in \nwriting cockamamie legal opinions that a first-year law student would \nsee through. They want to insulate themselves from accountability. I am \nnot going to support such an end run around accountability.\n  The administration knows these lawsuits may be the only way that it \nis ever going to be called to account for its flagrant disrespect of \nthe law. In running its illegal program of warrantless surveillance, \nthe administration relied on legal opinions prepared in secret and \nshown to only a tiny cabal of like-minded officials.\n  This ensured that the administration received the advice they wanted. \nDon't tell us what the law is; tell us what we want the law to be. I \nused to read my children ``Alice in Wonderland.'' Now I read my \ngrandchildren ``Alice in Wonderland.'' This sounds like ``Alice in \nWonderland.''\n  Jack Goldsmith, a conservative Republican who came in briefly to head \nthe Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, described the program \nas a ``legal mess.'' This administration does not want a court to have \na chance to look at this legal mess, and retroactive immunity will \nassure not that they are protecting telephone companies, but that they \nwill cover their own backsides. They want to protect themselves.\n  The rule of law is fundamentally important in our system, and so is \nprotecting the rights of Americans from unlawful surveillance. I do not \nbelieve Congress can or should seek to take those rights and those \nclaims from those already harmed. As I said, I worked with Senator \nSpecter and both Senators Feinstein and Whitehouse to try to craft more \neffective alternatives\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\nto retroactive immunity. We worked with the legal concept of \nsubstitution, replacing Government in the shoes of private defendants \nthat acted at its behest. Let it assume full responsibility for the \nillegal conduct.\n  Substitution would have protected the telephone companies. It would \nhave placed the administration in their shoes in the lawsuits. But the \ntruth is that the administration doesn't really care about the \ntelephone companies. They are worried only about the American public \nfinding out what they did illegally, how they violated the laws and the \nConstitution of this country.\n  I also supported Senator Feinstein's proposal to strengthen the role \nof the FISA Court in this regard. The administration and its allies in \nthe Senate defeated both of these viable alternatives to retroactive \nimmunity. The administration, by trying to frighten people, warded off \nall efforts of compromise and accommodation. They don't want to be held \naccountable, and they have enough Senators who will protect them so \nthey will not be held accountable--not to the Congress or, more \nimportantly, to the American people.\n  The Senate was forced to vote on retroactive immunity even though not \nall Senators had access to the information they needed to make an \ninformed judgment about the Government's and the phone companies' \nconduct. The majority leader wrote to the administration last year \nurging such access, and I supported it. Of course, we got had no \nresponse. The administration ignored the request. After all, if we knew \nwhat we were doing around here, we might actually make them stand up \nand be responsible for their actions, which is the last thing in the \nworld they want. It is clear they do not want to allow Senators or \nanyone else to evaluate their lawlessness. Their rule is no \naccountability. Whether it is Scooter Libby or anyone else, no \naccountability. We will protect those who break the law on our behalf.\n  I have drawn very different conclusions from Senator Rockefeller \nabout retroactive immunity. I agree with Senator Specter and many \nothers that blanket retroactive immunity, which would end ongoing \nlawsuits by legislative fiat, undermines accountability.\n  Senator Specter has been working diligently, first as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and now as ranking member, to obtain judicial \nreview of the legality of warrantless wiretapping of Americans from \n2001 until last year. The checks and balances the judiciary provides in \nour constitutional democracy has an important role to play. Every one \nof us, if we follow our oath of office, should want to protect that. \nJudicial review can and should provide a measure of accountability.\n  I believe protecting the rule of law is important, and I believe in \nprotecting the rights of Americans from unlawful surveillance. I do not \nbelieve the Congress can or should seek to take those rights and those \nclaims from those already harmed. Moreover, ending ongoing litigation \neliminates the only viable avenue of accountability for the \nGovernment's illegal actions.\n  Therefore, I say again, I oppose retroactive immunity. There should \nbe a measure of accountability for the administration's actions in the \nyears following 9/11. If it is simply a case of protecting the \ntelephone companies, then why don't we vote for something that would \nput the Government in their shoes? Why don't we? Because that is the \nlast thing in the world this administration wants because then they \nwould have to answer to how many different people in the Bush \nadministration broke the law.\n  I don't believe anybody is above the law. I don't believe the \nPresident is; I don't believe a Senator is; I don't believe anybody \nis. Keep in mind, as I said earlier, why we have FISA. Congress passed \nthat law only after we discovered the shameful abuses of J. Edgar \nHoover's FBI. Through the COINTEL Program--sometimes called \nCOINTELPRO--Director Hoover spied on Americans who objected and spoke \nout against the war in Vietnam. I objected and spoke out against the \nwar in Vietnam. Many Vermonters opposed that war. I wonder how many \nVermonters were spied on for daring to speak out against it.\n\n  Ironically, Madam President, in April of 1975, the United States \nSenate voted by a one-vote margin in the Armed Services Committee to \nstop the war in Vietnam. A year later, it was hard to find anybody in \nthis body who had supported it, although obviously an awful lot of \nSenators had.\n  Well, I wonder if we are going to look back that same way someday and \nask: were we so frightened by 9/11 that we were willing to throw away \neverything this country fought for, everything that has made this \ncountry great through our history?\n  We can protect Americans' rights. We can protect those things our \nforefathers fought a revolution to obtain, that we fought a civil war \nto protect, that we fought two world wars to cement. We can protect \nourselves. But we cannot protect ourselves if we do not protect our \nrights. Are we going to throw our rights away because of a group of \nterrorists? This Senator is not going to.\n  Let us show the American people and the world what America stands \nfor. We can and will do all we can to secure the future for ourselves, \nour children, and our grandchildren. At the same time, we can protect \nthe cherished rights and freedoms that define America and make this \ncountry different from all others. Those are the rights and freedoms \nthat protected past generations and allow us to have an American \nfuture. If we do not protect them, what will we leave to our children \nand grandchildren?\n  Let us stand up for American values. Let us not be afraid to preserve \nour freedom while protecting our national security.\n  Madam President, I retain the remainder of my time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, after a long debate, we are, in \nfact, ready to, hopefully, pass the FISA bill. This has been an \nextremely important debate over important issues critical to the \nNation's security.\n  As I discussed at the beginning of the debate, the guiding principle \nin bringing this bill to the Senate floor was to modernize our ability \nto collect communications intelligence against foreign targets without \ncompromising the constitutional and statutory privacy protections \nafforded to all Americans. In my mind, we have achieved this goal.\n  Vice Chairman Bond and I worked very hard in the Intelligence \nCommittee to produce a balanced and bipartisan bill. One can say \nwhatever one wants, but 13 to 2 is 13 to 2. I think we can be proud of \nthe improvements we have made to the bill each step of the way since \nlast September. But, in fact, it goes all the way back almost a year. \nIn the end, the bill we are about to pass, I hope, strengthens our \nnational security and represents a very significant improvement over \nthe Protect America Act that passed last summer.\n  Let me mention a few of the provisions we have included in the bill \nfor protecting the rights of Americans here in the United States and \noverseas.\n  We require an individual FISA order for the targeting of U.S. persons \nbelieved to be located outside the United States any time the \ncollection is conducted inside the United States.\n  We have also put in place for the first time a procedure requiring \nFISA Court approval for collection on United States persons outside of \nthe United States in circumstances that would require a warrant if \nundertaken within the United States. This has never before existed. It \nnow exists in the FISA law, if we do, in fact, pass it.\n  We have increased the role of the FISA Court in other significant \nways, starting with the new requirement that the FISA Court approve the \nminimization procedures that are essential to the treatment of \ninformation concerning Americans authorized under this act. And thanks \nto Senator Whitehouse's amendment adopted this morning, we have \nclarified that the FISA Court has inherent authority to enforce \ncompliance with the procedures that it, and it alone, can approve.\n  We also adopted new requirements to give Congress visibility into how \nthe new collection authority is being implemented, from the Feingold \namendment on FISA Court documents, to the new requirements for \nreporting by the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence.\n  Just as we have worked on a bipartisan basis here in the Senate in \norder to achieve the strongest possible bill, I believe now is the time \nto work with our colleagues in the House of Representatives to achieve \na true bipartisan, bicameral bill. I look forward to that dialog with \nour House colleagues.\n  I would note there are additional measures I support which may make \nthis legislation even stronger. Among these would be the exclusivity \namendment of Senator Feinstein that received a strong bipartisan \nmajority vote this morning. I think it was 57 votes. I commend her for \nall of her work she has done on this critical issue and on other parts \nof the bill, and I will fight like heck for her in the conference \ncommittee, if we are to have one. We will continue to work with her and \nwith Vice Chairman Bond to see if there is any way to bridge the \ndifferences in the bipartisan manner that has dominated our \nnegotiations throughout this procedure.\n  In closing, it would not have been possible to have reached this \npoint without the hard work of the staff of the Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees, as well as the leadership staff. From the \nIntelligence Committee, I thank Andy Johnson; Louis Tucker; Melvin \nDubee; Michael Davidson; Jack Livingston; Christine Healey; Alissa \nStarzak; and Kathleen Rice. I also thank Mary DeRosa, Nick Rossi, \nZulima Espinel, and Matt Solomon of the Judiciary Committee; and Ron \nWeich, Serena Hoy, and Marcel Lettre of the majority leader's staff.\n  Finally, I must recognize the steadfast support and work of the \ncommittee's vice chairman, Senator Bond. The work of the Intelligence \nCommittee is not easy. When it comes on the floor, it is more difficult \nbecause there is a certain kind of exclusivity which is not appreciated \nby some Members but is the way it works.\n  Vice Chairman Bond has been dogged in his efforts to move this whole \nthing forward. He is formidable in his pursuit of intelligence and his \ninsistence it be made available to the committee and to the appropriate \ncommittees; and he is flexible in his willingness to find compromises \nto keep our bipartisan coalition together.\n  I hope this bill does pass. I think it is landmark legislation. I \ndon't think all will see it that way at the very beginning, and that is \nOK because what we do is not so much of the moment but for the longer \nterm. So there may be disagreements on immunity. But, on the other \nhand, there can be no disagreements on the national security of the \nUnited States. Immunity has been narrowly tailored. A lot of people \ndon't know that, or maybe made up their minds at the beginning, but, \nwhatever, we did what we thought was the right thing to do.\n  One of the great things about being in this body is no matter what \npeople say and what people think, if you do what you think is right, \nyou are serving your country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, are we now in my designated time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, earlier today the Senate voted to \ninvoke cloture on the bipartisan Rockefeller-Bond bill. It was not a \nclose vote. Rather, it was a strong bipartisan show of support for this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  The Protect America Act expires at the end of this week. That is \nSaturday, February 16.\n  Twenty-one House Democrats have written to Speaker Pelosi saying they \n``fully support'' the Rockefeller-Bond bill if it is not changed \nsubstantially--and it was not changed--and they urge her, the Speaker, \nto ``quickly consider'' the bill in order ``to get a bill signed into \nlaw before the Protect America Act expires in February.''\n  I have a copy of the letter signed by 21 Democrats, so-called Blue \nDog Democrats, in the House. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 2008.\n       Dear Madam Speaker: Legislation reforming the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) is currently being \n     considered by the Senate. Following the Senate's passage of a \n     FISA bill, it will be necessary for the House to quickly \n     consider FISA legislation\n\n[[Page S902]]\n\n     to get a bill to the President before the Protect America Act \n     expires in February.\n       It is our belief that such legislation should include the \n     following provisions: Require individualized warrants for \n     surveillance of U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad; \n     Clarify that no court order is required to conduct \n     surveillance of foreign-to-foreign communications that are \n     routed through the United States; Provide enhanced oversight \n     by Congress of surveillance laws and procedures; Compel \n     compliance by private sector partners; Review by FISA Court \n     of minimization procedures; Targeted immunity for carriers \n     that participated in anti-terrorism surveillance programs.\n       The Rockefeller-Bond FISA legislation contains satisfactory \n     language addressing all these issues and we would fully \n     support that measure should it reach the House floor without \n     substantial change. We believe these components will ensure a \n     strong national security apparatus that can thwart terrorism \n     across the globe and save American lives here in our country.\n       It is also critical that we update the FISA laws in a \n     timely manner. To pass a long-term extension of the Protect \n     America Act, as some may suggest, would leave in place a \n     limited, stopgap measure that does not fully address critical \n     surveillance issues. We have it within our ability to replace \n     the expiring Protect America Act by passing strong, \n     bipartisan FISA modernization legislation that can be signed \n     into law and we should do so--the consequences of not passing \n     such a measure could place our national security at undue \n     risk.\n           Sincerely,\n         Leonard L. Boswell, ------, Mike Ross, Bud Cramer, Heath \n           Shuler, Allen Boyd, Dan Boren, Jim Matheson, Lincoln \n           Davis, Tim Holden, Dennis Moore, Earl Pomeroy, Melissa \n           L. Bean, John Barrow, Joe Baca, John Tanner, Jim \n           Cooper, Zachary T. Space, Brad Ellsworth, Charlie \n           Melancon, Christopher P. Carney.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is clear that not only does the \nRockefeller-Bond bill enjoy bipartisan majority support in the Senate, \nit also enjoys bipartisan majority support in the House. It is a \ntribute to the fine work of the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nRockefeller, and the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, in pulling this \ncomplex piece of legislation together and getting extraordinary support \nacross the aisle.\n  This bill protects the country. It is a bill that will be signed by \nthe President of the United States, so we are making a law here. We \nneed to focus on completing action on this legislation and get it to \nthe President before the Protect America Act expires.\n  As to further delays: Back in August, our Democratic colleagues said \nan additional 6 months was needed to get this right. In the fall, they \nsaid: We need a little more time. Last month, they said: Give us \nanother 15 days and we can wrap it up. At this point, no Member of this \nbody can reasonably state this piece of legislation was hastily or \nunfairly considered. It has been the product of 6 months' work, intense \nwork on behalf of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond.\n  We do not need yet another extension, yet another delay. We need to \nfocus on getting our work done. I am confident that with the help of \nour friends on the other side of the aisle, we can get a second \nbipartisan accomplishment to the President in as many weeks. Tomorrow, \nhe will sign the stimulus package--an important bipartisan \naccomplishment. Later in the week, he could conceivably be in a \nposition to sign this important piece of bipartisan legislation.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the House and the Senate to redouble \ntheir efforts toward this end. That would show the American people that \nCongress can indeed function on a bipartisan basis on important issues \nbefore the country.\n  I am among those proud of the fine work done by Senator Rockefeller \nand Senator Bond. This is a terrific, important piece of legislation. I \nknow it will pass the Senate shortly, overwhelmingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, is there time remaining on this side prior \nto the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and a half minutes remain.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, with the sufferance of the minority \nleader, I thank my colleagues, especially Senator Rockefeller, and all \nthose who worked with us. We have had to make a number of very tough \nvotes. We made some good changes in the bill. I thank, particularly, \nSenators Wyden, Feinstein, and Whitehouse for working with us to \nachieve their objectives in a way that would allow the program to \ncontinue.\n  Approximately 10 months ago, the DNI, Admiral McConnell, came to \nCongress and asked that we update FISA. Changes in technology had \nresulted in the FISA Court rulings or interpretations that impeded the \neffective use of electronic surveillance against terrorists overseas.\n  This problem came to a head in May 2007, when there was a FISA Court \nruling causing significant gaps in our intelligence collection against \nforeign terrorists. Throughout the summer of 2007 and amid growing \nconcern of increased threats to our security in light of these gaps, \nCongress was asked by the DNI to act. And Congress, in August, passed \nthe Protect America Act, a short-term fix that did what it was supposed \nto do. It was lacking in one important aspect; it did not provide civil \nliability protection to those private partners who assisted the \nintelligence community.\n  Following passage of the PAA, Chairman Rockefeller and I immediately \nset to work to come up with a bipartisan permanent solution. We worked \nclosely with the intelligence community.\n  In the end, after many hearings, briefings, debate, and visits to the \nfacility, we did pass it on a 13-to-2 vote. We concluded that those \nelectronic communication service providers that assisted with the \nPresident's TSP acted in good faith and deserve civil liability \nprotection from frivolous lawsuits. As indicated by the chairman, this \nbill goes further than any legislation in history in protecting the \nprivacy of U.S. persons, mostly Americans, whose communications may be \nacquired incidentally to this foreign targeting. For the first time in \nhistory, it requires the FISA Court to approve targeting of U.S. \npersons, American citizens, overseas to obtain foreign intelligence \ninformation.\n  This bill was a series of delicate compromises. Both sides had to \ngive. Many of us would have preferred to have all litigation related to \nthe TSP terminated as the DNI originally requested. Again, we agreed, \nfor reasons set forth on the floor, that cases against Government \nofficials--and all criminal cases--could go forward.\n  Others believed the FISA Court should not approve targeting of \nAmericans abroad, particularly when these same protections are not \nafforded in ordinary criminal cases. In the spirit of compromise, we \ncreated a process that allows sufficient flexibility while addressing \nprivacy concerns.\n  In the end, I am proud to say we have accomplished our collective \ngoals of making sure we have a bill with clear authorities for foreign \ntargeting, with strong protections for Americans, and with civil \nliability protection for those providers who may have assisted with the \nPresident's terrorist surveillance program.\n  We have heard debate over the past several weeks on a number of \namendments that I believe would have proved harmful to our intelligence \ncollection efforts. Some would have shut down, or severely impeded, \nintelligence collection against foreign terrorists. That is one of the \nreasons we worked so closely with the intelligence community to \nascertain what could be done to increase protections without harming \ntheir ability to collect.\n  We now have a solid bill. The DNI will support it and the President \ncan sign it into law. I urge my colleagues to send this bill to the \nHouse with a strong bipartisan vote. It gives our intelligence \noperators and law enforcement officials the tools they need to conduct \nsurveillance of foreign terrorists in foreign countries who are \nplanning to conduct attacks against the U.S., our troops, and our \nallies. It is a balance we need to protect our civil liberties, without \nhandcuffing our intelligence professionals.\n  I hope we can do the right thing and pass the bill. I thank all our \ncolleagues who helped.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I want the Record to reflect that any of \nmy remarks where I disagree with the bill before the Senate in no way \nreflects upon the chairman of the committee. I have known Jay \nRockefeller for several decades, and I have not known a better public \nservant than Jay. Jay Rockefeller got into Government for the right \nreasons. We know that the Rockefeller name is magic, that he could have \nled a life of leisure, doing many different things. But he chose public \nservice. He went to West Virginia doing work as a VISTA volunteer. He \nfell in love with the people--the poor people--of West Virginia and has \nworked since then to improve the lives of the people of West Virginia. \nHe has done a wonderful job there, serving as the secretary of state, \nGovernor, and now as a long-time Senator.\n  There are certain things in this legislation that I disagree with. \nBut I repeat, as a public servant, there is not one better--or I doubt \nthat there ever has been anyone better than Jay Rockefeller. He has \ndevoted his Senate life in service to the Intelligence Committee. He \ndevotes night and day not only working in the Committee room where \nthere is no exposure to the public--he gets no publicity for doing \nthis. He does it because he believes it is the right thing for the \ncountry. Of course, I receive calls from him well after hours on \nconcerns he has in dealing with foreign intelligence generally.\n  I already voted against it on the FISA legislation, and I will vote \n``no'' on final passage of the bill.\n  The Senate's debate on FISA has made the Intelligence Committee's \nbill better--no question about that--by adding a number of protections \nfrom the Judiciary Committee's version.\n  The Senate adopted amendments offered by Senators Kennedy, \nWhitehouse, and Feingold to improve title I of the bill. This concerns \nthe procedures we use to conduct this kind of surveillance in the \nfuture. That is an improvement. But the Senate rejected amendments to \nstrike and modify various parts of title I, to improve title I, and \nrejected all amendments to strike or modify title II concerning \nimmunity for telecommunications companies that may have broken the law \nby abiding the White House's requests for warrantless wiretaps on \nAmerican citizens.\n  I believe the White House and any companies that broke the law must \nbe held accountable.\n  In their unyielding effort to expand Presidential powers, President \nBush and Vice President Cheney created a system to conduct \nwiretapping--including on American citizens--outside the bounds of \nlongstanding Federal law.\n  As I have said before--and books have been written on it--the \nPresident, as soon as we passed the first PATRIOT Act, after he joined \nwith us in celebrating it, he basically ignored it and did whatever he \nwanted to do because he was told by the White House staff he was above \nthe law, he didn't have to follow the law we passed.\n  The President could have taken the simple step at any time of \nrequesting new authority from Congress. All he would have had to do was \ncome talk to us. We would have been willing to listen to him and, very \nlikely, would have done anything he wanted to do. After all, Congress \nhas repeatedly amended FISA because of new technology and legitimate \nneeds in the intelligence community.\n  But whether out of convenience, incompetence, or outright disdain for \nthe rule of law, the Bush-Cheney administration chose to ignore \nCongress and ignore the Constitution.\n  The White House should bear responsibility for this reckless disdain \nfor the rule of law.\n  It also appears that many companies followed the administration's \norders without regard to the law or privacy, or even basic common \nsense. I always will support giving our intelligence community the \ntools it needs to collect intelligence on terrorists and other foreign \ntargets. We have to do that.\n  We always have and always will need to help in the private sector to \nprotect our country. That is clear. When companies comply with legal \nand constitutional directives to support intelligence and law \nenforcement activities, they have no reason to fear. But the \nrequirement and obligation they have for protecting the rights of \nAmerican citizens and the Constitution and FISA are perfectly clear, \nvery clear.\n  According to the press reports, at least one company--Qwest \nCommunications Company--refused the White House request to participate \nin this program. The others had an opportunity to do the same. As far \nas we know, they chose not to. They didn't follow the example of Qwest.\n  If the Senate had voted today to reject amnesty, we would have sent a \nmessage that no one is above accountability and no one is above the \nlaw. If we had rejected amnesty, we would have sent a message that \nfighting terrorism doesn't require the sacrifice of basic fundamental \nrights.\n  I was disappointed that the Senate rejected amendments opposing \nimmunity. Even though their efforts were unsuccessful, all Americans \nowe a debt of gratitude to two outstanding and principled Senators, \nSenators Feingold and Dodd. I don't mean in any way to suggest that \npeople who disagree with them are not outstanding or are unprincipled. \nThat isn't the case. There is a basic disagreement. I felt I needed to \napplaud and commend these two men for how hard they worked in making \ntheir point. I believe they stood up to the administration, which \ncertainly needs standing up to. They stood up for accountability.\n  Despite today's votes, there is no doubt in my mind that history will \nprove they were right. Millions of Americans joined this effort. Win or \nlose, their voices were heard and their efforts made a difference.\n  If the Senate votes for final passage of FISA today, which I suspect \nwill be the case, we must decide what comes next. The mere fact that we \npass something today, and the House passed something previously, \ndoesn't mean we have anything to send to the President.\n  Two weeks ago, in the runup to the State of the Union Address--and we \nhave heard it time and again--the President and Vice President and \nSenate Republicans believed it was urgent to pass the FISA bill, that \nit is critical to our national security. But then, Senate Republicans \nspent most of the time since then refusing to allow any votes on FISA \namendments, slow-walking the bill as part of a strategy to jam the \nHouse. That is what happened. I have to suggest that they deserve a pin \non their lapel because they set out and did what they wanted to do--\nstall this as long as they could.\n  A week and a half ago, as the February 1 sunset to the Protect \nAmerica Act approached, we passed a 15-day extension. This would have \nallowed 2 weeks to negotiate with the House, which would have been \nrushed, but we could have at least had meaningful meetings. Those will \nnot take place.\n  Unfortunately, the White House has been convinced that if they \ndragged this process out long enough, there would not be enough time to \nnegotiate a bill with the House. The White House is convinced they can \nforce the House to pass exactly the bill they want. I believe it is \nwrong for the White House to do this, and I believe it is unfair to the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Due to months of White House foot-dragging, the relevant House \ncommittees have only just gotten the documents relating to immunity. \nThey need some time to review and analyze that.\n  We must not let this critical issue be resolved by the White House \ntrying to force the House to do something they didn't want to do, such \nas happened last August.\n  I plan to ask, after this legislation passes today, unanimous consent \nfor an extension in order to allow sufficient time for negotiation with \nthe House. My friend, the distinguished Republican leader, has already \nsaid there will be no extensions given. I hope that is not the case, \nand with this extra time, the conference committee can make further \nimprovements to this critical bill.\n  Why do we need to improve the bill?\n  Richard Clarke, a national security adviser to Presidents Reagan, \nBush Sr., and President Clinton, said it well in an op-ed:\n\n       FISA has and still works as the most valuable mechanism for \n     monitoring our enemies.\n       In order to defeat the violent Islamic extremists who do \n     not believe in human rights, we need not give up the civil \n     liberties, constitutional rights and protections that \n     generations of Americans fought to achieve.\n\n  The Bush-Cheney White House continues to sell us a false choice \nbetween\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\nsecurity and liberty. I reject that choice.\n  This is America and we are Americans. We can and must have both \nliberty and security.\n  It is my understanding we are ready to vote on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, again I rise to thank Chairman \nRockefeller, the members of the committee on both sides, and our very \nable staffs for a lot of hard work, particularly by members of the \ncommittee but by many Members who are not on the committee, who took \ntheir time to learn what the electronic surveillance capabilities are, \nto learn what guidelines and protections there are to protect the \nprivacy rights and constitutional rights of American citizens and help \nus pass this bill.\n  This is a bill which I hope we will at least, in large part, find the \nHouse agreeable to and that we can send it to the President. This has \nbeen a very long procedure. The chairman just pointed out that we have \nbeen working on this almost a year. We worked very hard after the \nAugust recess to come up with a good bill. I know we had some very \nwarmly felt and vigorously argued amendments, but the fact that these \nwould make it difficult for the intelligence community to collect the \nintelligence necessary to protect our interests, our allies, our troops \nabroad, and us here at home led a significant bipartisan majority to \nimprove it.\n  Again, my sincere thanks to the leadership on both sides for allowing \nus to get to this important measure. We hope we will have a conference \nreport, if necessary, or a measure from the House that we can pass \nbefore the end of the week.\n  So, Madam President, my sincere thanks to Members on both sides and \nparticularly our great staffs on both sides.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as I indicated I would earlier today, I \nwill ask unanimous consent to extend the law that is now in effect. I \nwish to extend that 15 days to see if we can work out something more \nwith the House.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 571, S. 2615; the bill be read a third \ntime and passed; and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, let me just make the \npoint once again that we just passed this bill 68 to 29 in its initial \nform, which was preserved on the Senate floor. It came out of the \nIntelligence Committee 13 to 2. This is the Rockefeller-Bond \nbipartisan, overwhelmingly supported bill coming out of the Senate.\n  The current law does not expire until Saturday. It is still my hope \nthat the House, and particularly when you consider the fact that 21 \nHouse Democrats, so-called Blue Dog Democrats, have indicated to the \nSpeaker in writing that they would like to see the Senate bill passed--\nthe Rockefeller-Bond bill taken up and passed by the House--I think it \nis just premature for an extension, Madam President. I think there is\n\n[[Page S914]]\n\nstill at least a chance the House might conclude that we have done a \nterrific piece of work, and they could very well consider the option, \nas the Blue Dogs have suggested, of taking up the measure and sending \nit on down to the President for signature.\n  So for the moment, Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, 99 years ago today, a group of courageous \nindividuals came together to form the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People.\n  The year of 1909 was the centennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth. Fewer \nthan 50 years removed from the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation \nand the carnage of the Civil War, the promise and price of that \nstruggle must have still been fresh on the minds of many Americans.\n  The ``Call for the Lincoln Emancipation Conference in 1909'' was \ndesigned to take stock of the progress since the end of the Civil War.\n  The conclusion of the 60 organizers, among them the mayor of Toledo, \nand the president of Western Reserve University in Cleveland, the \nconclusion was that Lincoln would have been disheartened by the \nNation's failure to secure equality of law and equality of opportunity \nwithout respect to color. They faced rampant Jim Crow discrimination, \nconducted with the blessing of the Supreme Court. The country was \nplagued by race riots and lynchings in every region, even in Lincoln's \nhometown of Springfield, IL.\n  The founders of the NAACP understood that if true equality was to be \nhad, the spirit of the abolitionists must be revived. So long as the \nNorth remained silent about the conditions in the South, it was \nsupplying tacit approval.\n  They wrote:\n\n       Discrimination once permitted cannot be bridled. Recent \n     history shows that in forging chains for the Negroes, the \n     white voters are forging chains for themselves.\n\n  They met, they organized, and they spoke out. For almost a century \nthe NAACP has led the fight for equality, continually working to ensure \npolitical and educational and social and economic equality for persons \nof all races.\n  Whether it was the fight to desegregate public schools or to secure \nequal voting rights or the passing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the \nNAACP has remained at the forefront of the struggle for justice. Even \nwhen this body, this Senate, did not do the right thing, the NAACP \ncontinued to fight for equal rights and equal opportunity.\n  This is a struggle that continues today. Discrimination in housing \nhas continued a legacy of segregation in many of our neighborhoods and \nmany of our schools. Discrimination in housing finance has led to \ndisproportionate numbers of African-American and Latino borrowers being \nstuck with predatory loans that are falling into forclosure at record \nrates.\n  Black young people are more likely than their peers to attend failing \nschools. A new wave of barriers to voting rights has appeared in the \nform of vote caging, deceptive practices, and unreasonable voter ID \nlaws. I saw some of those in the 1980s as Ohio Secretary of State. They \nhappened in New Jersey, they happened in Louisiana, they happened in \nthe North, they happened in the South. They are still happening.\n  African Americans make up about 13 percent of our population but \naccount for over 50 percent of the prison population.\n  In times such as these, the NAACP is needed more than ever. \nFortunately, in my home State of Ohio and across the Nation, NAACP \nchapters continue their fight for justice and equality. In Lorain, in \nMansfield, in Toledo, in Cleveland and Columbus, they continue that \nfight.\n  The Ohio NAACP Prison Program is changing the lives and helping to \nrehabilitate hundreds of inmates. NAACP members across the State are \nregistering voters and run afterschool programs.\n  The Cincinnati NAACP chapter is holding public forums to foster a \nbetter relationship between the community and the police department. \nThrough programs such as these, our communities are stronger, our \nneighborhoods are stronger, our Nation is stronger.\n  As a life member of the NAACP, I am proud to support its efforts to \nprotect our rights to increase opportunities for all Americans. As the \nfounders observed 99 years ago, this Government cannot exist half slave \nand half free any better today than it could in 1861. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me today in commemorating the NAACP's 99th \nanniversary.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S914-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S914-S915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              199TH ANNIVERSARY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S BIRTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in her book ``Team of Rivals,'' Doris \nKearns Goodwin tells a story that illustrates the extraordinary, \ntranscendent power of Abraham Lincoln's faith in human freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  It is a story about something that occurred in 1908, 100 years ago. \nThe Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy had been entertaining some Caucasus \ntribesmen for hours with tales of Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, \nand Napoleon. When he finished, a chief stood and asked Tolstoy to \nspeak about the greatest of all heroes, a man who ``spoke with a voice \nof thunder . . . laughed like a sunrise and his deeds were as strong as \nthe rock.'' Tell them, the chief implored, about Abraham Lincoln.\n  Tolstoy would later write, ``That little incident proves how largely \nthe name of Lincoln is worshipped throughout the world. . . . He was \nnot a great general like Washington or Napoleon; he was not such a \nskillful statesman as Gladstone or Frederick the Great, but his \nsupremacy expresses itself altogether in his peculiar moral power and \nin the greatness of his character. ``Washington was a typical American. \nNapoleon was a typical Frenchman. But Lincoln,'' Tolstoy wrote, ``was a \nhumanitarian as broad as the world.''\n  Today marks the 199th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth. This \npast weekend was also the official opening of a 2-year bicentennial \ncelebration of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial. In Harlan County, KY, \nwhere Lincoln was born in bitter poverty, Lincoln scholars and admirers \ngathered to discuss and celebrate Lincoln's life and legacy. This \nevening in Springfield, IL, the Abraham Lincoln Association will hold \nits annual meeting to once again reflect on the life of Abraham Lincoln \nin his hometown.\n  I express my personal thanks to Judge Tommy Turner who has worked \ntirelessly with so many dedicated Kentuckians to put together today's \nkickoff in Harlan County.\n  First Lady Laura Bush was to have spoken at the kickoff. \nUnfortunately, the icy weather forced postponement. It will be \nrescheduled. She will be returning to the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace \nNational Historic Site in Hodgenville, KY.\n  President Lincoln kept a place in his heart for Kentucky all his \nlife, and there must be a special place for Kentucky in the Lincoln \nBicentennial Celebration. I also thank my colleague, Senator Jim \nBunning, who is a member of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial \nCommission. I know how hard he worked to make this kickoff a success in \nhis home State.\n  Over the next 2 years, hundreds of special events and celebrations \nwill be held in cities and towns across America to remind all of us who \nLincoln was and what he meant and still means to\n\n[[Page S915]]\n\nAmerica and the world. Coordinating many of these events will be the \nAbraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, which I am honored to cochair \nwith Harold Holzer, a noted Lincoln scholar from New York, and my \nfellow Illinoisan, Representative Ray LaHood. Ray deserves special \ncredit because it was his idea to create this commission to honor \nIllinois's favorite son in our land of Lincoln. For 12 years before I \nwas elected to the Senate I had the privilege of holding the same seat \nLincoln once held in the U.S. House of Representatives, a seat now held \nby Congressman LaHood.\n  Abraham Lincoln was, I believe, America's greatest President. Our \nFounders decreed that we are all endowed with an inalienable right to \nliberty, but they could not reconcile their noble ideals with the \nignoble practice of slavery. Abraham Lincoln helped give meaning to our \nnational creed of ``liberty and justice for all.'' He steered America \nthrough the most profound moral crisis in our history and the bloodiest \nwar. His leadership saved the Union, and his vision redefined what it \nmeant to be an American.\n  The goal of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission is to help \nAmericans and people around the world to gain a better understanding of \nthis complex and heroic man. We want to foster a resolve among \nAmericans from all backgrounds to continue the work Abraham Lincoln \nstarted. I think the Gettysburg Address may be the greatest speech I \nhave ever read. I memorized it in grade school. I refer to it so many \ntimes, and realize, in an economy of words, Abraham Lincoln speaking \nalmost impromptu really captured great meaning for so many Americans. \nHe challenged all of us to rededicate our lives ``to the unfinished \nwork'' for which ``the brave men, living and dead'' had sacrificed so \nmuch on the hallowed ground of battle in Gettysburg, PA.\n  How much of the work of true democracy remains unfinished today? How \ncan we summon, as Lincoln said, ``the better angels of our nature'' to \nmeet the challenges of our time? Those are the discussions the Abraham \nLincoln Bicentennial Commission hopes to foster as America prepares to \ncelebrate the bicentennial of the birth of its greatest President.\n  I encourage everyone to go to the Commission's Web site at \nwww.lincolnbicentennial.com, learn more about Lincoln and about how \nyour community can plan to celebrate his birthday. President Lincoln's \nadopted hometown of Springfield is also my adopted hometown. I have \nlived there almost 40 years now. If you have ever been there, you know \nthat around every corner in downtown Springfield is another powerful \nreminder of Abe Lincoln. The small house at the corner of 8th and \nJackson, the only home Lincoln ever owned, is just a block away from my \nSenate office. His law office, right near the old State capitol, is an \namazing place, restored and visited by so many because of its meaning \nin his daily life as an ordinary lawyer in central Illinois, the old \nState capitol building where he warned prophetically that a House \ndivided could not stand. This beautiful building was restored in 1976 \nas part of our bicentennial. The old State capitol is one of my \nfavorite in the State of Illinois.\n  My special thanks to a good friend of mine, an architect named Earl \nWallace Henderson III, who was called on to do a magnificent job of \nrestoring and remodeling that old State capitol. And now, just a couple \nblocks away, my pride and joy as an elected official from Springfield, \nIL, is the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. It is just \n3 years old. It is already the most visited Presidential library in \nAmerica. I love that place. I go to a lot of museums and Presidential \nmuseums. I don't know of another one, though, that really captures the \nspirit of the President so effectively and lures children in for \nbeautiful exhibits and movies that they don't forget. Kids walk out of \nthe Abraham Lincoln Museum with their moms and dads and say: Can we go \nback? It warms my heart every time I hear of the record numbers of \npeople who are visiting.\n  It was also in Springfield that a 28-year-old Lincoln, a member of \nthe State legislature, delivered a speech that still speaks powerfully \nto us today. We know it as the Lyceum Address. Lincoln was told to \nspeak about whatever he liked. He chose as his subject ``the \nperpetuation of our political institutions.'' He expressed a concern \nthat would later be echoed many times: What would happen to America \nwhen its Founding Fathers and those who fought to gain our liberty were \ngone? How could we sustain America if new generations had no knew \nleaders to inspire them with original ideas of our Republic? Until \nthen, the truth and terrible costs of America's revolution could always \nbe seen--in Lincoln's words--``in the form of a husband, a father, a \nson or a brother. . . . A living history was to be found in every \nfamily . . . in the limbs mangled, [and] in the scars of wounds \nreceived . . . ''\n  Lincoln went on to say:\n\n       But those histories are gone. They were the pillars of \n     liberty; and now that they have crumbled away, that temple \n     must fall--unless we, their descendants, supply their place \n     with other pillars.\n\n  I would like to think that Lincoln would be relieved if he could see \nthis great Nation today. We are 170 years further removed from our \nFounders than we were when the young Lincoln spoke those words at the \nLyceum, but America is still filled with patriots who know and are \nwilling to defend our founding principles. There are many of us, and we \nare vastly more diverse than the Americans of Lincoln's time, but there \nis still in us a deep and passionate longing to be one nation, one \npeople, undivided.\n  We saw a glimpse of that desire in the dark days after 9/11. \nSometimes we wondered if we could ever recover that sense of national \nunity and purpose. But look what is happening today. There is a deep \nlonging in America today to transcend old divisions in order to meet \nour new challenges. It is a longing that goes far beyond political \nparties and labels of all kinds. We have not forgotten the principles \non which our Nation was founded, nor have we forgotten the lessons \nAbraham Lincoln taught us. Our unity is our strength. Together we can \novercome any challenge. We can finish the unfinished work of America \nand become a ``more perfect union.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S915-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, California and the entire Nation lost a \nremarkable leader yesterday with the passing of my friend, Congressman \nTom Lantos.\n  From his leadership as chairman of the House Committee on Foreign \nAffairs to his founding of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, \nCongressman Lantos went about his work with a dignity and a seriousness \nthat transcended politics. In a time of bitter divisions, he earned the \nrespect of colleagues from both sides of the aisle.\n  As a survivor of the Holocaust, Congressman Lantos brought to \nCongress a profound personal commitment to human rights. We will \nremember not only his courage and his optimism, but also his deep \naffection for his adopted country. He leaves behind a legacy of hope \nand inspiration.\n  On a personal level, it was an honor to call Tom a colleague and a \nfriend. I was proud to work with him on so many important issues.\n  I remember working with him to secure funding to build a tunnel to \nbypass a section of Route 1 that was so frequently closed by landslides \nthat it was known as ``Devil's Slide.'' It took years, but they broke \nground on the tunnel in November. And it is a fitting tribute to the \npassion with which he served his constituents that there is a bill \nbefore the State senate to name that tunnel in his honor.\n  Congressman Lantos was a true statesman, and we will miss him. My \nheart goes out to his family during this time of grief. They are in our \nthoughts and in our prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S915-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S915-S916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        APPROPRIATIONS EARMARKS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on October 23, 2007, Senator DeMint and I\n\n[[Page S916]]\n\nhad a debate in the Senate on Senator DeMint's amendment to strike $3.7 \nmillion in grants in the Appropriations bill for Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education with $2.2 million going to the AFL-CIO \nAppalachian Council and $1.5 million to the AFL-CIO Working for America \nInstitute. This funding applied to job-training programs covering some \n11 States and the District of Columbia.\n  During the course of the debate, Senator DeMint made the following \nstatement:\n\n       This amendment is part of an effort to clear up what a lot \n     of us have called the culture of corruption over the last \n     several years. A lot of this has come from Americans \n     connecting the dots between the earmarks that we give to our \n     favorite causes back home and many of the campaign \n     contributions and political support that we get back here in \n     Congress. While motivations are generally good, at best the \n     appearance of what is going on here has alarmed the American \n     people.\n\n  When I outlined my reasons for supporting these grants, Senator \nDeMint replied:\n\n       I agree with all the purposes the Senator stated, all of \n     the ideas of getting teenagers to work in Philadelphia. All \n     of those things are good. I am not taking argument with any \n     of them. If the AFL-CIO is the best source to deliver these \n     services, there should not be any problem with this at all. \n     All we are asking is to make this a competitive grant so that \n     we can have criteria and accountability in a system so that \n     what we want to accomplish will actually get accomplished.\n\n  Senator DeMint's amendment was rejected on a 60-34 vote.\n  After the floor debate and vote were over, Senator DeMint and I \ndiscussed the issues in the debate. Senator DeMint stated that he was \nnot suggesting any corrupt practice or inappropriate conduct by me, but \nonly that it was preferable to use the funds for competitive bids. \nSenator DeMint and I agreed that it would be useful to correct any \nmisimpressions by having this colloquy for the Record.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Senator Specter has correctly stated the conversation \nwhich we had after the floor debate and we agreed it would be useful to \nhave this discussion to clear up the record. As I told Senator Specter \nprivately and now state publicly, I was in no way suggesting that his \nsupport for these programs resulted from campaign contributions or \npolitical support. My reference to the ``culture of corruption'' was \nnot intended to suggest that there was any corruption involved in this \nmatter. In my statement, I was specific in not suggesting inappropriate \nmotivations when I said ``motivations are generally good.'' I was also \ncareful to focus on the ``appearance'' and not the reality by noting it \n``has alarmed the American people.'' As many know, my objection to \nearmarks has to do with the system itself, not the people who \nparticipate in it. While Senator Specter and I naturally have \ndifferences on issues of public policy, which is to be expected in an \ninstitution like the Senate, I have worked with him during my tenure in \nthe Senate of more than 3 years and do not question his integrity.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank Senator DeMint for his candid and forceful \nstatements which I think clear the record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S916-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Chad A. Barrett\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service and \nsacrifice of SSG Chad Barrett. Sergeant Barrett was assigned to the \n64th Brigade Support Battalion, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry \nDivision out of Fort Carson, CO. He died last Saturday in Iraq at the \nage of 35.\n  A native of Jonesborough, TN, Chad grew up in a family with a proud \nhistory of service. By joining the Army, he followed in the footsteps \nof his older brothers, his cousins, and his grandfather, who earned the \nPurple Heart in World War II.\n  Chad was in his 12th year of service and his third deployment to Iraq \nwhen he died. He took on one of the most dangerous jobs of the war: \nthat of a gunner tasked with defending supply convoys. Those convoys \nsee it all: improvised explosive devices, rocket attacks, explosively \nformed penetrators, ambushes. Protecting the convoys is a job that \ntakes courage, but it also takes a toll. In his second deployment, \nSergeant Barrett's unit was attacked 42 times. He put himself in harm's \nway and no doubt saved countless lives, but each day, each mission, and \neach fight has a cost that we often forget. However steely one's nerves \nor how strong one's will, the daily sacrifices of our soldiers do cause \nwounds and injuries of their own. These wounds are sometimes less \nvisible than those of a bullet or a blast, but they are no less painful \nand certainly no less deadly.\n  Mr. President, the daily heroics of Chad's service in Iraq will be \nremembered long after the words from this floor fade. This was a lesson \nof our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln, as he honored the tens of \nthousands who perished at Gettysburg. ``The brave men, living and dead, \nwho struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to \nadd or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the \nliving, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they \nwho fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.'' As we honor the life \nof Sergeant Barrett, may we embrace this charge and rededicate \nourselves to our unfinished work and to the dream for which every \nsoldier serves--that of achieving stable and lasting peace.\n  To Sergeant Barrett's wife, Michelle, his sons, Guston and Zachary, \nhis parents, Linda and Ronnie, and to all his family and friends, our \nthoughts and prayers are with you. I cannot imagine the pain and grief \nthat you are feeling. In time, though, I hope your sorrow will be \nsalved by the knowledge that Chad served his country with honor and \nthat we are all grateful for his courage, sacrifice, and daily heroism. \nMay his legacy always endure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S916-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S916-S917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              REMEMBERING LANCE CORPORAL JOHNATHON GOFFRED\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude, I wish to honor the life of a brave soldier. LCpl Johnathon \nGoffred, 22 years old, died unexpectedly on January 26 in Camp \nPendleton, CA. Johnathon was a dedicated soldier, loving son, grandson \nand brother, and a valued friend to many.\n  Johnathan grew up in Johnson County, IN, with his paternal \ngrandparents, Walter and MaryAnn Sparrow. He graduated from Center \nGrove High School in Greenwood in 2003, where he was active in sports \nand assisted the Center Grove Little League. It was his dream to become \nan Indiana State Police trooper.\n  In 2005, Johnathon joined the Marines where he was a rifleman with \nthe 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment. Johnathon served a 7-month tour \nof duty in the Anbar province of Iraq, returning in 2007. For his \nexcellent service, Johnathan was awarded the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, the National Defense Service \nMedal, and a Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. His comrades remember him \nas a devoted friend who was generous with all he had. One of his fellow \nservicemen described him as the type of person who would give you the \nshirt off his back if you needed it.\n  Johnathan is survived by his mother, Angie Martin Goffred; his \npaternal grandparents, Walter and MaryAnn Sparrow; his maternal \ngrandfather, Bill Goffred; his seven brothers, Dale, Shawn, Nick, Tom, \nWes and Kragen Sparrow and Michael Paul; and his eight sisters, Tina \nSeril, Mellisa, Keria, Keisa, Quinci, Brianna, Shannon and Masada \nSparrow.\n  Today, I join Johnathon's family and friends in mourning his death. \nWhile we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take \npride in the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and kindness that people will remember when \nthey think of Johnathon. Today and always, Johnathan will be remembered \nby family members, friends, and fellow soldiers as a true American \nhero, and we honor his service to our country.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of LCpl Johnathon Goffred in the \nofficial Record of the Senate for his service to this country and for \nhis profound commitment to freedom, democracy, and peace. When I think \nabout this just cause in which we are engaged, and the unfortunate pain \nthat comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that families like \nJohnathon's can find comfort in\n\n[[Page S917]]\n\nthe words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in \nvictory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Johnathon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S917-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF DARRELL KERBY\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, good mayors are those who leave the \ncommunities, citizens, and environment of the towns they have led in \nbetter condition than when they were first elected. An exceptional \nmayor is one who imparts a vision of what the community could be and \nworks with the members of his or her community and outside interests to \nachieve that vision. There are examples of this across my State of \nIdaho, and the outgoing mayor of Bonners Ferry, Darrell Kerby, is one \nsuch remarkable example.\n  Darrell is retiring from public service after serving the citizens of \nBonners Ferry for over 20 years, first on the city council and most \nrecently as mayor. He is known to city employees and the public as a \nman of outstanding character, courtesy, kindness, and confidence. His \nleadership has been marked by a penchant for conviction tempered in \nsmall-town graciousness. He was at the helm in 2003 when Bonners Ferry \nwas selected as Idaho's Most Friendly Town by travelers and tourists. \nHe was instrumental in the revitalization of downtown Bonners Ferry \nthrough the construction of the tunnel connecting the downtown business \narea to the Kootenai River Inn. He promoted the construction of the \nInternational Gateway Visitors Center, improved parking in the downtown \nbusiness district, secured improvements to and expansion of the city \nwater system that included obtaining a critical Federal grant, led \nimprovements to the city powerplant, and fueled positive city growth.\n  Darrell's participation in the community extends beyond his mayoral \noffice. He has served or serves on the Boundary Regional Health Center \nBoard of Directors, the Idaho Board of Health & Welfare, the \nAssociation of Idaho Cities, the Idaho Energy Resources Authority, the \nBoundary County Economic Development Committee, and the Kootenai Valley \nResource Initiative Committee, a collaborative effort that I have been \npleased to work with him on over the years. Speaking of the Kootenai \nValley Resource Initiative, Darrell has been instrumental in keeping my \nstaff informed and involved as the stakeholders involved work to \ncollaboratively manage the natural resources of the Kootenai Valley and \nbegin restoration work on the Myrtle Creek Watershed after the \ndevastating fire in 2003.\n  Darrell received the Harold Hurst Award in 2007 for exemplary \nperformance by a city official and has contributed in an outstanding \nmanner to the accomplishments of the Association of Idaho Cities.\n   I wish Darrell well in his retirement and thank him for his \nexemplary years of public service. The residents of Bonners Ferry and \nBoundary County, as well as the State of Idaho, have gained \nimmeasurably from Darrell's efforts and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S917-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF MARK SMITH\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a very \nspecial Iowan and a truly exceptional labor leader, Mark Smith. Mark \nretired earlier this month after serving 28 years in leadership roles \nin the Iowa Federation of Labor. He served as secretary-treasurer from \n1974 until 1997, and as president from 1997 until his retirement. \nThroughout, he has remained a member of the American Federation of \nTeachers, Local 716.\n  Prior to coming to the Iowa Federation of Labor, Mark spent 5 years \nas an instructor at the University of Iowa's Labor Center, where he \ntaught up-and-coming union leaders about labor law, labor history, \ncommunication, leadership, economics, and public policy. Mark may have \nleft the classroom, but he never stopped being a teacher and mentor. He \nhas always believed strongly that to achieve real successes for working \nfamilies and to advance a progressive public policy agenda, it is \ncritical to train people to organize and advocate for themselves.\n  Throughout his distinguished tenure as IFL president, Mark was \nrespected for his keen intelligence and his direct, honest, feisty \nstyle of doing business. He understood the political system, and how to \nget things done. He didn't believe in top-down political engagement; he \nbelieved in organizing and empowering people at the grass roots to \nfight for a brighter future--and to win.\n  Mark is a proud progressive, with a passion for economic and social \njustice. He is also a passionate believer in bringing people together \nin collective action, whether in the political arena, at the bargaining \ntable, or in the community. He has devoted his life to building \nstronger unions because he believes that they are an ideal vehicle for \neffecting positive change for ordinary people.\n  For many years, I have counted on Mark for his friendship, counsel, \nand support--and that will not change. But his retirement is a \ntremendous loss for working families and for the labor movement in \nIowa. In the Bible, it says that ``if the trumpet gives an uncertain \nsound, who will prepare himself for battle?'' For more than a decade as \npresident of the Iowa Federation of Labor, there has been nothing \nuncertain about Mark Smith's trumpet. He has been a great labor leader, \nand a strong, unwavering voice for progressive change. I wish him a \nlong and happy retirement with his family, including wife Marty, \ndaughter Christine, sons Michael and Erich, and grandson \nIsaiah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S917-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S917-S918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DENNIS SWANSON\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I wish a happy 70th \nbirthday to Mr. Dennis Swanson, a kind and generous man who has been \none of the leading innovators in television broadcasting over the last \n30 years.\n  Mr. Swanson, who currently serves as president of stations operations \nat FOX Television Stations, Inc., has been called a ``mastermind'' of \nthe broadcast industry. It is high praise, and very well deserved. With \nkeen foresight, tremendous business acumen, and a willingness to take \nchances, Swanson has improved the fortunes of every station he has \nworked for. Most importantly, he did this not by offering viewers \nprograms that appealed to the lowest common denominator, but instead he \ndeveloped creative, high-quality programming that appealed to the needs \nof the stations' communities.\n  In 1976, Swanson was hired as executive producer of KABC, Los \nAngeles' ABC affiliate. At that time, the station had never finished \nhigher than third in local news ratings, and Swanson saw that the \nstation needed to do something to offers its viewers a new perspective. \nIn 1977, with the debate over Proposition 13 raging throughout \nCalifornia, Swanson invited the measure's author, Howard Jarvis, to \ncome on the 5 p.m. newscast and debate the measure's opponents every \nday for a month. In addition, Swanson worked hard to improve the \nquality of the station's reporting. These efforts paid off when in 1978 \nhe was awarded the George Foster Peabody Award, the most prestigious \naward in broadcasting, for KABC's reporting on the Los Angeles Police \nDepartment. KABC became the No. 1 station in the region, and Swanson \nwas promoted to station manager in 1981.\n  In 1983, Swanson was asked to take over WLS-TV, an ABC owned and \noperated station in Chicago with low ratings. It is here that Swanson \nmade perhaps the best broadcasting decision of his career and one that \nreveals his strong character. Impressed by her audition, Swanson \noffered a morning show to a woman from Baltimore with a unique name. As \nSwanson recalled years later, Oprah Winfrey wasn't sure she was ready \nfor such a job. She was concerned that her color and appearance would \nprevent her from winning over viewers. Swanson would have none of that, \n``I'm not in the color business,'' he told her. He assured her that he \ndidn't want her to change her appearance, but to simply ``be the person \nI saw audition.''\n  As we all know, the decision to hire Oprah was an unqualified \nsuccess, rocketing WLS to the top of the Chicago market and eventually \nreaping billions in revenues for ABC. It also launched the career of \none of the most influential and inspirational figures in America today.\n\n[[Page S918]]\n\n  In 1986, Swanson moved to New York to take the helm at ABC Sports. \nDuring his tenure, ABC's top sports program, ``Monday Night Football,'' \nbecame one of America's top-rated primetime programs, consistently \nranking in the top-10 highest rated shows. He also pulled one of the \nmost remarkable developments in sports programming history when he \nconvinced the International Olympic Committee to stagger its winter and \nsummer games so the Olympics would occur every other year. This \ndecision has been credited with keeping the public interested in the \ngames and promoting the Olympics' message of sportsmanship and friendly \ncompetition. Additionally, Swanson was integral in the development of \nthe Bowl Championship Series, an agreement between the four major \ncollege football bowl games that allows for the top two teams to play \nfor the national championship at the end of each year.\n  In 1996, Swanson went to work as general manager for WNBC, NBC's \nflagship station in New York. The station was running second to \nlongtime market leader WABC-TV, but needed a creative spark to put it \nover the top. As he had done in L.A. and Chicago, Swanson focused on \nproviding viewers with high-quality community programming. He convinced \nnetwork executives to broadcast the Christmas tree lighting at \nRockefeller Center live during prime time. It was a huge hit. True to \nform, the station under Swanson broadcast other community events, such \nas the St. Patrick's Day Parade and the Puerto Rican Pride day parade, \nensuring that many New Yorkers who were unable to attend the parades \ncould still feel like part of the festivities. When Swanson left WNBC \nin 2002, the station, like those he left in Chicago and Los Angeles, \nwas the ratings leader for its market.\n  After leaving WNBC, Swanson served as executive vice president and \nchief operating officer of Viacom Television Stations, Inc., where he \noversaw 39 television stations throughout the country. While his tenure \nthere was brief, having left for FOX in 2005, at the time of his \ndeparture Viacom's stations in New York and L.A. were increasing in \nmarket share, as were several stations in smaller markets. He now is in \ncharge of FOX's 35 local television stations.\n  For all the success he has had, focusing solely on Mr. Swanson's \nprofessional success doesn't even allow one to scratch the surface of \nhis rich life. Far from the apocryphal career-obsessed television \nexecutive of popular lore, for him serving the community was not just a \nstrategy for increasing television ratings but a way of life. He has \nserved on the boards and advisory committees of various organizations, \nincluding the Broadway Association, Inc., the National Academy of \nTelevision Arts and Sciences, the Committee for Hispanic Children and \nFamilies, Inc, and the Ireland-United States Council for Commerce and \nIndustry. He has also been active in efforts to promote minority voices \nin the media, serving as chairman of the Emma L. Bowen Foundation for \nMinority Interests in the Media since its founding in 1991.\n  Those who know him best say Mr. Swanson has two passions: his family \nand the U.S. Marine Corps. Having served in the Marines as an officer \nin the early 1960s, he often credits the corps with helping make him \nthe man he is today. He has given back, raising millions for the Marine \nCorps Scholarship Foundation and the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund.\n  But first and foremost for Mr. Swanson is his family. Despite his \nbusy schedule, he strives to spend as much time as possible with Kathy, \nhis wife of 46 years, their three children and nine grandchildren. He \nmakes it a point to be with them for every holiday and special event. \nAll of his grandchildren have their grandfather attend their events, \nwhether they are hockey games in Connecticut at 6 a.m. or theatrical \nplays and lacrosse games in northern Virginia or ballets and soccer \ngames in southern California; Dennis is always there for them\n  When looking upon all that Mr. Swanson has accomplished both \nprofessionally and personally, it is difficult to imagine that there is \nmore that he can do. Yet his dedication and creativity have proven \nresilient over the years, so one can only expect bigger and better \nthings from him. I look forward to seeing what kind of new and \ninnovative ideas he develops in the future.\n  Happy birthday, Dennis Swanson. May your 70th year be your best one \nyet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S918-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LOUIE KROGMAN\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I honor Louie Krogman from \nWhite River, SD. On December 20, 2007, Louie scored his 2,826th point \nto become South Dakota's all-time leading boys basketball scorer.\n  Louie broke the former record of 2,825 points when he sank a free \nthrow in the first half of White River's game against Pine Ridge during \nthe Lakota Nation Invitational Tournament in Rapid City, SD. The 5,000 \nfans in attendance rose to their feet and honored him with a standing \novation. Before the game continued, the Lakota Nation honored Louie \nwith a Lakota name and serenaded him with a Lakota honor song while he \ndonned a traditional Native quilt. When the game resumed, Louie \ncontinued his dominance and led the Tigers to a decisive victory. Louie \nbroke the 50-year-old record notably early in the 2007-2008 season, \nwhich leaves him plenty of time to continue to build on an amazing high \nschool career.\n  This prestigious achievement is a direct result of the hard work and \ndedication that Louie has demonstrated throughout his career at White \nRiver High School. During his career, Louie was twice selected to the \nall-state basketball first team, named all-conference first team four \ntimes, named the Argus Leader player of the year, and chosen for the \nState ``B'' Tournament All-Tourney team. Through his hard work, \nleadership, athletic abilities, and a great supporting cast Louie has \nhelped the Tigers become one of South Dakota's top basketball teams.\n  Mr. President, it gives me great honor today, along with Louie's \nfriends, family, and the State of South Dakota, to congratulate him on \nthis impressive accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S918-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DON MEYER\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Coach Meyer recently won his 880th coaching career victory and \ncurrently has the most wins of any active coach in men's basketball. \nThis accomplishment places Coach Meyer in second place on the \ncollegiate all-time win list, trailing only Bobby Knight.\n  Coach Meyer began coaching at NSU in 1999 and has led the Wolves to \n178 victories. Prior to coming to Aberdeen, he coached for 24 seasons \nat David Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN, and three seasons at \nHamline University in Minneapolis, MN.\n  Despite his many accomplishments, Don Meyer has remained extremely \nhumble. He is always quick to praise his assistant coaches, players, \nand fans for the invaluable role they play in his accomplishments. This \nhumility has earned him the respect and admiration of his players. His \nexcellent example of leadership and teamwork has even inspired one of \nhis former players to write a book chronicling his time playing for \nCoach Meyer.\n  Coach Meyer is truly an example of the dedication and inspiration \nthat is found in South Dakota's coaches. He has given the young people \nof South Dakota a fine example of what it means to be leader both on \nand off the court. On behalf of the State of South Dakota, I am proud \nto commend Coach Meyer on this impressive accomplishment and wish him \nand the Wolves all the best for their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S918-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) announced that on today, \nFebruary 12, 2008, he had signed the following enrolled bill, which had \npreviously been signed by the Speaker of the House:\n\n       H.R. 354l.

A bill to regulate political robocalls, to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Robocall \nPrivacy Act of 2008, cosponsored by my colleagues Senator Specter, \nSenator Inouye and Senator Durbin. This is a simple, straight-forward \nbill that would allow continued political outreach through prerecorded \nphone messages, but protect American families from being inundated by \ncalls all through the day and night.\n  In recent years, we have seen an unparalleled development of new \ntechnologies that help political candidates reach out to voters.\n  This is a good thing. Political speech is essential, and should be \nprotected. The vast majority of these technological developments \nbolster the Democratic process, promoting an interchange of information \nand ideas.\n  One of these is the so-called robocall, in which a prerecorded \nmessage can be sent out to tens of thousands of voters at a minor cost \nthrough computer automation.\n  With television and radio ads becoming so expensive, these \nprerecorded calls can play an important role alerting voters to a \ncandidate's position and urging their support at the polls.\n  A recent Pew Foundation poll found that 80 percent of Iowans in the \nrecent primaries received automated political robocalls. A high level \nof sophistication goes into these robocalls--they are targeted and \nspecific software dictates who is called, and when.\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\n  But the process can be abused. And we all have heard stories about \npeople being called over and over and over again at all hours of the \nday and night.\n  I believe this is wrong. Not only is it interfering with the privacy \nrights of Americans, but it can turn people away from the political \nprocess itself.\n  Commercial calls are already limited by the Federal Trade \nCommission's ``Do Not Call'' list--with millions of individuals \nsubscribing. But political calls were specifically exempted from that \nlist.\n  Let me be clear: I am not seeking to eliminate all robocalls. \nInstead, this legislation is carefully designed to provide some \nsafeguards without halting the practice altogether.\n  The Robocall Privacy Act of 2008 bans political robocalls to any \nperson from 9 p.m. in the evening and a.m. in the morning.\n  It also bans more than two political robocalls from each campaign to \nthe same telephone number per day, bans the caller from blocking the \n``caller identification'' number, and requires an announcement at the \nbeginning of the call identifying the individual or organization making \nthe call and the fact that it is a pre-recorded message. This is to \nprevent misinformation about the caller.\n  The enforcement provisions of this bill are simple and intent on \nstopping the worst of these calls. The bill creates a civil fine for \nviolators of the law, with additional fines for callers who willfully \nviolate the law.\n  The bill also allows voters to sue to stop those calls immediately, \nbut not receive money damages. A judge can order violators of the law \nto stop these abusive calls.\n  Why are these provisions so important? Let me briefly describe some \nrecent incidents:\n  Hundreds of robocalls woke voters up at 2 in the morning during a \n2007 New York election--because of a software programming error. The \ncalls were supposed to occur at 2 p.m.\n  In the Nebraska 3rd District Congressional Election, voters \ncomplained to candidate Scott Kleeb when they received dozens of calls, \ncontaining poor-quality versions of his voice. Kleeb's supporters claim \nthat his voice was recorded, and used in an abusive robocall against \nhim.\n  In the 2006 Congressional elections, many calls wrongly implied that \none candidate was making a robocall. The message began with a recorded \nvoice stating that the call contained information about U.S. \nRepresentative Melissa Bean. Some voters called Bean's office to \ncomplain without listening to the entire message, which eventually \nidentified an opposing party committee as the sponsor--when most voters \nhad hung up. Representative Bean had to spend campaign funds informing \nvoters she had not made that call.\n  The National Do Not Call Network--a nonprofit focused on this issue--\nhas indicated voters receive many calls a day. They have reported as \nmuch as 37 political phone calls in one day for one voter. That same \norganization reports that 40 percent of its membership indicated it \nreceived between 5 and 9 calls a day during the election season.\n  In a recent Texas campaign, a negative robocall was sent to voters \nearly in the morning--supposedly from one of the candidates. That \ncandidate immediately protested it was not done on his behalf--but \ninstead was an attempt to smear him by using his name. Voters became \nfurious at the call.\n  In a Maryland race in November 2006, in a conservative area residents \nreceived a middle-of-the-night robocall from the nonexistent ``Gay and \nLesbian Push,'' urging them to support one of the candidates. That \ncandidate lost the election, and enraged voters about the false, late-\nnight call.\n  Repeated robocalls to Tennessee resident Jonathan Gregory caused him \nto complain to The Tennessean newspaper: ``It's extremely annoying, and \nit's like getting telemarketing calls at work. . . . I think they \nshould have some type of limit on how many times they can call the same \nnumber.''\n  A February 1 Letter to the Editor of the Harrisburg Patriot-News, \nfrom a woman from East Pennsboro, PA, indicated that she received many \npolitical robocalls to her personal cell phone and was billed for each \ncall.\n  I am a strong supporter of the First Amendment protection for \npolitical speech and I want to encourage the free exchange of \ninformation about candidates.\n  But I also believe people should have a right to be protected from \nthe most egregious forms of abuse.\n  However, the worst of these calls are disturbing people in their \nhomes by forcing them to answer calls and listen again and again. \nSomething must be done.\n  The bill does not ban robocalls. It merely provides a reasonable \nframework of tailored time, place, and manner restrictions.\n  I hope my colleagues join me in supporting the Robocall Privacy Act \nof 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S921-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 447--HONORING FRIENDSHIP FORCE INTERNATIONAL AND \n           RECOGNIZING MARCH 1, 2008 AS WORLD FRIENDSHIP DAY\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr. Chambliss) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nLautenberg of New Jersey to introduce a resolution condemning the \ncomments made by Iranian President Ahmadinejad on Israel and the \nHolocaust.\n  For too long, the civilized world has remained silent while the \nleader of Iran has threatened Israel's survival and denied the \nexistence of the Holocaust. Since the inception of his term in office \nin 2005, President Ahmadinejad has continually been the mouthpiece for \nthe vilest, most base examples of anti-Semitism and hate. Standing \nagainst this ceaselessly hostile rhetoric and threats, the State of \nIsrael should be afforded the full support of the United States and the \ninternational community. President Ahmadinejad's denial of the \nHolocaust--one of the most appalling crimes against humanity the world \nhas ever known--is likewise unacceptable and outrageous. My colleagues \nand I condemn these comments in the strongest possible terms, and call \nfor all the civilized nations of the world to do likewise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/12/senate-section/article/S922-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4018.
