Mr. President, following the remarks of the two leaders, \nthe Senate will proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators \nallowed to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  I have been in contact with the Republican leader. We hope, in the \nnear future, to be able to enter a unanimous consent agreement to move \nforward on the tax extenders legislation, with limited debate. We also \nwere unable to reach an agreement to consider the Advance America's \nPriorities Act. I am expecting a call from Senator Coburn momentarily \nto see if we can work our way through that. If we are unable to reach \nan agreement today on the extenders package--and we certainly think it \nwould be possible, with an agreement, to work through the Coburn \nproblems, but if we cannot do that, we will have to have a cloture vote \nin the morning on S. 3297. I hope that is not necessary.\n  I remind everybody that the adjournment date is next Friday. Everyone \nwho holds things up must be very careful that they are not holding up \nour getting out of here on time. We have to do the extenders. We have \nto do the energy legislation. We have to do work on the stimulus bill, \na CR, and a few other things that are absolutely necessary. I have \nspoken to the House leadership, and they want to be out by next Friday. \nBut we have to send them some things before we can be out by next \nFriday.\n  I remind everyone that it is possible that we might have to work the \nnext few days. There is nothing to change that at this stage. Monday, \nthere will be no votes. I announced that some time ago. That being the \ncase, whatever we do this week, then we have next Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday, and Friday, and that is our adjournment date. If we don't \nfinish our work by next Friday--or Saturday, if that is the case--the \nfollowing week is a Jewish holiday, Rosh Hashanah, which means we would \nhave to come back the following Wednesday. So I hope everybody \nunderstands how difficult this is. One of the Senators said to me: Why \naren't you more definite in what you are scheduling? I just cannot be, \nwith the procedures in the Senate. One or two people can really throw a \nmonkey wrench into how we move forward.\n  I hope we can have a very productive day. It is possible that we can \ncomplete the tax extenders and the energy legislation today. We could \ndo that all today. There is no reason we can't. We know what we need to \ndo. We need to pass the paid-for extenders on energy. We need to have a \nvote on AMT, whether we are going to pay for that, and we need to have \na vote on the rest of the extenders package. Time limits are in\n\n[[Page S8964]]\n\nthe proposed unanimous consent agreement. We can do that quickly, and \nwe can then move to have the votes on the energy package. Senator \nBingaman has an amendment. We have a House bill. We could move to \nsubstitute the Bingaman amendment for that. The Republicans have \nsomething they want to do on drilling. And then we will see if there is \ngoing to be the alternative offered by the Gang of 10. We could do that \nall today. We may go into the evening a little bit. But I hope Senators \nrealize that every little bit of time that we don't have an agreement \nto move forward with legislation, it makes it more apparent that we are \ngoing to have to be here tomorrow, maybe Saturday, and certainly after \nthe adjournment date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S8964-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on the front page of every newspaper in \ntowns and cities throughout the country, Americans are reading stories \nabout our economy and they are looking for answers. They are looking \nfor leadership. They are looking for a sign that everything is going to \nbe OK--or, at the very least, a sign that their elected officials are \ncommitted to fixing the problem.\n  I know that, in Kentucky, it is not the hard work that bothers them. \nThey have always held up their end of the bargain. It is what they \ncan't control that makes them nervous. They want to know that their \npensions, their savings, and their families are going to be OK. They \nwant to be reassured that the investments taxpayers made this week were \nthe right thing to do.\n  Considering what the American people have seen from some of our \ncolleagues on the Senate floor this week, I understand their \nnervousness. Instead of working to ease the anxiety Americans are \nfeeling about the economy, some are using the anxiety to continue their \neverlasting campaign. Instead of coming together to face this problem \nhead-on as a country, some colleagues have taken to the Senate floor to \nblame Republicans for the bad news.\n  It is little wonder why Americans hold this Congress in such low \nregard. We can all come up with a million reasons to blame someone for \nbad news, but it doesn't change the fact that we all face these \nchallenges together. It is time to confront the problem rather than \npoint fingers. That is the challenge for this Congress in the days \nahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S8964-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as the old saying goes:\n\n       If it were not for the last minute, a lot of things would \n     not get done.\n\n  Well, God willing, we are nearing the last minutes of this Congress \nand, God willing, we are close to getting a lot of things done.\n  For the better part of this Congress, we have been working on passing \nthree major tax bills. One has been to put America on sounder energy \npolicy. The second has been to prevent the AMT from raising taxes for \nmillions of American families. The third has been to extend a series of \ntax incentives that are vital to American jobs and families. Frankly, \non these matters, what unites us is far greater than what divides us. \nAnd now, at the last minute, it is time to get these bills done.\n  With this in mind, I have worked with my good friend Chuck Grassley, \nthe ranking Republican member of the Finance Committee. Together, we \nhave worked with the majority leader and with the Republican leader. We \nhave worked with Senator Durbin and with Senator Kyl. All of us have \ncome together on a way to get these major tax bills done.\n  What has divided us on tax measures has been mostly whether to pay \nfor them. Democrats have said we should. Republicans have said we \nshould not. So we and the leaders have come up with an honorable \ncompromise. We propose that we pay for the energy tax bill, that we not \npay for the AMT bill, and that we pay for roughly half of the tax \nextenders bill. With this structure, we believe we can pass these \nbills, we can get a lot of things done, and we can help to bring on the \nlast minutes of this Congress.\n  Passing these bills would get a lot of things done. The Energy bill \nwould help to create well-paid jobs in the growing field of new energy \ntechnologies. It would help to secure America's independence from high-\npriced foreign oil. It would help us to move closer to addressing \nglobal warming.\n  The AMT patch would keep some 21.5 million taxpayers from being hit \nby a tax increase. We must not let more families fall into the AMT.\n  The tax extenders package would help provide relief in a time of \neconomic uncertainty. The economy clearly is struggling and so are \nAmerica's working families. Markets are experiencing volatility. In \ntimes such as these, Americans need tax cuts they have come to count on \nto help them get by. The tax extenders package includes the research \nand development tax credit to spur new, high-paying jobs. It includes a \nteacher expense deduction to help teachers who put out money from their \nown pockets to buy school supplies. It includes a tuition deduction to \ngive families needed relief from rising college costs.\n  As well, this package includes the mental health parity bill. The \nbill has been a long time in coming. We must pass this bill for many \nreasons. It would ensure that families facing mental health challenges \nwould receive fair treatment--treatment the same as those facing other \nhealth challenges. This legislation is a tribute to the hard work of \nSenators Paul Wellstone, Ted Kennedy, and Pete Domenici.\n  This package also includes disaster relief. It would aid the victims \nof the Midwest floods. It would help the victims of all recent \nfederally declared disasters. It includes relief for the victims of \nHurricane Ike and Gustav.\n  This is a good package. It would make real progress on energy policy. \nIt would extend needed tax relief in hard times. It would give us a \nchance to show American families that Congress can work for them.\n  So let's hasten the last minutes of this Congress. With that, let's \nfinally get a lot of things done. Let's do the work of governing that \nthe American people sent us here to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this week I witnessed the devastation and\n\n[[Page S8965]]\n\ndestruction of Hurricane Ike in Texas, and, of course, that destruction \nhas extended beyond the State of Texas to other parts of the country as \nwell, leaving thousands of people without homes, millions without \nelectricity, and countless without water and the necessities of life.\n  I traveled with the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, \nMichael Chertoff, the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the President of the \nUnited States over the past few days surveying this devastation and \ntrying to do everything we could collectively, together with the \nGovernor of Texas, the National Guard, the Red Cross, and many \nvolunteers, to get people back to their regular routine, hopefully back \nin their homes, back to work with power restored and the necessities of \nlife being provided as soon as possible.\n  There are a lot of people working to make that happen, from private \nbusinesses to the electric utilities that are trying to get power back \nonline to the oil companies. All are working as hard as they can to get \nlife back to normal as soon as possible.\n  I also witnessed firsthand the importance to the Texans who were \npersonally affected by this catastrophe of a calm, reassuring response \nfrom the Government, a disciplined approach to the problems, and a \nsense of optimism from their leaders about the future. What people want \nfrom their Government is not panic, is not hyperbole, is not partisan \nattacks and the blame game. What they want is their leaders to talk \nabout how we are going to methodically work through this challenge and \nfind a solution to the problem.\n  Unfortunately, in Washington, we are facing a very different but \nnevertheless very real storm in our financial markets. The problem is, \nwe have witnessed the most recent string of failures that have not seen \nany precedent since perhaps the Great Depression.\n  The collapse of companies such as AIG and Lehman Brothers, the \npurchase of Merrill Lynch by the Bank of America, the probable sale of \nWashington Mutual, all on the heels of a massive Government takeover of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, point to a financial system in serious \ntrouble.\n  Today we do not yet know where this will all lead, especially how far \nthe fallout from the troubled subprime mortgage industry will reach. \nThe irresponsibility of so many financial institutions has touched \nalmost every segment of our economy, and the effects are far from over.\n  While I have heard from many of my colleagues demand for quick \nGovernment action to counter this downturn, I would caution all of us \nthat the most important approach is to take a deep breath, to consider \nthe facts, and then to act carefully and deliberately, working together \nacross the aisle to identify the actual causes of this crisis and what \nwe might do to make things better.\n  The first thing you need to do in a crisis is to take stock of the \nsituation and identify the specific problems that need to be addressed \nso we can be sure or as much as humanly possible that we don't \noverreact or actually try to treat a problem that doesn't exist or to \nmake something bad even worse, indeed.\n  Now, if there ever were a time, is a time for level heads and \nbipartisan cooperation, not overreaction and not partisanship. Now is \nthe time for an earnest and probing discussion.\n  It is clear that many factors have contributed to this problem, and I \nhave to say both political parties share part of the blame. In the 2 \nyears since our Democratic colleagues have taken over, Congress has \nfailed to address the rising debt of the Federal Government, with \ndeficits at record levels, important tax relief that has not been made \npermanent and which will expire in 2011, and all attempts at addressing \nAmerican energy production and, of course, rising prices at the pump. \nAll of those efforts have effectively been blocked.\n  But rather than engaging in the blame game, which is a world class \nsport in Washington, and pouncing on this crisis as an opportunity to \npoint fingers, the American people need for us to come together and \nhave a serious, nonpartisan discussion, investigation, and resolution \nof these challenges.\n  One thing that should be crystal clear, however, is that mixing \npublic purposes and private enterprise in a quasi-governmental entity \nis a dangerous business, if not more so, than the free market itself. \nThe unprecedented collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has sent shock \nwaves throughout our financial system.\n  That is why 2 years ago I joined several of my colleagues in an \nattempt to reform government-sponsored entities. That is what these two \nentities, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, are called, government-sponsored \nentities. Unfortunately, folks on the other side of the aisle blocked \nevery attempt at that time to reform this broken system. At the time, I \nsuppose things seemed to be working pretty well. But as we know now, \nthese institutions were rotten to their core and destined to ultimately \nfail. Looking back on those actions then, they seem even more urgent \nnow than they did then.\n  Now that these institutions have failed, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are calling for investigations they rejected 2 short \nyears ago. Representative Barney Frank at that time said:\n\n       These two entities--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--are not \n     facing any kind of financial crisis. The more people \n     exaggerate those problems, the more pressure there is on \n     these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable \n     housing.\n\n  I have said things in the past that I have later on learned to regret \nor had cause to revise and correct. I bet Barney Frank wishes he could \ntake those words back today. We have colleagues in this body who went \nso far as to ask the President to immediately reconsider his ill-\nadvised reform proposals. They are the reform proposals we have now \nenacted, unfortunately now that the horse is out of the barn and Fannie \nand Freddie have failed.\n  It is difficult to think that we may have had a chance to head off \nthe collapse of Fannie and Freddie and prevent a lot of turmoil we are \nfacing now. But, indeed, with the benefit of hindsight, if we had acted \n2 years ago or even 5 years ago to implement the reforms we have now \nsince implemented, we could have headed off this calamitous failure of \nthese two huge quasi-governmental institutions.\n  Then, of course, there is the fact that Fannie and Freddie faced \nincreasingly well-documented corruption and mismanagement. In 2006, \nsome of the very leaders of those entities paid huge civil fines for \nbasically cooking the books to make the profit look better than it \nactually was in order to reap huge financial bonuses. Yet for some \nreason, the Department of Justice gave them effectively a slap on the \nwrist, a civil fine rather than prison time and true accountability.\n  Because of the intertwining nature of these quasi-governmental \nentities, Fannie and Freddie, they developed ultimately a powerful \nlobby group and became institutionalized in the Government. They \ndeveloped, in effect, a political shield that made them invulnerable to \nthe kind of scrutiny that private enterprise ordinarily would have and \nthat proper oversight would produce.\n  I have sent a letter to the Attorney General of the United States \nasking for a full investigation into what happened with Fannie and \nFreddie and to find out how two institutions that are so central to the \nissuance of mortgages in the United States could have been so poorly \nmanaged that they had to be bailed out by the American taxpayers.\n  Fannie and Freddie have proven that direct governmental involvement \ndoes not necessarily mean better management, nor does it preclude \nfinancial disaster. In fact, the Government involvement itself may have \ncreated a false sense of security that made it less obvious that these \nentities were, indeed, increasingly a house of cards.\n  What was the result? The result is now at least an estimated $200 \nbillion tab for the Federal taxpayers, maybe higher in the end. All \ntold, Reuters has estimated the Federal Government bailouts to date \nhave totaled roughly $900 billion. Between Fannie and Freddie, Bear \nStearns, the FHA, and an assortment of other programs, we will spend \nalmost $1 trillion of the American taxpayers' money. This kind of \nspending on private entities and loans cannot protect the economy and \nwill only result in higher taxes to pay for it and further dwindling of \nthe value of the dollar.\n\n  That is why rather than reacting hastily and increasing the cost to \nthe\n\n[[Page S8966]]\n\ntaxpayers, we need to cool down, take a breath, and look at the economy \nmore closely.\n  No one suggests that regulation is not appropriate in the right \ncircumstances, but the Democratic candidate for President, Senator \nObama, used the word ``regulate'' or ``regulation'' or a variation of \nthose words 26 times in a single speech this last week--26 times. What \nwe need to ask ourselves is if we have the right systems in place to \noversee and effectively regulate industry where necessary.\n  Anyone who has studied corporate law can tell you there are plenty of \nlaws and regulations governing the conduct of business entities. The \nquestion we ought to be asking is, are they working effectively or is \nthe redtape and bureaucracy self-defeating? What can we do to improve \nthe regulatory regime, not necessarily use it as an excuse to grow the \nsize of Government along with an increase in the tab the taxpayers \ninvariably will pick up?\n  Rather than taking over businesses and guaranteeing against failure, \nhow can we, working together in a nonpartisan fashion, create a more \neffective framework to help business succeed?\n  The most important thing to remember is that the free enterprise \nsystem will weather any storm and will bounce back if we let it. But if \nwe use this as an excuse to grow the size of Government, to create new \nbureaucracies, to create more redtape, and to create an increase in the \ncost of Government, then it will crowd out the new job creation we need \nin order to keep this economy strong.\n  So instead of trying to box in our economy and control it from \nWashington, DC, how it works in every minute detail, we should be \ncreating the most fertile environment for the economy to grow. \nOverregulating the economy is like planting an oak tree in a flower \npot. Even if it survives, it will never get very big.\n  There are some things Congress can do and can do quickly. We can \nreassure the American worker that we will keep taxes low rather than \nallow them to grow and increase. We can keep taxes low for individual \nAmericans, for corporations, for small businesses. We can make sure the \ncapital gains rate is low. We can do what Senator McCain has proposed \nand lower the corporate tax rate, which is the second highest in the \nworld.\n  Does it make sense to increase corporate taxes because we can stand \nup here and rail against corporations and excess of the market or does \nit make sense to make it more likely that these corporations will \nactually create jobs in America because of a more favorable tax regime \nrather than go abroad and create those jobs because the cost of doing \nbusiness is too high here?\n  Another thing we can do is we can help cut out-of-control Federal \nspending. That would help the economy. Spending more Federal dollars \nwill only take away from the people the resources we need to strengthen \nthe economy--the small businesses that innovate and drive competition, \nthe workers who make industry run, and the consumers who return money \nto the economy.\n  Another thing we can do is commit to free trade. Free trade creates \njobs in America from the agricultural produce we grow to the products \nwe manufacture that we have new markets for in other parts of the \nworld. If we make a commitment to open new markets to fair and equal \ntrade, we give new outlets for American goods and produce. Trade has \nalways helped businesses grow, and it creates new jobs and higher wages \nright here in America. That is why one thing we could do to help \nstimulate our economy and get the economy back on track is to pass the \nColombia Free Trade Agreement, something that Speaker Pelosi has \nblocked for many months now.\n\n  We can open America's energy resources for more domestic exploration \nand production.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we can open America's energy resources \nright here at home so that we would have to spend less money buying \nthat oil from the Middle East or from Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.\n  Americans are feeling the pinch of high gas prices, and not just when \nthey fill their gas tank. They feel it at the grocery store, and in the \ncost of fuel for the schoolbuses run by the school districts around the \ncountry, even for our law enforcement officials who drive police \ncruisers. These high gas prices affect all of us, and we could do \nsomething about it today, right here in Congress, by our being part of \nthe solution and eliminating the moratorium on offshore exploration and \ndevelopment of the oil shale out in the Midwest and up in the Arctic, \nwhere we could produce as many as 3 million additional barrels of oil a \nday right here at home, and reduce the amount of money we send to the \nMiddle East to buy that oil. We know also that it would create jobs \nhere in America to produce it.\n  So there are a number of things we can do right here in the United \nStates at this time that do not result in overregulation and \nstrangulation of an already struggling economy.\n  We have seen financial institutions, such as the Bank of America, \nstepping in and shoring up the market and preventing some of the \nlosses. And while there is no doubt this consolidation of the financial \nmarkets is painful for many, we have to focus on long-term solutions \nthat will put the economy back on track. Again, this situation calls \nfor a calm, nonpartisan discussion that looks for the real root of the \ncauses of this crisis and the best ways to recover from it. We should \nremember the old carpenter's adage to measure twice and cut once. We \ncan't afford to make hasty decisions that may in the long run hurt our \neconomy.\n  We may never be able to foresee every crisis that our country or our \neconomy will face, but I do know that America is built to weather any \nstorm. American ingenuity and the engine of capitalism will always \nrebound, if we will let it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am always both amused and amazed to hear \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle talk about taxes, because \nthey are always talking about cutting the corporate tax rate. They \nalways say our corporate taxes are higher than anyplace in the world. \nBut that is on paper that they are the highest. The effective tax rate, \nwhat corporations are paying, is much lower. They know that and we know \nthat.\n  It is so often a smokescreen. Senator McCain and my friends on the \nother side of the aisle always want to talk about tax cuts. It is \nalways a smokescreen to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans while \nthe middle class, again, bears the brunt. The Obama tax cuts are all \nabout the middle class. He wants to cut taxes on people making $30,000 \nand $50,000 and $100,000 and $150,000 a year.\n  Certainly people making $300,000 a year can afford a little more, and \nthat is exactly the way Senator Obama has looked at it, and the way so \nmany of us have looked at it as well.\n  We want to get our fiscal house in order. We have seen what happens \nwith President Bush and Vice President Cheney. We have seen what \nhappens with the Federal budget. We are spending close to $3 billion \nevery week on this war in Iraq. These tax cuts, which have gone \noverwhelmingly to the richest citizens, have put us behind the eight \nball. And we have seen our budget surplus--the day George Bush was \nsworn in--go to more than a $1 billion a day budget deficit. That is \nbecause of tax cuts for the rich. Not for the middle class, tax cuts \nfor the rich. We want to move some of that money to middle-class tax \ncuts. And as we exit the war in Iraq and we begin to free up money, we \nwant to use that for the domestic needs many of us have talked about.\n  The real reason I came to the floor, though, was to talk about what \nhas occurred this week, what has happened on Wall Street. I am fairly \nincredulous that some in this body would still be saying we have too \nmuch regulation. It is pretty clear the cowboys on Wall Street and the \nderegulation of the Bush era--the Bush years--have led us to these \nproblems. Not that this leads us to a Great Depression. I don't believe \nthat. But it has led us back to some of the same kinds of unparalleled\n\n[[Page S8967]]\n\nzealous greed on Wall Street which we haven't seen since the 1930s.\n  But what concerns me is that I remember 3 years ago, in early 2005, \nGeorge Bush, Dick Cheney, and John McCain barnstormed the United States \nand campaigned all over the country for Social Security privatization. \nThey worshipped at the mantle of how important it would be to have \nthese private accounts; that if only people on Social Security invested \nin the stock market, think how much better off they would be. That was \nin 2005. Imagine if Bush and Cheney and McCain, and others around here, \nhad succeeded in that endeavor. Imagine what people would be doing \ntoday if we had privatized Social Security. When people opened their \nstatements--if they had private accounts--imagine what they would be \nfeeling today with what has happened in the stock markets.\n  That, to me, is the biggest contrast between the direction the \ncountry is going in now, the direction John McCain and George Bush \nwanted to take also, and the direction so many senators, such as \nSenators Whitehouse, McCaskill, and others in this body want to take \nus. Do we want to privatize Social Security, put senior citizens at the \nmercy of Wall Street? What would happen to their solid, guaranteed \nSocial Security payments? Do we want to do that or do we want to make \nsure we will protect those Social Security payments?\n  I can't get Social Security out of my mind this week as I have seen \nwhat has happened with AIG, and what happened a few weeks ago with Bear \nStearns, and what happened with Lehman Brothers and the stock market, \nand that we would possibly put people into private Social Security \naccounts. That is what John McCain wants to do. That is what they tried \nto do in 2005.\n  That is why I am so thankful that enough people in this body and in \nthe House of Representatives, where I was in those days--and, more \nimportantly, enough people in the United States, enough citizens--\npushed back and said no to the Bush-Cheney-McCain privatization of \nSocial Security. It wouldn't have worked then, and it clearly won't \nwork now. It is a bad idea. It is one of the major issues I think we \nwill see in the fall campaign, this whole idea of privatizing: \nprivatizing Medicare, privatizing Social Security, privatizing the \nmilitary, and all these contracts that Halliburton-Bechtel have.\n  Senator McCaskill, who will speak in a few moments, has done a great \ndeal of work in trying to root out all the waste and all the \nillegalities, if you will, in some of these private military contracts. \nThis whole effort to privatize has clearly cost taxpayer money. It has \ncaused great risk for far too many people in Medicare. Thank God we \nwere able to stop the Social Security privatization. If they had had \ntheir way in 2005, seniors would be much more worried about the cuts \nand the decline and the disintegration and the disappearance of their \ndollars if we had instituted private accounts, coupled with higher gas \nprices and food prices, and all that we have seen.\n  So again, I remind my colleagues that they have not given up on their \nidea in 2005. We know they will try it again. If they have a majority, \nand if Senator McCain is elected, we know they will try privatization \nagain. It was a bad idea then, it is a bad idea now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to open my remarks by simply \nstating that words matter. And to the distinguished Senator from Ohio, \nfor whom I have the greatest of respect, I gained a lot of concern \nyesterday when I heard the words used in so many speeches given on the \nfloor, especially at this disconcerting time, when the American public \nis so worried about our marketplace and our financial markets.\n  As Members of the Senate, I think it is very important we be \nconscientious, that we be positive and prudent in every word we use. \nWords matter. We have seen a savings and loan in California fail \nbecause words got out that there might be a failure and it became a \nself-fulfilling prophecy. We have seen things happen in the economy in \nlarge measure that were reactions to words that were said which should \nnot have been said at all.\n  In making that statement, I am going to make a speech about what is \nhappening right now on Wall Street and about our role in the Senate, \nand I will remember the admonition I gave that words matter. The words \nI want to use are words that I think are in the best interests of the \npeople of the United States, but more importantly of this institution.\n  We can't play this historical blame game and set a precedent for the \ncause of what is going on in the financial markets today. We have to \nrecognize that we equally, as Republicans and Democrats, have a \nresponsibility to work together and to recognize the things we have \ndone that have contributed to the problem. And I will give some \nexamples.\n  One of the problems with the American economy today is the deficit of \n$407 billion, which we will realize at the end of this month when the \nfiscal year ends. Yes, part of that deficit is because we have been at \nwar. And had we not gone to war, we might be in the throes of \nterrorism. But that is another debate. But a lot of that deficit is \nabout Federal spending. A lot is about the budget process. As Members \nof the Senate, we have yet to take up a single appropriations bill on \nthe floor of the Senate, yet in less than 2 weeks, this fiscal year \nwill end. I think it is our responsibility at a time of deficit, at a \ntime of spending difficulties to get that debate to the floor of the \nSenate and for all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, to recognize \nwe have a role in what that deficit is.\n  Secondly, the concerns regarding the financial markets now started \nback in May and June, when oil prices went to $147 a barrel. We are \nwithin a week, almost a week, of adjourning, yet it is patently clear \nthere will be no resolution by Congress to any way forward in terms of \ndomestic exploration or dealing with all the other energy issues out \nthere. Those are two things that, had we been doing them this month and \nin the months previous, might have helped to ameliorate at least part \nof the concerns on Wall Street.\n  So I think all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must \nunderstand that we share part of the blame as an institution, and not \njust as one political party blaming the other. It is time for cool \nheads and prudent minds in the Congress to prevail. Americans are \nconcerned. We should not play politics with their future. By way of \nexample, the previous speaker brought back the entitlement debate of \n2005 and the challenge of privatization. We must remember today that \nthe debate we had was about one of the problems that Congress has \ncontributed to, and that is a Social Security system from which we have \nborrowed all of its trust fund and spent all of its money. Because of \nthe way we have managed the fiscal house of the United States, we will \ndissipate the trust fund in its entirety by 2043. That is something we \nought to be addressing. We can have differences on the way to address \nit, but to try to stigmatize a sitting President or a future candidate \nwhen they were trying to address a problem that we all know exists is \nnot the way to deal with these financial difficulties.\n  On the question of regulation, I am not so sure it is a question at \nall of needing more regulation as much as it is a question of using the \nregulatory powers that we now have to address some of these problems. I \nwill give a couple of examples.\n  On Wall Street, within the Securities and Exchange Commission, there \nused to be an uptick rule. And the uptick rule basically was that as \nthe market was going up, you could play the market game with \nspeculation. But if it was going down, you couldn't short sell it. What \nis happening on Wall Street now is there are a lot of people selling \nshort, and they are selling short to the detriment of the American \npeople but to the benefit of the individuals themselves. That is part \nof the problem. We should ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nlook deeply into regulations that worked in the past and see if they \ncan't bring back the uptick rule to stop what has been an abuse in \nterms of short selling.\n  Secondly, I have said on the floor of the Senate three previous \ntimes--and I will repeat it today because I believe it strongly, and \nbecause I think it is more true now than ever before--a significant \ncontributor to the problems we\n\n[[Page S8968]]\n\nare facing today is an absence of transparency and accountability on \nbehalf of investment banking. The subprime securities that were created \non Wall Street, and were rated investment grade by Moodys and Standard \n& Poor's, are the fundamental foundation of these financial collapses \nnot just in the United States but around the world because those \nsecurities were bought as capital basis for many of the lending and \nfinancial institutions.\n  As we look to the future, and the recovery which we will see--because \nAmerica always recovers--it is important that we never allow something \nlike the securitization of high-risk paper and rating as investment \ngrade to ever happen again without some level of transparency and an \nabsolute level of accountability on behalf of the institution.\n  I want to tell a brief story, only for the purpose of letting people \nknow what a small world we live in and how our words matter and the \nconsequences to our actions. I traveled to Kazakhstan in August with \nthe majority leader, Senator Reid. It was an educational trip of \nimmense benefit to me, and I think of immense benefit to the country, \nin terms of what we did. Kazakhstan is a country of 16 million people \nwith the largest find of oil in all of Asia. It is a wealthy country \nthat built its capital city of Astana from scratch 10 years ago.\n  When we landed in Astana and left in a vehicle provided by the \nembassy and drove into town, there were landscaped gardens, beautiful \nbuildings, gold-domed mosques--obviously, the best of everything \nbecause of the wealth they had.\n  But I noticed something interesting. I counted 17 buildings, midrise \nand high-rise, partially completed, cranes up, with nobody working. \nWhen we got to the embassy I asked our ambassador when he said, Are \nthere any questions: Is there a holiday?\n  He said: No. Why do you ask?\n  I said: Nobody is working on all these unfinished buildings. Why is \nthat?\n  He said: The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.\n  I said: I don't understand.\n  He said: The bank of Kazakhstan bought a bunch of the subprime \nsecurities in the United States, and when Merrill Lynch wrote their \nportfolio down to 22 cents on the dollar, the bank of Kazakhstan did \nthe same thing. And when they did, they had to stop funding \nconstruction and stop funding mortgages.\n  If we do not think we live in a small world, if we don't understand \nthe consequences of our words and the policies that are initiated in \nterms of our financial products, we have another thought coming.\n  Last, I compliment the Congress and use as an example the housing \nbill, where we have the power to address and strengthen our economy. In \nJuly, this Senate passed, by a vote of what I remember to be 83 to 14--\nit may have been slightly different--a bipartisan housing bill that did \na number of things: It modernized FHA, raised loan limits, provided a \nrefinance mechanism for subprime loans rather than foreclosure, but \nalso answered the question of Freddie and Fannie and provided an \nopportunity for the Secretary of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve \nto address Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae should those institutions get in \ntrouble.\n  While we were gone in August they got into trouble. They got in \ntrouble in part because of their own doing but in trouble in part also \nbecause of a lack of confidence. If we had not passed that bill that \nallowed Secretary Paulson to come in and stabilize Freddie and Fannie, \nthe source of mortgage money for the people of the United States of \nAmerica, the problems we are experiencing now are nothing compared to \nwhat would have happened.\n  Our actions matter and our words matter. We should be careful to \nunderstand that in a time of uncertainty in our financial markets and \nof concern by all Americans, rich and poor, Republican and Democrat, \nour words matter. We should work diligently to give people confidence \nin our system of government and our financial system, provide the \nintervention and the appropriate aid while necessary but not \noverregulate or stigmatize a system that has worked for the better part \nof two and a quarter centuries.\n  I love this country, and I appreciate the people I represent. I \nsuffer as they do today with the uncertainties in the financial \nmarkets. I hope all of us will commit ourselves to do those things \nwithin our grasp to see to it that we have a sounder economy, a sounder \ndollar, and a sounder America. Let's do our appropriations. Let's have \nan energy policy that works. Let's look at those positive things that \nhave happened in the past on Wall Street that can bring back a level of \naccountability and transparency that are absolutely essential in the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to talk about what is \ngoing on in our economy right now. I think it is important that we \npoint out a couple of things at the outset.\n  First, I had the opportunity yesterday afternoon to spend some time \nwith some great community bankers from my State. They said something to \nme that really resonated, and that is: I don't think we have done \nenough to tell America the difference between deposit banks and \ninvestment banks. There are a whole lot of folks I represent right now \nwho are nervous. My sister caught her mother-in-law with cash in her \npillowcase this week.\n  The reason they are nervous is, frankly, a lot of them don't \nunderstand that the problems caused here were not because of deposit \nbanks. Deposit banks are highly regulated. Deposit banks have both \nState government and Federal Government looking over their shoulders \nevery single day. Deposit banks are fine in the United States of \nAmerica--partly because of appropriate regulation and oversight by \nState and Federal Governments. And they are insured. Every account in \nAmerica that is in a deposit bank is insured by the Federal Government \nfor up to $100,000.\n  In fairness to all those great community banks and the banks in my \nState that have used sound business practices, that have not let greed \nbe their watchword, that have served their communities well, let me \nreassure all the people who bank at those great banks that they can \ntake a sigh of relief today because the problem we have in our economy \nis not with deposit banks.\n  Let's step back and see what has happened. There are three things \nthat have happened. No. 1 was massive deregulation of exotic financial \ninstruments in investment banks and insurance companies. No. 2, there \nwas a huge amount of greed. And, No. 3, no one was watching out for the \ntaxpayers.\n  I heard my colleague from Georgia talk about short selling and naked \nshort selling and saying we need to tell them to enforce the law.\n  Think about that for a minute. We need to tell somebody to enforce \nthe law as it relates to trading? I heard just an hour ago that today \nthe SEC is going to enforce naked short selling rules. Naked short \nselling--it would take longer to explain than I have this morning, but \nsuffice it to say, it is wrong and bad because when you are hedging, \nwhen you are long selling and short selling, you need to take delivery. \nThat is how this works. There are rules against naked short selling, \nbut they were not enforced.\n  They are enforcing it today. Why wasn't it enforced last week? Why \nweren't the rules enforced the week before? Why weren't the rules \nenforced last year? They didn't want to. It is pretty simple. Nobody \nwanted to enforce the rules. Why not? Because the titans of Wall Street \nwere in charge. The titans of Wall Street have had their way with this \nWhite House.\n  Facts are stubborn. If the law is on the books and this \nadministration is not enforcing it, they need to explain to the \nAmerican public why the taxpayers are now on the hook for hundreds of \nbillions of dollars because these guys didn't think it was important to \nenforce the rules against their friends.\n\n  Credit default swaps is another exotic financial instrument that came \nin vogue after the massive deregulation of this administration. It was \nmade possible by the deregulators.\n  Here is the thing that is killing me--it is just killing me. All of \nthe folks\n\n[[Page S8969]]\n\nwho have been screaming: Deregulation, get government off our backs, \nevil government off our backs, big bad government off our backs, \nderegulate, deregulate, deregulate--in the last 24 hours there has \nbeen--do you remember the transformer toys that went from an animal to \na massive machine? We have transformers around here. These massive \nderegulation advocates all of a sudden say: We have to enforce rules on \nWall Street. We have to regulate.\n  Come on. Do you think we are dumb? You can't transform overnight from \na big bad deregulator to I am now the cop on the beat; I'll take care \nof Wall Street. It is not honest. Be principled. If you are a \nderegulator and you want to live with these consequences, you want to \nsay to the American people: Hey, when we deregulate, this is the risk. \nThis is the risk we are taking with your money.\n  They are going after the status quo. Many of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle, they are fighting the status quo. Guess what. They \ncreated it. This was their plan. It didn't work. It didn't grow our \neconomy. It didn't create our jobs. American families, for the first \ntime in our history, have gone down in terms of their average income. \nFor the first time in our history America is not growing. Our \nprosperity is not growing.\n  Senator Phil Gramm marshaled through the bill that allowed investment \nbanks and insurance companies to run wild. I have Missouri families who \nhave lost jobs. I have a lot of autoworkers who are losing their jobs \nin Missouri. One of the things that is hard--one of Senator McCain's \neconomic advisers, Senator Gramm, did this massive deregulation. We \nhave another one who was a CEO of a major corporation who walked away \nfrom a company with $42 million in her pocket. Because she did well? \nBecause she got that company to the stratosphere? No. She was fired. \nThe board of directors fired her and then gave her a $42 million \npayday.\n  I have to tell you, in Missouri that doesn't compute. It just doesn't \ncompute. When you lose your job because you haven't done a good job, \nyou should not get paid for it. I know I am offended at the notion that \nany of this taxpayer money is going to go to multimillion-dollar \npayouts to anybody who ran any of these companies. It is one of the \nthings we have to pay very close attention to because now that taxpayer \nmoney is on the line, we have to make sure it is spent appropriately.\n  CEO salaries are out of control in this country, and it is not a \nmatter of being competitive. It is not that we have to pay our CEOs so \nmuch more because everybody else is. Right now in America a CEO is \nmaking 40 times the average worker's salary. Do you know what it is in \nJapan, one of our competitors? Ten times. It is only ten times.\n  I want to mention Social Security because my colleague from Georgia \nmentioned Social Security. I want everyone to dwell just a minute on \nthis notion. At the same time Senator McCain, Senator Gramm, and many \nothers were saying deregulate, deregulate, what else were they saying? \nThe future of Social Security depends on privatization. Privatization \nof Social Security was our ticket to the promised land for stability in \nthe Social Security Program. Think about that today. Think about what \nthat means today, yesterday, Monday. Think about the consequences. We \nneed to realize we have to learn from our mistakes. We have to fix what \nis broken and, for gosh sakes, we cannot talk about privatizing Social \nSecurity on Wall Street right now. I am hopeful this will be a wake-up \ncall to all those people who advocate the privatization of Social \nSecurity.\n  They say: Deregulate, get government off our backs, free market, lax \nenforcement, big government, bad government, deregulate, deregulate, \nget government off our backs, big government, bad government--until \ntheir friends get in trouble. Do we have a free market with oil? No, we \ndon't have a free market for oil. We subsidize oil companies. Do we \nhave a free market for the pharmaceutical companies? No, Medicare D was \na huge profit subsidy for drug companies in this country. Do we have a \nfree market for Wall Street? No, we are rushing in to save them.\n  When their friends get in trouble, who comes to the rescue? Who comes \nto the rescue when trouble arrives at the doorstep? The taxpayers of \nthe United States of America, and that, in fact, is the rub.\n  What we have to have is reasonable regulation. We have to enforce our \nlaws--both our competitive laws and our regulatory laws--and we have to \nmake sure now that we watch the taxpayer money and make sure not a dime \nof it goes to a payout to anybody who doesn't deserve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the American \neconomy. I think most of us are talking about it. Most everybody is \nthinking about it. With the financial markets in turmoil, the \nconfidence of investors and consumers across my home State of Missouri, \nthe Nation, and the globe is being challenged. Most of the media focus \nis on the struggles in Wall Street. My concern is for American \nfamilies, anxious about their security, the security of their savings, \ntheir retirement, their assets, and their pensions.\n  I was disappointed to see that Leader Reid, just a day or so ago, \nsaid no one knows what to do at the moment. There are steps taken in an \nemergency matter. The fire department in this matter has been the \nFederal Reserve and the Treasury. We will look at and evaluate their \njudgment, but it appears they have at least stemmed the tide at this \npoint.\n  But there are a lot of things that we ought to be talking about doing \nnow. There are changes that need to be made. There are changes that \nneed to be made in regulation, there are changes that need to be made \nby legislation, there are changes that need to be made in attitudes.\n  If you want to get into the blame game, I assure you there is plenty \nof blame to go around. This concept, the original concept of \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, well, that is one that certainly got \noff the track. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle sponsored GSEs. \nBut they got themselves trapped way out in financial derivative \nspeculation and got outside their charter. The regulation was \ninadequate. There are some of us who called for a strong regulator. \nOthers who were defending the GSEs said: No, no, no, we like having an \nineffective regulator. There are a lot of examples of that. But this is \nnot the time to point fingers. The American people want solutions \nbecause these are serious and difficult times for everyone. As I said, \nfamilies are worried about their personal finances and savings.\n  American families are already struggling with the housing crisis as \nwell as high energy prices, which lead to food and other cost \nincreases, as well as health care and education. Those have to be \nforemost in our minds. I understand. I have listened to the people in \nmy State. I have heard their concerns.\n  These families need to know that the country's leaders take their \nconcerns seriously and are working together to make the right response \nto this crisis. We have to instill confidence in the public that our \nactions are also driven by the best interests of taxpayers so they and \nfuture generations are not saddled with debts driven by unnecessary \nbailouts and that Government has a plan to avert similar future crises. \nTo instill confidence, we must show true leadership and, I would hope, \nput aside the politics of blame and partisanship. We have had enough of \nthat already. The American people have had too much of that. Enough. \nThat ought to be it. Leadership should be about bringing people \ntogether and coming up with real solutions driven by the best interests \nof our families and country.\n  Leadership is needed now more than ever. I call for my colleagues in \nthe Senate, the House, the administration, the SEC, the Federal \nReserve, and others in the public and in the private sector to come \ntogether to share ideas and discuss them.\n  Let me share some of the ideas I laid out in a letter I sent out \nyesterday to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, SEC Chairman Chris Cox, \nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and the House and Senate \nchairmen and ranking members of the Banking Committee, because \neverybody needs to be in it.\n  First, we must all recognize that America's financial system is \nstruggling under the weight of greed, laced\n\n[[Page S8970]]\n\nwith regulatory loopholes, and compromised by complexity. Only \nfundamental reform of those excesses will prevent abuse from returning. \nWe need reform to provide greater oversight, transparency, and \naccountability so that our economy, housing system, and consumers are \nadequately protected. The status quo is clearly unacceptable, and \ntaxpayer-funded bailouts are not the answer. It is time that we reform \nour antiquated regulatory system to close loopholes to prevent the same \ntype of problems we are currently experiencing, by taking a number of \nactions to address our regulatory system, ensure better market \nstability, and protect consumers.\n  Regulation needs to be carefully considered because there are very \nstrong arguments that some of the problems today where some of the \nmajor institutions were put in a trap are the result of the post-Enron \nwave of trying to make everything bad illegal. Mark-to-market \naccounting was one of the things that has been instituted well \ndepending upon how you apply it when you are in a meltdown. Right now, \nthe value of a house covered by a mortgage may have declined 10 to 20 \npercent. But if nobody is buying that mortgage, if there is no market \ntoday for that mortgage, it might be marked to zero--to zero--when, in \nfact, the real value is probably no less than 75 or 80 percent. That \nputs a hit on the balance sheets, and that has repercussions throughout \nthe system. That may be part of the cause. We need to look at that.\n  We need to see if excessive regulation in mark to market has put \nbusinesses at risk that should not be at risk, that should not be \npushed into bankruptcy. Just as the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, designed to \ncurb excesses--which were actually punished under existing law--has \ndriven many of our financial institutions offshore, we have to be \nconcerned about what the impacts of the regulations are. But I firmly \nbelieve that corporations must be held accountable for their bad \ndecisions.\n  Similarly, we must find a way to prevent the use of golden parachutes \nto reward executives for their failed leadership. I think we were all \noutraged to hear the golden parachutes that were going to be given to \nthe leaders of the GSEs who had been responsible for their institutions \nbeing wiped out essentially and put into conservatorship. I do not want \na single taxpayer dollar going to pay them bonuses. If a baseball \nmanager does a bad job, he gets fired. When we have a bad job being \ndone by a financial institution head, the taxpayers sure ought not be \ncalled on to give that executive millions of dollars in a golden \nparachute.\n  But we also must find a way to restore personal responsibility in \nsociety. Responsible investors have an obligation not to enter into \ninvestments they do not understand. Responsible private citizens have \nan obligation not to take on debt they cannot afford.\n  Mortgage brokers should no longer receive special treatment allowing \nthem to escape regulation and licensing requirements standard for \nbrokers of other financial products. The Treasury's Regulatory \nBlueprint issued last March contains many positive recommendations, \nsuch as the creation of a new Federal commission, the Mortgage \nOrigination Commission, which I support. I plan to introduce \nlegislation to establish the Mortgage Origination Commission.\n  The Federal Government must step up its efforts in financial literacy \nand education, and pre- and post-purchase housing counseling. Most \nborrowers made responsible decisions in selecting appropriate financing \nvehicles for purchasing their homes and other major assets. \nUnfortunately, a large number of borrowers either knowingly or \nunknowingly agreed to loans that were detrimental to their families and \ntheir credit.\n  Mr. President, I stand ready to work with my colleagues here in the \nSenate on working on real solutions so that our Nation has confidence \nthat we are here for them.\n  We have talked about the American dream. There are some who, in the \nname of the American dream, have pushed home ownership on people who \ncould not afford it. Clearly, home ownership is part of the American \ndream, and in assisting families and individuals, we should do all we \ncan to achieve that. I have worked for that as lead appropriator on \nhousing on this side of the aisle for many years.\n  However, we have seen that American dream become the American \nnightmare when people have been given too-good-to-be-true offers for \nmortgages and asked to take on mortgages that consume all of their \navailable income.\n  Well, I will tell you something, having a little experience in owning \nhomes. Along with home ownership comes some potential financial \nresponsibilities. A couple of weeks ago, we had to have our basement \npumped out. That costs a lot of money. In the winter, I have had \nfurnaces go down, or if we have a family emergency, that may make the \nmortgage payments unaffordable. We must ensure that, to the greatest \nextent possible, people understand that the benefits of home ownership \nare balanced against the risks and the costs to the homeowner, the \nneighbors, the communities, and even the financial marketplaces. Home \nownership must be promoted, not on the basis of getting the number of \nhomeowners up to an arbitrary level but in a responsible manner \nfocusing on the best interests of families and not on investors or \nothers pushing mortgages.\n  You can live in rental housing until you have the funds to buy a \nhouse. I have lived in rental housing. Many people live in rental \nhousing. Before you decide to buy a home, if you are not financially \nwell experienced, there are a lot of good counseling concerns around \nthat can help you determine if you can buy a home and help you \ndetermine how much you can afford to pay and what kind of mortgage you \ncan afford to take on.\n  I worked with Senator Dodd last year to get $180 million for \ncounseling for homeowners facing foreclosure. Well, that is working, \nand we are seeing a tremendous need for that counseling. I have visited \nwith homeowners being counseled by housing counselors, with housing \nadvocates, with community leaders, local officials who are worried \nabout their communities going down, and the one thing every one of \nthose people say is: We need counseling not just at the time of \npossible foreclosure but before they purchase the house so they do not \nget in the crack of foreclosure.\n  Well, I think we have to strengthen the oversight, the regulatory \noversight of the housing finance market. The creation of a new \nregulator with more expansive powers to oversee the two mortgage \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, if they \ncontinue to exist, was a long overdue and necessary step.\n  While the importance of making this legislative change cannot be \nunderstated, I emphasize the critical need to ensure that the new \nregulator not repeat the same mistakes made by its predecessor. That \nregulator did not examine, did not look at the practices, did not call \nattention to the practices that the GSEs were engaged in, which may \nhave provided some short-term profits to their shareholders and \ncertainly healthy returns for their executives, but they failed to \nidentity and said that these were sound operations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter I referred \nto earlier printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 17, 2008.\n     Hon. Henry Paulson, Jr.,\n     Secretary,\n     Department of the Treasury.\n     Hon. Ben Bernanke,\n      Chairman, Board of Governors,\n      The Federal Reserve.\n     Hon. Chris Cox,\n     Chairman,\n     Securities and Exchange Commission.\n       Dear Secretary Paulson, Chairman Bernanke, and Chairman \n     Cox: America's financial system is groaning under the weight \n     of greed, laced with regulatory loopholes, and compromised by \n     complexity. Only fundamental reform of these excesses will \n     prevent abuse from occurring again. Thank you all for your \n     leadership in these uncertain times. As a long-time \n     participant in housing policy and oversight issues, I offer \n     my assistance in the hard work of reform that is too often \n     left undone after the crisis recedes.\n       This week's turmoil in the financial market is the latest \n     in a series of events that has shaken the confidence of \n     investors and consumers throughout the nation and the world. \n     While the media focuses on the struggles of Wall Street, my \n     concern is for American families anxious about the security \n     of their savings, retirement, assets, and pensions. These \n     American families--already struggling with a housing crisis \n     and high gas, food,\n\n[[Page S8971]]\n\n     health care and education costs--must be foremost in our \n     minds as we address the credit crisis. Our actions must be \n     driven by the best interests of the taxpayers so that they \n     and future generations are not saddled with debts driven by \n     unnecessary bailouts. The public must know their government \n     has a plan to avert similar future crises.\n       Any reform must provide greater oversight, transparency, \n     and accountability so that our economy, housing system, and \n     consumers are adequately protected. The status quo is \n     unacceptable. Taxpayer-funded bailouts are not the answer. \n     Loopholes in our antiquated regulatory system must be closed \n     to prevent the same type of problems that we are currently \n     experiencing.\n\n\n                 Corporate and Personal Responsibility\n\n       Excessive greed and abuse call for greater accountability \n     at all levels of government and private life. We must end the \n     troubling cycle of rewarding corporate failure with taxpayer-\n     funded bailouts. Corporations must be held accountable for \n     their bad decisions. Executives should not be rewarded with \n     golden parachutes for their failed leadership. We must also \n     restore a sense of personal responsibility in society. \n     Investors have an obligation not to enter into investments \n     they do not understand. Private citizens have an obligation \n     not to take on debt they cannot afford.\n\n\n                      Stronger Regulator Oversight\n\n       We must strengthen regulatory oversight of the housing \n     finance market. The creation of a new regulator with more \n     expansive powers to oversee the two mortgage government-\n     sponsored enterprises--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--was a long \n     overdue and necessary step. We must also ensure that the new \n     regulator--the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)--not \n     repeat the same mistakes made by its predecessor--the Office \n     of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). It is \n     critical that FHFA have adequately-skilled staff and strong, \n     competent leadership. OFHEO leadership delayed issuing risk-\n     based capital standards and consistently stated that the \n     enterprises' financial condition was healthy, and adequately \n     capitalized to continue meeting America's housing needs. They \n     were wrong on all counts.\n\n\n                 Oversight of All Mortgage Originators\n\n       In addition, I support Treasury Secretary Paulson's efforts \n     to address gaps in mortgage origination oversight. The \n     mortgage brokers who originated many of the subprime and Alt-\n     A loans that are major sources of the housing crisis were not \n     subject to adequate federal oversight. Mortgage brokers \n     should no longer receive special treatment allowing them to \n     escape the regulation and licensing requirements standard for \n     brokers of other financial products. The Treasury's \n     Regulatory Blueprint issued last March contains many positive \n     recommendations, such as the creation of a new federal \n     commission (the Mortgage Origination Commission). I will \n     introduce legislation shortly to establish the Mortgage \n     Origination Commission and ask for your support in moving \n     this legislation through the Congress.\n\n\n                Eliminating Abusive Short-Sale Practices\n\n       Excessive speculation that asset prices will fall, or \n     ``short-selling,'' is artificially destroying the value of \n     investments and companies. Actions to consider curtailing \n     short-selling abuse include reinstating the ``uptick'' rule \n     and protections on short sales. The uptick rule was \n     established back in 1929 to provide stability to the \n     marketplace. The SEC eliminated the uptick rule last year. \n     Some experts believe that the elimination of this rule has \n     contributed to the volatility in the stock market and the \n     record levels of shorting. Accordingly, the SEC should \n     reexamine its decision and reinstate this important rule. The \n     SEC is now in the process of finalizing two rules to \n     strengthen protections against short-selling. They should \n     finalize these rules as quickly as possible and strongly \n     enforce regulation of ``naked short sellers.'' Other experts \n     believe that mark-to-market accounting regulations need to be \n     reviewed to see if they have been inappropriately applied. I \n     urge you to review mark-to-market and to recommend any needed \n     changes. We must also increase oversight of hedge funds to \n     assure transparency, accountability, and avoidance of abusive \n     practices.\n\n\n              Consumer Confidence and Financial Education\n\n       The Federal government must step up its efforts in \n     financial literacy and education, and pre- and post-purchase \n     housing counseling. Traditionally, borrowers have made \n     responsible decisions in selecting appropriate financing \n     vehicles for purchasing their homes and other major assets. \n     Unfortunately, in recent years a large number of borrowers \n     either knowingly or unknowingly agreed to loans that were \n     detrimental to their families and their credit. To address \n     this problem, I recommend that you aggressively promote \n     financial literacy and homeownership counseling to consumers \n     and promote greater transparency in the loan process by \n     reforming the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).\n       Confidence in our financial markets is being severely \n     challenged during these difficult times. As the Federal \n     government's financial leaders, your commitment to address \n     the regulatory structure and educate consumers will be \n     critical not only to guide our nation out of this economic \n     downturn, but to mitigate future crises. While regulatory \n     reform and additional resources for counseling and financial \n     literacy are needed, we should also rethink our policy \n     emphasis on homeownership. Homeownership is the linchpin of \n     the American Dream. Assisting families and individuals \n     achieve that dream should continue. However, we must ensure \n     that the dream does not become a nightmare. Housing policy \n     must be re-examined so that the benefits of homeownership are \n     appropriately balanced against its risks and costs to \n     homeowners, neighbors, communities, and the financial \n     markets. Homeownership must be promoted not on the basis of \n     increasing the homeownership rate to an arbitrary level, but \n     in a responsible manner that focuses on the best interests of \n     the individual and family, and not on investors.\n       The leadership you have shown during this financial crisis \n     is commendable. Now we must work together to bring about \n     further reform to financial and housing markets. Thank you in \n     advance for considering my suggestions. I look forward to \n     working with each of you to restore Americans' trust in their \n     financial institutions and in their government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Christopher S. Bond,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown.) The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as we speak, people are losing their \njobs, losing their homes, and often losing the hope that their \nsituation will improve anytime soon. According to many, the worst may \nyet be ahead of us. For the first time in generations, we Americans can \nno longer promise our children they will be better off than we are. \nThat prospect strikes at the very heart of the American dream.\n  In less than 2 months, Americans will elect a new President who will \ninherit an economy indelibly marked by the negligent and incompetent \ndecisionmaking of the Bush administration. No matter what one \nPresidential candidate may think, the fundamentals of our economy are \nfar from strong. Our economy is off the rails. I believe it is \nimportant to take a few minutes to consider how it got dragged off the \nrails and, more importantly, what must now be done to restore \nAmericans' faith in our economy and put our country back on more solid \nfiscal ground.\n  President Bush's successor, whoever he may be, will confront four \nserious problems: an out-of-control financial market, a staggering \nFederal debt, a looming crisis in health care costs, and an increase in \nSocial Security obligations.\n  For the past 8 years, the Bush administration has preached over the \nfinancial markets a gospel of uncontrolled deregulation. Simply leave \nthe banks and the financiers and the lenders to their own devices, they \nsaid, and all will be well.\n  Well, all is not well. Markets are places where people come to make \nmoney; they do not come for altruistic motives. And some are clever \nenough when they come to those markets to try to rig or game the market \nin their favor, to gain monopoly power, to hide information, to cheat, \nto create special advantage--in short, to find a way to gull the \nsuckers. Markets need to be defended against that age-old risk. Markets \nhave to operate honestly, transparently, and reliably. That is where \nregulation comes in. That is how markets are defended against crooks \nand schemers. That is why we have an FTC, an SEC, a CFTC, a FERC, to \nkeep markets honest. Special interests constantly seek special \nadvantages, and it is the regulators' job to push back. In that \nconstant struggle of the special interests against the regulators, the \nBush administration always took the side of the special interests. They \nhave systematically undercut the regulators in their efforts to keep \nmarkets safe. And now here we are.\n\n  Senator McCain has been against the regulators, even back to the \nsavings and loan scandals of the 1980s. The schemers, the manipulators, \nthe Enrons, the subprime mortgage packagers, the oil market \nspeculators, the credit default swap artists--they all found a friend \nin the Bush administration. They all found an ally in the Bush-McCain \npolicies of deregulation. And now here we are.\n  Under an administration that cared more about protecting big \ninvestors than protecting consumers, one might expect that at least the \nstock market would have thrived. But after 225 percent growth during \nPresident Clinton's 8 years in office, the stock market now hovers just \nabout where it stood in 2001, when President Bush took office. Instead \nof growing by leaps and\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\nbounds, as we in America have come to expect, under the Bush \nadministration, our economy stood still. I ask my colleagues: Would \ninvestors prefer 225 percent growth and then paying a responsible \ncapital gains tax, or would they prefer having big fights about what \nthe capital gains tax rate should be while nobody makes any money? \nThere is a lesson here. Bad economic policy is not cured by mindless \ntax cuts. Anybody in their right mind would rather be here than here, \nif they are in the market.\n  The month George Bush became President, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the nonpartisan accounting arm of Congress, projected we would \nsee surpluses straight through the decade. These budget surpluses, the \nproduct of President Clinton's responsible governing, were projected to \nbe enough to completely wipe out our national debt by 2009--to \ncompletely wipe out the national debt by 2009. Instead of maintaining \nthe surpluses and paying down the national debt, President Bush chose \ntax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, a war he wouldn't pay for, and \nbad economic policies to amass a mountain of debt that he will leave to \nthe next generation.\n  This chart shows the difference between the budget left by President \nClinton and the one President Bush created. The difference between the \ntwo lines, this red area, is the measure of the cost of the Bush \nPresidency. The difference between the surpluses left by President \nClinton and the deficits run by President Bush and his Republican \nenablers in Congress is a staggering $7.7 trillion. Perhaps the more \ntangible number is $260 billion, the interest we will have to pay next \nyear on this Bush debt, $260 billion in interest, much of it to foreign \nnations such as China and Saudi Arabia that do not have our best \ninterests at heart. If we could have used that $260 billion that we now \nneed to pay interest on the Bush debt for other national priorities, \nhere is what we do could have done: fixed almost every unsound bridge, \ndoubled enrollment in Head Start to help kids get ready for school, \ndoubled all Pell grants to help kids get access to college, and \nprovided every American with health insurance--all of it. That is how \nbig $260 billion is, and that is what we are blowing on the Bush debt.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that \nthe national debt will go up by another $2.5 trillion over the next \ndecade. The next administration is going to have to figure out how to \ndeal with that mountain of debt. I think we need a Bush debt repayment \nauthority to study the possibility of bringing the Bush debt off \nbudget, to handle it responsibly, to remind the American public what \nthis Presidency has cost them, to pay the Bush debt down responsibly \nover time. But we must do something.\n  In addition, as the baby boom generation reaches retirement, we also \nface a tidal wave of health care costs that threatens to drown the \nTreasury and force unthinkable choices about health care for the \ncitizenry. According to an analysis conducted by the nonpartisan \nGovernment Accountability Office, we have $34 trillion in unfunded \nfuture Medicare liabilities alone. That is unsustainable. And the \nlonger we wait to reform the system, the worse it will become. \nPresident Bush has wasted the better part of a decade standing idly by \nas this problem exploded, as health care costs grew and opportunities \nfor reform came and went. Time is not on our side. The need is \npressing, and we have spent 8 years making no progress at all.\n  I have said over and over on many occasions in this Chamber that our \nhealth care system needs fundamental change. I will not pursue that \npoint at this juncture, but let me say, our health care system is \nitself broken. It delivers unsatisfactory results at vast expense, and \nwe need to fix it.\n  As we prepare for a new administration, we need to prepare for the \nwave of health care costs coming at us. Systemic reforms--a health IT \ninfrastructure, payment reform, major quality improvements--must be at \nthe heart of that effort.\n  Finally, the next administration must grapple with the challenges of \nSocial Security. As with all these issues, the choice of President will \nmake all the difference. Senator Obama will ensure that Social Security \nremains a strong bedrock of retirement security for generations to \ncome. But Senator John McCain supports privatizing Social Security, \nputting it in the stock market. This is an important point. Senator \nMcCain and his Republican allies prefer to invest seniors' Social \nSecurity funds in the stock market that just dropped by 500 points the \nday before yesterday and another 450 points yesterday, the very same \nstock market that stagnated through the entire Bush Presidency while \ncosts and prices rose by double digits. That is not a solution. That is \nmore of the same problems.\n  As for the blame game, which I have heard a bit about on the floor \nthis morning, it is bad enough that bad economic policy caused this \npreventable disaster. It is worse if we should fail to learn its \nlessons. I can understand why the proponents of the economic theories \nthat brought us here don't want that talked about, but it would be \nwrong and irresponsible not to learn from this disaster. It was \npreventable. We made mistakes. It was economic folly that brought us \nhere and regulatory irresponsibility. To now allow that entire lesson \nto pass would be an added shame for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Hampshire, \nSenator Judd Gregg, for allowing me to speak, rather than going back \nand forth. I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the recent collapse in \nthe financial markets and the Republican economic policies that have \nbrought us to this point.\n  On Monday, Lehman Brothers filed for the largest bankruptcy in \nAmerican history. This collapse will hurt hardworking Americans' \nability to access credit and could deteriorate their pension plans. For \nexample, the city of Detroit's general retirement system that had \ninvested in the bank could lose up to $25 million.\n  Can you imagine what would have happened if Social Security had been \nprivatized?\n  This failure occurs as Bank of America announced that it was buying \nMerrill Lynch and the Federal Reserve announced it was taking over the \nworld's largest insurer, AIG, for the staggering cost of $85 billion. \nWashington Mutual is still struggling to survive their investments tied \nto the mortgage market.\n  As a result of these events, the Dow Jones dropped more than 500 \npoints on Monday--the biggest drop since September 11, and Wednesday it \ndropped almost 450 points.\n  These announcements come as middle-class families face the highest \nunemployment rate in 5 years, record home foreclosures, and \nskyrocketing gas and grocery prices.\n  Despite these conditions, our colleague, Senator McCain responded \nthat ``the fundamentals of our economy are strong.'' I would like him \nto tell that to the 84,000 Americans who lost their jobs, or the 91,000 \nfamilies who lost their homes last month, or the 605,000 Americans who \nhave lost their job since January.\n  And now, Senator McCain's solution is to create a commission to study \nthe problem. Middle-class families don't need a study to tell them that \nwe're in an economic crisis.\n  They see it every day when they try to fill up their gas tanks or put \nfood on the table.\n  They have known it for the past 8 years, as they have watched jobs \nsent overseas and their pensions disappear.\n  Unlike Senator McCain's economic adviser, Phil Gramm, middle-class \nfamilies don't need a study to tell them that this isn't a ``mental \nrecession.'' What they need are real economic solutions and not 4 more \nyears of the same failed economic policies.\n  So one of the question I know Michigan families have is, how did we \nget here? Unfortunately, these failed policies go back for some time.\n  One example can be seen under the Republican Congress, when McCain's \nformer economic adviser Senator Phil Gramm slipped a provision known as \nthe ``Enron loophole'' into the 11,000-page appropriations bill on a \nFriday night before recess.\n  This provision allowed financial institutions to trade an unlimited \namount of energy commodities on dark, over-the-counter markets that\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\nare beyond the jurisdiction of the Commodities Futures Trading \nCommission.\n  Only now, with Democrats in the majority, are we seeing any \naccountability as we closed the Enron loophole. However, trading on the \nbilateral swaps markets and the electronic trading facilities are still \nconducted on these dark markets with no transparency or regulation.\n  The Commodities Futures Trading Commission only has the power to get \ninformation on these markets on an ad hoc basis so speculative \ninvestors continue to pour money into the markets without any \noversight.\n  Yet Republicans continue to oppose providing more authority and \nresources to the CFTC.\n  Authority that would allow necessary regulation of our commodities \nmarkets and protection against manipulative behavior that could \ninfluence the price of food and gas for every American.\n  This just reiterates the failed philosophy of President Bush, John \nMcCain and Republican economics that believe in less oversight, less \naccountability--more greed--at the expense of American families.\n  Nowhere is this seen clearer than what is happening in the housing \nmarket-- the root of our current crisis. The lack of regulation and \noversight by the Bush administration allowed for predatory lending to \nflourish.\n  In 1994, Congress gave the Federal Reserve the authority to prohibit \nthese unfair and deceptive lending practices. The Fed waited 14 years \nbefore implementing regulations.\n  Senators Schumer, Sarbanes, and Dodd introduced legislation to \nprotect homeowners from predatory lending. No Republicans cosponsored \nthese bills.\n  Then in 2004, despite warnings, the Fed actually promoted \nnontraditional mortgages over fixed-rate mortgages, resulting in the \nskyrocketing use of ARM and subprime mortgages.\n  In 2006, regulators finally finalized rules over nontraditional \nmortgage products, but it did not apply to subprime mortgages.\n  The Democratic-led Congress held oversight hearings, spoke out time \nand time again, and yet the administration still sat back and did \nnothing.\n  In 2007, the Treasury was still downplaying the subprime crisis by \nexplaining that it was ``largely contained'' and admitting they ``could \nhave done more sooner.''\n  The Republican philosophy of no public accountability and unlimited \ngreed created markets where these risky mortgages, that they promoted, \nwere packaged and sold as complex debt securities without any \noversight. Then, without any regulation, credit rating agencies were \nallowed to inflate the value of these complex securities and assign \ntriple-A ratings despite their inherent risks.\n  Greed continued to fuel the vicious cycle until our financial \nindustry was completely entangled in these risky securities.\n  When homeowners defaulted on their loans, it sent ripple effects \nthroughout the entire economy, bringing down the large banks that had \ninvested in the mortgage market, such as Bear Stearns and Lehman \nBrothers.\n  Time and time again, Democrats have tried to enact changes, but every \nattempt has been blocked by Republicans.\n  In 2005, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would have \ncreated a new regulator to oversee government sponsored enterprises--\nproviding the authority to set capital requirements and limit portfolio \nsize.\n  When I was on the Banking Committee, we worked to enact this \nlegislation, but we were blocked by the Bush administration.\n  This session Democrats introduced legislation to strengthen \nregulation over government sponsored enterprises, to keep families in \ntheir homes and help communities struggling with foreclosures.\n  Republicans opposed this legislation and, while more families lost \ntheir homes to foreclosures, they continued to block the bill for \nmonths.\n  Only after Fannie and Freddie reached the point of crisis did the \nadministration finally lift their opposition, further highlighting the \ninherent problems with the Bush/McCain economic philosophy--it is \nalways too little too late.\n  Now while Republicans have let the markets ``work it out,'' small \nbusinesses and families are faced with tightening credit markets, job \nlosses, increased foreclosures and a loss of confidence in our economy.\n  Each of these examples shows the fundamental failures of the Bush/\nMcCain economic policies. Policies that are based on greed as a \nnational virtue and high profits at any cost. Policies that send \nAmerican jobs overseas while increasing tax breaks for big oil.\n  Our economy cannot take another 4 years of this failed policy; \nAmerican families cannot take another 4 years. Out country can do \nbetter. It is time for a change.\n  We are in a very important discussion right now, not only about what \nwe need to do together to move our country forward, but it is important \nto talk about how we got here, because how we got here matters. \nCritiquing the philosophy that got us here matters, if we are not going \nto repeat it in the future. When we sum it up, when I look at what I \ncall ``Republican economics 101,'' it is more deregulation. We heard it \nagain today. I heard it from one of my colleagues today, the problem \nwith all of this is that we need more deregulation, more deregulation. \nLack of accountability, I call it, lack of transparency. More home \nforeclosures have come from Republican economics 101, more jobs lost, \nmore tax breaks for the wealthy. That seems to be the answer to \neverything: Lose your job, let's have another tax cut for the wealthy. \nLose your house, let's have another tax cut for the wealthy. Can't pay \nfor gas at the pump? How about another tax cut for the wealthy. \nFinancial markets exploding? Let's have another tax cut for the \nwealthy. That seems to be the mantra of the Republican economics 101 \ntheme. More excessive profits for oil companies which have translated \ninto $5 at the pump.\n  The bottom line is, we don't want more of the same. That is why it \ndoes matter how we got here. We do not want more of the same. The \nAmerican people cannot take more of the same. Enough is enough. That is \ncertainly what the people in Michigan are saying.\n  Let me specifically speak to what has occurred this week. On Monday, \nLehman Brothers filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history. \nThis collapse will hurt the people of Michigan, hard-working Americans' \nability to access credit, and could very well deteriorate pension \nplans. For example, we heard yesterday the city of Detroit's general \nretirement system that has invested in the bank could lose as much as \n$25 million. I am sure that is only one example. Imagine what would \nhave happened if President Bush had succeeded, with John McCain's \nsupport, in privatizing Social Security. I will never forget what \nhappened after Enron, when I had former employees come in to me who had \nlost everything, trusted the company, invested in the company, lost \neverything. They said: Thank God for Social Security. It is the only \nthing I have left.\n  Imagine if the Republican philosophy of privatizing had happened. One \nof the things I am most proud about in working with our Democratic \nleadership and our majority is we were totally together in blocking the \nPresident from proceeding. It was one of the most important \nachievements as a Democratic majority, stopping the President, John \nMcCain, and others who wanted to privatize Social Security. We now know \nthat the failure of Lehman Brothers occurred as Bank of America \nannounced it was buying Merrill Lynch and the Federal Reserve announced \nit was taking over the world's largest insurer, AIG, for the staggering \ncost of $85 billion. Washington Mutual is still struggling to survive \ntheir investments tied to the mortgage market. As a result, we have all \nseen the Dow Jones drop more than 500 points on Monday, the biggest \ndrop since September 11, 2001. Wednesday it dropped almost 450 points.\n  Most importantly is how this affects families, how it affects middle-\nclass Americans who are working hard every day. They are playing by the \nrules. They expect our Government to enforce the rules and enforce \naccountability. They are being hit with the highest unemployment rate \nin 5 years. It went up again yesterday, unbelievably, to now in \nMichigan an 8.9 percent unemployment rate. That doesn't count people \nwho have been unemployed so long they are not a part of\n\n[[Page S8974]]\n\nthe system anymore, or the people who are working one job, two jobs, \nthree jobs, part-time jobs trying to hold it all together, hoping maybe \none of them will have health insurance, maybe just one of them, for \ntheir families.\n  We have seen record home foreclosures for families, skyrocketing gas \nand grocery prices. These are the consequences of the reckless policies \nI am most concerned about.\n  Despite these conditions, our colleague John McCain responded--and he \nsaid it more than once; 16, 17 times at least that I know of--the \nfundamentals of the economy are strong. He is now saying that he meant \nthe American people, the American worker. I know the American worker is \nstrong and productive and hard-working. But we all know that is not \nwhat was meant by that comment, the fundamentals of the economy are \nstrong. He and Herbert Hoover share those comments, the gilded age of \nthe 1920s, when the wealthy got wealthier and wealthier and wealthier, \nuntil the system crashed and a great Democratic leader, Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt, came into office and put the American people first, put \npeople back to work and created Social Security and began to rebuild \nthe country. We are at one of those times where we need that kind of \nleader to rebuild for the American people and create jobs and put \npeople back to work.\n  I would like Senator McCain and others who believe the fundamentals \nof the economy are strong to tell that to 84,000 Americans who lost \ntheir jobs or the 91,000 families who lost their homes last month, or \n605,000 people who lost their jobs since January, 605,000 good-paying \nAmerican jobs and counting since January.\n  Now we hear the solution is to create a commission or to study the \nproblem. That is what we need, to study the problem. We know what the \nproblem is. The problem is, we need to get people back to work. We need \nto stop this failed Republican philosophy that has made the rich \nricher, while picking the pockets of every middle-class American and \nmaking those in poverty find more and more desperation every day. We \nknow what is happening. We don't need an economic study to tell us that \nPhil Gramm, a former colleague of mine, chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, was wrong when he said it is a mental recession. We are not \nmaking this up. We certainly are not a nation of whiners.\n  So the question is, how did we get here? Unfortunately, this does \nrelate to failed policies. One example was under the Republican \nCongress when Senator McCain's former economic adviser and friend, \nSenator Phil Gramm, slipped a provision called the Enron loophole into \nan 11,000-page appropriations bill on a Friday night before a recess. \nThat provision allowed financial institutions to trade an unlimited \namount of energy commodities in the dark in over-the-counter markets \nthat are beyond the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. Only now, with our Democratic majority, have we begun to \nget accountability back because we have closed that Enron loophole.\n  However, trading on the bilateral swaps markets, the complicated \nfinancial markets, the electronic trading facilities are still being \nconducted in the dark with no transparency, no regulation, no \naccountability for investors, no accountability for the American \npeople. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission only has the power to \nget information on these markets on an ad hoc basis. So speculative \ninvestors continue to pour money into markets without any oversight.\n  Yet Republicans continue to oppose more authority and resources to \nthe CFTC. We have a bill on the Senate floor right now, a speculation \nbill to stop speculation, that includes providing more authority and \nresources to the CFTC, and it has been filibustered by Republican \ncolleagues.\n  This just reiterates the failed philosophy of this President, \nPresident Bush, of John McCain, and Republican economics that believes \nin less oversight, less accountability, and more greed at the expense \nof the American people.\n  Mr. President, we have had enough. Nowhere is it seen more clearly \nthan in the housing market, which is the root of the crisis. The lack \nof regulation and accountability by the Bush administration has allowed \npredatory lending to flourish. It is important to note that clear back \nto 1994, Congress gave the Federal Reserve the authority to prohibit \nthese unfair, deceptive lending practices, and they waited 14 years to \nimplement this authority--14 years.\n  Mr. President, I know my time has come to a close, so I will not go \nthrough all of the other things that have happened--the times the \nDemocrats have proposed legislation, the warnings we have given, the \nfact we have tried over and over and over again to pass housing \nlegislation.\n  I was here on the floor of the Senate when a Republican colleague \ntalked about the fact that we finally passed housing legislation. But \ndo you know what? We took way too long. The bottom line is this: We \nhave been trying time and time again to enact changes, to bring \naccountability on behalf of the American people, and we have been \nblocked over and over again. It is important the American people \nunderstand we can do better than these failed Republican policies. It \nis time for a change.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The senior Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, obviously, I rise to express some \ndifferences of opinion with the prior two speakers, but I want to speak \nmore generally on the issue of where we stand relative to the financial \nmarkets. But if ``doing better'' is to follow the proposals of Senator \nObama, which have been estimated by a very legitimate estimating source \nto include over $300 billion of new spending annually on new programs \nthat are unpaid for, I do not think that is doing better. If ``doing \nbetter'' is to follow a path where we raise taxes on the American \npeople, especially small businesses, I do not think that is doing \nbetter.\n  If ``doing better'' means you approach an issue which is as deep and \nas significant as what we confront today in the financial markets with \na lot of partisan rhetoric about the failure of the Bush administration \nto make the stock markets function correctly, when this Congress has \nbeen controlled by the Democratic Party for 2 years and had more than \nample opportunity to address the restructuring of the regulatory \nentities, and, in fact, proposals were made to restructure Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, which were rejected by Members from the other side of \nthe aisle, by legitimate leadership on our side of the aisle on that \nissue, that is not better.\n  The Nation today confronts a very significant fiscal issue. The \nfinance houses of New York are in disarray, the credit markets are \nlocked down, and the American people and the world generally are very \nconcerned about their assets and how they are protected and whether \nthey are going to be able to continue to be liquid and viable.\n  It is not constructive for the Senator from Rhode Island to come to \nthe floor and start pointing to the Clinton years as showing a huge \nrun-up in the stock market and the Bush years as showing a flat stock \nmarket, and in the process ignoring the Internet bubble of the late \n1990s, which drove the stock market down radically in 2001 and led us \ninto a recession. That run-up occurred under the Clinton years and, \nobviously, they benefited from that, and the Bush years, regrettably, \ngot socked with a recession.\n  That is not constructive. It is not constructive to put charts up \nthat claim an economic recovery has not occurred since the Internet \nbubble burst and the 9/11 attacks occurred. In fact, over the last 6 \nyears, Federal revenues were up until about 5 months ago when we hit \nthis significant economic slowdown. Federal revenues had reached \nhistoric highs. We had seen 3 years of the greatest increase in Federal \nrevenues in the history of this country as a result of tax law that \nencouraged entrepreneurship, encouraged people to do things which are \ntaxable.\n  Job creation was pretty significant too. Over 8.5 million jobs were \ncreated over that time period. Yes, jobs have been lost, and that is \nnot good, in the last few months. But to put that in the context of a \npartisan atmosphere which says this is all the functioning of an \nadministration, when Congress controls the purse strings and Congress \ncontrols a large part of the policy and\n\n[[Page S8975]]\n\nCongress is controlled by the Democratic Party, is inappropriate, in my \nopinion.\n  Furthermore, if you want to look for culprits, the real culprit of \nthis economic disorientation we are going through is that credit was \nmade too easy for too long and, basically, borrowing became an \ninexpensive event, almost a zero-cost game because of the interest \nrates which the Fed maintained over a long period of time at such a low \nlevel--the Federal funds rate--and, as a result, these dead instruments \nwhich were written on real estate were written in a way that basically \nneither looked at the underlying asset or equity value to support that \ndebt instrument nor looked at the fact in the outyears--as those \ninstruments required reasonable return through interest increases--\nwhether the borrower could support them. So we have had this huge \ndislocation, this meltdown in the subprime market, which is being \nfollowed on by other real estate instruments.\n  So it is not constructive, and it is certainly a reflection of a lack \nof leadership when the only answer on the other side of the aisle is to \ncome forward and start claiming they are pure and this side or the \nPresident is not, when, in fact, there is more than enough blame to go \naround as to how we got into this situation.\n  The Federal Reserve deserves a lot of that. We in the Congress \ndeserve a lot of it for not doing our job in oversight. And, obviously, \nthe administration deserves a lot of it. But it is not unilateral in \nits placement, to say the least.\n  So how do we get out of this? Well, I think, first off, we ought to \nacknowledge that an aggressive effort is being made by the Treasury \nSecretary and by the Chairman of the Fed to try to control the damage. \nWhen they have seen entities such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae or \nentities such as AIG--whose failure would have a systemic effect which \nwould roll through the financial markets of the country, destabilizing \nnot only those businesses but also banks down the road and, in the end, \nMain Street, and cost Main Street jobs, and cause tremendous disruption \non Main Street--they have stepped in and stepped in aggressively. I \nrespect what they have done, and I have supported what they have done.\n\n  The markets have also, basically, to some degree, reflected the fact \nthat at least in the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac area, this was the \nright action. They still have not digested the AIG issue.\n  While we are on the AIG issue, I think it is important to point out \nthat we have heard the statement that it is an outrage that $85 billion \nis going to be put in to basically take over this insurance company--\nthe largest in the country. Well, first off, that money does not come \nfrom the Federal Treasury. It comes from the Federal Reserve. The only \nway it is going to appear on our books, on the Federal Government's \nbooks relative to the budget of the United States is if the Federal \nReserve pays us less in profit than they annually pay us--and they \nannually pay us about $25 billion--because of the cost of that action.\n  Secondly, what the Federal Reserve did was not bail out AIG. They \nwiped out, for all intents and purposes, the stockholders. All you need \nto do is look at the primary stockholder in that company, whose net \nworth dropped by $5.8 billion--which is the report I saw yesterday--as \na result of this action. That is a pretty deep loss: a $5.8 billion \nindividual loss. In addition, it is likely the senior debt will lose \ntheir position, and it will be wiped out. What will happen is that the \nparts of that company are going to be sold off in an orderly way, and \nit is very likely a large part, if not all, of that $85 billion will be \nrecovered and the Federal Reserve won't end up with any cost on its \nbooks and may actually make some money on this action. But in the \nprocess, more importantly, they will have done an orderly unwinding of \nthat company so you do not have a meltdown of that company, which would \nlead to a downstream, catastrophic event for literally hundreds of \nbanks in this country--small banks, especially--that have used the AIG \ninsurance to basically solidify the capital on their books. If those \nbanks fail--and they might well have failed if AIG had gone down in an \nimplosion--then Main Street would be affected and jobs would be lost \nand people would be dramatically impacted.\n  So this was an effort to pay some money now up front in order to \navoid big damage down the road. In my opinion, it was an effort that \nhad to be taken. But for Members of the other side of the aisle to come \nhere and start pounding their chests about how outrageous it is that \n$85 billion is being spent in this manner, either they do not \nunderstand the issue and understand what happened here or they are \nmisrepresenting the issue and in a way that is truly not constructive \nto settling the markets or to getting a resolution that will be \npositive.\n  We still have an issue, and it is fairly significant. The issue is \nthat the underlying credit in the mortgaged area--mortgage-backed \nsecurities--is locked up. It is virtually impossible to move these \nsecurities off the books because nobody knows the value of these \nsecurities. As a result, the marketplace is not working correctly and \nyou cannot move money and you cannot make loans and you cannot get \neconomic activity and thus you cannot create jobs. The engine of our \neconomy has always been our real estate industry.\n  So we as a government have to be thinking about how we should address \nthat. It may take some significant creativity. I respect the chairman \nof the Banking Committee in the House who has openly said maybe we \nshould take another look at something like the Resolution Trust \nCorporation which we had in the 1990s. This may be the type of vehicle \nwe have to take a look at. But to accomplish that, we have to have a \nmature approach. We have to have an approach that is not a juvenile, \npartisan attack coming from the other side on initiatives which might \nconstructively resolve this or at least should be debated in an \natmosphere where there is some sort of seriousness about the debate \nbesides hyperbole and political advantage trying to be scored.\n  I am willing to acknowledge and openly acknowledge that I respect the \nfact that Congressman Frank has put this concept on the table. It would \nbe nice if somebody on the other side of the aisle who had spoken \ntoday--and I did not hear anybody--had come forward and said they \nrespected the fact that the Secretary of the Treasury had been willing \nto take some aggressive action to try to stabilize Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac and AIG for the betterment of this country and our economy, \nbut all we are hearing is hyperbole, unfortunately. It is time we had \nsome adult reflection on this around here. Yes, it is an election year.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, it is an election year, and we know it is a \nPresidential year. We know everybody is trying to score points. What we \nare dealing with here is so big and so important to every American--\nbasically, the fiscal solvency of our Main Streets and the fiscal \nsolvency of the banks that support Main Street--that we can't allow \nourselves--or we should not allow ourselves--to devolve into this type \nof hyperbole and partisanship. It would be nice if people around here \nwould be willing to sit down and acknowledge that there are thoughtful \nideas coming at this and there are creative ideas, but they are also \ngoing to be controversial; and that in the atmosphere of high \npartisanship, which I have heard this morning on this floor, we are not \ngoing to be able to discuss intelligently thoughtful, creative, and \nbold ideas because they are going to be savaged by petty partisanship.\n  We have a job before us as a Congress. Clearly, the Secretary of the \nTreasury is engaged and the Chairman of the Fed is engaged, and I hope \nthe Congress will get engaged fairly soon, as well, in a substantive \nand positive way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Hampshire. \nHis remarks are right on point. I appreciate the tenor of what he is \nsaying, and I thank him very much for his mature and sober judgment.\n\n[[Page S8976]]\n\n  This is a moment when we should be talking about solutions. This is a \nserious moment in America. We have hit a very serious financial crisis \nin this country. The fact is--well, this morning, I was speaking to a \ngroup of bankers, a group of business people, and their concern is \nheightened. What they are seeking is for Government to, first of all, \ntry to provide a backdrop of assurance to the American people. One of \nthe gentlemen I was speaking with was saying his office is getting \ndeluged with phone calls from concerned investors who are wondering if \ntheir lifetime of savings is going to be eroded and go away. So what \nshould we do at a moment such as this? Should we heighten the level of \ntension and crisis or should we talk in mature, serious tones about the \nneed to come together as Americans first, Republicans and Democrats \nsecond--as Americans first--to try to find solutions?\n  I have seen a lot of finger-pointing. I have heard a lot of blame \nassessing. Much of it I find as logical as blaming President Bush for \nhurricanes, and sometimes I wonder when that will begin to occur.\n  Obviously, there have been things that have been done that have not \nbeen right. Maybe now we recognize and we can all come together around \nthe idea that we do need a new regulatory framework for our Nation's \nfinancial institutions. We have been going on the same ones that were \nexisting since the Great Depression and days after that. So this has \nnow focused our attention on the need for finding ways in which we can \nfind a way of better regulating financial institutions so we can avoid \nsystemic risk--systemic risk--a risk to the financial system.\n  For those who are playing the partisan game, the big charge seems to \nbe that somehow this administration was against regulation. Well, not \nto take the other side and become partisan, but let me try to set the \nrecord straight a little bit and talk about what happened. I was a part \nof this administration for the first 3 years of it. During that time, I \nand other members of the administration, including the then Secretary \nof the Treasury, Secretary Snow, and others made a mighty effort to try \nto get the Congress's attention to begin the process of regulating \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Now, anyone who looked at that situation--\nand it was part of my responsibility as HUD Secretary to partially \nregulate those entities--knew I did not have the authority to regulate \nthem; that the laws were written in such a way that it made it \nimpossible to have an effective regulator over these two giant and \ngrowing entities, and their growth has been dramatic, or was dramatic, \nfrom the time after I left HUD until the time of their collapse and \nGovernment intervention took place. They continued to grow \ntremendously.\n  It is very clear there were efforts by Republicans to try to regulate \nthese entities and there was equally strong and better constructed \nefforts by Democrats to not regulate them and to allow Fannie and \nFreddie to continue business as usual. Finally, this year, we came \ntogether--and I commend Chairman Dodd and Chairman Frank for leading \nboth committees of the House and Senate so we could come together in a \nbipartisan effort to regulate these two entities. Now, if I had had it \nmy way, that regulator would have been stronger and even more capable \nthan the one we put in place, but thank goodness we did act and we \ncreated a regulatory scheme. It was a little late to save them because \nby then the horse was out of the barn. Had we regulated them back in \n2003, when I testified before the Banking Committee of the Senate, the \nFinancial Services Committee of the House, maybe we could have begun a \nnew regulatory scheme then, and we could have today perhaps been in a \nposition where those entities would not have had the problems that they \nran into. Our efforts were not taken very seriously at the time, and \nthe record is pretty clear about who was in favor of regulation and who \nwas absolutely dead set against it.\n  The fact is it does no good for us to today, in the midst of this \nenormous crisis, to be sitting around finger-pointing and trying to \nscore points. The bottom line is we have a problem ahead of us, and the \nbest thing we can do is to utilize sober judgment to try to come \ntogether, as I said, as Americans--not Republicans, not Democrats but \nMembers of the Congress, Members of the Senate who have taken an oath \nof office--to try to do the right thing by the people whom we \nrepresent. How can we address this problem? What can we do? In fact, it \nmay not be that there is much we can do. This is not a governmental \nproblem at this moment in time. There is a need for us to look and see \nwhat the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is going to be. Do they \nbelong as a half private, half governmental agency? Does it make any \nreal sense for them to be partially beholden to their shareholders and \npartially beholden to the taxpayers? I am not sure it does. So we will \nneed to legislate on that issue in a serious manner as to what the \nfuture of those entities should be.\n  Here is one suggestion I would make today as to how we might begin to \nameliorate the problem and how we might begin to work together, \nbipartisanly, to try to find an answer. I believe, from talking to \npeople in the financial world, that one of the serious needs of today's \nproblem, that would begin to ease all these problems, is for us to \nbegin to look to ending the enormous surplus of unsold homes. The fact \nis people are not buying houses. The fact is there is an oversupply. \nThe fact is supply and demand is out of whack. So perhaps we could, \nthrough tax credits, encourage people to buy homes, to purchase homes, \nproviding them with essentially a tax credit that would encourage them, \nthrough the tax system, to purchase a home at this moment in time. If \nthe inventory were to be drawn down, if we had fewer unsold homes \nsitting in the market, it would make it much easier for the marketplace \nto then begin to find a bottom--a price floor--that could then begin to \nease the burden on all these financial institutions that are holding \npaper that today is not worth what they thought it would be.\n  I wish to shift subjects, but before I do, I would make a call that \nwe try to temper a little bit our desire to score a point today on the \nbacks of the American people who are frightened and who are concerned--\nand rightfully so--about a very difficult problem and try to, rather \nthan finger-point, join hands; rather than finger-point, let's put our \nhands together, Republicans and Democrats, to work together toward a \nsolution, toward some honest-to-goodness effort. That is what the \nAmerican people expect of us. That is why they sent us here, to work \ntogether to solve problems; not to try to assess blame and not to try \nto score political points.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S8976-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8976-S8977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PUBLIC SAFETY\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to talk about another matter \nwhich has to do with the public safety of our people. Public safety is \namong the highest priorities of Government. Americans should feel--and \nhave a right to feel--safe in their homes, their neighborhoods, and \ntheir communities. Although the national violent crime rate has dropped \nsubstantially since 2000, we know any crime is too much crime. As \nelected officials, we ought to do what we can to prevent criminal acts.\n  In recent years, my home State of Florida has, unfortunately, seen a \nrise in violent crime--a very sharp increase. If we look at the numbers \nin recent years, there is a clear trend: The murder rate in Florida \nrose more than 28 percent in 2006 and another 6.5 percent in 2007. \nInstances of armed robbery increased by 13.4 percent in 2006 and nearly \n12 percent in 2007. So while the overall crime rate rose only 1.4 \npercent--and it was the first time in more than a decade--we did see a \nrise in violent crime.\n  Many of the crimes committed in Florida are being committed by those \nwith prior records and those who are already fugitives from justice. A \nU.S. Marshal--a good friend--told me fugitives from justice posed the \nmost risk to society because they have to keep committing crimes in \norder to keep going and crime then becomes their livelihood.\n  So that is why, since the creation of the U.S. Marshals Service, \ntheir priority has been to capture fugitives. They work closely with \nlocal and State law enforcement agencies, they devote the resources \nnecessary to track fugitives across State lines, and they have\n\n[[Page S8977]]\n\nseveral regional task forces set up specifically to go after the worst \nof the worst criminals.\n  Currently, my State of Florida falls under the purview of the \nSoutheast Regional Fugitive Task Force based in Atlanta, GA. Given \nFlorida's size, its population, and the escalation of violent crimes, \nwe need a special focus to more effectively target those responsible \nfor the most serious of crimes.\n  Last year, I requested the resources necessary to establish a \nregional Fugitive Task Force in Florida. We secured $2.8 million, and \nwhile not enough to establish a task force, it did provide the \nresources to increase the Marshals' presence in my State. Over the past \n10 weeks, the Marshals Service put those resources to work in an effort \nthat they call ``Operation Orange Crush.''\n  In Miami, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm \nBeach, and other places, the Marshals Service linked up with other \nState and local law enforcement agencies and targeted the worst of the \nworst fugitive criminals.\n  They went after murderers, rapists, child sex offenders, and gang \nmembers, and they very specifically went after violent offenders. The \nresults were absolutely astonishing. Nearly 2,500 fugitives were \napprehended. More than 2,900 warrants were cleared, 113 homicide \nsuspects were arrested, and 255 sex offenders were also captured. They \nalso took in 76 firearms and about 100 pounds of illicit narcotics.\n  Among those captured in Operation Orange Crush was fugitive David Lee \nGreen, an escapee listed on the Marshals' 15 Most Wanted list, and a \ncriminal who has been on the run since the year 2000, out there \ncommitting more and more crime. Green was found in Titusville after \nescaping from a Federal correctional institution in Elkton, OH, where \nhe was serving a 235-month sentence for cocaine distribution. In \naddition, he was wanted for machinegun possession.\n  Another captured fugitive, Rosalino Yanez, was arrested in Okeechobee \nCounty.\n  Authorities in Fort Pierce wanted him for a 2003 murder, when he \napparently used a shotgun to fire and kill two men. He is also wanted \nin Georgia for attempting to commit murder there.\n  Another arrested was Nolan Woods, who was captured in Miami on a \nwarrant for sexual assault of a minor. So this man was also captured \nand put behind bars.\n  These are some of the more than 2,400 arrests that were made. These \nwere made possible because of the additional resources this Congress \nmade available to the U.S. Marshals Service.\n  Given these statistics and what the Marshals Service was able to do \nin a 10-week period--in just 10 weeks in my State--demonstrates that \nthere needs to be a permanent Regional Fugitive Task Force in Florida. \nRising violent crime rates pose a serious threat to our children, our \nfamilies, and our communities. These results demonstrate that Florida \nhas a need, and the resources used will yield the desired results.\n  Establishing a permanent Regional Fugitive Task Force in Florida will \nrequire Congress's support through the fiscal year 2009 and beyond. But \ngiven the results of Operation Orange Crush and the outstanding \ncommitment of the U.S. Marshals Service, I am very hopeful we can take \nthe results of this task force and make this be a reality in the coming \ndays.\n  So I am very pleased, and I wish to give a word of thanks not only to \nthe Marshals Service but also to all law enforcement in the State of \nFlorida who worked together cooperatively to make this terrific result \nhappen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S8977-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8977-S8983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, we have seen the financial landscape in \nour country reshaped overnight. The titans of Wall Street have been \nrendered insolvent or even bankrupt. These are firms that survived the \nGreat Depression, world wars, the attacks of September 11, but were no \nmatch for a mounting credit crisis that was allowed to escalate in the \nshadows of our financial system.\n  The Federal Government has taken over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nBear Stearns had to be rescued by JPMorgan Chase, after the Federal \nGovernment guaranteed J.P. Morgan's investment. While they are in talks \nto keep part of the company viable, Lehman Brothers has declared the \nlargest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Merrill lynch has been purchased by \nBank of America, and the Federal Government has agreed to rescue AIG.\n  This past Monday, we saw the largest drop in the Dow Jones Industrial \nAverage since 9/11. Now even money market funds are affected; for only \nthe second time in our history, one has been valued at less than 100 \ncents on the dollar. Alan Greenspan called this a ``once in a century \nevent.''\n  In my State of New York, tens of thousands of hard-working employees \nhave lost their jobs. The livelihoods of tens of thousands more who \ndepend on Wall Street's economy are threatened as well.\n  New York City and New York State, already facing serious economic and \nfiscal challenges, will now be forced to contend with a battered Wall \nStreet, the lifeblood of our State's economy. The sudden collapse of \nthese firms and the Government takeover of some has shaken our markets \nand buffeted the economy as a whole. Many are now asking: What is next? \nI know that New Yorkers and other Americans are deeply concerned and \nmore than a little bewildered. As our markets have grown more complex \nand interconnected globally, so, too, have the crises that have \nemerged. We are still sorting out the details.\n  One of the consequences of the secrecy and lack of oversight under \nthe Bush administration is that we do not know what we do not know. But \nit is important to recognize what we do know about what went wrong so \nwe can assess what needs to be done right now to make it right.\n  What we have seen over the course of the last 8 years is an \nadministration that refused to recognize the threats that lurked in our \neconomy--no matter what lurked just beneath the surface or what \nproblems were facing middle-class families.\n  We know that many CEOs are paying lower tax rates than their \nreceptionists. We know that President Bush and those who carry his \nmantle seek to lower those taxes even further. Middle-class families \nhave seen their wages decline, even as the cost of living has \nskyrocketed. This administration has the worst job creation record in \n70 years. Millions of families were locked into ballooning and \nunaffordable adjustable rate loans as this administration stood by \ndenying there was a crisis. Regulations designed to keep pace with the \nmarkets have been steadily chipped away by Washington Republicans even \nas companies experimented to the tune of hundreds of billions of \ndollars in ever-more complex and risky financial instruments. Now, we \nwere reassured that the risk was too diversified and investments too \nsophisticated to put our economy in jeopardy. Meanwhile, behind closed \ndoors, the cracks were showing as the value of mortgage-based \nsecurities slipped day by day. And the President and his supporters in \nCongress repeatedly chanted--and still chant today--the mantra that the \nfundamentals of our economy are strong.\n  The administration waxed philosophic when middle-class families \nstarted facing foreclosures at record levels. The administration and \nits allies derided my proposals over the last 2 years to offer \nassistance to troubled homeowners seeking refinancing as a ``bailout.'' \nThey dismissed my concerns and the concerns of millions of Americans \neven as the storm clouds gathered. They said they didn't believe the \nGovernment should intervene and provide borrowers an affordable \nopportunity to avoid foreclosure.\n  Even when I and others warned the Bush administration repeatedly from \nthe start of this crisis, that decisive action was demanded immediately \nto help families stay in their homes, that that was the best way to \nstave off a deepening economic crisis, their only responses were \npredictions for a ``soft landing'' and that the crisis could be \ncontained.\n  As I traveled throughout our country, I could see that no soft \nlanding was forthcoming. Many families, hundreds and even thousands of \nmiles from Wall Street, were having their lives turned upside down by \nthe home mortgage crisis and the ripple effect being\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\nfelt throughout the economy as a consequence of the broken economic \npolicies of the last 8 years.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration waited until this past summer \nto admit that massive housing relief was necessary. The administration \nfinally supported, in concept, much of what I had proposed--mortgage \nmodifications, freezes for unreasonable mortgage rate increases, and an \nexpanded role for the Federal Housing Administration. But their \nresponse was halfhearted, without adequate resources or a commitment to \nenforcement. So the home mortgage crisis slowly but surely eroded the \nvalue of risky debt instruments upon which Wall Street firms were \ndependent. The house of houses of cards began to fall. My proposals, as \nwell as those of others, were falsely greeted as too much, too soon. \nNow we are forced to reckon with too little, too late.\n  When giant Wall Street firms revealed their dire straits and turned \nto this administration for the exact same help as we had sought for \nmiddle-class families--discounted loans, loan modifications, and \nGovernment-backed lending to weather the storm--Adam Smith was nowhere \nin sight.\n  Taxpayers have loaned these banks upwards of half a trillion dollars. \nAfter years of laissez-faire policies for the middle class, the Bush \nadministration has acted on behalf of Wall Street, with the largest and \nmost significant Federal interventions in the history of our modern \nfinancial system. The largest banks in the world could have closed-door \nmeetings with the White House and Federal Reserve and Treasury \nDepartment to discuss their bailout options, but millions of homeowners \nwith mortgages worth more than their homes or who are facing default \nand foreclosure don't have the same opportunity.\n  This administration seems to be, once again, paralyzed. I represent \nboth the workers and the homeowners and the investment firms. I wish we \nhad taken action long before this, for the sake of all of my \nconstituents. But now we must have a concerted, focused effort. I don't \nbelieve we can wait until the next President. I am extremely hopeful \nand optimistic that we will have a President who will work with us to \nresolve our economic challenges, but I don't think we can wait.\n  However, I do believe we can avoid a deepening crisis. We can take \nsteps right now to address the root causes of what is taking place in \nour economy to stem the tide of foreclosures, mortgage defaults, and \nthe aggregating consequences in the credit markets, on Wall Street, and \nthroughout the global economy. But we must cast aside the haphazard, \nhalfhearted approach of this administration and bring every stakeholder \nto the table to seek out and implement the right solutions.\n  We must be as vigilant on behalf of homeowners and middle-class \nfamilies as we are on behalf of Wall Street firms. We must chart a new \ncourse based on the facts at hand, not the ideology at work for 8 long \nyears. We have tried being reactive. It is now time to be decisive.\n  No option should be off the table--certainly not because they don't \nfit into a narrow ideological prism that this administration has \nabandoned for some at the first sign of trouble. Ideologues in \nWashington or in the market who thought that the only danger to the \nmarketplace was the Federal Government are now going hat-in-hand to \nthat same Government seeking help to stay afloat.\n  So to those who suggest that the steps taken thus far are enough, let \nme be clear: We may need to take even more significant steps to avoid a \nself-sustaining cycle of depressed home prices and foreclosures, with \nthe consequent effect on the entire marketplace. We have already pumped \nhundreds of billions of dollars of liquidity into the markets, but we \nstill cannot see the end of this crisis.\n\n  The biggest problem now is that our entire financial market is \nanchored by the mortgage securities that are untouchable. We have seen \nthe banks and the financial institutions that had the largest exposure \nto these instruments among the first to fail. Now we have begun to see \nsome of the mightiest institutions--even those making a profit--fall by \nthe wayside and the market thrown into upheaval, and others the target \nof predatory short-sellers.\n  The Federal Reserve has used virtually every arrow in its quiver, \nfrom rate cuts, opening its lending windows, and, in desperation, has \neven created some new arrows through its new lending facilities. By \nsome estimates, the Fed has put out more than half a trillion dollars \nthrough discounted loans, bailouts, and takeovers to stabilize the \nmarket and the economy. While necessary to prevent even deeper \ndisaster, we have seen that the benefits of these actions have had \nlimited effect.\n  This situation reminds me of that old fable where people are standing \nby the side of a river and they keep seeing babies being rushed down \nthe river in the current. They desperately reach out and try to save as \nmany babies as possible. Day after day, they are reaching out. They get \nnew tools, they build a bridge, they get a ladder, and they are \nconstantly trying to get to those babies, hoping they can save many of \nthem. Finally, someone walks up and says: Who is throwing them in? Go \nupriver and find out the real problem and stop that.\n  The real problem has always been the way our home mortgage system got \ntotally out of whack, with new kinds of instruments that were sold many \ntimes over, with very little regard to the realities of life, human \nnature, and the inevitable ups and downs in the economy, with the \nresult that until we reach in and fix the home mortgage crisis--and we \ncan bail out everybody from here until kingdom come--we will not get a \nhandle on this economic crisis.\n  Here is what I believe we should do:\n  First, in light of historic bank failures, even with the largest \nFederal intervention in the history of the mortgage market, we need a \ngovernment entity, a modern-day homeowners loan corporation, referred \nto as HOLC, or we need to build on the Resolution Trust Corporation \ncreated to help deal with the savings and loan crisis. I personally \nbelieve and was among the very first to suggest that a HOLC, a \nhomeowners loan corporation, could be a preferable way of unfreezing \nand beginning to fix our struggling mortgage market.\n  Some of my colleagues and many other respected economists and \nGovernment officials have called for the creation of an entity like the \nResolution Trust Corporation which was created after the savings and \nloan crisis to liquidate in an orderly way the virtually worthless \nassets that the failed S held.\n  Yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, Paul Volcker, Eugene Ludwig, \nand Nicholas Brady made such a proposal. They said a HOLC, RTC--we have \nto come up with an entity that will assume these debts and burdens and \nbegin to work our way out.\n  Last spring, when I called for a modern version of the HOLC--that is \nthe Depression-era entity that bought up old mortgages and issued more \naffordable ones in their stead--most people didn't pay much attention. \nBut I think it is important to note that by the time the HOLC closed \nits books, that agency had turned a small profit and helped over a \nmillion people keep their homes. And this was 70 years ago.\n  Our population has grown dramatically. Obviously, if we did it right, \nwe would be able to save a lot of homes, and I think if it is \nadministered correctly, it could be actually a net expenditure or even \nwinner for the Federal Government.\n  With the FHA reforms I long championed and adopted this past summer \nin our omnibus housing bill, the FHA could be a modern home ownership \nlending corporation. But we need to look to new ways to revive and, if \nnecessary, create a new market for mortgage securities based on sound \naccounting, transparent recordkeeping, and responsible lending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator has used 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I did not know I had a time restraint.\n  A new government entity such as the HOLC with focus on attacking the \nsource of the problem can serve a purpose of clearing a lot of those \ntoxic mortgage securities from the market. We know there will not be \nany semblance of a normal or orderly marketplace until we have found a \nway to resolve these mortgage securities that\n\n[[Page S8979]]\n\nare metastasizing in the bottom of our markets.\n  By taking this paper out of the market and quarantining it in this \nnew entity, we will give the market breathing room to recover. We also \nwill be able to set the stage for an orderly sale of these securities \nand in return allow some of them to recover and regain some of their \nvalue. Perhaps as importantly, not only would our financial markets \nstabilize, but so would our housing markets.\n  This is an extraordinary measure, but it is not without precedent. \nThis is the greatest market upheaval since the Great Depression. We \nare, indeed, in crisis, and in times of crisis there are opportunities \nfor leadership. Congress can show the American people that leadership \nby working with the President to embrace this bold proposal to take \nimmediate action to address the abusive and manipulative short-selling \npractices that are rattling the markets, threatening firms and jobs, \nand sending shock waves across the broader economy.\n  I commend the SEC for yesterday tightening rules against manipulative \nshort selling. The SEC's rulings are a positive step in curbing the \nheightened volatility casting uncertainty on domestic markets and \nfinancial institutions. However, the Commission did not go far enough.\n  As a Senator from New York, I have a special duty to represent the \nworkers of the financial services industry and to try with all my might \nto retain New York City as the financial capital of the world. The \nabuses that have disrupted the markets today will impact the lives of \nso many far beyond New York. So I think it is necessary for the SEC to \ntake steps similar to the emergency rule it imposed this past July when \nthe Commission ``concluded that there now exists a substantial threat \nof sudden and excessive fluctuations of securities prices generally and \ndisruption in the functioning of the securities markets that could \nthreaten fair and orderly markets.''\n  Conditions now pose a greater threat than they did in July. Several \nof the institutions that the Commission sought to insulate from abuse \ndo not even exist or certainly not in the same form they did 2 months \nago.\n  The situation is evolving rapidly, so we need to stay a step ahead, \nnot a step behind.\n  I urge the Commission, as I expressed yesterday in a letter to \nChairman Cox, to move toward a temporary moratorium on all the abusive \nand manipulative short-sale practices associated with ``substantial \nfinancial firms,'' such as those the Commission identified in July.\n  A temporary moratorium would allow the marketplace to take a step \nback, take a deep breath, and it would allow the Commission and other \nregulators to identify and weed out the sources of these abusive \ntransactions.\n  Moreover, the Commission should give close consideration to the many \ncalls for the immediate restoration of the uptick rule, whose repeal \nhas been linked to the recent market volatility and proliferation of \nthese short-sale transactions.\n  I know there are technical problems in moving toward digitalized \ntrading, but we ought to figure out how to handle that.\n  Third, I am calling on President Bush to convene an economic summit \nthat brings together leaders in the administration and Congress with \nlenders, consumer advocates, nonprofits, financial institutions, and \nall the stakeholders. Such a summit, I believe, would restore \nconfidence and demonstrate that the entire country is focused on \nsolving the problem we face.\n  Fourth, I want to propose once again that we aggressively pursue and \nencourage mortgage modifications. I have introduced such legislation. I \nbelieve it is important. Madam President, 10 million homeowners are \nunderwater today, carrying more than $2 trillion in mortgage debt. That \nis a huge anchor on our markets and our economy. Modification done \nright is a strategy that serves lenders and borrowers, as well as the \nbroader markets.\n  Fifth, it is clear that for too long, the rapid evolution of the \nsecurities and banking industry overwhelmed our regulatory framework, \nresulting in an entire shadow banking system that operated outside of \noversight and without accountability.\n  It is not enough to shift responsibility or move lines on a flow \nchart. We need a new regulatory framework. We have been living off the \none from the Great Depression. Now is the time to create a new \nframework.\n  Sixth, I proposed the Corporate Executive Compensation Accountability \nand Transparency Act to impose new transparency rules on executive pay \nand the accounting techniques that hide compensation and provide \nshareholders a say in executive compensation packages.\n  Finally, and seventh, I am proposing that we require any financial \ninstitutions borrowing money from the Federal Reserve's new lending \nfacilities to open their books and ensure accountability and \ntransparency to identify unsound practices.\n  These banks and other entities have tapped the Fed's new lending \nwindows for over $300 billion in capital. They shifted a lot of that \nrisk onto the backs of our taxpayers. These are unprecedented \ninterventions, and we should make sure these companies are not using \ntaxpayers' dollars to subsidize golden parachutes or risky investments, \nthrowing your good money after bad. If we are bailing you out, we \ndeserve to know exactly your liabilities, and you have to be part of \nthis new regulatory framework.\n  This crisis has not abated. It is time for us to start acting like \nAmericans again. There isn't anything we can't solve once we put our \nminds to it. For that we need leadership. I know that our leader, \nSenator Reid, has said the Senate will remain in pro forma session. We \nare ready to work with the administration, to work with the other \nstakeholders to change course and end the failed economic policies and \nfailure of regulatory oversight that brought us to this point.\n\n  There is much more we need to do. Individuals have to take \nresponsibility, we know that, but in this dynamic environment, we must \nwork together to stabilize the market, tackle the root causes that have \nfestered too long, and restore confidence in our economy.\n  We will weather this storm, but let's do it sooner instead of later. \nLet's try to save as many boats in the water right now instead of \ncleaning up the wreckage on the banks. I believe we can do that.\n  I thank you, Madam President, for your attention. I hope we will be \nable to start seeing action very soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 20 minutes and the Senator from Vermont follow me, \nand that he be allowed to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am astonished at the diatribe by some of \nour Democratic friends who are charging that our current economic woes \nare ``the Republicans' fault,'' as if somehow our system of housing \nfinance and the complex mortgage-backed investments were created by \nPresident Bush. The American people know better and, frankly, they \ndeserve better.\n  Similarly off base are efforts by some Democrats to rewrite history \nby trying to cast Senator McCain and President Bush in the mold of \nPresident Hoover. It is, of course, a false and complete \nmisunderstanding of history and I believe nothing more than attempted \nmudslinging.\n  There is an excellent history of the Great Depression by Amity Shlaes \ncalled ``The Forgotten Man.'' In it she reminds us that Herbert Hoover \nwas an interventionist, a protectionist, and a strong critic of \nmarkets. If anything, Herbert Hoover and then Franklin Roosevelt \nprolonged the Great Depression by their intervention in the free market \nwith their support for more taxes and tariffs, all of which, of course, \ncaused a spiral of deflation.\n  No one can argue that my colleague Senator McCain is an \ninterventionist or protectionist such as Herbert Hoover. He is a strong \ncritic of the greed and the cronyism that are two things that have led \nto our current financial problems.\n  What are the facts about the current situation? Where did it all \nbegin?\n  I think almost everyone agrees that this financial crisis was \nprecipitated by the housing crisis, the bursting of the bubble of \noverinvestment and speculation in home mortgages. Housing\n\n[[Page S8980]]\n\nprices skyrocketed to unsustainable levels as mortgages were given to \npeople who simply could not afford them, and speculators ran up prices \neven more. All of the experts I talked with agree that until housing \nprices level out naturally--in other words, not artificially through \nsome kind of Government interference--our financial crisis will not \nreach a conclusion. That is what is necessary to begin the rebound so \nthat we can recover from the current crisis.\n  While it is true that both parties took pride in supporting more home \nownership, a goal to which all Americans would certainly aspire, \nDemocrats cannot deny that they promoted expanding loans to more and \nmore people who had previously found it very hard to get a mortgage \nbecause they could not make a sufficient downpayment or failed to meet \nother normal loan criteria; in other words, people who were higher \ncredit risks. So it isn't just lenders but also politicians who enticed \nand encouraged folks to buy homes they could not afford. And this, of \ncourse, fueled speculation as well.\n  It is also true that members of both political parties were strong \ndefenders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the so-called government-\nsponsored enterprises, or GSEs. But I can't think of a single Democrat \nwho fought for comprehensive, meaningful reforms of these entities over \nthe last decade.\n  Fannie and Freddie made huge campaign contributions, and those \ncampaign contributions secured many friends who were willing to stymie \neven the most modest proposals for regulation, proposals put forth by \nRepublicans both in Congress and in the administration.\n  I cite, for example, a New York Times article of September 11, 2003. \nI will quote two brief paragraphs:\n\n       The Bush administration today recommended the most \n     significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance \n     industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The plan is an acknowledgment by the administration that \n     oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--which together have \n     issued more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding debt--is \n     broken. A report by outside investigators in July concluded \n     that Freddie Mac manipulated its accounting to mislead \n     investors, and critics have said Fannie Mae does not \n     adequately hedge against rising interest rates.\n\n  The article concludes with a criticism, two paragraphs more:\n\n       Significant details must still be worked out before \n     Congress can approve a bill. Among the groups denouncing the \n     proposal today were the National Association of Homebuilders \n     and Congressional Democrats who fear that tighter regulation \n     of the companies could sharply reduce their commitment to \n     financing low-income and affordable housing.\n       ``These two entities--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--are not \n     facing any kind of financial crisis,'' said Representative \n     Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the \n     Financial Services Committee.\n\n  Again, ``These two entities--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--are not \nfacing any kind of financial crisis.''\n  Quoting again:\n\n       The more people exaggerate these problems, the more \n     pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in \n     terms of affordable housing.\n\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle claim the current \nfinancial crisis stems from a lack of regulatory oversight, but they \ndon't mean a lack of oversight over Fannie and Freddie, which they \nresisted. They don't mean regulations that actually would have headed \noff the crisis of these GSEs.\n  I think most of my colleagues would acknowledge that I am one of the \nmost free market Members of the Senate. I am not one to usually call \nfor more regulations. But in the case of Fannie and Freddie, I did. As \nchairman of the Republican policy committee in 2003 and 2004, I \nprovided two detailed analyses of the potential for catastrophic \nfailure of the GSEs unless they were precluded from taking on more and \nmore questionable debt. I noted that while their executives and \nshareholders were making a lot of money in the short run, the taxpayers \nwould be on the hook in the long run. And that is exactly what \noccurred.\n\n  The first paper the Republican policy committee released under my \nwatch suggested that the implicit Government guarantee of both Fannie \nand Freddie allowed the companies to borrow significantly more than \nthey would have without the guarantee, and that they used those \nresources to invest and trade in risky mortgage securities, not to pass \non the benefit to borrowers.\n  In September 2003, 5 years ago, I recommended that Congress ``improve \ndisclosure requirements and transparency, increase risk-based \nregulatory oversight; and begin to consider how to create a greater \nseparation between the taxpayers and the business operation of these \nfirms without causing financial dislocation or upsetting the mortgage \nmarkets.''\n  I also warned that without reforms, either or both companies could \nfail. And I said:\n\n       The potential cost to U.S. taxpayers could range into the \n     hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n  I am sorry to report that I was correct. The bailout will cost at \nleast $200 billion. That is the amount that has been cumulatively \ncommitted to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  The second paper I released in April of 2004 reported that then-\nChairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, had endorsed \nfundamental reforms for Fannie and Freddie. Greenspan threw cold water \non the most often repeated rationale for allowing Fannie and Freddie to \ncontinue growing, indeed, for their very existence: that they increase \nhome ownership and reduce mortgage rates. My report, quoting once again \n``challenged the Senate to act quickly to reduce the risks to the \ntaxpayer, either by fundamentally altering their relationship with the \ngovernment, or by establishing a new regulatory regime.''\n  But the Senate failed to act in 2004, when it could have headed off \nthis crisis.\n  I also want to highlight the efforts made by Senator Shelby, the \nranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, to reform Fannie \nand Freddie. In 2004 and 2005, Senator Shelby tried to enact \ncomprehensive GSE reforms of the kind I have referred to only to be \nstonewalled by then-Senator Sarbanes. First, in 2004, Senator Sarbanes \nrefused to consider the legislation. He said the problem was the \nreceivership provisions. At the time, Fannie and Freddie could only be \ntaken into conservatorship if they failed but not receivership. Fannie \nand Freddie used their objections to this provision to label my \ncolleague, Senator Shelby, as anti-home-ownership.\n  When Shelby tried again, Senator Sarbanes told him the reforms \ncouldn't move forward because he objected to the portfolio limits that \nShelby's legislation would have imposed on Fannie and Freddie. Same \nkind of thing I had called for earlier in the report to which I \nreferred. Remember, their portfolios were highly leveraged. Again, \nShelby and those who supported him were castigated as anti-home-\nownership. Each time he pressed for these reforms, the supporters of \nSenator Sarbanes and Freddie and Fannie came up with reasons to oppose \nthem.\n  When Congress passed the Fannie and Freddie bailout legislation this \nlast summer, we were finally able to secure fundamental reforms, thanks \nagain to Senator Shelby and to Secretary Paulson, but no thanks to most \nof the Democrats who worked against the reforms. Unfortunately, by then \nthe damage was already done. The legislation came too late to avoid \ntheir collapse. Instead, we had to end up managing their collapse, and \ntheir collapse had spread throughout the entire financial system to the \npoint that we now have a whole series of companies that we are having \nto try to find a way to assist in order to prevent further collapse of \nour financial system.\n  Even at this late date, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee \nand the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee would only \nagree to the GSE reforms proposed by Secretary Paulson after \nRepublicans gave in to their demands for billions of dollars to go to \ngroups such as ACORN, the far-left advocacy group that has engaged in \nvoter fraud.\n  In a last-ditch attempt to save Fannie and Freddie from greater \nscrutiny, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee even \ntried to delay the appointment of the new, more powerful regulator set \nup in the legislation until next year. Fortunately, on this, Senator \nShelby prevailed. When the two entities were taken into conservatorship \nthis month, the new regulator shut down all political activities of \nFannie and Freddie\n\n[[Page S8981]]\n\nand fired their executives and barred them from getting lavish \ncompensation packages.\n  That is the kind of thing that should have been done a long time ago, \nand it is exactly the kind of thing Senator McCain is talking about \ntrying to reform if he is elected President.\n  One final point about the political entanglement of Fannie and \nFreddie in Washington. When Senator Obama began searching for his Vice \nPresidential running mate, he tapped former Fannie Mae CEO Jim Johnson \nto help conduct the search. This wasn't surprising. Johnson had the \nsame role in Senator Kerry's 2004 campaign. But Senator Obama had to \nend his relationship with Jim Johnson after it came to light that \nJohnson had received at least three sweetheart loans from Countrywide. \nRemember, Countrywide was accused of pushing many people into home \nmortgages they could not afford. It ultimately failed, and it had to be \nacquired by a bank. I should also note that Johnson is credited by many \nas having built Fannie Mae into the financial giant it became. He built \nthe failed business model that will cost taxpayers hundreds of billions \nof dollars. When he was CEO, he aggressively hired an army of lobbyists \nto protect Fannie Mae from any meaningful oversight.\n  Well, Fannie and Freddie guarantee about $5 trillion now of the \napproximately $12 trillion in total outstanding home loans in the \nUnited States. That amounts to $5 trillion in mortgage-backed \nsecurities guaranteed by the pair. Fannie and Freddie sold these to \ncountless different companies not just in the United States but around \nthe world. They were sold as sound investments. But with real estate \nprices dropping, nobody knows how to value these investments, and that \nis part of the problem of this continuing crisis. Countless major \ninvestors here and abroad are now at risk. Witness the problems with \nBear Stearns, Lehman, Merrill Lynch, AIG, to name only the most \nprominent.\n  So the problems that several Republicans predicted and tried to \nprevent have now come to pass. The Treasury has placed Fannie and \nFreddie in conservatorship, risking up to $1 billion of taxpayer money \nfor each of them. Add to that the $30 billion the United States had to \nguarantee in the Bear Stearns debt to get J.P. Morgan to acquire the \nbank, plus $85 billion to nationalize AIG, and you begin to see the \ndegree of commitment the American taxpayers are now obligated to--all \nof this because several prominent Democrats, and sometimes even \nRepublicans, refused to appropriately and seriously address the \nproblems and dangers posed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  That is how this all got started. And unless there is a willingness \nto prevent the GSEs from doing it all over again, with taxpayers \nguaranteeing against losses, we will not have learned the lesson we \nshould learn from this catastrophic event. I am anxious to see if my \nDemocratic colleagues will agree or whether, as before, they will try \nto perpetuate the same corrupt system that got us where we are today. I \nhope, Madam President, this will be an opportunity for us to begin \nworking together, to stop pointing political fingers of blame at each \nother, to learn the lessons of the past, and to ensure that never again \nwill we allow this kind of situation to develop at the cost of our \nconstituents--the taxpayers of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I would like to focus on three aspects \nof the current economic and financial crisis that is wreaking havoc on \ntens of millions of working families throughout our country and, in \nfact, people throughout the world. I think the questions we have to \ndeal with are, No. 1, how did this crisis develop; No. 2, what can we \ndo in the short term to address it and to protect middle-class \nfamilies--people who are scared to death all over our country about \nlosing their 401(k)s, people who are worried about losing their jobs, \npeople who can't afford health insurance today--and, No. 3, what can we \ndo long term to learn from the mistakes of today so that we create an \neconomy where this crisis never erupts again.\n  I think those are the areas we might want to be focusing on right \nnow.\n  Madam President, we are here today in the midst of the most serious \nfinancial and economic crisis that our country has faced since the \nGreat Depression of the 1930s primarily--primarily--because of one \nreason; and that is, over the last many years, especially in the last 8 \nyears of President George W. Bush, government policy, government \nideology has been dominated by an extreme rightwing position that tells \nus--and we have heard it over and over and over again on the floor of \nthe Senate--that government is bad, government is evil, government has \nto get out of the way so we can allow large multinational corporations \nand the wealthiest people in this country to do all of the wonderful \nthings they will do to create prosperity for all Americans.\n  Now, among specific policies, what President Bush and others of that \nview have said is it is important for us to give huge tax breaks--\ntrillions of dollars in tax breaks--to the wealthiest people and \nlargest corporations in our country so they will then invest in \nAmerica, create good-paying jobs, and their wealth will trickle on \ndown. That is the trickle-on-down theory of economics.\n  In fact, my friend, Senator Kyl, who just spoke a moment ago, is the \nlead advocate, along with Senator McCain and many other Republicans, of \nthe repeal of the estate tax that would provides $1 trillion in tax \nbreaks over a 20-year period to the wealthiest three-tenths of 1 \npercent. Three-tenths of 1 percent receive $1 trillion in tax breaks. \nThat is part of that ideology.\n  Further, what they have said is, we need to not worry about \nmanufacturing in America because what we should establish is a policy \nof unfettered free trade. We don't need tariffs. What we need is to \nallow corporate America the freedom to throw American workers out on \nthe street--people who are making 15, 20, 25 bucks an hour, health \ncare, pensions--because somehow we are going to create wealth in \nAmerica and good-paying jobs in America as we shut down plants, we move \nto China, and corporations there pay workers 20, 30 cents an hour, and \nwe bring the products back into this country. Anyone who goes shopping \nin a mall knows how difficult it is today to find a product made in \nAmerica, but that is a plus.\n  I have to say, in that regard, the champion--and he is honest on this \none. Senator McCain has been criticized recently for not being the most \nhonest candidate we have seen in terms of his answers and so forth, but \nhe has been honest on this one. He has been the lead advocate of \nunfettered free trade. This is an important part of this rightwing \nideology: that it is good for America that corporations can go to China \nand bring products back into this country. But the third pillar of this \nrightwing ideology that I want to discuss this afternoon, and perhaps \nthe most pertinent to the crisis we are now facing, is over and over \nagain what we have heard from President Bush, what we have heard from \nSenator McCain, what we have heard from many of our Republican friends \nis, deregulate, deregulate, deregulate; that the government has to get \nout of the way so that ExxonMobil and the other large multinational \ncorporations can do all of the wonderful things they will do to create \nwealth in America.\n  I will just give one example. It is not a major example but a \nhumorous example. All over this country, Madam President, parents who \nhave little kids who play with toys have been worrying about the toys \nand the quality of the toys coming into this country. It was recently \nlearned that at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, because of that \nideology of deregulation, there was one guy, one person whose job it \nwas to test all of the toys, thousands of different types of toys \ncoming in from China and every other country in the world--many of them \nunhealthy, many of them having toxic ingredients in them. Because of \nderegulation, because we have great faith in these companies bringing \ntoys in from China, we didn't even have to have a strong regulatory \nsystem. I am happy we have moved in that direction in the last few \nmonths, but that was the case.\n\n  The deregulation mantra goes obviously a lot deeper than toys. Let me \nfocus for a moment on this issue of deregulation because it is at the \nheart of the current financial crisis we are facing. I want to say a \nword about the\n\n[[Page S8982]]\n\nformer Senator who, it turned out, was the chief economic adviser to \nSenator McCain and who actually was the leader on deregulation.\n  I know in politics things change from yesterday to today. I have not \nheard Senator McCain's last pronouncement. I guess he wants to regulate \neverything today. But yesterday and in the rest of his career he was a \nchampion of deregulation and his major economic adviser was a gentleman \nnamed Senator Phil Gramm, formally the Senator from Texas.\n  To review a little bit of what Senator Gramm's role was in pushing us \ntoward this deregulatory society, as chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee in 1999, Senator Gramm spearheaded legislation that bears his \nname. It is not a great secret, it is his legislation, the so-called \n*Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill, and that broke down critical regulatory \nsafeguards the Government had put in place after the Great Depression \nto prevent--what? To prevent exactly what we are seeing today. Senator \nGramm spearheaded that effort and broke down those firewalls.\n  Having laid the groundwork for our crisis in the financial sector, \nthe very next year Senator Phil Gramm is credited--and I do not think \nthere is a lot of debate about this--with slipping into a large \nunrelated bill legislation that deregulated the electronic energy \nmarkets, including, of course, oil. There are leading energy \neconomists--who have testified over and over again just this week, \namong other committee hearings before Congress--who are telling us that \nas a result of the deregulation of the energy futures market, 50 \npercent of the cost of oil, when it was at its peak of $147 a barrel--\n50 percent of that was due to speculation and that speculation was \nallowed to take place because of the deregulation of the energy futures \nmarket spearheaded by Senator Gramm.\n  We are seeing what deregulation did to the financial institutions, \nwhat it has done to energy prices, but that is not enough. Senator \nGramm was a very aggressive and a very effective, if I might say so, \nSenator. As we all know, the Federal Government is in the process of \nnationalizing AIG and bailing them out to the tune of $85 billion. AIG, \nas we all know, is the world's largest insurance company.\n  It also turns out that the AIG situation is closely tied to the same \nextremist ideology that has been pushing us toward economic disaster. A \nkey part of the responsibility for AIG's collapse lies once again with \nthis same key Member of the Senate, Senator Phil Gramm, and his \nrightwing ideology. It turns out that Senator Gramm slipped a 262-page \namendment--I always find it amusing how you can ``slip'' a 262-page \namendment--into a larger bill that was instrumental in creating, and I \nknow this number is a little bit difficult for anybody in the world to \ndigest, a $62 trillion market for very risky, unregulated financial \ninvestments called credit default swaps, that are central to AIG's \nmeltdown.\n  This is extremely complicated. Very few people understand anything \nabout it. But we are talking about an unregulated $62 trillion market \nfor credit default swaps, which played a major role in the collapse of \nAIG and the fact that the Federal Government is now in the process of \nbailing that company out.\n  As an online article from Time Magazine explains, AIG's traditional \ninsurance business was doing well. In other words, when they were in \nthe business that they had historically been in, actually they did \nquite well. But what AIG got involved in was more than traditional \ninsurance. They got involved in risky derivative schemes called credit \ndefault swaps, or CDSs, that allowed big companies to guarantee each \nother's risky lending practices. The point here in this whole \ncomplicated scheme of things is that all of this is deregulated \nprimarily because of the efforts of Senator Gramm. The big, bad Federal \nGovernment no longer can protect consumers, can protect our economy \nbecause we are going to trust all of these guys who are playing in a \n$60-plus trillion business.\n  In order to give the American people a full understanding of the \nrisks posed by these unregulated credit default swaps, I wish to quote \nbriefly from a September 15 article by Professor Peter Cohen, a \ngraduate of the Wharton School, that details the full scope of the \nproblem we face and the role Senator Gramm had in its creation. Let me \nquote from Professor Cohen.\n\n       Lurking in the background of this collapse of two of Wall \n     Street's biggest names, is a $62 billion segment of the $450 \n     trillion market for derivatives that grew huge thanks to John \n     McCain's chief economic advisor, Phil . . . Gramm. That's \n     because in December 2000, Gramm, while a U.S. Senator, snuck \n     in a 262-page amendment to a government reauthorization bill \n     that created what is now the $62 trillion market for credit \n     default swaps. I realize it is painful to read about yet \n     another Wall Street acronym, but this is important because it \n     will help us understand why the global financial markets are \n     collapsing. . . . CDSs are like insurance policies for \n     bondholders. In exchange for a premium, the bondholders get \n     insurance in case the bondholder can't pay. . . . In the case \n     of the $1.4 trillion worth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \n     bonds, the Government's nationalization last Sunday triggered \n     the CDSs on those bonds. The people who received the CDS \n     premiums are now obligated to deliver those bonds to the ones \n     who paid the premiums.\n\n  Professor Cohen continues:\n\n       Gramm's 262-page amendment, dubbed the ``Commodity Futures \n     Modernization Act,'' according to the Texas Observer, freed \n     financial institutions from oversight of their CDS \n     transactions. Prior to its passage, they say, banks \n     underwrote mortgages and were responsible for the risks \n     involved. Now through the use of CDSs--which in theory insure \n     the banks against bad debts--those risks are passed along to \n     insurance companies and others . . .\n\n  wrote the Texas Observer. I will not go on.\n  The bottom line is Gramm, who is McCain's leading financial adviser, \nspearheaded the effort to deregulate financial services that opened up \nthis huge unregulated market. The result of that has played a \nsignificant role in placing us where we are right now.\n  We can go on and on. This is complicated stuff and I am sure there \nare people who can talk about this for many hours. In my view, the time \nfor hand wringing is over. What we have to understand is the efforts of \nPresident Bush to ``deregulate, deregulate,'' and those of Senator \nGramm, Senator McCain and many others, was wrong. It largely \ncontributed to where we are today.\n  It seems to me that Congress right now needs to put an end to this \nradical deregulation. We need to put the safety walls back up in the \nfinancial services market.\n  I was a member of the Banking Committee in the House in 1999 when \nthis whole issue was discussed. Many of us then--a minority, but some \nof us then--saw exactly what was in line to occur. Some of us at least \nvoted against it.\n  What we have to do now is understand that we need to reregulate the \nelectronics energy markets, we need to end the unregulated credit \ndefault swaps. Unfortunately, the response we have been hearing from \nthe administration and from Wall Street is not to do that but in fact \nto move us in another direction, which is to push for further \nconsolidation in the financial services sector.\n  I have a very simple question. Do I hope I am wrong on this one, but \nI fear I may not be. That question is: What happens when these now even \nbigger entities, these multi-multi-multibillion dollar corporations--\nwhat happens when they run into trouble in the future? None of us hope \nthat happens, but what happens if that does occur? Once again, clearly, \nit will be the American people who will be on the hook.\n\n  This country can no longer afford companies that are too big to fail. \nIf a company is so large that its failure would cause systemic harm to \nour economy, if it is too big to fail, then it is too big to exist. \nWhat we need to do right now is to assess which companies fall into \nthis category.\n  For a start, I don't think you need to be a Ph.D. in economics to \nunderstand this. I think Bank of America, if I may be allowed to say \nso, is certainly one of those companies. Let's take a look at Bank of \nAmerica. It is the largest depository institution in our country. It \nhas assets of $1.7 trillion; $711 billion of that money comes from bank \ndeposits representing over 10 percent of all bank deposits in the \nentire country--one bank, 10 percent of all bank deposits.\n  In August, the Bank of America bought Countrywide, the largest \nmortgage lender in the country. And then last week it bought Merrill \nLynch, the largest brokerage firm in America. There is so much \nconcentration of wealth in the Bank of America that clearly, if it were \nto fall in the future,\n\n[[Page S8983]]\n\nwhat do you think the U.S. Government is going to say? You can \nabsolutely expect that the President or the Congress will say: My God, \nwe can't allow Bank of America to fall. Because if they fall, it will \nimpact the entire national economy, the entire world economy. The \ntaxpayers of this country are going to have to bail out Bank of \nAmerica.\n  My suggestion is before we allow ourselves to be in that position, \nmaybe we make certain the Bank of America never is allowed to have that \nkind of power.\n  In my view, we should not be making Bank of America bigger; we should \nbe breaking it up. We should start that process today and we should be \nbreaking up other large financial institutions that are ``too big to \nfail.''\n  Finally, in terms of dealing with this unfolding disaster, we need to \nmake certain that working Americans, the middle class of this country, \nare not asked to foot the bill for the current economic crisis that was \nbrought to us by these large multinationals. If the economic calamity \nrequires a Federal bailout, it should be paid for by those people who \nactually benefited from the reckless behavior of people empowered by \nthe extreme economic views of Senator Gramm, President Bush, and \nSenator McCain.\n  Right now, today, the wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent earns more \nincome than the bottom 50 percent. That gap between the very rich and \neverybody else is growing wider. We have the dubious distinction of \nhaving by far the most unequal distribution of income in the world, and \non top of that the richest 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom \n90 percent.\n  The wealthiest 400 Americans--this is a startling figure that for \nobvious reasons people don't talk about too much, but this is amazing. \nThe wealthiest 400 Americans in this country have not only seen their \nincomes double, but their net worth has increased by $670 billion since \nPresident Bush has been in office. Four hundred families have seen \ntheir net worth double and increase by $670 billion since President \nBush has been in office.\n  Amazingly, the wealthiest 400 families in our country are now worth \nover $1.5 trillion--400 families. On average they earn over $214 \nmillion a year. As a result of President Bush's policies and the \npolicies of our Republican colleague, the tax rate for these families \nhas been cut almost in half, to 18 percent.\n  Amazingly--and this is a clearly a national disgrace--the wealthiest \n400 families pay a much lower tax rate than most police officers do, \nthan nurses do, than teachers do, than firefighters do.\n  Now, what does this say about us as a nation or about our politics, \nor the power of the wealthy over Government, when the middle class is \npaying a greater percentage of their income, a middle class which is in \ndecline, a middle class where millions of workers have seen a reduction \nin their wages, and yet they are paying a higher percentage of their \nincome in taxes than the very richest people in America?\n  It is this very small segment of our population which has made out \nlike bandits, frankly, during the Bush administration. In my view, we \nneed an emergency tax on those at the very top to pay for any losses \nthe Federal Government suffers as a result of efforts to shore up the \neconomy.\n  In other words, before we ask the middle class to pay more in taxes, \nbefore we ask working families to pay more in taxes, it is obvious to \nme that it is simply fair and right to go to those groups, that group \nof people who have benefited most out of Bush's policies, who have seen \ntheir incomes and their wealth soar. Let's ask them to help us bail out \nthe economy rather than the working families who had nothing, nothing \nto do with this crisis, and, in fact, who have suffered under the 8 \nyears of President Bush.\n  Before I finish, I wish to step back for a moment and examine this \ncurrent crisis in the context of who our Government represents. What \ndoes it say about an administration that is prepared to put $85 billion \nat risk to bail out AIG but which has fought tooth and nail against \nprograms that benefit working families all over this country? In my \nState of Vermont, people are worried about going cold this winter. And \nyet President Bush wanted to make hundreds of millions of dollars in \ncutbacks for the LIHEAP program that keeps people warm because we did \nnot have enough money to do it.\n  We have enough money to provide hundreds of billions of tax breaks \nfor the top 1 percent, we have enough money to spend $10 billion every \nmonth in Iraq, we have enough money to bail out AIG and Bear Stearns, \nbut somehow we do not have enough money to keep people warm, to make \nsure that young people can go to college, to make sure that working \npeople have affordable housing?\n  Since George W. Bush has been in office, nearly 6 million Americans \nhave slipped out of the middle class and into poverty; over 7 million \nAmericans have lost their health insurance; more than 4 million \nAmericans have lost their pensions; over 3 million good-paying \nmanufacturing jobs have been lost; total consumer debt has more than \ndoubled; the median income for working-age Americans has gone down by \nover $2,000, after adjusting for inflation.\n  The interesting question to ask is, in the midst of that crisis \nfacing tens of millions of working families, where has President Bush \nbeen? Where has his voice been in saying we have got to bail out \nworking families who are seeing the decline in their standard of living \nand are falling into poverty? We have got to protect old people who are \ngoing to go cold this winter. We have to make sure that everyone in our \ncountry is able to get a decent education and can afford college. We \nhave got to make sure that all Americans have health insurance. I have \nnot heard the President say we need to bail out the middle class or \nworking families, but he surely has been there to bail out large \nmultinational corporations.\n  The American people deserve better. We need to reject the failed \neconomic policies and priorities of President Bush and John McCain. We \nneed a government that is not going to allow the wealthiest people and \nthe largest corporations to loot our economy. We need a government that \nwill put regulatory firewalls back in the financial sector and end the \nuse of unregulated credit swaps. We need a government that is going to \nprevent speculators from stealing from them at the gas pump. We need a \ngovernment that breaks up corporations that are too big to fail. We \nneed a government that is going to view the problems of ordinary \nAmericans as almost as important as they view the needs of large \nmultinational corporations.\n  In other words, we need a government that represents the people of \nthis country rather than just the wealthy and large multinationals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S8983-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8983-S8985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THOMAS VANDER WOUDE\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, we also, I think, need a government \nthat will stand up for the weakest and most vulnerable amongst us as \nwell.\n  I have got a real story of human heroism that I wanted to share with \nthe body, and then I am hopeful we can agree to a piece of legislation \nthat Senator Kennedy and I have done that has been rolled into this \nbigger package that has drawn a lot of difficulty.\n  But this is a piece Senator Kennedy and I have worked on for a couple \nof years now. There is no reason for this to be blocked. So I am \nhopeful we can then move to it and pass it through this body, move it \non forward.\n  I have got a picture of a gentleman. I want to show you a wonderful \nman. This is Thomas Vander Woude. This is an incredible story here in \nthe suburbs around Washington, DC. On September 8, Thomas Vander Woude \nreturned from mass that he had gone to in Gainesville, VA. He attended \nmass regularly and was working in his yard with his youngest son, who \nis 20 years old, Joseph. He is known by the family as Josie. Josie is a \nDowns syndrome adult. He fell through a 2 foot by 2 foot piece of metal \nthat covered an opening to a septic tank, Josie did. His dad Thomas \nimmediately rushed to his aid. According to an account in the \nWashington Post, when he saw that Joseph could not keep his head above \nthe muck, Vander Woude, who was 66, jumped in the tank, ``submerged \nhimself in sewage so he could push his son up from below and keep his \nhead above the muck.''\n\n[[Page S8984]]\n\n  Tom Vander Woude saved his son, but he drowned in the process. As it \nis stated so eloquently: There is no greater love than to lay down your \nlife for another. And Tom Vander Woude laid down his life for his 20-\nyear-old Downs syndrome son. This is a beautiful story that has taken \nplace of the dedication of a father for his son, an act of heroism, but \nin his quiet life of dedication to his son, to his wife Mary Ellen of \n43 years, to his six sons, 24 grandchildren, and to his country.\n  Tom served his Nation as a pilot in Vietnam, and after the war worked \nas a commercial airline pilot. Around the community of Gainesville, \nthough, he was known as a generous neighbor, a volunteer at church, a \nbasketball and soccer coach for the high school in Manassas that five \nof his sons attended.\n  He was also a farmer, something dear to my heart, I know to the \nChair, the Presiding Officer as well. Most of all, he was known as \nJosie's devoted dad. Wherever you found Tom--at a game, at church, \nhelping a neighbor--there was Josie, lending a hand.\n  Tom Vander Woude knew the value of his son's life. He considered it \nso precious that he gave his own to save it. He never considered the \nspecial care and attention that Joseph required because of his Downs \nsyndrome, he never considered that a burden to the family. On the \ncontrary, ``he always considered Joseph a wonderful blessing to the \nfamily,'' a special gift from God who brings out the best in his family \nand the lives of all of those he touches.\n  This is true of so many families who have children with difficulties. \nThey find that through all of the difficulty and trial of caring for \nand providing for their child who has a mental disability, these \nspecial individuals are ambassadors of love and of understanding, \nfilled with an openness and unconditional affection that acts as \na humanizing force of compassion in their families and in their \ncommunities.\n\n  But we have to be open to this kind of gift and to the potential of \nevery human life to make our world a better place. Now that I reflect \non Tom Vander Woude and the value he placed on the life of his son, I \nalso thought of Sarah Palin and what she said about her son, Trig, born \nin April. When the Governor and her husband Todd were told last year \nthat the child she was expecting in May would be born with Downs \nsyndrome, they knew that ending that pregnancy was never an option for \nthem. After all, why would it be? ``We understand,'' she was quoted as \nsaying at the time, ``that every innocent life has wonderful \npotential.''\n  The problem is that between 80 and 90 percent of the children \ndiagnosed with Downs syndrome in the United States will not make it to \nthe world, simply because they have a positive genetic test in prenatal \nscreening, tests which can be wrong, by the way. I have had a number of \npeople come up to me and say they had a positive Downs syndrome \ndesignation and the child was born and the child did not have Downs \nsyndrome.\n  America is poorer because of this. To deny children with disabilities \na chance at life will make us more insensitive, callous, and jaded, and \nwill take away from the diversity of American life. I do not think this \nis what we were meant to do.\n  So Senator Kennedy and I, for about 2 years now, have been working on \na bill. What we are trying to do with this bill is to see that more \nDowns syndrome children make it here and get here. It is a pretty \nsimple bill that establishes a registry of people who are willing to \nadopt Downs syndrome children. So that if someone gets that diagnosis \nand they say, I cannot handle it, fine. The answer is not to kill the \nchild, the answer is to put the child up for adoption. We have got \npeople willing to adopt it, and also to put forward information to \npeople about the current condition of a Downs syndrome child and what \nall is available, because a lot is available for this child.\n  So we worked a long time, got the spending lined up--we are in good \nshape on that--and we are ready to move forward with this so we can get \nmore of these special kids here.\n  What I was hoping we can do, and we had it almost passed through, and \nthen this got caught up in the clutter of things, was that we could get \nthis bill hot-lined--Senator Kennedy's sister is a big proponent of \nthis, has done great work with the Special Olympics--that we could do \nthis. It got caught up in this overall package. Nobody objects to this \nbill. What I would like to see us do is let us take the pieces of this \noverall omnibus that we can agree to and let's do them. So then we have \ngot some progress that is being shown.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 1810\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 701, S. 1810, the Prenatally and \nPostnatally Diagnosed Conditions Awareness Act. The lead sponsors are \nSenator Kennedy and myself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be agreed to, \nthe committee-reported amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the bill as \namended be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table with no interviewing action or debate, and that we \ncan get more of these special children here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. On behalf of the leadership, I object. This bill, as I \nunderstand it, is part of a number of bills that are noncontroversial \nand are going to be included together.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3297\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of Calendar No. 784, S. 3297; the bill be \nread a third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I object.\n  Madam President, I would say, let's take pieces of that overall big \nbill that we can agree to.\n\n\n             Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 1810 and Others\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that we agree to consider S. 1810 which I \ncited, and then the PROTECT Our Children Act, and the Effective Child \nPornography Prosecution Act--they have all been considered and cleared \non both sides--and we move to the immediate consideration of those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SANDERS. On behalf of the leadership, I object. I understand that \nis contained within a group of other noncontroversial bills.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I hope we could move forward with \nthis. It would show that we can get something done in the body. There \nis no objection. We have worked on this for multiple years. We have got \nthe funding worked out. This is a time in the country where people have \nheightened awareness of the genetic discrimination that takes place in \nutero. We have passed bills here that said you cannot discriminate \nagainst an individual for their genetic type once they are born, but in \nutero they are killed. That surely is not something that people want or \ndefend or think is right.\n  This is not even a limitation on that. It is saying that all we are \ngoing to do here is establish a registry and provide current \ninformation if you get a Downs syndrome designation. I hope in the \ninterest of this wonderful gentleman Tom Vander Woude we could see this \nconsidered. I am sad that we are not doing that in this particular \nsituation.\n  The day after Trig was born to the Palins, they released the \nfollowing statement. I thought it was so beautiful, I will read it \nhere:\n\n       Trig is beautiful and already adored by us. We know through \n     early testing he would face special challenges. We feel \n     privileged that God would entrust us with this gift and allow \n     us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives. We have faith \n     that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential \n     to make this world a better place. We are truly blessed.\n\n  All we are asking is that more people would really have that \nopportunity to do that or, if they don't feel they can handle it, to \nput that child up for adoption on a registry that we establish. It \nwould be an important thing for us to be able to move forward with. I \nam sorry we cannot get that piece done here today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8985]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the Senate knows, yesterday we voted to \npass the Defense authorization bill. However, one of the casualties of \nyesterday's process--which was unique, to my knowledge; we actually had \nonly two rollcall votes on amendments to the Defense authorization \nbill, which I don't think has ever happened before, and many important \namendments were blocked by the process, amendments that might have been \nincluded in the managers' package. I wish to mention just one of those, \nwhich is the Military Voting Protection Act.\n  This was originally offered as a freestanding bill earlier, but then \nit changed to become an amendment to the Defense authorization bill \nbecause we thought it was particularly appropriate, as we were dealing \nwith the needs of the men and women in uniform around the world, that \nwe also respect and enforce their right to cast a vote.\n  We know from 2006 statistics alone that of all of the eligible \ncivilian and military voters around the world who were eligible and who \nactually requested an absentee by mail ballot, only 5.5 percent of \nthose votes were actually counted. That is a disgraceful statistic and \none we need to do something about.\n  I compliment Senator Levin, Senator Feinstein, and others for working \nwith us during the process of the Defense authorization bill to come \ntogether on what I believe was a clear and acceptable amendment to all \nsides, but because of the bizarre process we found ourselves in \nyesterday, this bill was basically a casualty of that process, as I \nsay.\n  So what I am hoping to do is take a bill we worked on that is very \nimportant in order to protect one of the most important civil rights of \nour men and women in uniform--the right to vote--and hopefully, by \nunanimous consent today, we can pass this bill and get it on its way to \nthe President for signature in due course. I don't see any reason, \nsince we did work together on this on a bipartisan basis and it has \nbeen cleared by both sides, there would be any objection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S8985-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3073\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. So let me ask unanimous consent at this time that the \nRules Committee be discharged and the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 3073, the Military Voting Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment at the desk be agreed to--\nby the way, that is the amendment we worked on with Senator Bennett, \nthe ranking member, and Senator Feinstein, the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, together with Senator Levin and Senator Warner. I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I object on behalf of the leadership, as \nthe Rules Committee needs time to look at this and digest this and \nfigure this out to try to work something out. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the other side \nwould object. This is the same amendment that was already cleared by \nthe Rules Committee, so I don't understand what the process is that the \nSenator is referring to. I hope this isn't just another delay tactic. \nIt is something that really cries out for us to address.\n  I have to say, when I travel back to my State and talk to my \nconstituents, they absolutely believe this Congress is dysfunctional. \nIf we can't find some way to come together on a bipartisan basis to \npass noncontroversial voting rights protection for our military such as \nthis, I guess there is not a lot of hope for doing other, perhaps more \ncomplicated, more involved things.\n  This is very straightforward. To have an objection to this bill which \nhas already been worked on and cleared through the process and which \nwas a casualty of the bizarre process by which we adopted the Defense \nauthorization bill, without any right, really, to offer any amendments \nsuch as this, is, frankly, beyond me.\n  In the remaining few days this Congress is in session, I hope \nwhatever concerns the Senator was referring to which have not been made \nknown to me will be addressed. I will come back here every day, if \nnecessary, and offer a similar unanimous consent request. I would ask \nthose on the other side who object to the passage of this bill to offer \nme some explanation for what the specific concern is. If there is a \nproblem we can eliminate by working with them, we would be glad to do \nit. But to just stonewall this important amendment to protect one of \nthe most basic civil rights for our men and women in uniform--the right \nto vote--is, frankly, beyond me.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to express \nmy strong support for the so-called extenders package, which includes \nthe Energy Improvement and Extension Act and will come before the \nSenate, as I understand it, as early as this afternoon.\n  Passage of this bill is very important for the country and will have \nwide-reaching impacts. It will reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, \ncurb greenhouse gas emissions, create hundreds of thousands of American \njobs, promote R in our innovative industries, ease fiscal burdens on \nrural counties, and reduce the tax burden on middle-class families.\n  The bill demonstrates the critical role that tax incentives can play \nin addressing our country's most pressing challenges.\n  Let me focus today on the very robust package of tax incentives for \nclean, renewable energy, and energy efficiency. Those are incentives I \nand many of my colleagues have worked on since the beginning of this \nCongress. We have already taken eight votes this Congress on various \nversions of this energy tax package. Unfortunately, as the ``green'' \nenergy sector has sat by and production has slowed in that sector, and \nas skyrocketing gas prices have made our dependence on foreign oil more \napparent than ever, our energy tax incentives have been hostage to a \nbroader dispute between the parties concerning whether, and how, to \noffset the costs of extending various tax provisions. I am very pleased \nthat after a number of false starts, we appear, finally, to have \nreached a compromise.\n  The compromise will enable us to become a more energy-efficient \nnation. It will wean us off of our dependence on fossil fuels. It \nextends the production tax credit by 1 year for wind energy and by 2 \nyears for other qualified renewable sources. I had hoped we could \nachieve a longer term extension of the production tax credit, but this \nis all that could be afforded within the package's cost constraints. \nUndoubtedly, this bill's extension of the production tax credit will \nenable our renewable industries to stay afloat. Today, I want to state \nmy commitment again to work for a long-term extension of the production \ntax credit, which is very much needed, which I hope we can achieve in \nthe next Congress.\n  This package, however, includes long-term extensions for tax credits \nthat make distributed green energy technologies affordable for American \nbusinesses and families. The investment tax credit, which gives \nbusinesses a 30-percent tax credit for investing in solar, wind, \ngeothermal, and ocean energy equipment, is extended for a full 8 years. \nSo, too, is the residential energy efficiency property credit, which \ngives families a 30-percent tax credit for the cost of installing solar \nequipment at\n\n[[Page S8986]]\n\ntheir residences. That is an 8-year extension of that provision, which \nis very good news for many Americans.\n  For both of these tax incentives, the bill expands the classes of \nqualifying equipment. This means businesses and families will have \nadded flexibility in choosing the energy-saving technologies that make \nthe most sense for them. Both credits are expanded to include small \nwind technologies that are used for onsite energy production, and \ngeothermal heat pumps, which can use the Earth as either a heat source, \nwhen operating in heating mode, or a heat sink, when operating in \ncooling mode. There are already more than 1 million geothermal heat \npumps installed in the United States, and those who have installed them \ncan save up to 70 percent annually on their utility bills. So when this \nbill becomes law, families will be able to choose among installing \nsolar technology, small wind technology, and geothermal heat pumps in \ntheir homes, and the 30 percent tax credit will be available for any of \nthose installations. In case of solar electric investments, we greatly \nimprove the incentive by removing the current $2,000 credit cap.\n  The bill also expands the business credit to include combined heat \nand power systems, which use a heat engine or power station to \nsimultaneously generate both electricity and useful heat. Businesses \nthat install these systems are able to get both heat and electricity \nfrom the same source, which decreases both energy costs and greenhouse \ngas emissions.\n  The benefits of these investments, these incentives, go far beyond \nenergy independence, greenhouse gas reduction, and energy cost savings. \nThey will enable U.S. firms of all sizes to add a great many ``green'' \njobs on American soil. The Navigant Consulting organization recently \nput out a report estimating that the 8-year extension of the solar \ncredit that I have just talked about will create 1.2 million employment \nopportunities in this country, including 440,000 permanent jobs, and \n$232 billion in domestic investment. Solar energy is already an \nimportant economic engine in my State of New Mexico. I am very pleased \nthis extension is anticipated to add an additional 12,000 direct jobs \nin my State and 7,000 indirect jobs.\n  Shifting to the need to reduce demand for petroleum, the bill creates \na new plug-in electric drive vehicle credit. We are hopeful that plug-\nin electric vehicles will come to the market next year and that the \nGovernment will help individuals purchase these vehicles through tax \ncredits. This bill provides those tax credits will start at $2,500, and \nthey will climb as high as $7,500, depending upon the battery capacity \nof the particular vehicle.\n  For commercial vehicles, the bill adds incentives for idling \nreduction units, which provides an alternative source of power used to \nheat, cool, or provide electricity to the cab or other parts of the \ntruck. There are more than 200,000 trucks carrying refrigerated cargo \naround this country any day. The fleet owners will be incentivized to \ninstall advanced insulation on those trucks that can dramatically \nreduce the amount of gasoline those trucks consume trying to keep that \ncargo cool. So this is a very important provision.\n  Finally, the bill addresses our conservation and efficiency needs. It \nextends credits for energy-efficient improvements to new and existing \nhomes and commercial buildings. Because energy used to heat and cool \nresidential and commercial buildings accounts for nearly 40 percent of \nU.S. energy consumption--and nearly as much of our carbon dioxide \nemissions--these tax incentives are especially important. Owners of \nexisting homes will be able to claim a tax credit of up to 10 percent \nof the combined costs from all qualified electric efficiency \nimprovements, such as installing insulation in their homes, replacing \nwindows, water heaters, and high-efficiency cooling and heating \nequipment. For new homes, there is a $2,000 tax credit for a home \nbuilder who constructs a qualified new energy-efficient home, certified \nto achieve a 50-percent reduction in energy usage. With new homes \nlikely to remain part of our Nation's housing stock for more than 60 \nyears, we need to make sure that builders have the right incentives to \nmake energy efficiency a top priority. Owners of commercial buildings \nwill continue to be able to deduct up to $1.80 per square foot of \nbuilding floor area if they achieve a 50-percent energy savings target \nthrough energy reductions for the building's HVAC and interior lighting \nsystem.\n  With this addition to the provisions related to energy, American \nbusinesses are counting on Congress to enact this package because it \ncontains an extension of the R development tax credit. It contains \nimportant tax relief for American families. It patches the alternative \nminimum tax to prevent it from engulfing millions of additional hard-\nworking families. It lowers the income threshold for the $1,000 child \ntax credit from $12,000 to $8,500. That change alone enables 25,000 New \nMexico children to newly qualify and an additional 94,000 to receive a \nlarger credit than under prior law.\n  It extends the qualified tuition deduction for higher education \nexpenses. That is a deduction of up to $4,000 that helps more than 4.4 \nmillion middle-class families meet the cost of sending their children \nto college.\n  Finally, the bill includes the secure world schools provisions and \nthe payment in lieu of taxes provisions. These are extremely important \nfor Western States in particular but for virtually all of our States.\n  As to the payment in lieu of taxes, let me talk specifically about \nthat issue. We increase funding for payment in lieu of taxes in the \ncurrent fiscal year. We fully fund the program for 4 years. These \nFederal payments are essential to local governments, including many in \nmy State, in order to offset the losses and property taxes due to \nnontaxable Federal lands located within their boundaries. This funding \nis long overdue, and it is more desperately needed now than ever \nbefore.\n  Passage of this legislation, this energy incentives package, will \ndemonstrate to the American people that we are willing to shift our tax \npriorities in a new direction toward a national energy policy that \npromotes diversified domestic sources of clean energy.\n  It furthers the significant progress we made in recent years with \nrespect to promoting investment in efficiency and the renewable energy \ntechnologies that can help grow our economy. And beyond energy issues, \nit addresses key concerns of American families, businesses, and \nmunicipalities.\n  I applaud the various Senators who have had a major part in the \ndevelopment of this legislation, particularly Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley, but also our leadership, both the Democratic and \nRepublican leaders, for bringing us together around this package.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we speak, the financial turmoil of this \ncountry is ongoing. One way we can help is create some jobs, and that \nis what this legislation regarding the tax extenders would do.\n  We have waited for months for this legislation--months. It seems to \nme we should move forward. I am so disappointed that it has taken so \nlong to get where we are. It has been months.\n  Senators have worked for a long period of time. We had a problem \nearly on about how we were going to pay for it. I admire and respect \nthe work done by Senators Cantwell and Ensign. They have worked very \nhard. It was a bipartisan effort to move forward. We have Senators \nBaucus and Grassley who have worked very hard, joining with Senators \nCantwell and Ensign to move this legislation forward. We have a program \nto do this.\n  The longer we wait, the more difficult it is. We are in the waning \nhours of this legislative session, and there is going to be a lot of \nhue and cry that we not go home now. There is all this financial \nturmoil.\n\n[[Page S8987]]\n\n  I tell everyone here, we should try to complete our work. The \ncommittees have a right to meet, even if we are not in session. And if \nthere is something they come up with that we need to do, the President \ncan call us back within a matter of minutes.\n  So let's try to get the work done that we know we have to get done \nnow. The work we know we have to get done now is to get the tax \nextenders passed. We have to do something on energy that is nontax \nrelated, we have to do something on stimulus, and we have to do \nsomething on a CR. There are other issues we can work together to get \ndone. But here it is Thursday afternoon. It is 2:30 in the afternoon.\n  I am going to ask for consent. It is something I have discussed at \nlength publicly. I have discussed it privately with the Republican \nleader. We want to get this done. I think that is a fair statement.\n  It is never quite enough. There are some people who never can quite \nget enough. They want a little bit more. In the Senate, as it is set \nup, a person or two can wreak havoc with what is going on around here. \nI hope people understand that if we don't get this bill done, it is \ngoing to add to the financial catastrophe we are facing in our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 6049, energy extenders, at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, following consultation with the \nRepublican leader; that when the bill is considered, it be considered \nunder the following limitations: that there be 60 minutes of general \ndebate on the bill, equally divided and controlled by the leaders or \ntheir designees; that the only first-degree amendments in order be the \nfollowing, with no other amendments in order and that they be subject \nto an affirmative 60-vote threshold, and that if the amendment achieves \nthat threshold, then it be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; that if the amendment does not achieve that \nthreshold, then it be withdrawn; that each amendment be subject to a \ndebate limitation of 60 minutes equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form: Baucus-Grassley substitute amendment regarding energy tax \nextenders with offsets; Reid or designee perfecting amendment regarding \nAMT with offset; Baucus-Grassley perfecting amendment regarding tax \nextenders, amendment without full offset; that it be in order for \nSenator Conrad to raise a budget point of order against the amendment; \nthat once the debate time has been used or yielded back, the motion to \nwaive the applicable point of order be considered to have been made; \nfurther, that if the motion to waive is successful, then the amendment \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that \nif the motion to waive is not successful, the amendment be withdrawn, \nand that Senator Conrad control up to 10 minutes of time during debate \non this amendment; provided further, that regardless of the outcome of \nthe vote with respect to the Baucus-Grassley substitute amendment, the \nSenate vote in relation to the remaining two amendments covered in this \nagreement; that the votes in relation to the above-listed amendments \noccur in the order listed after the use or yielding back of time; that \nupon disposition of all amendments, the bill be read a third time and \nthe Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if \namended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  I will say this before asking for acceptance of this consent request. \nIt is Thursday afternoon at 2:30. This bill has to go to the House of \nRepresentatives. I had somewhat long conversations with the Republican \nleader. I think this is going to work out fine. The longer we wait, the \nmore difficult time we are having getting this through all the hoops \nthat need to be jumped. So I hope people will allow us to go forward \nwith this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I share the \nmajority leader's hope that we will be on a glidepath toward completion \nof the Senate's business on a timely basis. I largely support the \nprovisions of this bill.\n  We have been consulting with the Finance Committee chairman, Senator \nBaucus, and Senator Grassley, the ranking member, and in good \nconsultation with the staff. The problem is that as proposed, my State, \nthe State of Texas, where 2 million people are without power because of \nthe devastation of Hurricane Ike, are being treated in a discriminatory \nmanner under some of the provisions of this bill.\n  I am hopeful--indeed, I am optimistic--that we can work through these \nissues. Our initial discussions have been very productive. I expect we \nwill be able to reach some resolution, but we are not there yet.\n  For that reason, I reluctantly object.\n  Mr. REID. I ask through the Chair a question: When? That is the \nquestion. When is all this going to be worked out, if it is going to be \nworked out?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished majority \nleader, we have had productive meetings, as I said, with the Finance \nCommittee staff and the Joint Tax staff. We are consulting now with the \nGovernor of our State and with other officials who have \nresponsibilities in the areas most affected by this devastating \nhurricane.\n  We think after consultation, hopefully over the course of the \nafternoon, we can wrap this up. But it is going to take all of us \nworking together to try to reach that resolution. I am hopeful we can \nget there, but we are not there yet.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will say this: I received a call from the \nGovernor of Louisiana and the Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana. \nEveryone wants more. When is enough enough? We know Texas has been hit \nhard by this storm, and our hearts go out to the people without homes \nand without power. We understand that. But this is not the last train \nthrough this body. We are going to have a stimulus bill and a \ncontinuing resolution. Let's finish this bill. No one wants to leave \nTexas without the resources they need, but we need to complete this \nlegislation now.\n  I say, if I heard my friend right, they are going to have to work \nthrough the afternoon to do this? What do we do with the State of \nLouisiana? Do we have to wait now to match that, that they get their \nfair share, as comparing it to Texas? As I said, there is other \nbusiness we have to complete before we leave. One of them is a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  I say to my friend, if he doesn't get everything he wants on this \nbill, wait until then. We need to get this done; otherwise, we are \ngoing to be in a bottleneck, and there is no way in the world we can \nfinish this work we have to do by a week from tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The objection is \nheard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my good friend from \nNevada, this is a very legitimate concern that the Texas Senators have. \nThey are working diligently, as the junior Senator from Texas \nindicated, with Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley.\n  I support this bill; the majority leader supports this bill. It has \nbroad bipartisan support. I assure my good friend the majority leader \nthat there is not an effort here to try to slow down the passage of \nthis extender package. But we would like to get it right, if we can, \nand this is a legitimate concern the Texas Senators have. I am \nconvinced that they are working as rapidly as possible; that Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley are sympathetic to their concerns and, \napparently, think they are legitimate concerns that could be addressed. \nSo I would like to try to cheer up my good friend the majority leader \nthat maybe progress is just around the corner.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I hope this can be worked out very \nquickly, and I applaud both the majority leader and the Republican \nleader for their efforts to get passed the renewable energy tax bill \nthat Senator Cantwell and I have worked so hard on this entire year. I \nalso want to thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley for \ntheir work in putting this whole package together. We have been working \nthe last couple of weeks trying to come up with a compromise and we are \nfinally almost there.\n  The Ensign-Cantwell Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act passed the Senate \nby a vote of 88 to 8 back in April. The bill was not paid for at that \ntime, and the\n\n[[Page S8988]]\n\nHouse of Representatives did not want to see a bill like this enacted \ninto law without it being paid for. So over the last couple of weeks, \nwe have worked to make sure there was an offset and to make sure this \noffset was not going to be damaging to further exploration of other new \nenergy. While producing more green energy, we do not want to hurt the \nproduction of other types of energy. So we worked hard to do that, and \nI think we have succeeded in this bill.\n  This bill will create at least 440,000 permanent jobs just in the \nsolar energy sector alone, and Senator Cantwell and I are very proud of \nthis legislation. It is critical we get this passed before we leave \ntown. We need to enact proper policies to help create more jobs all \nover the United States right now. The economy is in trouble, and this \nis a shot in the arm to the economy which also will produce more green \npower for the United States, makes us less dependent on foreign sources \nof energy, and it is the right thing to do.\n  We want to join together to push this important legislation through, \nand obviously we have to work to make sure the House of Representatives \ntakes up the bill and passes it in time to get to the President's desk. \nI am convinced the President will sign it.\n  The renewable energy tax extenders will be combined with AMT relief \nand other business extenders that are important for our entire economy, \nespecially to the high-tech sector of our economy.\n  The American people are calling for bipartisanship. Senator Cantwell \nand I have joined together and have been working very hard to get the \nrest of the Senate, including the two leaders and the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Finance Committee, to go along with us. This is \nthe time for bipartisanship to show that we are Americans first and \nthat we can join together to accomplish important tasks.\n  I hope we can go to this bill as quickly as possible, get it passed \nthrough the Senate and on to the House of Representatives, where I hope \nthey will pass it. Then we can send this bill off to the President so \nwe can see these renewable projects begin--these important projects on \nsolar, on wind, on geothermal, on biofuels, and on so many other \nthings.\n  In my State, there are a lot of people who would like to add solar \npanels to their homes to help produce their own electricity. Current \nlaw just doesn't work effectively enough to incentivize that activity. \nThe credits are not right. There is no predictability. Financially, it \njust doesn't pay off. With the bill we have on the floor, there would \nbe a financial payoff to actually encourage homeowners to put solar \npanels on their homes where there are States, such as mine, that have a \nlot of sunshine.\n  This is an important bill, and once again I thank my colleague from \nthe State of Washington, Senator Cantwell. She has been absolutely \nfabulous to work with this on this, both she and her staff. I \nappreciate both our staffs. Jason Mulvihill on my staff, and Lauren \nBazel and Amit Ronen on Senator Cantwell's staff, are working together \non this so that hopefully we can get this bill done as soon as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor so Senator Cantwell can make a few comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I do wish to be recognized, along with \nmy colleague from Nevada, to talk about the importance of the passage \nof this legislation, and not just the extenders--which are good for not \nonly the States of Washington and Nevada as it relates to sales tax and \nR tax credits and county payments and a whole variety of things--but \nmost importantly these renewable energy credits, where we are trying to \nchange the focus and the direction of our country by unleashing the \npower of the solar industry to help create about 400,000 new jobs for \nour country. So we do want to get to this package done.\n  I thank the leaders as well, Senators Reid and McConnell, for trying \nto get this legislation on the floor. I hope we can get through this \nlast hiccup and actually get this legislation before our colleagues and \nget it passed today--hopefully today--because I think that is how \nimportant it is to send out this message.\n  I certainly thank Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for their \nperseverance in continuing to try to work through vote after vote on \nthis so we could have a package.\n  I want to say to the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign, how much I \nappreciate his willingness to engage in this subject starting really \nthe beginning of this year and for understanding what the opportunity \nwas to look at renewable energy and to make sure the tax credits were \nmore predictable and there was more long-term certainty for businesses \nso that we could take advantage of the manufacturing base that could be \ncreated in the United States. I certainly applaud him and his staff for \ntheir perseverance in trying to come up with a funding mechanism for \nthis package of green energy tax credits in the last 2 weeks and coming \nup with a breakthrough on exactly how to pay for them.\n  So we are at this momentous point now where the bipartisan efforts of \nworking across the aisle have paid off. Frankly, I think we need more \nof that--working across the aisle--on some of these solutions so that \nwe can actually move legislation. I hope we can come back in the next \nfew hours and actually talk about some more of the specifics of this \nlegislation because it is really breakthrough legislation.\n  For the first time, we are giving an extension of the solar \ninvestment tax credit and fuel cell tax credit that will, I believe, \nchange investment patterns in such a significant way that we will be \nreaping the benefits of that kind of generation of power to replace \nwhat we are currently doing on our grid today.\n  We also have incentivizing new provisions for plug-in electric cars, \nwhich will help in that transition so that people understand our future \nsource of energy and power for our transportation sector has a very \nbright future. We provide for tax breaks for participating in that \ntransition and help them realize they will be able to drive for $1.00 a \ngallon in these plug-in electric cars instead of for $3.50 or $4 a \ngallon using fossil fuel.\n  In this legislation there is over $10,000 in consumer tax breaks and \ncredits on all sorts of things, from home improvements to making sure \nthat consumers, particularly in the northeast part of our country, get \na tax break for moving off of home heating oil and on to wood stoves \nthat will help them reduce the cost in their heating bills in the \nfuture.\n  There are a lot of breakthroughs in this legislation which I hope to \nget back to this afternoon. So I hope we can get our colleague from \nTexas to remove his objection and that we will be able to move forward \non this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senators from \nWashington and Nevada not just for the product of their work but for \nthe way they are working together. I think what the American people \nwant to see the Senate focus more on the biggest issues facing our \ncountry and work across party lines to get a result.\n  I was one of the few Senators earlier who voted against the Ensign-\nCantwell legislation because I thought it disproportionately favored \none form of renewable energy. I think this is a great improvement over \nwhat had been done before, and I especially like the fact that solar \nhas a chance to move up the line as a developing energy. It is not \nproven yet, it is not able yet to do all we hope it will do, but this \nshould help. And the idea that we would use this vast reservoir of \nunused electricity we have at night around the country to plug in our \ncars, rather than spend money on gasoline that we send overseas to \nunfriendly people, is a very appealing idea.\n  All those ideas have broad support on both sides of the aisle, and \nSenators Cantwell and Ensign have been persistent in their efforts to \nfashion a bipartisan result. So I congratulate them for what they have \ndone, and I thank them for it. I feel confident, with the support of \nthe majority and Republican leaders, that we will get to a result.\n  My colleagues' work on this bill, and the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader's work on this bill, to bring us toward a bipartisan \nresult on one of the largest issues facing our country is in great \ncontrast to some of what I\n\n[[Page S8989]]\n\nheard this morning from the Democratic side of the aisle about today's \nfinancial structure. What I heard was what I call kindergarten \npolitics. It looked as if somebody had been down in the War Room with \ncrayons and paper on the floor coming up with how do we score political \npoints about the financial crisis in the country today, instead of \nsaying: What can we do, working together, to reassure the American \npeople we are going to take every step we need to take here to make \ncertain we restore the vibrancy of our economy?\n  I came to the Senate, not as a Senator but as a staff member, more \nthan 40 years ago, and what was going through my mind is the way Lyndon \nJohnson and Everett Dirksen would have worked when Everett Dirksen was \nthe Republican leader and Lyndon Johnson was the President. When it was \nimportant, they worked together, and they let the American people know \nthat. So did President Kennedy and Senator Dirksen, when he was the \nRepublican leader. So did Senator Mansfield, from the Democratic side \nof the aisle, and President Nixon, a Republican.\n  I remember Senator Byrd telling me that both he and Senator Baker, \nthe Democratic and Republican leaders when President Carter was here, \nchanged their minds about the Panama Canal, and they cast controversial \nvotes because they thought it was the right thing to do. We had a major \nissue before the country, and some in the country didn't like the \nresult, but they respected the fact that Senators had the instinct to \nrecognize that when something is important, threatening our country, \nthat people expect us not to play kindergarten politics but to put that \naside, leave it off the Senate floor, and come here and do our jobs.\n  The same was true with President Reagan and Tip O'Neill, the Speaker \nof the House, who had very different points of view. But when Social \nSecurity was nearly broken, they worked together.\n  Now we have a serious financial crisis facing our country, and what \ndo we get from some of the Members of the other side of the aisle but a \nlot of kindergarten partisan politics, which should be left in the \ntrash can somewhere. We even had the majority leader criticizing a \nformer Republican Senator for something the majority leader himself \nvoted for. Why was it even being discussed? Because somebody over in \nthe kindergarten room wrote out a press release and handed it to \nsomebody. So instead of seeing what we just saw on the Senate floor a \nfew minutes ago, which was a Democratic and Republican Senator saying: \nLet's work together on energy, we saw something much different.\n  From the Republican side of the aisle, we could come and say: Well, \nthis whole financial crisis is caused fundamentally by a collapse in \nhousing prices. And one of the greatest factors in that is the great \nhousing institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When we brought up a \nbill to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all the Democrats voted no \nand all the Republicans voted yes. We could say that. We could say it \nwas a Democratic President who stopped us from bringing in oil from \nAlaska 10 years ago, which today would have kept gas prices from going \nup. We could say it was a Democratic President who encouraged a lot of \npeople to buy homes who didn't have the money to pay it back.\n  But that is not what we should be doing here. We should put all that \naside, and we should say to the President and say to the Speaker and \nsay to each other: We have a serious financial crisis facing our \ncountry. What can we do, working together, to reassure the American \npeople we are going to take any step we can to ensure the security of \ntheir savings accounts, the values of their homes, the security of \ntheir money markets, of their accounts? We can do that. We should do \nthat. That is what most of us are elected to do, or we feel we are \nelected to do.\n  So I was very disappointed to see so much of the partisan \nkindergarten-talk coming from the other side of the aisle this morning. \nI would much rather see the kind of action that the Senator from \nWashington and the Senator from Nevada have demonstrated throughout the \nyear and did today, as did the majority leader and the Republican \nleader when they said: We are very close to having a renewable energy \nbill that meets the objections many have had. And that is one step we \ncan take to deal with the problem of the high price of energy, because \nwe need to, as we say, find more American energy as well as use less \nenergy, including alternative and renewable energy.\n  There is one other thing that we could do together and I would like \nto briefly outline it today. It was pointed out in an article in the \nWashington Post last week by Susan Hockfield, the President of MIT, one \nof our great research universities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her op-ed be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. She suggested that we should have a dramatic new \ninvestment, a new Federal investment in energy research and \ndevelopment; that our current spending for energy research and \ndevelopment had shrunk, in her words, ``almost to irrelevancy''; and \nthat the $2 billion to $3 billion that the Federal Government is \nspending annually on energy R is less than half of what our largest \npharmaceutical company spends on research each year.\n  Yesterday, I had a visit from the President of Yale University who \nmade the point that, since 1973, we have found as much oil as we have \nused. Mr. President, 1973 was the year we had the big oil shock. He \npointed out the reason we were able to do that was because of extensive \nscience and technology advances.\n  Most of our wealth since World War II in this country has been \ncreated by our brainpower advantage, and we worked together as a Senate \nand as a Congress, with everyone taking credit, to pass legislation to \nhelp. We called it the America COMPETES Act--to help keep America's \nbrainpower advantage so we can keep growing good jobs here.\n  What the president of MIT and the president of Yale are saying, and \nmost of our research universities would say and most of us know, is we \nneed to keep pushing on science and technology. As we stand here today, \nthinking about how we deal with high gasoline prices and electricity \nprices that are increasing and the national security issues that arise \nfrom depending so much on other countries in the world for oil; and as \nwe think about the financial markets and how over the long-term we \nstrengthen our country so we are able to withstand any sort of jolt to \nthe system--one of the most important things we should consider doing, \nand doing in a bipartisan way, is to make a dramatic new Federal \ninvestment in energy research and development. I may have more to say \nabout that next week. It is a tremendous opportunity for the next \nPresident to take.\n  Let me give an example of what I mean by it. In May, I went to the \nOak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, along with Bart Gordon, the \nDemocratic chairman of the House Science Committee. I proposed that the \nUnited States set as a goal putting our country on a path to clean \nenergy independence within the next 5 years and do it in a way that we \nhave done it before, with a new Manhattan Project for clean energy \nindependence.\n  The Manhattan Project was the project the United States launched \nduring World War II to create the atom bomb before Germany did, because \nwe were afraid that if Germany beat us in that, it would blackmail us \nin the same way many oil-producing countries are blackmailing us today. \nWe succeeded in that. But we did it because we put a clear focus on it, \nwe put an objective, we dedicated the money, we drafted companies, we \nassembled the best scientists in the world, and we won that race.\n  We could do the same with energy. What I suggested in May was that we \nadopt seven grand challenges. First, of course, we ought to do what we \nalready know how to do, which is to drill offshore and create more \nnuclear power. But then there are some things we don't know how to do, \nand most of the legislation we are considering--whether it is the \nlegislation that Senators Ensign and Cantwell have proposed or the Gang \nof 20 legislation or the bill that Senator Bingaman and others might \npropose--does not do much for energy research and development.\n\n[[Page S8990]]\n\n  Energy research and development would be this, for example: To make, \nwithin the next 5 years, electric cars and trucks commonplace--which \nwould mean research on advanced batteries; and to make solar energy \ncompetitive within the next 5 years with fossil fuels.\n  Incentives will help with that. That is in the tax extenders bill \nthat will be coming before the Senate. But in order to accomplish that, \nwe need money for research and development.\n  Among the other challenges, I suggested carbon capture and \nsequestration. We need to be able to use our coal plants and we need \nother ways of capturing carbon than taking it and putting it into the \nground. We need it within 5 years as well.\n  I see my time has come to an end. My point is the same. I like what \nSenators Ensign and Cantwell have been doing. I like the approach. I \nwould like to see more of that rather than the finger-pointing and \nblame calling, and one of the areas in which I hope we will work is a \ndramatic new Federal investment in energy research and development.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 11, 2008]\n\n                           Reimagining Energy\n\n                          (By Susan Hockfield)\n\n       Almost 70 years ago, as Germany invaded France, President \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt received an urgent visit from Vannevar \n     Bush, then chairman of the National Advisory Committee on \n     Aeronautics and formerly vice president and dean of \n     engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n       Bush's message was simple: For America to win the war that \n     was to come, it had no choice but to make aggressive, focused \n     investments in basic science. The case was so compelling that \n     Roosevelt approved it in 10 minutes. From radar to the \n     Manhattan Project, the innovations that decision unleashed \n     produced the military tools that won the war.\n       That same presidential decision launched the enduring \n     partnership between the federal government and research \n     universities, a partnership that has vastly enhanced \n     America's military capabilities and security, initiated many \n     important industries, produced countless medical advances and \n     spawned virtually all of the technologies that account for \n     our modern quality of life.\n       Today, the United States is tangled in a triple knot: a \n     shaky economy, battered by volatile energy prices; world \n     politics weighed down by issues of energy consumption and \n     security; and mounting evidence of global climate change.\n       Building on the wisdom of Vannevar Bush, I believe we can \n     address all three problems at once with dramatic new federal \n     investment in energy research and development. If one advance \n     could transform America's prospects, it would be ready \n     access, at scale, to a range of affordable, renewable, low-\n     carbon energy technologies--from large-scale solar and wind \n     energy to safe nuclear power. Only one path will lead to such \n     transformative technologies: research. Yet federal funding \n     for energy research has dwindled to irrelevance. In 1980, 10 \n     percent of federal research dollars went to energy. Today, \n     the share is 2 percent.\n       Research investment by U.S. energy companies has mirrored \n     this drop. In 2004, it stood at $1.2 billion in today's \n     dollars. This might suit a cost-efficient, technologically \n     mature, fossil-fuel-based energy sector, but it is \n     insufficient for any industry that depends on innovation. \n     Pharmaceutical companies invest 18 percent of revenue in R \n     Semiconductor firms invest 16 percent. Energy companies \n     invest less than one-quarter of 1 percent. With this pattern \n     of investment, we cannot expect an energy technology \n     revolution.\n       While industry must support technology development, only \n     government can prime the research pump. Congress must lead.\n       The potential gains--from the economy to global security to \n     the climate--are boundless. Other nations are also chasing \n     these technologies. We must be first to market with the most \n     innovative solutions. We must make sure that in the energy \n     technology markets of the future, we have the power to \n     invent, produce and sell--not the obligation to buy.\n       How much should we invest? In 2006 the government spent \n     between $2.4 billion and $3.4 billion (less than half of the \n     annual R budget of our largest pharmaceutical company). \n     Many experts, including the Council on Competitiveness, \n     recommend that federal energy research spending climb to \n     twice or even 10 times current levels. In my view, the nation \n     should move promptly to triple current rates, then increase \n     funding further as the Energy Department builds its capacity \n     to convert basic research into marketable technologies.\n       Vannevar Bush's insight was his appreciation of the value \n     of basic research in powering innovation. I believe that we \n     stand on the verge of a global energy technology revolution. \n     Will America lead it and reap the rewards? Or will we \n     surrender that advantage to other countries with clearer \n     vision? I believe we can chart a profoundly hopeful, \n     practical path to America's future--through rapid, sustained, \n     broad-based and intensive investment in basic energy \n     research.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent \nthat my remarks be immediately followed by Senator Schumer of New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S8990-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8990-S8991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. RES. 626\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, last night the majority leader filed \ncloture on an unusual bill. It is a bill he drafted, combining 36 \ncompletely unrelated bills, making it one big package, the so-called \nReid omnibus, which is the anti-Coburn omnibus, or my favorite term, \nthe ``Tomnibus.''\n  That is a very unusual and suspect way for the Senate to proceed. \nSenator Reid says it is necessary because all these measures are being \nblocked by one or two Senators. The only problem with that argument is \nthere are other measures that are being blocked by one or two Senators, \nbut he has not included those in his omnibus because they are his \nMembers who are doing the blocking, who are doing the obstructing, who \nare in the tiny narrow majority on those bills.\n  I have one of those bills. I wish to talk about it today. That is S. \nRes. 626. This is very simple, very straightforward and has the support \nof the huge majority of the American people and the huge majority of \nthe Senate. It is a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that \nthe Supreme Court of the United States erroneously decided the case \nKennedy v. Louisiana and that the eighth amendment to the Constitution \nof the United States allows the imposition of the death penalty for the \nrape of a child.\n  First of all, I would like to thank my cosponsors in this Senate \nresolution, Senators Crapo, Burr, Cornyn, Dole, Sessions, Kyl, DeMint, \nGraham, and Coburn.\n  I would like to thank so many other Senators who agree with this \nimportant resolution and agree with everything stated therein.\n  As you know, the Supreme Court, in a very narrowly decided 5-to-4 \ndecision, has now construed the Constitution to categorically bar the \nimposition of the death penalty for the crime of child rape, even \nthough, of course, the document says nothing of the kind. The majority \nnoted that a child rapist could face the ultimate penalty, the death \npenalty, in only 6 States and not in any of the 30 other States that \nhave the death penalty and not under the jurisdiction of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  One big problem is that Justice Kennedy's confident assertion about \nthe complete absence of Federal law in this area is wrong. It is \ncompletely wrong. It is clear that it is wrong. The Federal Government \ndoes have jurisdiction and there is a Federal law applying the death \npenalty, making that available for the rape of a child. Congress--yes, \nCongress--revised the sex crimes section of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice a few years ago, in 2006, to add child rape as offense \npunishable by death.\n  The revisions were in the National Defense Authorization Act of that \nyear. President Bush signed that bill into law and then issued an \nExecutive order which put the provisions of that act into the 2008 \nedition of the Manual for Courts Martial.\n  My resolution is simple and straightforward. It asks the Supreme \nCourt to rehear the case of Kennedy v. Louisiana because they got that \naspect of Federal law so very wrong. It says that among the worst of \nall crimes is the crime of child rape and that there is nothing in the \nConstitution to take away the death penalty from States, in terms of \nappropriate penalties for that crime.\n  The Louisiana district attorney's office in Jefferson Parish has \nasked for a rehearing on this case on July 21, 2008, based specifically \non that very false assertion made before the Supreme Court about \nFederal law, so that rehearing is being actively considered. It is very \nappropriate in this context, as the Supreme Court considers right now, \nas we speak, possibly rehearing the case, that the Senate be allowed to \nspeak on the matter; that the Senate make its voice heard on the matter \nand point out that rehearing should go forward and that the case was \nerroneously decided.\n\n[[Page S8991]]\n\n  This is a serious issue. Obviously, on the face of it, child rape is \na heinous crime. But it is even more heinous when you look beneath the \nsurface and understand more about the repercussions.\n  It has been estimated that as many as 40 percent of 7- to 13-year-old \nsexual assault victims are seriously disturbed. Psychological problems \ninclude sudden school failure, unprovoked crime, dissociation, deep \ndepression, sleep disturbances, feelings of guilt and inferiority, and \nmuch more.\n  The deep problems that affect these child rape victims often become \nsociety's problems as well. Commentators have noted the clear \ncorrelations between childhood sexual abuse and later problems such as \nsubstance abuse, dangerous sexual behaviors or disfunctions, inability \nto relate to others on the interpersonal level and other psychiatric \nillnesses.\n  Victims of child rape are nearly 5 times more likely than nonvictims \nto be arrested for sex crimes themselves; they are 30 times more likely \nto be arrested for other serious related crimes.\n  Justice Alito's dissent summed up the impact and horror of the \noffense of child rape:\n\n       Long-term studies show that sexual abuse is grossly \n     intrusive in the lives of children and is harmful to their \n     normal psychological, emotional and sexual development in \n     ways which no just or humane society can tolerate.\n\n  For all these reasons and in light of the clear fact that the Supreme \nCourt got it very wrong with regard to Federal law on the subject, I \nbelieve this sense of the Senate is important to pass. I believe that a \nhuge majority of Senators do and will support it on passage and that it \nis an important statement to make as the Supreme Court actively \nconsiders this possibility of rehearing.\n  I would simply like the same type of opportunity which the majority \nleader is giving his Members in bundling these other bills into the so-\ncalled Reid omnibus, or anti-Coburn omnibus or ``Tomnibus.'' Why can't \nthis provision, which has bipartisan support, which has very strong \nsupermajority support, be passed in an expeditious way as well, so we \ncan make our voices heard in a timely way, as the Supreme Court \nconsiders rehearing this very serious case which they got very wrong?\n  With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent to discharge the Judiciary \nCommittee from further consideration of S. Res. 626, a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the Supreme Court of the United \nStates erroneously decided Kennedy v. Louisiana and that the eighth \namendment to the Constitution of the United States allows the \nimposition of the death penalty for the rape of a child; that the \nSenate immediately proceed to consideration of the resolution and that \nit be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from New York \nis recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object and I will \nobject, but I wish to make a comment too. First, without stating \nwhether I would be for or against such a resolution--I have not seen \nthe language--there are Members on the other side--on my side of the \naisle who do object and on their behalf I am objecting.\n  I would say this to my colleague. It would seem to me whether one \nsupports the idea of making sure the death penalty extends to rapists, \nthat the best place, when we are dealing with the Supreme Court, is an \namicus brief to the Supreme Court, making the legal arguments--because \nobviously the Supreme Court is not supposed to just listen to what a \nbody such as this believes but, rather, look at the law.\n  So that might be the appropriate way to go. But having said that, \nwithout taking my own personal position on this, I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if I can briefly wrap up, obviously I am \ndisappointed. I understand the Senator's objection. But a great \nfrustration in all of this, in holding bills, in filing secret holds, \nin everything else, is that we never know on whose behalf those \nobjections are being made.\n  So I would ask my distinguished colleague if that can be made part of \nthe record. Apparently he did not make the objection on his own behalf, \nhe made the objection on behalf of other Senators. I think it is a \nlegitimate part of the debate and should be an important part of the \nrecord to hear on whose behalf these objections are being heard.\n  With regard to the Senator's comment about an amicus brief, obviously \nthat is being done from a number of quarters. I am participating with \ngroups in doing that. So that suggestion has already been taken up. But \nI would love to make part of the record on whose behalf any objection \nis heard.\n  Again, I would ask the question through the Chair, because it has \nbeen a very elusive, frustrating part of this process and this debate, \non whose behalf this objection is being made.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. All I can tell my colleague is more than one Member. And \nunder the rules, I guess that has to be disclosed within 5 days.\n  Mr. VITTER. Well, I will look forward to that disclosure because that \nhas been a frustrating part of this process and this debate today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar.) The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, before I get into the substance of my remarks, I \napologize to my colleague from Louisiana. It is 6 days after which \nobjectors are known, not 5. So that was my mistake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S8991-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8991-S8994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Today I rise to discuss the recent turmoil in our \nfinancial markets. Over the past few days the upheaval in New York has \nbeen extreme, as we have witnessed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, \none of the oldest and most well-respected financial institutions in the \nworld, the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, and the \nGovernment takeover of AIG, America's largest insurance company.\n  Those stunning developments followed closely on the heels of the \nGovernment takeover of Fannie and Freddie a mere 10 days ago. And I \nwatched with great sadness those lining up at some of these companies \nto take their belongings away after years and years of work and heard \nthe tales of woe from my constituents.\n  Our job here is to cushion the blow for those who are innocent of any \nwrongdoing and have lost their jobs. I am trying to do all I can to \nminimize job loss in New York. But it is also to prevent this from \nhappening again. That is why I rise to speak today, to lay out an \noutline of principles, and a broad-brush plan that might help us deal \nwith this crisis.\n  These unprecedented events have made it clear to the country what \nmany of us have been saying for some time. We are in the midst of the \ngreatest financial crisis since the Great Depression. After 8 years of \nderegulatory zeal by the Bush administration, an attitude of ``the \nmarket can do no wrong'' has led it down a short path to economic \nrecession.\n  From the unregulated mortgage brokers to the opaque credit default \nswaps market to aggressive short sellers who are driving down prices of \neven healthy financial institutions based on innuendo, this \nadministration has failed to take the steps necessary to protect both \nMain Street and Wall Street.\n  There may not be a silver bullet to fix what is currently dragging \ndown the economy, but we can take steps to mitigate the costs and \nensure that the impact of this crisis will be short term. We need to \noffer a smart, targeted, and timely solution that will help our economy \nweather this storm and keep as many families from losing their homes in \nthe process as we can.\n  Every minute matters, and the future competitiveness of the U.S. \neconomy depends on the administration's response. The series of ad hoc \ninterventions in the market over the past 10 days were important to \navoid a systemic disaster, but we cannot continue to act in such an \nuncoordinated and ad hoc fashion.\n  Furthermore, the Federal Reserve is being asked to do things that go \nfar beyond its mission. I represent 19 million New Yorkers, many of who \nlive on Main Street and work on Wall Street. So I know better than most \nthat our response has to be aimed at both areas. It must protect the \ndownstate economy, and the upstate economy. And\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\nthe two--whatever one feels or wants to say--are intrinsically linked. \nMake no mistake about it. The reckless lending practices and \nirresponsible risk taking conducted by many of our financial \ninstitutions during this era of deregulation have proven costly for the \nU.S. economy and its taxpayers.\n  The Federal Government cannot and should not write a blank check to \nthe institutions that have exacerbated this crisis. The U.S. taxpayers \nhave already extended $300 billion worth of capital to troubled banks \nand financial institutions, asking for nothing in return.\n  So starting today we need to condition the Federal Government's \nfinancial lifeline on the institutions' firm commitment to take actions \nto get us out of our immediate economic crisis. If the Federal \nGovernment is going to continue to support the economy, its new formal \nlending program with financial institutions must address both the need \nfor restoring stability and confidence in the U.S. financial market, \nand the need to set a floor in our plummeting housing market.\n  Some people focus on one, some people focus on the other. The fact is \nwe need both. We are not going to get out of this great mess unless we \ndeal with the mortgage crisis and the homeowner, and we deal with the \ncycles in our financial system which not only affect Wall Street and \nits jobs, of course, and my constituency, but affect all of America, \nbecause lending is the lifeline of the economy.\n  Someone from Chrysler told me that right now you need a FICO score of \n720--that is a credit rating that is very high--to get an auto loan. If \nthat continues, we would only sell 10 million cars in America next year \nas opposed to the 15 or 16 million we sell now. That shows you the \ninterrelationship right there. The auto worker is related to the \nfinancial institutions. We must fix both in a practical, nonideological \nsolution aimed at getting our economy back on its feet.\n\n  The rapid deterioration of the financial sector is fueled by the \nsteep rise in delinquencies and the foreclosure of risky mortgages that \nhave been sliced and diced and sold in complex instruments that are \nbecoming rapidly toxic waste on the balance sheet of our largest \nfinancial institutions.\n  The best way to stop the bleeding is to turn these mortgages into \nviable assets on a large scale. But the combination of an economic \ndownturn, tumbling home prices, complex mortgage security, and \nirresponsible underwriting by unregulated mortgage brokers has made \nthis a daunting and so far insurmountable challenge.\n  Over the past few years we have heard many discussions of a so-called \nRTC, Resolution Trust Corporation, and RTC-like proposals modeled after \nthe Government-owned asset management company charged with liquidating \nassets after the 1980s S crisis.\n  Today, Senator McCain made a similar proposal. And before I address \nthat, let me speak for a minute on Senator McCain. He has been a \nleading advocate for deregulation for a very long time. All of a \nsudden, he sounds almost like a populist. He seems to reverse course \nday in and day out.\n  Two days ago he said: AIG should not be aided by the Government and \nshould go bankrupt. And today he is calling for large Government \nintervention in the financial markets. It is no wonder that Senator \nMcCain said he does not understand economics. His erratic behavior in \nthe last 2 days is inconsistent--saying one thing on Tuesday and \nanother thing almost directly opposite on Thursday--makes you \nunderstand why people would not trust him with the economy.\n  Today he called for the firing of Chris Cox of the SEC. Well, I have \na lot of differences with Chris Cox and with the SEC. They have been \nfar too deregulatory to me. But where does Senator McCain differ in \npolicies with Chris Cox? Does he have a different view on short \nselling? Does he have a different view on holding company regulations? \nWho knows? Maybe he will replace Chris Cox with Phil Gramm who \nconsiders someone who lost his job a whiner, and considers all of us \nhurting in this economy a ``nation of whiners.''\n  It is hard to take the proposals by Senator McCain very seriously \nunless he backs them up, not only with detail, but with consistency and \na philosophy.\n  But getting back to his proposal today, something of an RTC-like \ncompany, the central challenge with that approach, and anyone who is \nadvocating the RTC--and my colleague Senator Dodd has outlined this \nvery well recently--is that the Federal Government would take on all of \nthe risk of the bank's troubled assets without addressing the root of \nthe problem, the housing market.\n  Proposals such as Senator McCain's may help Wall Street but they will \ndo nothing for Main Street. Two major problems exist. First, troubled \nmortgages have been sold into complex mortgage-backed securities which \nhave themselves been split into pieces and sold to thousands of \ninvestors around the world.\n  In order for an RTC to be able to modify the mortgages, it would have \nto gather up all of the pieces of every security and put the proverbial \npuzzle back together. This would be incredibly difficult and virtually \nimpossible. That is why the proposals by Secretary Paulson, as well \nintentioned as they are, have done very little in the foreclosure area. \nBecause if one investor of the hundreds who hold a piece of a mortgage \nsays ``no,'' there can be no refinancing, no reformulation. It is a \nhuge problem.\n  Second, even if it were possible for borrowers to have piggyback \nloans on second mortgages, which is an estimated 50 or 60 percent of \nthe troubled mortgages, the RTC would have to go back and buy the \nsecond lines as well in order to work out the loan.\n  In other words, even with the first mortgage, if you could get all of \nthose hundreds of pieces together, there is a second mortgage in 50 to \n60 percent of these troubled mortgages and the second mortgagors or \nmortgagees are not going to stand for--the first mortgagors are not \ngoing to stand for reducing their mortgage while the second mortgage is \nas large as ever.\n  In short, the complex structure of the most troubled mortgages \nunderwritten over the past several years would prevent an RTC from \nbeing able to help most homeowners. Furthermore, it seems like the RTC \nis Rashoman these days.\n  Some propose the name ``RTC'', like the Wall Street Journal financial \npage, to buy financial instruments; some propose it to deal with the \nmortgage situation, which is difficult, as I mentioned. And I think \nwhen we look at the specifics, the RTC model is not the best way to go. \nIn fact, it might not work at all.\n  Therefore, I am proposing that we examine a two-part approach that \nwill help suffering homeowners across the country keep their home and \nrestore stability to Wall Street.\n  First, we must get banks and other financial institutions to drop \ntheir fierce opposition to judicial loan modification in exchange for \nany additional assistance from the Federal Government.\n  This year my colleague, Senator Durbin, led legislation in the Senate \nthat many of us cosponsored that would make a simple change to current \nlaw to allow judges the authority to modify harmful mortgages on \nprimary residences. The industry adamantly lobbied against this \nlegislation, arguing it would harm the secondary mortgage market. \nSimply put, this is wrong. Between 1978 and 1993, when such \nmodifications were allowed, the evidence is clear. It had no impact on \nthe secondary mortgage market whatsoever. What is even more absurd, a \njudge can already modify a mortgage on a second home. So if you own two \nhomes--or seven homes--the bankruptcy court can help. But if you are \nlike Joe and Eileen Bailey and most of us and you only have one home, \nwhich is, by the way, also your largest and most important asset, and \nyou find yourself in trouble, there is nothing a bankruptcy judge can \ndo.\n  This critical solution is achieved by simply removing the bankruptcy \nlaw's language that denies relief to homeowners for their primary \nresidence. Court-supervised loan modification is the simplest, fairest, \nand least expensive way to get all the parties of a mortgage together \nand modify the loan down to the fair market value of the home with no \ncost to the U.S. Treasury. This provision also guarantees the lenders \nat least the value they would obtain through foreclosure, since a \nforeclosure sale can only recover the market value of the home. In \naddition, it saves lenders the high cost and significant delays of \nforeclosure. Because\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\nbankruptcy is enshrined in the Constitution and because the bankruptcy \njudge has the power, unlike the mortgage processor, to require all the \nparties to come together, this can work and, again, at no cost to the \nFederal Government.\n  Second, to restore confidence in financial markets and institutions, \nrather than continuing to intervene on an ad hoc basis as additional \ncompanies face problems, we should look at options to formalize ways \nfor the Federal Government to provide capital injections and secured \nloans for banks that are struggling. This will give financial \ninstitutions the capability to de-lever their balance sheets and write \ndown their bad assets over time. The rapid failure of a large number of \nfinancial institutions would have a disastrous long-term effect on the \nAmerican economy, a situation we must avoid at all cost. The Government \ncould establish a new agency similar to the Reconstruction Finance \nCorporation or RFC-like model employed during the Depression. The RFC \nis far preferable to RTC. But we must condition the development of this \nformal structure on the agreement of banks to abandon their opposition \nto judicial loan modifications, and not only banks but others who hold \npieces of mortgages as well. An RFC-like agency would receive equity \nand possibly secured debt from the banks in return for providing \ncapital or liquidity. The equity received by the Government would allow \nthe Government to share in any upside appreciation of the banks and \nminimize taxpayer costs in the process. The RFC would also get some \ndegree of oversight lending activities of banks it has invested in, and \nthe Government would come first. The Government would get repaid before \nothers in the financial chain.\n  I represent the State of New York where many of my constituents live \non Main Street and many work on Wall Street. Both are in dire trouble. \nWe have the largest city in the country, and we are the financial \ncapital of the world. We have upstate New York which would be the \nseventh or eighth largest State in the country. In addition, we have \nthe third largest rural population. Right now all are in trouble \nbecause in this complicated economy all are interrelated. We have a \nresponsibility to address the problems faced by both homeowners and \nfinancial markets. Attempts to solve only one side of the equation will \nnot get us out of this crisis. Without a comprehensive solution that \nhelps keep people in their homes, no amount of money advanced by Uncle \nSam will restore the fundamental strengths of the American economy.\n  Chairman Bernanke has said it over and over again: Until we solve the \nmortgage problem, we are not going to solve our economic or even our \nfinancial problem. But unless we also solve our financial problem, the \neconomy will not recover, and the housing problem will get worse. So we \nneed to do both. Those who say just do one or the other, for \nideological or policy reasons, will not come up with a solution. The \nsolution I have proposed does both, and it links the two. To those who \nsay the Government can't get involved in these institutions for no \ncost, we are making sure there actually is a cost, not only in the \nrepayment plan but in the fact that they will have to treat mortgages \ndifferently and help beleaguered homeowners. By doing that, they will \nhelp the economy.\n  To those who propose a plan of just helping the homeowner, worthy as \nthat is and as much as I have worked hard and believe in it, if our \nfinancial institutions and our financial lifeblood continues to be \nbrittle, frozen, and sparse, it will be far more difficult to solve the \nhomeowner problem because the economy will get worse, housing prices \nwill go down, and the cost and ability to keep mortgagors in their home \nwill be less.\n  This solution represents the best way to get us out of our financial \ncrisis in a comprehensive way. It should have appeal to those on both \nsides of the aisle. Most importantly, it is a solution that deals with \nthe entirety of the problem in a comprehensive way.\n  Given our economy hurtling southward, given the horrible stories we \nread in the newspapers every day about those who work on both Main and \nWall Streets hurting, we cannot afford not to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I understand we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, because of the hard work of Chairman \nBaucus of the Finance Committee, Senator Cantwell and several others, \nwe may--I say ``may'' and I will talk about that in a moment--have \nfinally secured a deal to extend the renewable energy tax credits and \nto temporarily fix the alternative minimum tax. If we can do this, it \nis a huge accomplishment that will generate hundreds of thousands of \nnew, green-collar jobs, stimulate the economy, improve our energy \nindependence, and lower energy costs for all Americans. And it cannot \ncome too quickly, as we heard from our distinguished colleague from New \nYork.\n  Unfortunately, in order for the Democrats to secure a deal to do \nthis, we had to agree to a bill that, in my opinion, is not as strong \nas previous versions of the bill. On eight separate occasions, our \nRepublican colleagues had the opportunity to keep the rapidly \ndeveloping wind and solar industries growing at an astonishing pace. \nBut, instead, they decided to play politics. Time after time, \nRepublicans filibustered and then voted to block consideration of \nproposals to extend critical tax credits for wind, solar, biomass, and \ngeothermal energy. So Democrats had to sit down with our colleagues \nfrom the other side of the aisle and work out a deal.\n  I have heard a lot recently about how Washington is broken and how \nthere needs to be a greater spirit of bipartisanship. I agree. But I \nwant the American people to understand that comes at a price. What is \noften overlooked is there is a price to be paid for that compromise. In \nthis instance, the price being paid is $8 billion over the next 5 years \nto big oil. In essence, at a time when financial markets are in \nturmoil, banks are failing, Americans are struggling to make ends meet, \nRepublicans have required a big oil bailout, a bailout for the most \nprofitable industry in history, at a time when they are beating their \nown record profits.\n  I also have concerns about some of the oil shale and tar sands \nprovisions of the bill in an environmental context. But on balance, \nbased upon the circumstances of where we are and what is possible, this \nbill will do a lot more good than harm.\n  Renewable energy is essential for our environment and our economy. \nBut renewable energy is, most importantly, the opportunity to produce \nmassive amounts of domestic, clean, cheap energy and generate hundreds \nof thousands of new jobs in doing so. Simply put, renewable energy is a \ncore solution to our energy woes and a massive business opportunity. \nDon't take my word for it. Just ask landowners in Texas or Minnesota or \nIowa or Wyoming who are receiving $3,000 to $5,000 per month for \nallowing a windmill to be sited on their property. Or ask oilman T. \nBoone Pickens who is plowing billions of dollars of his own money into \nwind energy, even though he made his money on oil and has a plan to use \nrenewables to end our addiction to oil.\n  Last year the United States installed enough wind turbines to power \nover 1.5 million homes, and the solar power industry is growing at over \n40 percent a year. In fact, over one-third of all additional electric \npower capacity that was added to the grid last year was from renewable \nsources. So despite claims by the Republican Presidential nominee, \nthese technologies work. They work now, and they are producing an \nenormous amount of energy.\n  They have done so in large part because of the leadership and \ninvestment by the Federal Government in incentivizing those renewable \nenergy industries. By extending the wind and solar tax credits so these \nindustries can continue their rapid growth, we could easily add 150 \ngigawatts of installed capacity within 10 years.\n  What does that mean? That is enough electricity to power over 37 \nmillion homes. By 2030, even if we do not pass additional policies to \ncreate a national grid or further incentivize distributed energy, we \ncould get well over 25 percent of our Nation's electricity from wind \nand solar power.\n  This tax package also has a very important provision to help us \ntransition from oil to renewable fuels. The bill\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\ncontains a large tax credit for the purchase of plug-in hybrid \nvehicles, cars such as the Chevy Volt which will be able to run solely \non electricity only for the first 40 miles after being plugged in.\n  If projections by some experts hold true and half the cars on the \nroad in the year 2030 are plug-in hybrids, we could easily cut our use \nof oil by one-third or more. By this time we would be producing enough \nrenewable energy to power all of these cars and still have electricity \nto spare. If we want cheap gasoline, to be free from imported oil, \ncreate hundreds of thousands of new jobs, then we need to pass this tax \ncredit extension. It is that simple.\n  I am relieved in one sense that my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have finally come to the table to let us vote on something \nthat will actually produce energy, but I am concerned that there are \nstill those objecting to us proceeding. This fall, voters, however, are \nnot going to forget that the price the Republican Party has forced on \nthe American people in order to get to these renewable energy sources \nis to continue $8 billion in subsidies for big oil. When the American \nvoters see that, they are going to have a much different view of what \nthey do in these elections, and we will see a very different Federal \nGovernment come January.\n  I also want to address another essential piece of the tax extenders \nprogram, and that is the temporary fix of the alternative minimum tax. \nNew Jersey's hard-working families deserve real tax relief. More than \n70 percent of the President's tax cuts have gone to people making over \n$200,000, while families who earn anywhere between $50,000 and $75,000 \nhave received less than 5 percent of those cuts. Yet the President has \ndone nothing to make the AMT exemption permanent, a tax which, in the \nnext 4 years, would affect nearly every family of four earning between \n$75,000 and $100,000 if nothing is done.\n\n  The President has directed all his efforts, priorities, and the \nNation's bank account to tax breaks for the wealthiest, leaving little \nroom, let alone money, for the reforms that will affect nearly 24 \nmillion middle-class families.\n  When Americans wonder why there has been little attention on what \nmost tax analysts refer to as the ``single most important tax issue'' \nfacing the Nation, they should know that it is because tax cuts for the \nmiddle class have clearly not been a priority of this administration.\n  I am glad we are moving in this Democratic majority in a different \nway. The fact is that, without this bill, middle-class families will be \nfaced with a harsh reality at the end of the year. In my State of New \nJersey, where roughly 270,000 families were subjected to the \nalternative minimum tax in 2006, the number of middle-class taxpayers \nsubject to this tax would explode if no fix is enacted. Average \nfamilies, who are far from wealthy, could face significantly higher \ntaxes this year if we do not act on the crisis at hand. This fix makes \nvery clear that our priority should be to protect middle-class families \nfrom an unintentional tax hike, and that millions of taxpayers should \nnot wake up next tax season to realize they owe more in taxes even \nthough their income has not changed.\n  Let's remember, this was a tax intended to ensure that those making \nover $200,000 a year were not able to game the system and avoid paying \nany taxes toward the common good at all. It was never intended to raise \nthe taxes of average Americans.\n  So let's send a clear message that the values we embrace are the \nvalues of helping American families. Let's embrace fairness and equal \ntreatment for those who are working hard. We can do that in this bill.\n  Finally, let me thank again Chairman Baucus and others for their hard \nwork in crafting this legislation to extend the renewable energy tax \ncredits and to temporarily fix the alternative minimum tax.\n  But I do urge my colleagues who are objecting to bringing up this \nlegislation to drop their objections. You cannot expect more for oil \nthan even what you have gotten in this bill. These are obstacles the \nAmerican people clearly cannot afford at this time, that this country \ncannot afford at this time in one of the worst financial times.\n  This will be one part of a solution to move us in a direction that \ncreates jobs, that can stimulate our economy, that can break our \ndependency on oil, that can do something about our environment and, at \nthe same time--and, at the same time--ensure that we give relief to \nmiddle-class families through that relief in the alternative minimum \ntax.\n  I hope if, in fact, we can get through our colleagues' objections--\nthe majority leader has tried to bring up this bill already--if we are \nable to do so, we can send a message as this week comes to a close that \nthe Senate is finally on the way to giving relief to American families \nin a real, meaningful way, and as people are losing their jobs in this \neconomy, we can be at the threshold of creating a new generation of \njobs in which people will be able to prosper and the Nation will be \nable to meet its energy needs for the future.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, there is extraordinary economic hurt in \nmuch of rural America this evening, and that is especially the case in \nmy part of our country in rural Oregon. We are going to have a chance \nto do something about that with the tax extenders legislation. I come \nto the floor today to urge its passage.\n  A number of colleagues have been wondering about the folks in green \nshirts who are out and about on Capitol Hill this week. These are some \nof the country's best people committed to making this country a better \nplace, and they are here because they come from communities where the \nFederal Government owns much of the land and the Federal Government, \nregrettably, has been talking about breaking its commitment to these \ncommunities.\n  About 100 years ago, the Federal Government entered into an agreement \nwith these communities. In effect, the Federal Government said: When \nthe National Forest System is created, so it benefits people across the \ncountry--in Minnesota, in New York, in Florida, and all across the \nland--because we are going to have property owned by the Federal \nGovernment, we will assist those communities with funds for schools and \nessential services.\n  That worked for a number of years when the timber cut was fairly high \nand we were able to get the funds those communities needed for \nessential services. However, when the laws began to change in the 1990s \nand timber cut went down, all of a sudden those communities were hard-\npressed to keep the schools open in my part of the country and to make \nsure there was essential law enforcement service--on the beat fighting \nmethamphetamines and providing key services on our Federal lands. So in \n2000, I authored a law with our friend and colleague, Senator Craig, \nand brought those communities money for schools, money for essential \nservices, but regrettably, that money has run out. As the revenues and \nbenefits that we receive from our national forests change with the \ntimes, Congress simply can't walk away from its responsibility to \nprovide funding to rural counties.\n  Now, because of the good work particularly of Chairman Baucus and \nSenator Grassley, there will be an opportunity to renew our commitment \nto these rural communities and to do it in a way that is going to allow \nthese communities, after a few additional years, to get into additional \nopportunities for economic growth and creating good-paying jobs for \ntheir citizens. For example, I have said that if we pass this \nlegislation--and it authorizes $3.8 billion in desperately needed funds \nfor rural schools and essential services--we are going to use those 4 \nyears so that at the end of that period, our rural communities can be \ninvolved in a number of other economic development activities that will \nallow their communities to prosper. For example, we\n\n[[Page S8995]]\n\nknow that in our part of the country--and this has been true in much of \nthe land where there is great risk of fire--there is a need to thin \nsome of these forests. In our part of the country, it is second growth. \nIt may be different in the Midwest and Minnesota and other parts of the \nland.\n  But the point is, they are working together--people in the forest \nproduct sector, environmental leaders, scientists, and others--they are \ncoming together and over the next 4 years will act in a fashion that \nwill allow us to say that, on our watch, by making sure we acted today \nso these communities could survive, we used this period so that they \ncould get into additional opportunities that would allow their \ncommunities to prosper and provide good-paying jobs for their people.\n  Right now, pink slips have been sent out to county workers, teachers, \nand others, and without the action that has been achieved in the \nextenders legislation on a bipartisan basis, led by Chairman Baucus and \nSenator Grassley, without their work becoming law, it is my view that \nthe very fabric of rural communities in our part of the country and \nover much of the United States will be torn asunder.\n  A number of colleagues have worked hard on this legislation, and that \nis because this 100-year commitment we have had with rural America has \nalways been bipartisan. The fact is, Americans who enjoy the National \nForest System don't come to the forest and get asked whether they are \nDemocrats or Republicans. It has been something that has been \nbeneficial to our Nation, and in return, we said that our rural \ncommunities would be given the funds they need for essential services. \nThe fact is, in much of the country where there is not Federal land, \nwhere there is not land in Federal ownership, they sell private \nproperty, they tax private property, they generate revenue, and they \npay for essential services. That is what is different about my home \nState where the Federal Government owns much of the land. We haven't \nbeen able to do that.\n  I see my friend and colleague on the floor, Senator Craig. We worked \ntogether to update our commitment to rural America back in 2000. We put \nin place, for example, resource advisory councils--and Senator Craig \nremembers this well--that brought together people in the forest product \nsector and environmental leaders. Several of them said: What you were \nable to do with Senator Craig has people working together in the \nnatural resources field who never worked together before.\n  So this has been a program that has worked. We have tried to extend \nit on a multiyear basis. I offered legislation previously with Senator \nCraig. We got 74 votes. An overwhelming majority of the Senate \nsupported this legislation. Yet we were not able to get it enacted into \nlaw.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nWyden, for the work he has continually done on behalf of timber-\ndependent school districts and this uniqueness that Western States have \nthat have these large portfolios of public land and have grown \nincreasingly dependent upon the action taken by the Federal Government \nand the reaction in the States and the impact on the economy of local \ncommunities. When he and I stood together and worked out Wyden-Craig, \nCraig-Wyden and worked with our timber-dependent school districts and \ngot it funded, we solved a very big problem.\n  The advisory committees the Senator speaks to were in themselves a \nphenomenon in the sense that after 2,300 decisions by those groups to \ndo activities on public lands, and not one of them objected to by an \ninterest group or a suit filed to stop them, Senator Wyden and I grew \nconvinced that we could work together to resolve our public land issues \nwhen we put determination and resource behind them, and that is what we \ndid.\n  I thank Senator Wyden very much for staying with this. It is my \nunderstanding that in the tax extenders package we will consider this \ncoming week, we will see a reauthorization of Wyden-Craig that will get \nthis work done, send a message back to our school districts and our \ncounties that we are here to help, to assist, and to stabilize the very \ndire economic conditions those school districts and counties are \nexperiencing. I thank Senator Wyden for sticking to it and with it \nbecause it is that kind of resolve that may solve this substantial \nproblem.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I don't want to turn this into a bouquet-\ntossing contest, but the fact is that Senator Craig and I have been \npartners in this for some time. We believed we had a good model when we \nmoved to pass it during the Clinton years in 2000. It has exceeded our \nexpectations in terms of bringing people together and helping these \nrural communities survive.\n  I simply say to colleagues that as part of this tax extenders \npackage, by extending the program now through 2011, the legislation \nwould give rural communities the certainty they need to plan for the \nfuture and get them off this roller coaster of disaster one day, hope \nthe next, that has been the pattern of the last few years.\n  There are a lot of exciting things going on in the rural West. My \nfriend from Idaho and I, as we sat on the Forestry Subcommittee, have \nheard the exciting developments, for example, in projects to thin and \nrestore the Nation's forests, have heard about the good work that is \nbeing done in terms of biomass, taking essentially woody waste and \nturning it into a source of clean fuel. We have been working together \nto make sure the Federal Government gets the right definition of \nbiomass so that we can allow these programs to go forward. Carbon \nsequestration would be a third opportunity that we know will be a \nsensible step because it will help improve the climate and create \neconomic revenue.\n  So as Senator Craig and I sat and listened to this testimony all of \nthese many hours about thinning and biomass and carbon sequestration, \nit became clear to us that as long as our rural communities weren't \ndenied the funds they needed to keep going, which is what we are \ntalking about today, they could use these next 4 years to get into some \nvery exciting and promising fields in the years ahead.\n  Madam President, I am very pleased that my friend from Idaho has come \nto the floor, and I know I have exceeded my time for morning business. \nI simply say to my colleagues that I hope they will pass the extenders \npackage. The funds involved are for secure rural schools, and it is \ncritically needed now so they can use this time to make sure young \npeople, law enforcement, and other essential needs are addressed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I understand that Senator Akaka is en \nroute to the floor to speak and possibly put forth a unanimous consent \nrequest. He is entering the Chamber now. I know he has time for that \nconsideration. I will not speak as in morning business, but I will \nclose by saying I thank my colleague from Oregon.\n  The years we have worked together have become a very valuable \npartnership for the benefit of public land States and for us to \nrecognize the changing world in which we live in these States. But the \ndemand is still on the communities. No matter how the use of public \nland--or how we apply policy to public land changes, we still have to \nmaintain roads, bridges, and schools if there is going to be vitality \nin a community that can support new economic opportunity in the coming \nyears. That is what the Senator has so eloquently spoken to. We both \nrecognized that, and we used the Public Land Subcommittee of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, which I chaired and which he now \nchairs, as that link and partnership to accomplish a great deal of \nthis. I thank him for that work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S8996-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8996]]\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1315\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and I will \nobject because of my concern of the way the given legislation is being \nhandled--this is an issue on which the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee and I have had some difference.

Madam President, of course, I am very disappointed that an \nobjection has been made to this unanimous consent request. The intent \nof the request is to create a means by which there might be further \naction on this very important veterans legislation before the Congress \nrecesses next week.\n  On April 24, 2008, the Senate passed S. 1315, the Veterans' Benefits \nEnhancement Act of 2007, by a vote of 96-1. Since that time, the bill \nhas languished in the House.\n  This bill would improve benefits and services for veterans, both \nyoung and old. It includes numerous enhancements to a broad range of \nveterans' benefits, including life insurance programs for disabled \nveterans, traumatic injury coverage for active duty servicemembers, \nautomobile and adaptive equipment benefits for individuals with severe \nburn injuries. In addition, the bill includes a provision that would \ncorrect an injustice done to World War II Filipino veterans over 60 \nyears ago. It grants recognition and full veterans status to all of \nthese individuals, both those living inside and outside the United \nStates.\n  In order to cover the costs of S. 1315, the bill would overturn a \ncourt decision in a case known as Hartness. That decision allowed for \ncertain veterans to receive an extra pension benefit based solely on \ntheir age, a result never intended by Congress. The purpose of the \nprovision in S. 1315 is simply to restore the clear intent of Congress, \nbut some have mischaracterized it as an attempt to withdraw benefits \nfrom deserving veterans and grant them to undeserving veterans. This \nmisconception is the main reason that action on S. 1315 has been held \nup.\n  I am not interested today in debating the merits of the bill--either \nthe increased benefits or the revenue provisions--but rather ask that \nthe Senator or Senators who object to the request to set up a \nconference with the House--advise me of their concerns to see if it \nmight be possible to find a way forward. I am very committed to this \nveterans' benefit legislation and would like to see if we can reach \nfinal action before the end of next week. If we are not able to do so, \nI intend to renew my efforts in the next Congress.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to return to the issue which has \nbeen the topic of the day--and should be, obviously--and that is the \nstress on the financial systems in the United States.\n  Earlier in the day, I asked why we couldn't have an adult discussion \nof this subject rather than a lot of hyperbole and partisanship. I \ndoubt it was my comments that energized it. In any event, the Senator \nfrom New York, Mr. Schumer, did come down and make a couple of points \non how he thought we could proceed. I wish to comment on those specific \npoints and elaborate a little bit.\n  First off, the term ``Resolution Trust Corporation'' has been thrown \naround a great deal. I am, as I mentioned earlier today, rather \nfamiliar with that term because I was Governor of the State of New \nHampshire at the time that we had the real estate meltdown in the \nNortheast and the Resolution Trust Corporation came in, as well as the \nFDIC under Chairman Seidman. Chairman Seidman did an extraordinary job, \nby the way, for us. We had to reorganize our banking system. The assets \nfell into the hands of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which then \nproceeded to dispose of those assets which basically had caused the \nbanking system to fail in the Northeast and earlier in the Texas area.\n  I think that vehicle was appropriate to that time. I think what we \nare hearing today in the term ``resolution trust'' is the concept, not \nthe specifics of that vehicle. Thus, when Senator Schumer said it was \ninappropriate for Senator McCain to throw out the concept of resolution \ntrust as an approach to addressing this extraordinarily critical \nmatter, I think he may--I don't know, I can't speak for Senator \nMcCain--I suspect Senator McCain's purpose was to talk about the \nconcept of a government entity, such as the resolution trust, which \ncomes in and basically relieves the pressure on the financial markets \nby creating value under assets which nobody at the present time can \nvalue. That is what we need. That is exactly what we need.\n  I would not dismiss the idea out of hand. I would simply say it is a \nterm of art now versus a specific structure, and the term of art is \nessentially stating that the Federal Government does have a role \npotentially of coming in and putting value on assets which cannot be \nvalued by the market and which are locked down and which have caused \nthe whole credit market in the Nation to freeze down.\n  That is what has happened today, of course, in these mortgage-backed \nsecurities. Nobody knows the value of the security underlying the \nmortgage-backed security and, therefore, it is impossible to sell them \nand, therefore, the fluidity of the economy has been disrupted and, in \nfact, we are seeing a freezing of the economy as these securities hold \nin place instead of being traded.\n  What has been suggested, and actually, interestingly enough, appears \nto be the suggestion of the Senator from New York, is we create some \nsort of structure which allows the Federal Government to step in and \nessentially put value underneath these mortgage-backed securities by \nusing the good faith and credit of the American taxpayer to essentially \nset a price for those. He suggested a couple ways of doing this. Let me \ncomment on those suggestions because I think they are worth commenting \non.\n  First, as the price of doing this, he suggests we should change the \nbankruptcy laws, a proposal debated here at some length earlier in the \nyear, so bankruptcy courts would have the right to write down mortgages \nin bankruptcy. That is an appealing idea on its face because most of \nthese mortgages are going to be written down anyway. But the issue \nbecomes, what is the cost\n\n[[Page S8997]]\n\nof that on the marketplace. If the mortgage underwriter knows there is \na potential that the mortgagee may file bankruptcy and that mortgage \nmay be adjusted significantly in bankruptcy, then the cost of that \nmortgage is going to go up and go up a lot because it is going to have \nto cover the premium and some actuarial estimate of how many mortgages \nmight end up in bankruptcy, might end up being written down.\n  As we know, bankruptcy doesn't deal with secured assets such as a \nmortgage in the sense it doesn't write them down. The secured assets \ncome first. This proposal has its upside from a standpoint of being \nattractive to a way of getting these mortgages performing again. But it \nhas the downside of probably creating a much higher price for mortgages \nin the marketplace in the initial offerings.\n  Of course, what we want to do is make mortgages more readily \navailable in a sound and reasonable way, not in a speculative way, the \nway they were in the last few years under the subprime system.\n  There may be a way to do this. I wouldn't close the door to it. I \nsimply say, in looking at this, we have to be realistic and recognize \nthat the cost of writing mortgages in this way will go up, and there \nmay be a way to keep that price from being excessive by limiting the \navailability of that option. So I am willing--not that it is my role, \nbut I would certainly think it is something to look at.\n  The second idea the Senator suggested was that we allow the Federal \nGovernment to basically buy into troubled banks and get what I presume \nwould be equity back by creating a new entity, a new agency to do that.\n  That is also an interesting idea, and I respect the fact he brought \nthat idea forward. I suggest that is a long, complicated exercise, \nhowever, and we are not in a period where we have a whole lot of time. \nWhat we need is something that is going to make sense soon and give us \nsome fluidity in the marketplace reasonably quickly.\n  Probably the only way we are going to accomplish that is to pursue a \ncourse of the Federal Government injecting itself into the process by \npurchasing mortgage-backed securities in some manner, maybe through one \nof the agencies we have already gotten possession of--Freddie Mac, \nFannie Mae, or one of our other agencies--and taking them off the books \nof these entities and reselling them in some way that recoups value to \nthe taxpayer. That gets liquidity into the process, and it hopefully \ngets a stability into the pricing mechanism for these mortgage-backed \nsecurities which are at the core of our problem.\n  Honestly, if we had done this or taken this type of route with \nstimulus 1, where we used $160 billion, we probably could have abated \nthis entire problem or at least muted it significantly because that is \na lot of money, $160 billion. If we had not handed it out in $600 \nincrements to everybody to be spent to buy a television made in China \nso the Chinese benefited from it--we didn't benefit from it--instead, \nif we had put it on the problem, which is the mortgage issue and the \nfact there was a lot of debt nonperforming and where you couldn't \nascertain the value and use it to settle out that part of our economy, \nwe might have made great strides earlier, and we might not be where we \nare today, which is in such dire straits.\n  I think it is good at least that the topic has been opened, and I \ncongratulate Senator McCain for being willing to stick his toe into \nthis rather choppy water and do it in a way that isn't in the tradition \nof what one would call classic conservative politics. He is basically \nsuggesting we might need to look at a major initiative through the \nGovernment to stabilize the situation. That is a departure. He should \nbe congratulated for being strong enough, creative enough, and mature \nenough to be willing to step into that direction.\n  I wish, quite honestly, Senator Obama was saying something similar. \nSenator Obama continues to talk, unfortunately, in hyperbole on this \nissue, sort of out here on some other planet, relative to the reality \nof the on-the-ground problem. At least Senator McCain is talking about \nthe problem in a mature, substantive way. Obviously, the ideas haven't \ntotally evolved or developed yet, but he is opening a dialog that I \nthink is very constructive to the question of how we get to a solution, \nas Senator Schumer, quite honestly, did in his proposal.\n  As I said, I have outlined what I think is the point to begin the \ndialog. This may all be moot anyway because there is significant rumor \nthat the Treasury and the Fed are moving much faster than the Congress, \nwhich should not be a surprise, which they usually do. That is why we \nhave them. The Treasury did a good job, in my opinion, on Freddie Mac \nand Fannie Mae, and the Fed did the right thing with AIG.\n\n  Another issue that has been raised, however, that is giving us some \nproblems is the short-selling issue. There has been a lot of discussion \nabout short selling, how it has been predatory and inappropriate. It is \ntrue. There is no question but that naked short selling is a serious \nproblem. I congratulate the SEC for pursuing aggressive rules on the \nequity side of naked short selling so people have to cover what they \nare doing.\n  But when you do an event on short selling on the equity side, it \nopens short selling on the debt side. If a short seller thinks a \ncompany is a target and they are going to go after that company, a \nperson who is approaching this from a very predatory approach on the \nequity side and the equity side is shut down by the SEC or, more \nimportantly, by financial houses, with the British action which \nbasically bars short selling from financial houses until the beginning \nof next year, then that short seller is probably going to move over to \nthe debt side.\n  Spreads jump dramatically, and the practical effect of that is it \nbecomes virtually impossible for people to borrow money because the \nspreads are so high, and that is an equally contracting event. It makes \ncommercial paper very hard to move.\n  I do hope that as we look at the short-selling issue, we not only \nlook at the equity side but we also look at the debt side. In that \narena, there are a lot of different ideas that have been suggested. One \nthat I heard is that you should--and I don't know that this works, but \nI think it is worth throwing out--is that you have to look at the \ncredit default swap arena and have more transparency so people know \nwhat the risks are and they know what the value is and they know what \nis going on in this arena.\n  That can be done through creating some sort of clearinghouse along \nthe lines of what we do with S futures. That has been a suggestion. \nMaybe that is the way to go.\n  In any event, we cannot fix half of this equation, in my opinion, and \nexpect the markets to not adjust in a way that actually continues the \nretardation of the markets or the retardation of the economy because of \nthe lack of transparency on the debt side as to who owns what and what \nthe spreads are. Not the transparency on the spreads but the fact that \npeople are not going to be able to get commercial paper because the \nspreads will be too high as a result of the short selling.\n  I am not talking about eliminating it. I am not even talking about \nchilling. I am talking about making it more transparent, and that I \nthink will be very helpful.\n  In any event, it seems to me at least we are getting some good and \npositive discussion on these issues around here, which is a change, and \nhopefully we can continue on this track. It may be that the Congress \nwill be out of session before anything can be done, and that may \nactually be good, too, if we don't have anything good to do. But as a \npractical matter, I think we have to maintain our flexibility as a \ngovernment, and we have to be willing to support those who are trying \nhard in this area to try to get our markets back operating at some \nlevel of normalcy, specifically the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nChairman of the Fed. And we should not try to hyperbolize this issue \nand create an atmosphere where the well of opportunity to look at \nthings that are different and creative, maybe outside the tradition of \nthe ideology of one side or the other, is poisoned by excessive \npartisan discussion.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8998]]\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, we have some startling new figures \nabout how difficult it has become for the middle class to get by. We \nnow have some new numbers, through the Joint Economic Committee and the \nwork of Professor Elizabeth Warren, that in fact the average middle-\nclass family has lost about $2,000 in wages, $2,000 per year, for the \nlast 8 years, and the expenses have now gone up about $4,400 per year. \nThat is a net loss of $6,400 per year. And with family childcare, you \nadd an additional $1,500 per year. This is how much more expensive it \nwas than 8 years ago.\n  So we are seeing more and more families in debt, more and more \nfamilies having trouble getting by due to the failed economic policies \nof this administration, and as we have seen from the events of the past \nweek, the country is facing an enormous financial crisis, probably the \nlargest we have seen since the Great Depression.\n  Although the administration is still wary to admit this is a \nrecession, we have seen time and time again over the last 8 months more \nand more jobs lost. Many institutions--some that have been on Wall \nStreet for decades, some for a century--are finding themselves in the \nsame position as many families were when their house was foreclosed on, \nwith nowhere to go, and secretaries with nothing to their name. People \nhad their retirement money in stock in the company. They were depending \non that stock for their future but now have nothing to their name. This \nweek we saw things take an even greater turn for the worse.\n  When Chairman Bernanke was in front of the Joint Economic Committee \nback in April, days after the Bear Stearns buyout, there was some talk \nthat maybe that would stabilize things. But Wall Street was simply in \ndenial. When you look at this past decade, Mr. President, you can see \nit was a decade of greed, a decade of risk, and there wasn't much fear \nin how those deals were made--jumbo mortgages, securities with no \nbacking. Too much, too much, too much.\n  Look at IndyMac in California, and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman \nBrothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG, and all of these firms that insisted they \nwere solvent, until the eleventh hour. That practice put everyone's \nsavings at risk.\n  Next week, in our Joint Economic Committee, we are going to be \nhearing from Chairman Bernanke and discussing exactly where we go from \nhere. I believe in this country. I believe we will move forward. But I \ncan tell you lax regulation, decaying agencies, and some of the people \nwho were put in charge of them have led us to where we are today.\n  I saw it firsthand on the Commerce Committee with the Consumer \nProtection Agency, a shadow of its former self, with 50 percent fewer \nemployees than it had during the Reagan era. Big surprise when these \ntoxic toys started coming in from places such as China. There was no \none there to mind the store. There was one guy named Bob in a back \nroom.\n  When you look at these mortgage instruments, there was no one \nwatching over them, no one to enforce the rules. As a former \nprosecutor, I know you can have all the laws on the books, but if you \ndon't have people enforcing them and people who are committed to the \npurpose of making sure that regular people are protected in this \neconomy, it is not going to matter what laws are on the books.\n  We also had rampant change in some of our regulations--the Enron \nloophole. We had the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nbefore a joint meeting with our Agriculture Committee, and I asked him \nif he didn't want some more tools in his arsenal so he could maybe look \nat what is going on with these trades and the speculation going on with \nforeign countries. Even if you don't want to use them, I asked him: \nDon't you want those tools we can give to you? As a prosecutor, I \nfigured I wouldn't use every law that was on the books, but I always \nwanted more tools to look at things.\n  He said: No, we are fine the way we are. It was that attitude, Mr. \nPresident, that got us where we are today. So we are going to have to \nchange things in this country. We are going to have to get some \nbalance. I believe in vigorous entrepreneurship. My State is home to \nnine Fortune 500 companies and many thriving small businesses. We \nbelieve in entrepreneurship in our State, but we also believe there \nmust be a balance and there must be fairness and somebody minding the \nstore. And that has been lacking over the last 8 years.\n  We do have an opportunity as we look at how we are going to get this \neconomy moving. I mentioned there was so much greed and not enough fear \nin the last 8 years. Well, now we stand on the precipice of where we \ndon't have too much fear, but we want to move forward as an economy, \nand there is one thing we know we can do immediately in the next few \ndays. We can make sure the incentives are in place to keep moving \nforward with this new green economy to compete with other countries and \nhave the right incentives in place.\n  I am talking about the extenders for renewable energy that have \nreally led to a boom in my State. We are third in the country with wind \nenergy. Southwestern Minnesota is home to hundreds of large-scale wind \nturbines, helping to make us a leader in wind power. Along with \nbiofuels, these wind energy farms have spurred a rural economic \nrenaissance in that part of our State.\n  Let me give a few examples of this and examples of hope for this \neconomy as we go forward and how we can put incentives in place so we \ncan keep going.\n  I see my friend from Kansas across the aisle, and I know he has a \npicture of a wind turbine in his front office. We know there is a \nfuture for this country with development in this area.\n  In 1995--and this is just an example from Minnesota--SMI & \nHydraulics, Inc. began their business in Porter, MN, primarily as a \nwelding and cylinder repair shop for the local farmers and businesses. \nToday, SMI & Hydraulics, which manufactures the bases for the wind \ntowers we see all across this country, just recently expanded a \nfacility to 100,000 square feet and created over 100 new jobs in just \nthis little town. It is a barn with these big wind bases that actually \ncome out of it. It is an amazing success story.\n  Last year, the renewable electricity sector pumped more than $20 \nbillion into the U.S. economy, generating tens of thousands of jobs in \nconstruction, transportation, and manufacturing. Throughout the \ncountry, renewable energy has led us down a path toward new jobs, lower \nenergy bills, and enhanced economic development. We need to move this \ncountry forward.\n  For me, and the State of Minnesota and so many other areas across \nthis country, the protection tax credit is critical to realizing this \ngoal. The protection tax credit, in combination with strong State \nrenewable electricity standards, has been a major driver of wind power \ndevelopment in Minnesota. That is why I was so concerned we might \nactually lose it. All the studies show if you let it go, about 8 months \nbefore it is forecasted to go off, you have an enormous drop in \ninvestment, and that is exactly what we don't need now in this country. \nWe need a plan to go forward.\n  I personally would like to see it go into effect for 3, 4, or 5 \nyears. I have a bill with Senators Snowe and Cantwell to put it in \nplace for 5 years. But if all we can agree on today is to extend it for \nanother 1 year for wind, solar, geothermal, and all kinds of renewable \nproducts and wasted energy, that is what we should be doing. But I will \ntry. We are working on a bipartisan basis with a group of Senators to \nextend it for at least 3 years for renewable fuel sources. Because as \nwe struggle with this economy we know, as we say in Minnesota, the \napproach is not just going to be a silver bullet, it is going to be \nsilver buckshot. It is going to involve all kinds of energy production, \nincreased energy production. But it is also going to involve looking at \nthings in a new way. That has been lacking so much, this long-term look \nat our economy while other countries have leapfrogged us. While we \ndeveloped the technology for wind and solar, we have been leapfrogged \nby other countries. Anyone who watched the Olympics in China knows what \nwe are up against on the world stage for competition. They saw not only \nthe athletes from all over the world but they\n\n[[Page S8999]]\n\nsaw the precision with which the Chinese were able to pull off that \nopening ceremony in those Olympics.\n\n  We have to get our act together. We have to get our act together for \nour economy and be sensible and not look at 1-day solutions and 1-day \nspins. We have to have a plan for this economy, and this is a start, \nbut we also have to have some balance in our regulatory system so our \neconomy can function and our businesses can function as they were meant \nto.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Minnesota. I \nhave a map that shows the wind energy capital of the world, the Saudi \nArabia of wind, right in the middle of our country. I have a nice \ncorner here in Minnesota with some good wind power. We have a lot right \nhere in the middle of the country in Kansas and we want to harvest it. \nI am delighted to see that the wind energy piece in the production tax \ncredits is in the bill, the tax extenders bill. That is what I wanted \nto come to the floor, because it is critical to the investment taking \nplace for wind power generation. We are doing that in this particular \nbill.\n  I, as well as my colleague from Minnesota, wish to see these \nproduction tax credits extended for a series of years rather than one; \nplanning that arrives in a 3 to 5-year window would give a lot better \nopportunity for capital to come into the business. I think this is a \ncritical piece we have to get done.\n  I met with my Kansas wind energy associates yesterday, people putting \nin these units on a big scale, and small scale. They are saying we need \nto have these credits in place.\n  I was at Pratt Community College about a month ago. They have put in \nthree midsize wind turbines that are cutting down the community \ncollege's electric bill about $1,000 a week. They are looking at it and \nsaying this credit is a great one, it has a nice payoff. It is right in \nthis zone where we have high wind electric generation. It is working \nand working well.\n  I do note for my colleagues, on this particular issue you cannot rob \nPeter to pay Paul. This is the sort of thing where you have to do all \nthe energy issues. You can't punish one or another. We need all of it. \nWe have said that for some period of time. I hope we would start to do \nthat.\n  The unfortunate piece of the tax extenders is the pay-for provision \nof it, where it is going at the refining capacity in the United States. \nI do not think that is wise at all. I want to cover this briefly here.\n  Of the $17 billion energy portion of this tax package, that is being \npaid for mostly by tax incentive freezes and adjustments to other \nsectors of the energy industry, primarily the refining sector. That is \nnot where we should go. We need more refining capacity, not less. It is \nnot the sort of thing that we should rob from one piece of the energy \npie and sector to put it in another one. That is not the way to go \nforward on this. It is to grow the entire energy piece.\n  This bill will alter current law and freeze a manufacturing tax \ndeduction at 6 percent instead of the current law, which would raise it \nto 9 percent by 2010 for the sale and exchange of oil, natural gas, or \nprimary refined products. This is something that was going to be used \nby refineries to expand refining capacity and was going to provide a \ntax deduction from 6 to 9 percent. That is a good incentive. It will \nsee the refining industry that is important to my State as well that is \nlooked at, a refining industry that has been punished by Hurricane Ike, \nin rebuilding, to use that money to encourage more refining capacity in \nthe United States. We need to do it rather than to tax it.\n  That is why I urge, when we look at these in the future, we do not \npunish one piece of the energy sector to pay for another one. I support \nwind power generation. It is key and critical. I am very supportive of \nthe wind package in here. I want to make sure that we do all in the \nenergy field because we need all of it in the energy field. We do not \nwant to continue sending $500 billion overseas every year for oil. Much \nof that goes to countries that do not like us. We need to be able to do \nmore of the production and the refining here in the U.S., and the \ncurrent state of the technology will allow us to do it.\n  We have somewhere between 10 and 18 billion barrels of oil available \nunder 2,000 acres in ANWR, along with another 45 billion barrels \navailable in the offshore and deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico. \nUnfortunately, many of those proposals, we are not going to be able to \nvote on here. We need to be able to get at that oil and we need to be \nable to get at the oil shale production in the western United States--\nin Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado.\n  I note to my colleagues, we need to do all of it. On this side of the \naisle I think they will find support for all of it, but not to pick \npieces of it.\n  There is another thing I want to point out, and I don't have the map \nhere, but I think it is illustrated by the map I do have here. We have \na lot of electric wind power capacity generation, given the strength of \nwind we have in our State. But we need to be able to move that to \nmarkets; we need to be able to move it to markets in my State but also \nbe able to move it across State lines as well to be able to take \nadvantage of this energy production. To do that you need backbone lines \nto be able to move it.\n  A lot of times you are going to need that wind to mix with, whether \nit is natural gas electric production, coal or nuclear production. We \nneed to expand those so you have the base load there to build the wind \nenergy into, to have the pipelines of electricity to move it to various \nplaces in the market throughout the country.\n  We need a 21st century grid. That is going to require not just wind \nbeing harnessed to it but also the base power being generated for times \nin the season and places where wind is not blowing, to be able to move \nit. I urge my colleagues to look at this as the total package. That is \nhow we move this forward and how we balance the three E's of energy, \nenvironment, and the economy. It is all of them working together to get \nus a more stable economy, having more of this energy production here at \nhome and having a better environment in the process. It is not just \nthrowing any of these out in the process to get that done.\n  I hope in a new Congress, when we can look at these things, and in a \nnew administration, I hope we can look at these things together and \nwork them all in together, balancing those three E's to move the \ncountry forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in the last 18 or 19, 20 months since I \nhave been a Member of the Senate, joined by my friend from Rhode \nIsland, I have held, around my State, about 115 or so roundtables in \nmost of Ohio, all of Ohio's 88 counties, from Mahoning County to \nAshtabula to Williams County, from the southeast to the southwest, all \nover the State, listening to groups of 15 to 20 people for an hour and \na half or so tell me about their hopes and their dreams and what we can \ndo to build their communities and help strengthen the middle class in \nthe State.\n  I hear regularly, in more emphatic terms almost every month, about \nthe anxiety facing our State's middle-class families. They can be as \nrural as Fulton County or Highland County, they can be as urban as \nCuyahoga or Franklin or Hamilton County, or they can be in between, \nplaces such as Mansfield and Lima and Zanesville and Chillicothe and \nPortsmouth. I hear people in Ohio who work hard, who play by the rules, \nand they are watching too many of their jobs or their neighbors' jobs \nmove overseas. They are seeing their own health care and energy costs \nsoar. In far too many cases, even in unionized plants, they are seeing \ntheir pensions disappear.\n  I hear this sense of betrayal. People understand--intuitively \nunderstand--that in most of the last 8 years, especially up until last \nyear but even so,\n\n[[Page S9000]]\n\nstill, how they feel this Government has betrayed the middle class. \nWhen President Bush had control of the House and Senate, with the \nRepublican majority in the House and Republican control of the Senate \nand Bush and Cheney in the White House, they saw the drug companies \nwriting the Medicare laws; they saw the insurance industry dictating \nhealth care policies; they saw the oil industry ramming through energy \nlegislation; they saw Wall Street pushing these job-killing trade \nagreements through the House and through the Senate. They understand, \nagain intuitively, that the Bush-Cheney-McCain ideology that markets \ncan always police themselves is bankrupt.\n  Every year of the Bush administration and every year of Republican \ncontrol of the House and Senate, we heard this mantra, this \nconservative orthodoxy that markets always do the right things; that \nmarkets can police themselves; that any regulation is evil; just open \nour country, no reason for environmental rules, no reason for worker \nsafety rules, no reason for rules, period, governing financial \ninstitutions.\n  Let's take one issue. Imagine if George Bush and Dick Cheney and John \nMcCain had gotten their way 3 years ago, in January 2005--I believe \nJanuary or February. President Bush and John McCain and Dick Cheney \nauthored their scheme, their legislation--call it legislation--to \nprivatize Social Security. This risky, reckless privatization scheme \nthey were trying to push through Congress met incredible opposition, \nnot just from Democrats in Congress--because we believe strongly in a \nSocial Security that works, not one that is privatized, that Wall \nStreet gets its hands on--but the American people spoke resoundingly, \nloudly, clearly that they did not want this Social Security \nprivatization.\n  But go back. Imagine if the voters of Rhode Island or the voters of \nmy State of Ohio--if George Bush and John McCain had gotten their way 3 \nyears ago with that risky scheme to privatize Social Security, imagine \nwhat American seniors would think today as their private Social \nSecurity accounts disintegrated before their eyes. Imagine the next \nSocial Security statement they would get after we have had a week like \nthis, when they opened up the envelope that was mailed to them that \nitemized how their private accounts were doing, their Bush-Cheney-\nMcCain private accounts.\n  Imagine what choices they would face. Their food prices are already \ngoing up. Gas prices are through the roof. Heating prices, especially \nin States such as Rhode Island and Ohio--imagine what seniors in Dayton \nand Findley and Bowling Green and Akron and Canton would think when \nthey opened their Social Security statements and saw what had happened, \nas they look forward to the winter and high energy prices.\n  Look at John McCain's economic advisers. I have not been privileged \nto serve in the Senate that many years. I was in the House then, and I \nwas not here when Phil Gramm served as a Senator. Phil Gramm was John \nMcCain's economics mentor. John McCain looked to Phil Gramm for advice \nabout economics. Phil Gramm is the one who said we are not in a \nrecession; we are in a mental recession. Americans should just get over \nthis. Then he told Americans to quit whining. It is easy for Phil Gramm \nwho, I assume, has a pretty good pension. I also know he is now an \ninvestment banker and adviser to large corporations. I am sure he is \nmaking a salary of several multiples of what he was making in the \nSenate. So, to him, recession doesn't much matter. He is still cashing \nhis bonus checks. I am sure he doesn't whine about his economic \nsituation. But I am equally sure he doesn't understand the economic \nwoes of people in Galion and Cambridge and Bellaire, OH.\n  I am equally sure both John McCain and Phil Gramm probably own more \nhomes each than almost anybody in any of those communities and don't \nface these kinds of economic problems. Phil Gramm said he wants to be \nTreasury Secretary if John McCain is elected.\n  Look at one of his other advisers, Carly Fiorina, ousted CEO of \nHewlett Packard. She pretty much failed at her job, was ousted, and was \ngiven a huge golden parachute. She is John McCain's chief economic \nadviser in the campaign. Phil Gramm was the mentor. Now Carly Fiorina \nis his chief economic adviser. She said she doesn't think John McCain \nis capable of running a corporation, and she wanted to be Vice \nPresident.\n  I guess I should not be surprised that Ohio's middle-class families \nintuitively understand they can't afford four more of Bush, Cheney, and \nMcCain, of deregulation and privatization, how so many in this \ninstitution--and unfortunately, Senator McCain--are so out of touch \nwith the middle class of Ohio, the people he is going to ask to vote \nfor him. I think none of us are fooled by this latest change in \nrhetoric where Senator McCain is all of a sudden showing an anger at \nwhat these companies and Wall Street have done.\n  As we know, John McCain was one of the cheerleaders not just for \nprivatization of Social Security, he was also a cheerleader for \nderegulation, saying we have way too many regulations, too many \nenvironmental, worker safety, consumer product safety, and health \nregulations and rules on Wall Street.\n  We know when you relax regulation of consumer product safety, you get \ntoxic toys coming from China. When you relax regulation on food safety, \nyou get too many cases of E. coli. You get too many contaminated \ningredients that end up in drugs such as Heparin that killed several \npeople in Toledo, contaminating prescription drugs. When you weaken \nenvironmental laws, we know what happens. When you weaken food safety \nlaws, consumer product safety, all the things that Americans care \nabout, and when you deregulate Wall Street, we know what happens. It is \npretty clear but nowhere is it clearer than it is on Social Security. I \nknow the Senator from Rhode Island and I and the majority of people in \nthis Senate want to protect Social Security, don't want to privatize \nit. John McCain, George Bush, and Dick Cheney tried to privatize it \nback in 2005. We know if they get a majority in the House and Senate, \nthey will try to privatize Social Security again. It is bad for the \nAmerican people.\n  We saw this week the best illustration yet of what happens if this \ncrowd in Washington, the people who are so out of touch with the middle \nclass--John McCain, George Bush, Dick Cheney--if they get their chance \never to privatize Social Security, far too many of my constituents will \nbe hurt.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his comments. This whole concept, \nthe underlying philosophy that you will hear from President Bush and \nSenator McCain with his support, is the notion of the ownership society \nwhich, to put it in shorthand, means: Just remember, we are all in this \nalone. They believe when it comes to at least the issue of Social \nSecurity, it would be preferable to divert money from current benefits \nand to put it in the stock market. That was the notion supported by \nJohn McCain and President Bush which the American people rejected. It \nis my understanding as well that Senator McCain has taken this \nownership society idea to the notion of health insurance too, that they \nwould penalize employers that provide health insurance and give people \na tax break to go out into the market and go shopping for their own \nhealth insurance policies.\n  I ask the Senator if he has any reaction to the notion of individuals \nand families shopping for health insurance, not as part of some pool \nwhere they work but on an individual family basis.\n  Mr. BROWN. The first thing Senator McCain would do is tax those \nhealth care policies that tens of millions of Americans have. In my \nState there are an awful lot of still pretty good health care policies, \nhealth care coverage, often negotiated by unions, often extended \nvoluntarily by employers. Senator McCain wants to tax the worth of \nthose policies. So if you have a policy worth $6,000 for your family, \nthen that would be taxed under the McCain plan. He turns around then \nand gives some tax breaks in their place. But the net effect simply \nmeans it isn't going to work.\n  It goes to the heart of our philosophy as a people, the values we \nhold. The values that we hold, in my view, are about communities. We \nreally are in this together. Our country works best when we are \ncooperating, working together. We pulled together after September 11. \nWe pulled together during\n\n[[Page S9001]]\n\nWorld War II. When we pull together and work together, things work for \neverybody so much better.\n  Senator McCain is taking up where George Bush and Dick Cheney left \noff. They think it is every man and woman for himself or herself: \nprivatization of Social Security, messing with employer-based health \nbenefits as they are, without replacing them with anything that makes \nany sense. The ``you are on your own'' attitude makes no sense for the \nAmerican people. The more people know about this, the more upset they \nare going to be.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't know if the Senator, when he was a Member of the \nHouse, ever served with Phil Gramm, who is from Texas. I did. Then \nSenator Gramm came over and represented the State of Texas in the \nSenate. For the longest time, Senator Phil Gramm was the economic \nadviser to John McCain, not just on a campaign basis but on a personal \nbasis. They shared a lot of thinking together. It was Phil Gramm's \ninspiration that moved us to this moment now where we have a lack of \noversight, a lack of accountability when it comes to basic investments \nand credit institutions. The Gramm-McCain view of the world was \ngovernment should step aside and get out of the way for the magic of \ncapitalism and the magic of the free market. There is no question that \nthe entrepreneurial spirit is a major part of the success of America, \nbut time and again in history we have seen that if there is not a \ngovernment entity involved in oversight, demanding accountability, many \ntimes the forces in the market go to extremes.\n  What we have seen in the last 2 weeks are the extremes of the Phil \nGramm-John McCain approach to regulation. In fact, Senator McCain \nprided himself by saying he was one of the leading deregulators in the \nSenate. In the last couple days, as companies have been crashing and \ntaxpayers have been picking up the bills, he now says he favors \nregulation. I ask the Senator, isn't this part of the same mindset, \nprivatizing Social Security, privatizing health care, and basically \nremoving the government from market operations that can ultimately \ndamage investors, savers, retirees, and the taxpayers?\n  Mr. BROWN. There is no question. Earlier we were talking about Phil \nGramm, who says we are in the middle of a recession and Americans \nshould quit whining; Phil Gramm, whose income is many times what it was \nin the Senate, and we are paid very generously in this body. John \nMcCain has followed the policies of the Bush-Cheney administration, but \nhe gets his advice, if he ever strays, from Phil Gramm. Phil Gramm was \nhis mentor on his economic views.\n\n  If you remember John McCain said several times in the last couple \nyears, I don't know much about economics. He may or may not. \nApparently, he doesn't know much. But what he does know comes from this \nvery corporate, very privatized way of thinking that Phil Gramm has \ntaught him. He has carried that into the campaign as Phil Gramm \ncontinues to advise him on economic matters. Just because John McCain \nis saying some things today that you and I agree with about going after \nWall Street and that I want regulation, his whole history is \nderegulation, fighting for deregulation, doing Wall Street's bidding, \ndoing the oil industry's bidding, doing the health insurance companies' \nbidding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would ask the Senator from Ohio, is it fair to say when \nit comes to regulation that Senator McCain was against it before he was \nfor it?\n  Mr. BROWN. I think he was against it before he was for it. He was for \nthe head of SEC, Chris Cox, and now he is against him. Maybe tomorrow \nhe will want Secretary Paulson fired. I don't know. He has been for a \nlot of things before he has been against them, unfortunately. I thank \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9001-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9001-S9003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX EXTENDERS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor hoping that the two \nleaders, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, might be close to getting \nan agreement that allows us to move forward on voting on the tax \nextenders package, including the critically important energy \nprovisions. While we wait for that, I thought I would take an \nopportunity to come down and mention some of the key provisions of the \nbill and also to thank many people who have worked on it.\n  We are the cusp of breaking this logjam on clean energy tax policy \nand pushing the United States into more of a leadership position on \nclean energy technology. Getting to this point took a lot of work and \ndedication. Senator Reid of Nevada, obviously coming from a State that \nhas incredible resources to participate in this, has long been an \nadvocate of renewable energy. He instinctively understands what it is \ngoing to take for us to get off of fossil fuels and on to other \nalternative, more sustainable technologies. He has consistently forged \na consensus on critical issues in the Senate. I know Senator Reid knows \nhow desperately our Nation needs to get on this path toward energy \nindependence.\n  I also take the opportunity to thank Senators Baucus and Grassley for \ntheir commitment and leadership. I don't think there has been a time \nduring this whole process that these two wise leaders of the Finance \nCommittee have waivered, and we have had many votes to try to get to \nthis point where we are today.\n  I especially want to thank the Finance Committee staff: Cathy Koch, \nPat Bousliman, and Mark Prater, who all worked long hours crafting the \noverall package. While I will not talk about the overall package, I \nwill talk about the energy provisions. I thank them for their hard \nwork. It takes a lot of time and energy. I also thank Senator Ensign \nand his staff, particularly Jason Mulvihill, who spent many hours \nworking with my staff, Lauren Bazel and Amit Ronen, and my chief of \nstaff Maura O'Neill. All have worked on this in a bipartisan effort to \ntry to get this legislation across the finish line.\n  It is a bipartisan effort that got us here today. And I hope we will \ncontinue bipartisan efforts on many of these policies moving forward \nbecause that is what it is going to take given the structure of the \nSenate for us to continue to move forward on important legislation.\n  What are we doing in this Energy bill that is going to hopefully be \nbefore us this evening? First and foremost, we are doing several things \nthat are new, new policies that will help our nation realize a clean \nenergy future. First we are unleashing the power of solar energy. In \n2005, we took a very important step by incenting solar energy for 2 \nyears. Now we are doing something much more robust. We are giving an 8-\nyear investment tax credit to the solar industry because we believe \nthat it will unleash the potential of this unbelievable energy source \nfor our Nation. We think that over 440,000 new jobs could be created in \nthe solar industry just in the next 8 years. Much of that growth is \ncoming from new concentrating solar plants, a breakthrough in \ntechnology that has great promise to provide affordable and predictable \nbaseload power in rapidly growing parts of the Southwest. Without this \nbill that is going to be before us, electricity rates surely would have \nrisen in these fast growing parts of the country, and our environment \nwould have suffered.\n  Now if we pass this bill, States such as Nevada, Arizona, and New \nMexico not only will be able to produce emission-free solar power at a \nstable and affordable rate, but the industry will be a new source of \nmanufacturing jobs for this part of our country. The new 8-year \ninvestment credit will also, I believe, unleash a similar opportunity \nfor fuel cell technology because we are giving this nascent industry \ngreat predictability.\n\n  Second, we are jump-starting the transition to plug-in electric \nvehicles. This is the first time we are giving tax breaks to consumers \nwho purchase plug-in electric cars, trucks, and SUVs. These are cars \nthat are about to appear on the showroom floor, and may achieve 100 \nmiles per gallon. By giving consumers up to a $7,500 tax rebate per \nvehicle, we can accelerate the adoption rate and the mass production \nand, I believe, help this game-changing technology be deployed more \nquickly.\n  This provision was part of a bill that Senator Hatch, Senator Obama, \nand myself began working on over a year and a half ago. We recognized \nthat our current electricity infrastructure,\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\nwhen it is matched with plug-in vehicles, could help us displace 6.5 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. That is an amount equivalent to 50 \npercent of our foreign oil imports.\n  And instead of paying $4 a gallon, as many consumers have paid in the \nlast several months, with a plug-in electric vehicle you can fill up \nwith electricity for the equivalent of only $1 per gallon. Wouldn't \nthat be terrific for our consumers today?\n  Third, this legislation is a big step forward on giving every \nAmerican the opportunity to generate their own power. With the advent \nof distributed generation, now individual homeowners will be able to \ngenerate their own electricity, produce their own hot water, and \nmonitor their own energy uses and, consequently, save precious dollars.\n  This bill contains new incentives for residential solar, small wind \nturbines, and smart meters--all things that empower the consumer with \nthe ability to control and reduce their own energy costs. For example, \nconsumers can receive a Federal cost share of 30 percent for installing \nsolar photovoltaic or hot water systems on their roofs, and for the \nfirst time we are eliminating the cap on residential solar tax credits. \nLifting the cap will encourage residential homeowners to put on even \nbigger renewable solar systems, allowing them to sell clean energy back \nto the electricity grid used by other families.\n  We all know about big wind farms. We have seen pictures of them. Some \nof my colleagues have wind farms in their State. But for the first \ntime, this bill provides a tax credit to homeowners who put small wind \nturbines onto their property, which can also generate a source of \nelectricity in windy rural farm and ranch areas across our country.\n  This legislation also incorporates a credit for installing geothermal \nheat pumps, which is really one of the cleanest and most efficient ways \nto heat and cool your home. This technology uses the constant heat of \nthe Earth to make or take away the heat in our homes, instead of \nburning fossil fuels into the sky.\n  One of the provisions I am very enthusiastic about--and I thank the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Baucus, for including this in the \nlegislation--is smart metering technology. Smart metering, along with \nthese other uses, is going to be so empowering for the consumers \nbecause smart meters are an essential component of making our \nelectricity grid more intelligent, making it smarter about how we use \nelectricity, making it less prone to blackouts. By putting smart meters \nin this tax package, hopefully the adoption rate will also pick up and \nbe spread more quickly. Smart meters will allow for real-time pricing \nthat will let consumers know how much energy they are consuming so that \nthey can adjust their consumption accordingly to lower their \nelectricity bills. The smart grid example I always like to use is to \nset your dishwasher to turn on at the lowest megawatt rate. Having that \ncapability across a range of technologies could end up giving consumers \nsignificant savings.\n  This legislation also gives consumers access to over $10,000 in tax \ncredits to purchase technologies that can lower their energy bills. For \nexample, this bill allows consumers to use up to a $500 tax credit for \ninstalling energy-efficient appliances, windows, and insulation. It \nalso provides consumers incentives for solar PV panels, solar hot water \nheaters, and residential wind turbines.\n  There is also a $300 tax incentive for the purchase of clean-burning \nwood stoves. In fact, I think that provision alone will give Northeast \nconsumers an opportunity to significantly reduce their home heating \nbills because more efficient, new wood-burning stoves can help \nconsumers get significant reductions to their winter heating bills by \nmoving toward this new state-of-the-art technology, to say nothing of \nhelping the Northeast get off of home heating oil and on to things such \nas wood-burning pellets, which are renewable and can be much more \neconomical.\n  So there are other things in this bill about biofuels, about clean \nenergy credits for nonprofit organizations, and I am sure my colleagues \nwill come and talk about other things. But there is one last point I \nwish to make about this legislation because I really do think we are \nmaking a game-changing decision here as it relates to clean energy and \nour clean energy future. That is because another breakthrough in this \nbill is that it is the first time I know of that the Senate is voting \nto take away tax breaks from the oil and gas companies and reallocate \nthose funds to renewable energy sources. This is the first time, I \nbelieve, we are truly beginning to level the playing field, taking away \nsubsidies from those mature and profitable industries that I think have \nhad too many subsidies for too long a time. This bill says we want our \nenergy future to be based on more diverse and renewable energy sources \nthat are better for our environment.\n  In 2005 energy bill--one of the last times Congress considered new \nenergy tax policy--the authors chose to give two-thirds of the tax \nbreaks to the fossil fuel and nuclear industries. This bill flips that \nratio on its head. Two-thirds of the tax incentives in this package go \nto clean energy generation, helping consumers take more control of \ntheir own energy costs.\n  So we are putting our money where our mouth is. We are saying we want \nto invest in cleaner, more distributed generation that is domestically \nproduced and environmentally friendly.\n  So I am proud of this energy package--and hopefully tonight we will \nget it passed--that unleashes the power of solar, that empowers \nconsumers with incentives to reduce their energy use and to be in the \nproduction of cleaner energy themselves, for which this legislation \ngives up to $10,000 in tax breaks, and it certainly helps level the \nplaying field as far as public policy by starting to incentivize clean \nenergy over our historic dependence on fossil fuels.\n  I hope we can get this legislation passed because not only will it be \nan economic opportunity for job growth in America and for \nmanufacturing, but it will also provide real opportunities for \nAmericans to save real dollars on their energy bills. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in passing this package. I hope we can get it \nthrough the House quickly and get it signed by the President so we can \nget about having the energy relief America deserves.\n  Mr. President, I also want to highlight the additional tax relief to \nAmerican families and businesses that we will provide when we finally \nact on the other tax extenders.\n  The 2-year extension of the State sales tax deduction is critical to \nthe struggling families in my State who just can not afford to face the \npotential tax increase they would face if we fail to extend the \ndeduction for State sales taxes.\n  I am pleased we give taxpayers certainty for 2008 and for 2009.\n  And I am pleased this deduction means real money for real families.\n  In 2006, more than 880,000 Washingtonians claimed this deduction. And \n49 percent of those folks made less than $75,000.\n  This deduction meant an average of $600 more in the pockets of \nWashington State taxpayers.\n  This is an issue of fundamental fairness and I will continue to work \nto make this deduction permanent. No one should be left in the dark \nwondering if the deduction will be extended from year to year. They \njust can't afford the uncertainty.\n  I am also pleased to see us restore the R tax credit for 2008 and \nextend it through 2009.\n  This tax credit has a strong history of supporting much needed high-\nwage jobs in the United States.\n  The Information Technology Association of America estimated that if \nthe tax credit was in place during 2008, there would have been $8.5 \nbillion more in economic activity this year.\n  That is investment that Americans could have greatly benefited from. \nAnd it is economic activity we can still benefit from if we act now.\n  Clearly, given that our economic news only gets worse each day, we \ncan't afford to turn away the $51 million per day in new investments \nthat are at risk if this credit is not extended.\n  And this bill fulfills the promise we made to support our rural \nneighbors by reauthorizing our Secure Rural Schools Program and fully \nfunding the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program.\n  This will mean an influx of around $47 million a year for 4 years for \nsome of our rural counties that have a very small tax base because \nFederal lands take up so much of the county.\n\n[[Page S9003]]\n\n  Facing the expiration of these payments this year, rural counties \nhave been forced to begin laying off teachers, librarians, and county \nemployees that provide critical services.\n  And these communities cannot absorb the loss of these workers. Nor \nshould they have to deal with further erosion of the sense of community \nthat many of their towns were founded on.\n  But today we are reversing this trend and helping counties retain \ncounty employees and teachers, keep roads safe and maintained, stemming \ncuts in vital government services, while also providing funding for \nresource conservation projects, forest service land rescue services, \nand programs to support economic development.\n  This bill not only provides new opportunities for American businesses \nto take advantage of the growing green energy economy, but it provides \nreal opportunities for Americans to save real dollars.\n  So today I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for a strong, \nbipartisan tax package that helps move this country forward toward \ngreater energy independence and provides needed tax relief to our \nfamilies and businesses.\n  I would also like to take a moment to recognize the mental illness \nparity provisions in this bill. What they mean is that when Americans \nneed mental health treatment that they will not be faced with higher \ncosts for that treatment than they currently have for medical surgical \ntreatments. This bill would require private insurance plans that offer \nmental health benefits as part of the coverage to offer such benefits \non par with the medical surgical benefits. Any cost-sharing or benefit \nlimits imposed on mental health services must not be any more \nrestrictive than those imposed on medical surgical services.\n  Your support on all of these provisions cannot wait any longer. We \nhave run out of time, and the time to act is now.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier the majority leader came to the \nfloor and propounded a unanimous consent request on the tax extenders \npackage, and I told him that while I supported the legislation, there \nare a lot of good things in the bill, I still had some concerns about \nthe disparate treatment of the State of Texas, especially related to \nHurricane Ike.\n  I am pleased to report that as a result of discussions with the \nFinance Committee--Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, and their staff--I \nbelieve we have achieved our goal of getting fair treatment for the \nState and the victims of Hurricane Ike. I wanted to come to the floor \nand express my gratitude to Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley. We are \nreviewing the final language, but subject to that, I think, as far as I \nam concerned, there is no objection to proceeding to the bill.\n  As I toured the hurricane-damaged area last weekend----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if the Senator would briefly pause, I wish \nto thank the Senator from Texas. The Senator has been great to work \nwith as we worked out some provisions to help that State, especially \nthe Galveston area, and the coastal States in getting additional \ndisaster assistance. I thank the Senator as well as his colleague from \nTexas. We will come back to do more at a later date, but we are doing \nwhat we can on this bill, and I say thanks to my colleague for working \nso well with us.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the generous comments of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. I especially enjoyed \nthe part where he said we may come back later for more once we have \nbeen able to do further assessments. That is an important part of the \nrationale for agreement on this bill. We understand we can't do \neverything that needs to be done in this bill because the hurricane \nonly hit this last weekend. There are a lot of people who have yet to \nbe able to get back to their homes, a lot of folks without power, a lot \nof damage that is ongoing that cannot be fully calculated.\n  I had the chance, when traveling around the damaged area, to witness \nthe destructive capacity of this huge hurricane and hear from a lot of \nmy constituents, a lot of displaced Texans who were trying to find the \nnecessities of life, including food, water, and shelter. Of course, \nthey were very anxious to know about their homes, whether they would be \nable to return home, when they would be able to return home, and what \nthey would find when they got there.\n  I appreciate that the chairman of the Finance Committee has included \nin the extenders package things such as bonus depreciation and \nexpensing. These may seem like arcane subjects, but they actually mean \na lot. They will mean a lot to the people of my State when it comes to \nrebuilding and getting back on their feet and getting back to work.\n  I understand the unique circumstances we find ourselves in and the \nneed to get the extenders package passed, which, as I said earlier, I \nsupport. I offer my congratulations to Senator Cantwell, who is on the \nfloor, and Senator Ensign for their leadership. They have been working \nhard and long at trying to get this done, and I know we are almost over \nthe goal line.\n  Included in the package is an extension of the State and local sales \ntax deduction. This is something that is important to my State and to \nthe other States that do not have an income tax. Because, of course, \nyou can deduct your Federal income tax from your--or your State income \ntax from your Federal income tax, but if you don't have a State income \ntax, as Texas does not and, I might add, never will, this provides a \nlevel playing field by allowing the deduction of State and local tax.\n  This also includes an extension of the very important research and \ndevelopment tax credit which helps many companies in Texas and around \nthe country be competitive in the globalized economy.\n  This measure also includes the extension of several renewable energy \ntax credits that have helped grow the Texas renewable energy industry. \nI know my colleagues get a little tired of Texans always bragging about \nTexas, but I am not going to stop now. We are No. 1 in the production \nof electricity from wind energy. Many people think of Texas as an oil \nand gas State, and we are that, but we are much more. We are an energy \nState. Credits for wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, hydropower, clean \nrenewable energy bonds, fuel cell, and credits for residential energy \nefficiency home improvements are helping to diversify our Nation's \nenergy portfolio and are a significant contribution toward answering \nthe energy crisis we find ourselves in today.\n  This measure also supports the clean use of coal. Coal, of course, is \ncheap. It is domestic. We have a lot of it. We are sometimes called the \nSaudi Arabia of\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\ncoal here in the United States. Its use is essential to helping reduce \nour dependence on imported energy from abroad. Of course, coal can burn \ndirty, and we need to continue to do the research and development that \nis so important to finding ways to use that energy with which we have \nbeen endowed here in this country in a way that results in not only \ngood and inexpensive energy use, but also a good, clean environment. We \nneed to spur the advanced technology market to capture carbon and \nsequester it. Of course, the Federal Government has sort of been \ninvolved in a start-and-stop effort to try to do that kind of research. \nAs a matter of fact, two cities in Texas, Jewett and Odessa, were \nfinalists in the Federal Department of Energy effort to do an extensive \nresearch project into clean coal technology. Unfortunately, that got so \nbig and expensive that the Secretary of Energy decided to basically go \nanother way.\n  The fact is we have the geology in Texas because of a lot of old oil \nwells that could sequester carbon dioxide, and we also know that the \ncapture of carbon dioxide has many beneficial uses, particularly when \nit comes to secondary recovery and tertiary recovery in old oil fields.\n  Another key part of solving our energy crisis is the transformation \nof our transportation sector through the use of plug-in electric \nvehicles and other alternative fuels. This package establishes a new \ncredit for consumers who purchase plug-in electric vehicles. Now, I am \nstill a little bit skeptical of how many people in my State of 24 \nmillion people are going to decide to trade in their pickup truck for a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle that has a battery that will go maybe 40 miles. \nThat won't get you very far, particularly out in west Texas. But I \nthink in a lot of places, that kind of technology, hopefully, will come \nto the market as soon as 2010. I know GM is going to introduce the Volt \nand I know other car manufacturers will be introducing their own models \nof these plug-in electric hybrids, and I think this new credit will \nprovide that choice and that option to consumers in Texas.\n  So I thank, again, Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, and the Finance \nCommittee staff. I wish to extend my appreciation to my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, for all of her hard work. \nWe have tried to work together, and have worked together, in the best \ninterests of our State, but also in a way that I think creates a win/\nwin for the people of America. I believe this effort is the first step \nto making Texas whole again, and I trust that our colleagues who have \nexpressed so much sympathy and concern for the people of Texas who were \naffected by this terrible hurricane will have long memories.\n  When we come back after this bill is passed, we will continue to work \ntogether on other important measures to make sure that each of our \nStates affected by natural disasters, wherever they may be, will be \ntreated in a fair and evenhanded sort of way. Senator Hutchison, of \ncourse, has been taking the lead when it comes to working on what I \nanticipate will likely be a supplemental appropriation request. But as \nI said at the outset, this hurricane is very recent. There are still a \ncouple million people without power, and the assessments are still \nbeing done. But we will be back and we will be seeking the further--not \nonly words of support from our colleagues, but something real and \ntangible in terms of support for the people of our State.\n  I see my colleague, the senior Senator from Texas on the floor, and I \ncertainly yield the floor to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to say to my colleague from \nTexas that we have been working together all day on the tax extender \npackage, because there are many facets that affect Texas in this tax \nextender package. Then, on a separate note, I am certainly working with \nour whole delegation on the appropriations part of the continuing \nresolution we expect to see next week.\n  I so appreciate working with the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nas well as Senator Grassley. Both Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley \nhave been very helpful in trying to fashion an addition, actually, to \nthe tax extender bill because, of course, as Senator Cornyn has said, \nthis hurricane hit our State last weekend. We have seen the pictures--\nall America has seen the pictures--of the streets of Galveston, the \nformer streets of many of our areas, and the residents who still cannot \nget back into their homes, including 2 million people who still don't \nhave power. So we know the devastation that has hit our area, but we \ndon't know yet what the total cost is going to be, because we can't \neven get into Galveston to start making assessments. Certainly Port \nArthur, Orange, Beaumont, the lower parts of Harris County--all the way \nthrough our area, we are seeing the effects of this storm that are not \nyet calculable.\n\n  The Finance Committee has agreed to add into the bill, that was \nalready on the way, the help that Texas and Louisiana are going to need \nbecause of Ike in the tax part of the extender package. The disaster \npart that will be added in is going to be very helpful to the private \nsector and the ability to start getting the housing up and going in \nthese areas that have been completely wiped out. I think that later, \nwhen Senator Baucus comes to the floor, we will want to talk about it \nto make sure it is clearly understood exactly what the effects will be \non Texas and Louisiana. But our delegations have worked very closely \ntogether with Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley to achieve what I \nthink is a good result.\n  In addition to the disaster part of the bill, there are important \nparts of the tax extender package that will affect all of our \ncommunities. Certainly in Texas, the sales tax extension that is a \nmatter of equity for States that don't have income tax, to be able to \nhave the same deduction for our sales taxes that income tax State \ntaxpayers have for theirs is a very important component of the tax \nextender package. Then, again, since Senator Baucus has just walked on \nthe floor, I wish to say that I think what has been worked out on the \noil and refinery tax issue from the manufacturing standpoint, along \nwith the additional two years of the expansion of refinery tax credit, \nwe are going to be able to continue to build out the refineries that \nwill affect the price of gasoline all over our country, because as we \nare seeing right now, due to Hurricane Ike, the shutting down of \nrefineries affects the price of gasoline everywhere. If we can add to \nthe capacity of our refineries all over the country--this is not only \nTexas and Louisiana; this is Michigan and everywhere where there are \nrefineries--if we can add to that capacity, it adds to supply, and it \nwill bring down the price of gasoline. The extension of 2 years is \ngoing to be very helpful for refineries to have an incentive to do even \nmore than they have already been committed to do.\n  Certainly, I think the addition of the manufacturing tax credit, even \nat the lower level, will also add to the capability as these Gulf of \nMexico rigs and refineries are spending millions of dollars, not only \non cleaning up the damage and trying to get back up and operating, but \nthey are also helping their employees at a time such as this with the \nproblems they are having with their homes being gone and their living \nconditions being unable to be sustained.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, for working with us on that. I ask if the Senator is ready \nto go with a colloquy, or should we wait. I don't know what the status \nof the tax extender package is at this point, but perhaps he would be \nable to tell us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think someone is getting the colloquy \ntogether. We don't have it at the moment. However, I think we can \nbasically have an impromptu colloquy right here to handle most of it, \nand if we want to do more later, we can do so.\n  Essentially, the Senator from Texas very correctly and appropriately \ncalled me and said we need to do more for Texas, including Galveston, \nand some other coastal counties. I said to the Senator, if the disaster \nprovisions in the tax bill, which were somewhat patterned--basically \npatterned--after the Katrina provisions, many of those would apply to \nTexas. With the consequences of Ike and Gustav, we went back and looked \nso we could do more.\n  The slight problem we faced is it takes some time to pinpoint and to \nwrite precise tax provisions that affect\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\nthe areas that are hit by disaster. We don't want to give relief to \ncounties or portions of counties where there is no disaster. That would \nnot be the correct thing to do. In fact, we ran into that problem back \nduring the time of Katrina when the initial request, which was, on the \nsurface, appropriate, but when we looked more closely, there were too \nmany dollars spent inappropriately and not enough spent appropriately. \nIt takes a little time to work that out.\n  After about 2 months, we talked to mayors, local people, and disaster \npeople to make sure we tailored it well. We ended up with a result that \nwas quite good and appropriate. It wasn't as large as the initial \nestimate, but the initial estimate was way overblown. It was not well \ntailored. I mentioned this to the Senator from Texas, and she said she \nunderstood. On the other hand, she said, ``We need help here.'' I \nappreciated that and said: You bet.\n  I tried to find some ways to provide additional disaster assistance \nin the bill that I hope we take up on Tuesday. Essentially, what we \nworked out is an increase in the allocation of low-income housing tax \ncredits, as well as an increase in the allocation of private activity \nbonds. The total amount is geared for those counties on the coast. I \nthink there are four or five coastal counties which were hit the most.\n  But to make sure we are not too locked in, we also give the Governor \nthe right to reallocate the benefit of these provisions to other areas \nin Texas but under the total amount. The thought is that we are \nhelping, that way, tailor the assistance most appropriately and \nspecifically.\n  I say to my friend from Texas, it was good to work with her to find \nthe combination, as I said to the junior Senator from Texas, and there \nwould be an opportunity to come back later for more if that is \nappropriate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the key provisions that the Senator \noutlined are exactly what we have agreed to in that we would get extra \namounts that would be allocated for the five coastal counties in Texas \nand into Louisiana. Because the amount is higher, the Governor would \nhave discretion, within the other disaster areas, to allocate that \nexcess. That is indeed part of this because there are areas in Houston, \nHarris County, Galveston, Port Arthur, and Beaumont that will be in the \nmain bill. There are counties such as Orange, Tyler, Polk, and others \nin the disaster-declared areas that could make the added excess, and so \nit would be allocated throughout the area according to the discretion \nof the Governor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. That is my understanding, and \nthat is what we intend to provide.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The tax-exempt bonding authority, as well, and the \nlow-income housing tax credits will bring that housing back on line, \nwhich is so important.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. Allocations for both, that is \ncorrect.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Senator Cornyn had mentioned earlier that he might \nwant to address the additional potential, since we all know this \nhappened just a week ago, and we don't have final actual numbers. I ask \nhim if he wants to speak on something that he had been very active in \ndoing.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I reiterate my thanks to the Senator from Montana, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee. He described what I had understood, \nand we are reading the fine print to make sure that is how it is \nwritten. I anticipate that we will be able to be satisfied with that. \nAs Senator Hutchison knows because she and I traveled the affected \narea, the two areas most affected were Galveston and Orange County. The \nfact that specific counties were listed does not limit relief to areas \nthat may have been, as a matter of fact, disproportionately impacted, \nsuch as Orange. So I am glad to hear that confirmed for the record \nbecause it is very important.\n  As we have all said, it is still very early and there is a lot of \nwork to be done in just assessing the damage. As a matter of fact, \nbefore the storm, there was a projection that the surge of water that \nwould be pushed up by the storm could reach a level of 25 feet--a wall \nof water being pushed up the Houston ship channel. It was projected \nthat 125,000 homes would be destroyed.\n  According to the computer models, there was a projection that as much \nas $81 billion in damage would be done. At that time, we were \nprincipally concerned with making sure that lives were saved and, of \ncourse, in the immediate aftermath with the search and rescue \noperation. But that assessment, of course, fortunately, is going to be \na lot lower than the computer models projected because the surge was \nnot quite as bad as predicted. The storm hit in a way that didn't push \nthat 25-foot wall of water up the Houston ship channel.\n  As I said, we are grateful for all of the cooperation. I hope we will \nbe able to come back when we have firmer numbers and a more detailed \nassessment, and we will experience a similar sort of cooperative spirit \nin trying to make sure the people of Texas are treated on the same \nbasis that other victims of natural disasters in other parts of the \ncountry have been treated.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to just say to Senator Cornyn \nand to Senator Baucus, as we said earlier, there are actually 29 \ncounties that will be in this affected area. What I appreciate so much \nis that Senator Baucus realized that it would be very difficult for us \nto pass a disaster package and leave out Texas and Louisiana when the \ndevastation is so bad. It is the beginning, and I am sure there will be \nmore. But the fact that Senators Baucus and Grassley have understood \nthe enormity of our situation, it gives us great comfort. I talked to \nthe mayor of Houston, also, about this issue. We have been talking to \nthe other mayors, and they so appreciate the Senator's accommodation. \nWe are all going to be able to continue to work together, just as we \nhave in so many of these disasters that keep on having issues, and we \nwant to do it in the right way because that is the American way.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana. I also thank the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Grassley. We will continue to work with them.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I might say to the Senator from Texas that \nI had a nice conversation with the mayor this afternoon, too. He was \nhelpful in explaining what needed to be done. He appreciated the \nefforts both Senators from Texas have undertaken. I think he would like \nmore, but he understands where we are.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think he understands exactly where we are now. He \ntold me he had a good conversation with the Senator from Montana. We \nare all working on this together and taking 1 day at a time. We \nappreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will offer something at some point. \nThere is not a Democrat here. I am not trying to pull a fast one on \nanybody. I understand there is an objection to the bipartisan agreement \ncalled the Legal Immigration Extension Act of 2008 by one, perhaps, \nSenator. I want to share some thoughts about that and how we got where \nwe are today.\n  There are four pieces of legislation that are expiring or are about \nto expire. After a good bit of work in the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nwe reached an accord that we would not offer any changes in immigration \nlaw before we try to recess this year. A lot of us have some real firm \nviews about some things that need to be done, but everybody has \nbasically agreed not to push that. But it is important that a number of \nthings get passed. The most important thing that needs to be passed--\nand it would be unthinkable were it not to pass--would be the extension \nof the E-verify program.\n  It is a voluntary Web-based system operated by the Department of \nHomeland Security, in partnership with the Social Security \nAdministration. It allows participating employers to electronically \nverify the employment eligibility of people they would hire, to see if \nthey are presenting a legitimate Social Security number.\n  More than 84,000 employers voluntarily participate in E-verify and we \nwould get--get this--a thousand new enrollments by employers each week. \nIt is growing in popularity. Because it was a limited program, it is \nset to expire in November of this year. So the agreed-upon legislation \nwould be to extend the program for 5 years. I note that this program, \nunder the Kennedy-McCain bill, and the subsequent comprehensive bill \nthat was offered on the\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\nfloor, which was voted down, would have made E-verify mandatory on all \nemployers. This does not do that. This just keeps it as it is.\n\n  Presumably, we are going to have to have a real serious talk about \nwhat to do next year. Also in the package I just mentioned would be an \nextension of the ED-5 regional center program. This is a program that \nsays if someone comes to America--and it has been in effect since \n1990--and they are willing to invest $1 million in hiring at least 10 \nAmericans, they would be able to get a visa. That program is set to \nexpire, and we have agreed that it would continue for 5 years--not be \npermanent, but it would be extended for 5 years. It is an additional \ngroup of people on top of the 1 million or so we allow in the country \nevery year. It is an additional group on top of that.\n  Then there is Senator Conrad's 30 J-1 visa program. Senator Conrad, \nin 1994, passed a provision that would allow foreign medical graduates \nto waive the mandatory return to their foreign residence, and if they \nwere going to practice in a State for 3 years before they return to \ntheir home country, they could stay here. Many States have found that \nto be an advantage.\n  Again, that is on top of the others. I am a little bit concerned that \nevery time we do one of these programs it is just on top. We are not \nchoosing and prioritizing the people who would best flourish in \nAmerica, but we are just adding on top. But I have agreed to go along \nwith that and extend that program for 5 years.\n  There is also the nonminister religious worker visa program. It was \npassed in 1990, and it allows up to 5,000 workers on top of the people \nwho are already able to come here and be a part of America, and people \nbelieve that should be extended. I am prepared to agree to that as part \nof the package. So that would be what we would do there.\n  Those were the pieces of legislation that Senator Leahy and, I think, \nthe entire Judiciary Committee agreed that we should move forward on.\n  Now, let me mention why the E-verify program is critical.\n  I have to say to my colleagues that I cannot agree and this Congress \nand this Senate should not agree to an additional expansion of \nimmigrants into this country as a price to continue the current law. If \nwe are going to do that, then we need to have a full debate about \nimmigration and a full debate about the numbers that should be \nadmitted, and properly so, into our country, and what standards should \nbe utilized. That is the situation we are facing.\n  E-verify, as included in this bipartisan package, would not be \nchanged in any way. It will remain the program it is today, but it \nexpires on November 30 of this year. It was originally established in \n1996, and it must not be allowed to expire. If this Congress allows E-\nverify to expire, then we will have made a statement to this Nation \nthat the one system that is working today and could be expanded in the \nfuture to create a lawful system of immigration is being abandoned. It \nwould rightly cause every American who has been hearing Members of the \nSenate and the House promising to do something about restoring the rule \nof law to immigration--they would know we were not serious at all. They \nwould know this is one more flimflam that would be carried out.\n  I feel very strongly about this issue. The total number of users in \ncorporations today are 84,000, representing 438,985 hiring sites. It is \nbeing used quite a bit today in a voluntary fashion.\n  So far in 2008, there have been over 5.8 million queries run through \nthe system compared to a total of 3.2 million in fiscal year 2007. If \nyou do not want the law enforced, that makes you nervous. Look, it has \nincreased maybe 50 percent in 1 year. More and more people are using \nit. It is having some sort of impact in the country. If you want the \nlawlessness to continue, you don't want E-verify to be extended. The \ngrowth now continues at 1,000 new users and participants each week.\n  More and more people are finding it to be a good system. It is \nvoluntary. Companies are finding it works, and it is not burdensome. It \nhelps deter the use of fraudulent documents. Businesses have a \ndifficult time examining documents. They are not document examiners. \nThey are concerned if they deny somebody without a good basis they may \nsue them. If they don't deny somebody, the Government might fuss at \nthem. This is a way they can do a quick check to determine whether \nsomeone is in the country legally.\n  Both in the 2006 and 2007 comprehensive immigration legislation, this \nproposal, as I said, would have been made mandatory. However, the \nlegislation we are talking about today certainly is not that; it is \nonly a temporary extension of the existing program. I want to make that \nclear.\n  No system is perfect, but we have invested millions of dollars to \nimprove this system. Many of the kinks have been worked out. The \nsystem, I think, could and should be enhanced substantially, and I \nwould like to see it made better, but by all means it should not be \nkilled. We must not let it expire. The employers are relying on it. We \nmust not pull the rug out from under them and undermine the rule of \nlaw.\n  To give a brief background on the E-verify system, the Immigration \nReform Act of 1986 made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or \nemploy aliens who are not eligible to work in the United States. It \nrequired employers to examine the identity and work eligibility \ndocuments of all new employees.\n  Employers are required to participate in a paper-based employment \neligibility verification system, commonly referred to as the I-9 \nsystem, in which they examine documents presented by the newly hired \nworkers to verify identity and work eligibility and to complete and \nretain I-9 forms.\n  Under the current law, if the documents provided by an employee \nreasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met his \ndocument review obligation. However, the easy availability of \ncounterfeit documents and fake identification has made this a mockery \nof law. It is not working.\n  In 1996, Congress authorized a basic pilot program to help employers \nverify the eligibility of their workers. Participants would verify a \nnew hire's employment authorization through the Social Security \nAdministration and, if necessary, through the Department of Homeland \nSecurity databases.\n  The basic pilot of E-verify was authorized in five States until an \nexpansion of the program was agreed to by Congress in 2003. Now all \nStates and all employers can take advantage of this voluntary and free \nprogram.\n  Let me give some facts on the statistics. There has been a lot of \nconcern that the program does not work fairly. I dispute that most \nstrongly. Mr. President, 94.5 percent of individuals whose numbers are \nchecked are authorized to go to work. There is not a problem. It is \ndone routinely within 3 seconds. One-half of 1 percent are final \nnonconfirmations. That is, they are identified as not being eligible to \nwork right off the bat. So an employer should not hire them and could \ncommit an offense if they do. Five percent come out of the computer \ncheck as tentative nonconfirmations. If a person has that happen to \nthem, they have an opportunity to step forward and show that the \ncomputer is wrong and find out what the problem is and fix it. However, \nthe facts are that the vast majority of people who are shown to be \ntentative nonconfirmations do not contest the matter. What that \nindicates is they know they are not legal, they know they are not \nentitled to go to work, and they don't contest it, which proves, I \nthink, that the system is working.\n  President Bush's Executive order requires contractors of the Federal \nGovernment to use the system. It is only right that the Government do \nbusiness with companies that are not violating our immigration laws. We \ndon't need to let somebody bid on a contract and submit a low bid \nbecause they are able to use low-cost illegal labor and defeat the bid \nof a legitimate American contractor who is using legitimate labor, \npaying insurance, paying retirement benefits, paying decent wages.\n  I have had a personal example in the last few weeks in which a \nbusinessman told me his company has been losing bids to an out-of-State \ncorporation. This corporation just appeared. He is convinced, and there \nis evidence apparently, that the corporation is using large numbers of \nillegal workers, and he cannot win any bids. He said: My people have \nbeen working for me for 10 and 15 years. I pay them good wages and good \nbenefits. I want to keep them.\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\nI cannot compete. What are you going to do about it? This is one way.\n  States are on board with the E-verify, and they are beginning to take \na look at it. In fact, many of them are encouraging their businesses to \nuse it. Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, Mississippi, \nMissouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, \nTennessee, Utah, and some others, have passed legislation requiring \neither explicitly or implicitly that certain employers within those \nStates participate with E-verify.\n  On Wednesday of this week, the Ninth Circuit, the most liberal \ncircuit in the country and the most favorable circuit to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator has used \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Ninth Circuit upheld an employer law in Arizona \nthat revokes a business license of employers caught knowingly hiring \nillegal immigrants. Businesses in that State do rely on the E-verify \nprogram. Killing this program would undermine their law. This is the \nright thing for us to do.\n  It is not possible for us at this late date, in light of the \nagreement we have reached, to have Members of the Senate ask for an \nexpansion, a dramatic expansion of a half a million people to come into \nour country as a price that must be paid to extend E-verify. That is my \nconcern.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 875, S. 3257; that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nappreciate what my colleague, Senator Sessions, is trying to \naccomplish. But I think there is another view. That view in large part \nis expressed by the House of Representatives that sent over in a vote \nof 407 to 2 a much different and obviously very bipartisan approach \ntoward E-verify. It is one that does what Senator Sessions wants to do, \nwhich is extend the program for 5 years. But it also had some other \ncritical protections.\n  No. 1, the protection of the Social Security Administration programs, \nand in that vote of 407 to 2, realizing there are only 435 Members of \nthe House of Representatives--that is how overwhelming it was--it, in \nfact, also made sure that funds would be provided for the Commissioner \nof Social Security by the Secretary of Homeland Security to administer \nthis program. When it is costless--it is not costless to the taxpayers, \nand in reality it is not costless to the Social Security funds.\n  The bottom line is these provisions that were passed by the House to \nextend the life of E-verify 4 or 5 years also have a protection of the \nSocial Security programs. It is one that I believe makes a lot of \nsense.\n  It also had to ensure, if you are an American and you get--I know \nSenator Sessions downplayed the percentage of people who get kicked \nout--but in fact if you are totally eligible to work but somehow \nthrough computer error are denied that ability in the first instance, \nnow the burden shifts. The burden goes to an American citizen to prove, \nin fact, that they have a right to work in the first place.\n  We might say it is only 5 percent, but 5 percent of millions of \npeople in this country is a lot of people. So the House of \nRepresentatives passed in their proposals, in addition to extending E-\nverify for 5 years and making sure that Social Security funds were held \nwhole, they also passed provisions having a GAO study of this program \nand ensuring that, in fact, it was improved in a way so that we could \nunderstand the magnitude of those individuals who are totally U.S. \ncitizens or legal permanent residents with the full right to work but \nwho are being denied because of computer error.\n  Those provisions which passed 407 to 2 are ones that I would like to \nsee in an E-verify extension.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor under the regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be glad to share with the Senator my thoughts \nabout it. The House did pass it 407 to 2, I believe. We are not \nexpressing any pride of authorship. Will the Senator accept the bill as \npassed by the House? I think we can perhaps do that and we can reach an \nagreement. Just accept the bill passed by the House.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I urge the Senator to consider, and I will make a \nunanimous consent request when the Senator is finished, that S. 3414, \nwhich includes all of the House provisions, as well as H.R. 5569 which \nwould be the EV5 extension, as well as all of the other items the \nSenator spoke about--the Conrad State 30, the religious workers would \nbe included.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Does he wish \nadditional time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nbut I do, in that reservation, want to be recognized next after the \nSenator finishes his 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would ask the Senator to modify his request so that I \nbe recognized immediately after his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be pleased to modify and ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from New Jersey be recognized after my 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Menendez for his \ncourtesy, and I think we have an opportunity to reach an agreement. On \nthe House version there are some things he says he likes better than \nthe bill we agreed on in our committee, which I think passed our \ncommittee unanimously here in the Senate, but I would be prepared to go \nforward with that.\n  I urge my colleague from New Jersey to recognize the proposal he is \nmaking would add about 550,000 more people. It would allow that many \nmore to enter the country on a legal basis. We have a million now who \nenter our country each year, and this would be a huge increase--I think \na one-time increase--but it is a huge increase and it is not \nacceptable. We had sort of reached a stalemate last year when the \nAmerican people rejected the comprehensive bill. They rang our phones \noff the hooks. The switchboard of the Senate shut down. There was a \ngeneral recognition that we needed to do an enforcement system before \nwe started granting amnesty and expanding immigration. That was, I \nthink, a pretty national sentiment. Even Senator McCain, who proposed \nthe legislation, stated that the American people, he understands now, \nexpect us to create a lawful system before we start expanding the \nsystem we have and giving amnesty to those who violated the law.\n  This is a big change from what the Senator has been proposing. I \nsubmit that the choice is simple. We will either go forward with the \nagreement that we reached in committee, without the changes Senator \nMenendez offers, or we will have to have a real debate. And that would \nbe all right with me, but I don't think it is what our leadership \ndesires at this point in time.\n  So I say that I would be delighted to continue to discuss this with \nSenator Menendez, but I feel pretty firmly, I feel very firmly that \nalthough I could accept, I am confident, the House version that he has \nmade some comments about, I cannot accept a major alteration of \nexisting immigration policy because that is not the right way for us to \ngo at this point.\n  It is something I guess we are going to have to talk about next year. \nI see no alternative to ignoring it any longer than next year. It is \ntime for this Senate to get busy and to create a system that ends the \nmockery that exists for our legal system today and creates a lawful \nsystem that will serve our national interest.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my \ndistinguished colleague from Alabama, but I have to correct some \nthings.\n  First, we do, under the unanimous consent that I will ask for \nbriefly, under S. 3414, extend E-Verify. We extend it for 5 years. We \ndo it, as the House did, protecting Social Security and protecting U.S. \ncitizens who get rejected by the system and yet have every right to \nwork. So that is one thing.\n  The second thing is, I heard my colleague talk about extending \ncurrent law. We heard a lot of business-related elements--investors who \nhave a lot of money and who are going to get visas, businesses are \ngoing to have these checks and all these things are going to happen. \nWell, current law allows a U.S. citizen to claim their immediate \nfamily. And as far as family values, it seems to me that the core of \nwhat our immigration policy has been and the core of what Members of \nthis body have talked about time and time again in the context of \nfamily values is that family reunification is the core of those family \nvalues. You can't have family values if you don't have a family in the \nfirst place. And the family in the first place is the core essence of \nthat family. That is, in essence, what the current law provides.\n  So what is simply done, as we look to solve businesses' challenges \nand problems, and bring in investors who have a lot of money, who now \nget a visa because they have a lot of money, is to say to a current \nU.S. citizen that we are going to recapture and use, for the purposes \nof absolutely legal immigration, under the current law, visas that \nexist but don't get used because of the way our system is working. This \nwould allow a U.S. citizen to claim their relative using those visas, \nor a portion of them.\n  By the way, I would urge my distinguished colleague to look at the \nnumbers. We are not talking anywhere near the number he throws around \nof half a million. It is more like 300,000. And we have even talked \nabout working on that number and narrowing the universe. So this is \nabout using the existing legal system to have U.S. citizens be able to \nclaim their relatives under the existing system and make sure the visas \nthat exist under the existing system are used in a way that meets the \ngoal of legal immigration.\n  Now, I don't know why we are so hell bound on giving businesses \neverything they need and then saying to U.S. citizens they do not have \nthe opportunity to be able to meet some of their challenges. In my \nmind, that is promoting a lawful system. I know it is very easy to slap \nup the word ``amnesty'' every time somebody wants to talk about \nimmigration. You can become famous by claiming everything is amnesty, \nbut it doesn't necessarily make it true.\n  The bottom line is what we are talking about is making sure that U.S. \ncitizens who are presently torn apart from their families, and who \nunder existing law have the right to claim that immediate family, have \nthe wherewithal to be reunified using visas that don't get used but \nwhich should be used for this family reunification under existing law. \nSo it seems to me we can do E-Verify, and do it the way the House did \nit, so Social Security is not hurt in terms of funds; and we can make \nsure that we improve upon a system that right now rejects a percentage \nof American citizens who have legal eligibility to work and yet now \nhave the burden of proof shifted upon them.\n  It changes the whole legal precedent where in our country you are \nconsidered innocent until proven guilty. Under E-Verify you are guilty \nuntil proven innocent. I would be outraged as a citizen if I had to be \nchallenged about my ability to work when I have every right to work but \nsome system is barring me from that right to work. And that situation \nexists under E-Verify. Now, it doesn't mean we should do away with E-\nverify, but we need to make it better, and the House provisions do \nthat.\n  We also say: OK, you want to give those people who have a lot of \nmoney to come here and make investments a visa? OK, we will do that. \nYou want the religious workers, of course, who are not necessarily \nclergy members, but religious workers? OK, we will do that. You want to \nbring in doctors? OK, we will do that. But at the same time let's have \na smaller universe of those whose families have been waiting and who \nfollowed the law.\n  This is the interesting part. We can't even seem to incentivize \npeople who follow the law. These are people who didn't come crossing a \nborder, whether it is the southern or northern border. These are people \nwaiting. They have waited and they are still waiting. Yet their U.S. \ncitizen husband or wife or mother and father can't get reunified in \nwhat is a core family. We seem to have lost sense of that core value.\n  So in that respect, I think we are being very reasonable here. And \nthis is not about a broad comprehensive immigration reform. This is not \nabout amnesty. It is not about all those things people like to throw up \non the wall and suggest ultimately that is the case and paint it as one \nbig swath. I don't know when U.S. citizens became second-class citizens \nin terms of being able to be reunified with their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9008-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9008-S9009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3414\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. In pursuit of meeting these goals, redoing E-verify, \ngiving it a 5-year life, doing it the right way, doing those other \nthings, as well as trying to help this small universe of American \ncitizens, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 3414, the Visa Efficiency \nand E-Verify Extension Act of 2008, the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration and to the consideration of H.R. 5569, the E-V-5 \nextension, which was received from the House, en bloc; further, that \nthe bills be read a third time and passed, en bloc; and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I note \nthat we are talking about some sort of capture of unused visas in the \npast, which we calculate at about 550,000. Maybe it is 300,000. This is \na major alteration of current law that has a certain number of family \nmembers, a large number, actually, who can come in every year. This \nwould be a major expansion of that.\n  Those are the kinds of things I think the Senate has gotten to the \npoint we know we don't need to have a full debate on before we recess \nthis year. Therefore, I consider that addition to the House bill that \nSenator Menendez wishes to see become law as a nonstarter and would \nhave to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I regret my colleague's objection. At \nthe end of the day, I understand how passionately he feels. I hope he \nunderstands how passionately I feel. The reality is I find it very \ndifficult when my constituents, U.S. citizens, paying their taxes, \nbeing good citizens, come to me and say: We cannot get reunified with \nour spouse. We cannot get reunified with our mother and father. We \ncannot get reunified with our son and daughter. That is the universe we \nare talking about.\n  If we do not stand for the very core value of family reunification, \nwhile we talk about those who have money to invest and who get visas \nbecause they have money, well, we have seen what has happened with our \nsystem around here when everything is about money, and it is a huge \nfailure. The proposition is that if you have money, yes, you can get a \nvisa. But God forbid we give a U.S. citizen who is claiming their \nfamily a visa as well.\n  I feel very passionately about this. I understand Senator Sessions \nfeels very passionately about the way he views it, and I hope we can \nreconcile our passions and be able to have a little less heat, a little \nmore light, and create an opportunity to be able to move forward in the \ndays ahead. We have time until the end of November, and I certainly \nlook forward to working constructively to make that happen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

You have to be patient in this business. I especially \nextend my appreciation to Senators Baucus and Grassley, and it has been \ndifficult.\n  We have had a terrible natural disaster that has hit.

We have had a lot of \npictures about what took place with this terrible wind storm.\n  So, again, I wish we could have moved this more quickly. But certain \nthings do not happen as you would want.

They are expecting that we work together in a bipartisan \nfashion to craft legislation that will address our Nation's long-term \nenergy requirements and set us down a path towards energy independence.\n  Their urgency is underscored by the fact that this is no longer just \na question about the price of oil but also about national security.\n  Americans are hurting from our addiction to oil, but I am not sure \nthey fully realize the extent our national security; and indeed our \nvery way of life, is threatened by our reliance on foreign oil.\n  Every year we send hundreds of billions of dollars overseas for oil \nto pad the coffers of many nations that do not have our best interests \nat heart, and to some like Venezuela, whose leader has threatened to \ncut off oil.\n  In fact, in 2007, we spent more than $327 billion to import oil, and \n60 percent of that, or nearly $200 billion, went to the oil-exporting \nOPEC nations. In 2008, the amount we will spend to import oil is \nexpected to double to more than $600 billion, $360 billion of which \nwill come from OPEC. Let's take a moment to put those import figures \ninto context. When compared to our Fiscal Year 2008 budget for our \nNation's defense, which was more than $693 billion, the $600 billion we \nwill spend to import oil in 2008 is nearly equal to our entire defense \nbudget.\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\n  There is no question that our dependence on foreign oil has serious \nnational security implications. In addition to funding our enemies--as \nI just explained--we cannot ignore the fact that much of our oil comes \nfrom and travels through the most volatile regions of the world.\n  A couple of years ago I attended a series of war games hosted by the \nNational Defense University. I saw firsthand how our country's economy \ncould be brought to its knees if somebody wanted to cut off our oil.\n  In 2006, Hillard Huntington, executive director of Stanford \nUniversity's Energy Modeling Forum testified before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, and stated that based on his modeling, ``the odds \nof a foreign oil disruption happening over the next 10 years are \nslightly higher [than] 80 percent.'' He went on to testify that if \nglobal production were reduced by merely 2.1 percent due to some event, \nit would have a more serious effect on oil prices and the economy than \nhurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  And our dependence on foreign oil is even more troubling when you \nconsider our Nation's financial situation.\n  The national debt stands at $9.3 trillion, almost double the $5.4 \ntrillion debt that existed when I came to the Senate in 1999. By the \nend of 2009, the national debt is expected to have grown to $10.5 \ntrillion.\n  In July, the Office of Management and Budget projected a $389 billion \nbudget deficit for 2008. And this week even worse numbers came from the \nCongressional Budget Office. CBO said the Federal Government will \nfinish the fiscal year with a near-record deficit of $407 billion.\n  These numbers, however, do not include borrowing from the Social \nSecurity trust fund and other trust funds to the tune of $184 billion. \nSo the real operating deficit is actually projected at $591 billion--\nalmost three times the $219 billion deficit projected at the start of \n2008.\n  We cannot overlook our ballooning national debt. Today 51 percent of \nthe privately owned national debt is held by foreign creditors--mostly \nforeign central banks. That is up from just 6 years ago. Foreign \ncreditors provided more than 70 percent of the funds that the U.S. has \nborrowed since 2001, according to the Department of Treasury. And who \nare these creditors?\n  According to the Treasury Department, the three largest foreign \nholders of U.S. debt are China, Japan, and OPEC nations. With the debt \nskyrocketing to 10.5 trillion in fiscal year 2009 and the plight of our \nfinancial markets we can expect an even greater involvement by these \ncountries in purchasing our debt.\n  This is insane and it has to stop. We can not afford to allow the \ncountries that control our oil and our debt to control our future. It \nis time that we took our future into our own hands.\n  Let's take a moment to think of our Nation like a business. Our \nfeedstock is oil, and our competitors control the supply and price of \nour oil. We have debt, but our competitors also control our debt. \nWhat's to keep our competitors from raising prices, calling in our debt \nand running us out of business?\n  I imagine that many have yet to hear of this, but it has been rumored \nthat countries like China, with large financial holdings in Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, pressured Secretary Paulson to bail out the \ncorporations, by threatening to reduce their security holdings.\n  This is a very real example of how not only our foreign policies, but \neven domestic policies can be stymied due to reckless fiscal policy. I \nhope it frightens you as much as it frightens me. It certainly has \ndramatic effects in the present, but portend what it does for our \nchildren and grandchildren futures which we continue to mortgage with \nthe irresponsible use of their credit card.\n  But also keep in mind, that as we sit here and twiddle our thumbs \nover simply expanding domestic drilling within our own borders, Russia \nand China are actively and aggressively laying claim to energy \nresources around the globe.\n  Russia, the world's second biggest oil exporter, is trying to lay \nclaim to large section of the Arctic seafloor that is believed to \ncontain billion of barrels of fuel equivalent. The country has also \nmade moves to control a larger portion of the world's natural gas \nreserves. Russia, which has significant reserves of natural gas, is \nconsidering the creation of a natural gas cartel similar to OPEC. \nVenezuela and Iran have expressed interest.\n  Russia has proven it has no qualms with using energy as a weapon. In \n1990, Russia tried to suppress independence movements in the Baltics by \ncutting energy supplies. In all, Russia has used energy as a tool to \nfurther their foreign policy goals on no less than six countries over \nthe last 15 years. And energy is believed to be one of the driving \nreasons for Russia's military action in the independent nation of \nGeorgia, through which passes a critical oil pipeline.\n  China as well is moving ahead in securing its energy future. In \nAfrica, China is handing out loans and funding expansive infrastructure \nprojects in an effort to lay claim to lucrative oil reserves. With the \nhelp of Chinese investment, Angola recently passed Nigeria to become \nthe largest petroleum producer on the continent.\n  Can you imagine these countries scratching their heads in disbelief \nwhen they see the U.S. with the largest energy reserves in the world \ndebating to drill or not drill?\n  My friends, we have allowed the environmental lobby to run wild. As a \nresult, we have had a tail wagging the dog environmental policy which \nhas ignored our energy, economy and national security interest.\n  And why did Congress let them get away with it? Because oil was cheap \nand some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were afraid of \nthe 30 second commercials that would be run against them if they didn't \ntoe the environmental line.\n  Now the chickens have come home to roost. Ask any Ohioan about the \nhigh price of gasoline. They will give you an ear full. Many of them \nhave told me about how both the price of gasoline and the price of \nnatural gas are affecting them where it hurts, right in the pocketbook \nand in their quality of life. These are the middle class Americans, the \nelderly and the poor that my friends on the other side of the isle keep \ntalking about.\n  Addressing this crisis requires nothing less than a Second \nDeclaration of Independence--to move us away from foreign sources of \nenergy in the near term and away from oil itself in the long term. To \ndo this I believe we must find more, use less, and conserve what we \nhave. As T. Boone Pickens said, ``we need to do it all.''\n  In order to find more and stabilize our Nation's energy supply we \nmust enact policies to increase responsible development of our abundant \nAmerican resources.\n  The fact of the matter is that when you take into account our \nuntapped oil shale reserves, we have more oil resources than any other \npart of the world. The Department of Energy estimates that America's \ntotal oil shale resources could exceed 2 trillion barrels of oil \nequivalent, and there are currently 800 billion barrels of proven \nreserves. This is three times larger than the total proven oil reserves \nof Saudi Arabia.\n  Further, the majority of conventional resources are locked up due to \nshortsighted congressional moratoria. Eighty-five percent of our \noffshore acreage and 65 percent of our onshore acreage is off limits.\n  I was very embarrassed when our President went over to Saudi Arabia, \njust a few months ago, with hat in hand to beg for them to increase oil \nproduction. And last month I spoke with oilman T. Boone Pickens, who \nwas recently in Saudi Arabia. He said they asked him, ``Why is your \ncountry asking us for oil, why aren't you exploring your own?''\n  The Saudis couldn't have been more right. Rather than begging foreign \ncountries for their oil, we need to be utilizing our own. That means \nopening up areas like the Outer Continental Shelf and ANWR for oil \nexploration. And that means capitalizing on our vast reserves of coal, \noil shale, and tar sands.\n  While we must increase our production of fossil fuels to relieve \ncosts and reestablish our independence in the short term, in the long \nterm we must reduce our demand for oil.\n  And with that goal in mind, it is essential that we explore \nalternative means to meet our Nation's energy needs.\n  It is long past time for our government to provide the spark to \nrekindle\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\nour Nation's creativity and innovation. Following Russia's launch of \nSputnik, President Kennedy challenged our country in 10 years to be the \nfirst in the world to land a man on the Moon. And it was Neil \nArmstrong, an Ohioan, who did it. If we can put a man on the Moon, \nthere is no reason why we cannot be the first country in the world to \nnot have to rely predominantly on oil for our transportation needs.\n  It is time we undertook a similar Apollo-like project to establish \nclean, reliable and domestically abundant energy alternatives and in \nturn usher in a new era of American freedom and independence.\n  And through this new Apollo program, we must encourage further \nadvances in biofuels, electric-hybrid plug-in vehicles and fuel cells.\n  One of the best shots we have in significantly reducing our reliance \non foreign oil is plug-in hybrid vehicles. If half our fleet of 240 \nmillion vehicles were converted to electric-hybrids, we could reduce \nour oil imports by 4 to 5 million BPD. Just doing this could cut our \nreliance on foreign oil by 40 percent.\n  Americans today demand action. And they demand we come together in a \nbipartisan fashion to solve this crisis. I commend my colleagues in the \n``Group of 10'' on their efforts to find sensible solutions to this \ncrisis. While their bill is not perfect, it would be my hope that we \ncan continue to work together to move our country towards energy \nindependence.\n  Regardless of what one thinks of the specifics of the bipartisan \nproposal, this is the way we should be trying to get things done around \nhere--Senators of good will from both parties coming together, with \neveryone willing to give up a little of what they want in order to move \nthe country forward. My greatest frustration in the Senate is the \npartisanship and game playing. We must end the gridlock and put the \npeople's business first.\n  I honestly believe that the best message we can send to OPEC, those \ninvesting in the oil market, and indeed the entire world, is that we \nare mad as heck and won't take it anymore. We must demonstrate that we \nare going to find more by going after every drop of oil that we can \nresponsibly drill and that we are going to use less by undertaking a \nnew Apollo program, and continue to conserve and become more energy \nefficient.\n  I envision an America where in 10 years we have enough oil to take \ncare of our needs. I imagine an America that is the least reliant \nnation in the world on oil. An America where our economy is not \nthreatened, an America that has created thousands of jobs by finding \nmore and developing technologies that use less. It will be an America \nthat has gone from the bottom of the barrel to the top. Who's national \nsecurity is without threat because we have removed the potential of \nenergy being used as a ``weapon'' against us by those who do not share \nour values?\n  We must put aside our differences and come together to reaffirm our \nNation's independence for a second time. We can usher in a new era of \nprosperity and a guarantee that in the new global economy we will \nmaintain our position as the greatest military and economic power in \nthe world.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know it is getting late in the evening, \nand we are at the end of a long day for a lot of people in our country. \nI want to talk about not just the economic crisis our families and our \ncountry are living through right now, but also what we have seen over \nthe last couple of years, and certainly in the last 7 to almost 8 years \nnow.\n  I think it is instructive to look at where we were 7 years ago and \nwhere we are today. By virtually every indicator, it is a much tougher \nworld for a lot of families, especially working families and poor \nfamilies. On the one hand, you have an increase in the number of \nAmericans living in poverty; by one estimate, more than 5.5 million \nmore people. So now that number goes above 38 million Americans.\n  Health care, there are so many different ways to look at it. I know \nin my home State of Pennsylvania, since 2000, family premiums--the cost \nof health care for a family--are up by almost 50 percent, between 45 \nand 50 percent. If you look at it in another way, in terms of overall \nhealth care, we have seen these national numbers of 47 million \nAmericans uninsured right now in the country. Some say it dropped to 45 \nmillion. Whatever that number is--whether it is 45 million or 47 \nmillion--it is way too high.\n  I think the current administration has done nothing to address that--\nno leadership by the President, no prioritization of that issue as a \ncompelling national issue. There are 9 million American children with \nno health insurance, and the President vetoed the expansion of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, which, as the Presiding Officer \nknows, got almost 70 votes in this Chamber more than once.\n  There are so many different ways to look at these numbers. In the \nlast year, over 605,000 Americans lost their jobs. The mortgage crisis, \nthe foreclosure crisis is in the lives of so many families. I live in a \nState which, if you compare it to other States, relatively, has not had \nas much of a problem as some States such as California or Nevada or \nothers.\n  But in the month of August of this year--August of 2008--versus \nAugust of 2007, if you compare it month to month for those 2 years--\nAugust 2007 to August 2008--the foreclosure rate in Pennsylvania is up \nsome 60 percent, much higher than the national rate. So even in a State \nwhich has not felt the same effects, relatively, as these other States, \nnow the foreclosure crisis is closing in on places and on families in \nPennsylvania. In so many indicators, we can see it.\n  We can see it obviously on Wall Street in the headlines. I do not \nneed to repeat what we have seen in the newspaper. But I think when we \nlook at our own communities, we can see the same is true. I am not \ngoing to read all of this document. I am going to have it printed in \nthe Record. I am going to read the headline and ask that the document \nbe made a part of the Record: ``Recent major Pennsylvania plant \nclosings and/or layoffs.'' I ask unanimous consent to have this \ndocument printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Recent Major Pennsylvania Plant Closings and/or Layoffs\n\n\n                               Northeast\n\n       Luzerne County, Wilkes-Barre: Geisinger Health System in \n     South Wilkes-Barre is laying off 451 employees, primarily \n     those who work in inpatient services, by September 2008.\n       Luzerne County, Mountaintop: Fairchild Semiconductor \n     International is laying off 331 employees, this was announced \n     7/24/2008.\n\n\n                             Lehigh Valley\n\n       Lehigh County, Allentown: Mack Trucks Inc. is moving 800+ \n     jobs from Allentown to North Carolina when it consolidates \n     its headquarters by the end of 2009. This will be partially \n     offset when Mack moves 200+ jobs from Virginia into its \n     Macungie manufacturing facility by the end of 2008. This was \n     announced on 8/14/2008.\n\n\n                               Southeast\n\n       Montgomery County, King of Prussia: Idearc Media \n     Corporation laid off some 120 CWA members at the end of 2007 \n     from its facility in King of Prussia. The workers there \n     produced advertisements for the yellow-pages phone book. \n     Idearc moved this production to India and laid off half of \n     the 240 employed at this facility.\n       Bucks County, Warrington: MeadWestvaco Consumer Packaging \n     Group LLC is laying off 145 when they close their packaging \n     manufacturing plant in Warrington, which was announced on 5/\n     15/2008.\n       Northumberland County, Elysburg: Paper Magic Group Inc. is \n     laying off 312 employees when it closes its Elysburg \n     facility. This was announced on 1/4/2008.\n       Berks County, Reading: Hershey Inc. is laying off 274 when \n     it closes its Reading facility, announced on 3/14/2008.\n       Montgomery County, Fort Washington: Chase Home Lending is \n     laying off 266 employees, announced on 5/29/2008.\n\n\n                        Central and Southcentral\n\n       York County, York: Harley Davidson is laying off 300 as \n     part of a nationwide layoff of 730. The layoffs were \n     scheduled to begin this month.\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\n       Fulton County, McConnellsburg: JLG Industries is laying off \n     375 employees by September of this year. They produce heavy \n     aerial lifts and work platforms. It was announced in July \n     that they will be laying off 250 employees in McConnellsburg, \n     100 at Shippensburg, and 25 at Bedford.\n       Centre County, Bellefonte: Bolton Metal Products is laying \n     off 223 when it closes its Bellefonte facility due to \n     increased foreign competition. This was announced on 2/4/\n     2008. A letter under your signature was sent to the \n     Department of Labor in support of the workers when they were \n     denied TAA benefits. The workers then won the benefits on \n     their appeal.\n       York County, Red Lion: Yorktowne Inc. is laying off 349 \n     employees when it closes its plant #6 in Red Lion. This was \n     announced on 1/23/2008.\n       Lancaster County, East Petersburg: Sterling Financial is \n     laying off 325 employees in its East Petersburg facility, \n     which was announced on 4/15/2008.\n\n\n                               Southwest\n\n       Allegheny County, Bethel Park: Washington Mutual is laying \n     off 247 when it closes its facility in Bethel Park. This was \n     announced on 4/9/2008.\n\n\n                               Northwest\n\n       Erie County, Corry: Erie Plastics is laying off 189 \n     employees, announced on 2/15/2008.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. This is a brief summary of plant closings that involve \nhundreds of jobs in particular communities: Luzerne County--the county \nright next to my home county--451 employees at Geisinger Health System \nlosing their jobs; 331 employees at the Fairchild Semiconductor \nInternational plant being laid off. That was announced in July. In \nLehigh Valley, at Mack Trucks: more than 800 jobs being lost in our \nState and moving to another State. In Montgomery County--a very \nprosperous county in southeastern Pennsylvania--a corporation there \nlaying off 120 employees. In Bucks County, a company there laying off \n145 employees. In Berks County, Hershey Incorporated laying off 274 \nemployees. That is just in the southeast.\n  Then you go to central Pennsylvania. In York County, a plant there--\nHarley Davidson, in fact--laying off 300 employees; a plant in Fulton \nCounty--a very small county in Pennsylvania--laying off 375 employees.\n  It goes on from there: hundreds and hundreds of people losing their \njobs, just in some communities in Pennsylvania, just this year. So that \nis exhibit A in terms of job loss in Pennsylvania.\n  But also I think it gets back to this whole question of about what \nthe Congress can do. We look at what has been happening on Wall \nStreet--the loss of wealth, the loss of confidence--but what is \nhappening on Wall Street mirrors what has happened in the lives of a \nlot of families. When you lose your house--and because of foreclosure, \nyou are forced out of your home--you lose not only your home, the place \nyou live, the place your family lives--a sense of your own, and the \nreality, I should say, of your own net worth--but as much as all that, \nyou lose your dignity. So many families have lost that dignity. I think \nas much as we in the Congress, for the next couple of weeks and months, \neven leading into a new administration, will debate policies that \npertain to financial markets--what about credit, what about capital, \nall these terms, ``liquidity,'' the things we are hearing a lot about \nas they pertain to Wall Street--and regulation is going to be an \nimportant part of what we do--but as we debate all of those issues, I \nthink we have to get back to the fundamentals about why we are living \nthrough this nightmare.\n  Part of it is the failure of this administration to do something in \nan aggressive way about regulation. Part of it is greed. But what \nresulted from that greed and from that inability to regulate markets \nand to oversee mortgages in an appropriate way is the fact that we have \nforeclosures. So if the Congress wants to respond to this in a positive \nway, to get something done, we have to do something about foreclosures, \nto bring that number down, to keep people in their homes and thereby to \nstrengthen neighborhoods and our economy overall. If we keep \nneighborhoods strong, keep people in their homes, it will affect the \nwhole world's financial markets and certainly our economy.\n  So what do we do? Well, I think what we can do--there will be a lot \nof proposals about how to get there--but just broadly--and I will \nconclude with these thoughts--to get there broadly what we have to do \nis to say: If in the July legislation--which was not everything that \nall of us wanted; I know the Presiding Officer and I probably wanted a \nlot more in that bill than we got, but what we did in that bill was to \ncreate an opportunity for 400,000 people to stay in their homes by \ngetting the borrower and the lender in the same room, so to speak, to \nwork out a modification, to work out some arrangement to keep that \nfamily in that home. What we have to do is take that 400,000 and expand \nit exponentially to at least a million and, beyond that, if possible, \nto do everything possible to keep those families in their homes.\n  If there is nothing else the Congress does for the next couple of \nmonths but focusing on the prevention of foreclosures, we will have \ncontributed significantly to preventing some of the trauma we see on \nWall Street and, as we have been hearing over and over again, on the \nMain Streets of America in the lives of our families.\n  There are a lot of ways to do that. One of those strategies is making \nsure that the prevention of predatory lending is a higher priority. But \nI think focusing on individual mortgages and the relationship between \nan individual lender and that homeowner is going to be critical to \nthis. So we have to expand what we have already done and do more on \nkeeping people in their homes.\n  We will talk more about it. But do you know what. All the answers to \nthese questions do not simply reside in what we talk about in the \nSenate or what happens in the House or here in Washington. A lot of \ngood ideas are coming from our communities.\n  I point to one example. In Philadelphia--one of the places in \nPennsylvania where the foreclosure rate has been far too high, even \nthough other places have escaped it so far--in the city of \nPhiladelphia, the court system, Judge Darnell Jones, and others, the \nmayor of the city, Michael Nutter, a very effective and capable mayor, \ncame together with activists and people who understand how to keep \npeople in their homes and said: Let's develop a program at the local \nlevel, and let's try to implement it.\n  They developed the Residential Mortgage Foreclosure Diversion Pilot \nProgram. I have spoken about this before. But it is a kind of example \nwe should expand upon and use as an example to keep people in their \nhomes. In a word or two, it is an early intervention program. Instead \nof letting these mortgages go so far out of control where someone \ncannot stay in their home, they intervene earlier. The courts are able \nto facilitate loan workouts and other solutions to keep homeowners and \ntheir families in their homes.\n  It is an effort, as I said before, by the city and the mayor's \noffice, Mayor Nutter, of being able to bring together housing \nadvocates, volunteer attorneys, lenders, and servicers who all share \nthe same goal of keeping people in their homes.\n  Now, the interests of these groups are divergent, but they have set \naside those differences, and they realize that stemming the tide of \nforeclosure helps everyone. It obviously helps the homeowner and the \nfamily and the community. But it also helps lenders and, in a very \nsubstantial way, our economy.\n  So that is one example. We will talk more about it later in detail. \nBut we need to enact policies that make sure those kinds of good \nexamples coming from our communities become part of national policy. If \nwe do that--if we are able to keep more and more, instead of 400,000 \npeople staying in their homes, we make that 1 million, or even higher \nthan that; if we do that, I think we can begin to stabilize the root \ncause of a lot of our problems.\n\n  In addition to that, we have to do more in regulation. We have to do \nmuch more in holding government agencies accountable that should have \nbeen the cop on the beat, so to speak, when it comes to what happens to \nlending practices and to mortgage practices.\n  So there is much to do, but I think the best thing we can do is focus \non the root cause of this, which is foreclosures and the prevention of \nthose foreclosures through counseling, through good programs, and \nthrough bringing people together at a time of real stress in the life \nof families. I think we can do that. I think we have done that in the \npast. I think it is a bipartisan wish. What we are going to need here \nis leadership beyond the finger-pointing that we often see here in \nWashington.\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\n  So if we bring that spirit to this priority of stabilizing our \neconomy, I think we can move forward and have a much stronger economy. \nIf we choose not to and choose to focus on issues that will divide us \nwhen it comes to foreclosures, I think we are going to be off on the \nwrong track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9013-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY AND WATER COMMISSION TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today \nto express my sadness regarding the tragedy this week involving \nofficials with the International Boundary and Water Commission, IBWC. \nOn Monday, an airplane carrying U.S. Commissioner Carlos Marin; Mexican \nCommissioner Arturo Herrera; and also Jake Brisbin, Jr., Executive \nDirector of the Rio Grande Council of Governments; and Matthew Peter \nJuneau, the pilot, was reported as missing when it failed to arrive at \nits destination of Presidio, TX. Wreckage of that aircraft was located \nyesterday, and it was confirmed that there were no survivors. I offer \nmy condolences to the family members of all of the individuals who were \non the aircraft.\n  I would like to say a few words in particular about Commissioner \nMarin, who I had the pleasure of working with on a range of IBWC \nmatters in New Mexico. Commissioner Marin was appointed to his position \nby President Bush in December 2006 after 27 years of service to the \nCommission. Previous to that, he worked with the Bureau of Reclamation \nafter receiving a bachelor's degree in civil, engineering. He took over \nthe IBWC at a tumultuous time, and quickly gained the respect of his \ncolleagues and employees with calm and steady leadership of the agency. \nHe was a problem-solver, focused on the IBWC's mission, and someone who \nwas always readily accessible to my staff and me. Recently, my staff \nworked with him on the management plan for the Rio Grande in southern \nNew Mexico. Commissioner Marin was instrumental in moving this project \nalong after an impasse of many years. We will miss his effective \nleadership and his warm personality. My sympathies go out to his wife \nRosa and two adult children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9013-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate .gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       My family runs a purebred cattle ranch. Two years ago, my \n     oldest son decided he wanted to join us in the ranching \n     business, so we doubled our cowherd and made some changes. It \n     was a challenge to feed another family, but one we were \n     willing to take. Last year, we had to refinance the farm to \n     get a little breathing room, but within one year, the margin \n     we gave ourselves by refinancing was gone with the \n     skyrocketing cost of feed, fertilizer, and fuel--all as a \n     result of the cost of fuel. Now our power rates have \n     increased, also. There was not money in the budget for my son \n     and he had to take a job in town. Now I am left with twice \n     the work and half the help.\n       I have two other sons that stated recently a business \n     installing dairy lockups. They have taken on a lot of debt \n     for equipment and also have to support a family. Within just \n     a few months, they have seen the rising cost of diesel eat \n     into their business to the point that I think they will have \n     to take out bankruptcy and try to piece their lives together \n     afterwards. A pretty rough start for a 22-year-old newlywed \n     and an 18-year-old. They watch their spending, but right now \n     they are maxed out on their credit because of fuel costs and \n     cannot even afford to get to their job sites. All our \n     government officials need to be doing more. Absolutely open \n     up our own oil fields. We need more refineries and more \n     alternative fuel sources. I think hydrogen has excellent \n     possibilities. And Idaho is an excellent source of wind. \n     Something has got to be done and I mean now or this state \n     will blow away.\n     Mike, Gooding.\n                                  ____\n\n       Short term: gas prices, depending on how soon we can start \n     pumping oil, let us start drilling and refining here in the \n     US. Same with nuclear power.\n       Long term: Honda just announced a new hydrogen fuel cell \n     hybrid car that is three times as fuel efficient as the \n     current hybrids. Will not be ready for about ten years, they \n     say. Let us have these vehicles ready to purchase in three \n     years, not ten. Same with electric cars. And give these \n     businesses some kind of a [tax] break to keep the price of \n     these vehicles down so everyone can afford to buy them, not \n     just the movie stars in Hollywood!\n     Rick.\n                                  ____\n\n       Please put politics aside and get serious about solving the \n     energy crisis. You are the leaders of this country. You are \n     representing the country very poorly. I am so amazed and \n     ashamed of the way our leaders are putting themselves before \n     the good of the country. Our forefathers were patriots! There \n     are a few of you that are trying to solve the energy crisis. \n     Quit throwing road blocks in front of those people.\n       My husband and I are retired, and the high cost of fuel is \n     really hurting us. We live in a small town in Idaho, and we \n     do not have public transportation. It is not like living in a \n     city. Everything is spread out, so we have to drive almost \n     everywhere. We have no choice. We bought a fifth wheel and a \n     diesel truck when we retired. We planned on taking a summer \n     trip in our RV to the Oregon Coast, but that will not happen. \n     We just hope that we can take our RV to Arizona this winter. \n     We have saved all our lives for our retirement, and the \n     energy situation is wiping out our savings.\n       Let us see action [to back up the words we hear from our \n     leaders]. Get off of foreign oil and become independent. Do \n     the right thing and plan ahead. If it takes ten years to \n     develop domestic oil wells, then get with it. This is a \n     serious problem that is really hurting Americans.\n     Linda, Fruitland. \n                                  ____\n\n       I am concerned about the price of energy. Gas prices have \n     gone up, and this is disconcerting and expensive. I am a \n     mother of three and a devoted conservative. Last year we made \n     plans to take a vacation on the Oregon coast this summer. \n     Since we made those plans, gas prices have almost doubled. \n     Now that we paid our deposit on the beach house, we cannot \n     really back out, and it is still unaffordable to fly a family \n     of five there, but we are afraid it is going to cost $600-900 \n     in gas just to get there. When we made our plans, we were \n     thinking more in the $300-400 range. But if this sounds bad, \n     my brother and his wife who are going with us, both \n     schoolteachers, with their six kids between the two of them \n     (it is a blended family) will have to take two cars. So what \n     was once a fun affordable summer vacation is now in the \n     ridiculous range, just to get there, without food or hotel or \n     fees for anything fun.\n       Why can't we drill for oil here in America? Why is our dirt \n     so much more sacred than the dirt in the rest of the world? \n     Let us look in our own country's wealth of resources to \n     address this issue.\n       I am also highly supportive of exploring all our other \n     resources: nuclear, water, wind, coal, etc. I know there are \n     Native American reservations that want to build nuclear \n     plants and they have been forbidden because of safety \n     concerns. They should be allowed to build these plants, and I \n     believe Americans are committed to the safety of our citizens \n     in the process of exploring these other options. I am all for \n     nuclear energy, with it is cost effectiveness and \n     cleanliness.\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\n       I also believe here in Idaho we should be jumping at the \n     chance to expand our public transportation in the form of a \n     light-rail train. At this time of expensive gas, it would \n     really be serving our community if we as citizens could look \n     ahead and vote for it. I have lived in Utah and utilized \n     their light rail (it runs full nearly every run) as well as \n     traveled throughout Europe on their train systems. The \n     convenience of traveling to downtown Boise from Meridian, or \n     to BSU would be great. Not having to worry about parking or \n     gas is wonderful. Can you imagine what this would do for the \n     students of the valley if they could take the train to BSU? \n     It was about four years from the time Utah voted it in until \n     they could actually ride it. Let us begin!\n       Thank you for taking this issue seriously. Let us drill, \n     let us build a train, and let us build a nuclear plant here \n     in Idaho.\n     Tawna, Meridian. \n                                  ____\n\n       [Partisan policies have kept this issue from being resolved \n     for many years.] The solution has been very obvious for a \n     very, very long time. Simply ``explain'' to the oil companies \n     that they have a choice. That is to either pay a huge \n     windfall tax, or to immediately invest those windfall profits \n     in new drilling in all the areas we already know we have \n     an abundance of oil--and, by the way, process the huge \n     supply of oil shale--if you recall, they said, ``when oil \n     gets to $50 a barrel, it would be profitable!'' Well, what \n     have they been waiting for?!\n       By the way, just the mention of this will cause the price \n     of oil to drop $50 a barrel, if not more! But [there is too \n     much special interest and environmentalist influence to take \n     this simple solution.]\n       Plus, once you have that in place, the economy and the \n     dollar are immediately strengthened. The next obvious step is \n     to mandate that corn and other food stuffs will not be used \n     for fuel, such as ethanol. There are many byproducts and non-\n     food stuffs that are easily accessible and readily available \n     that will produce that which is now obtained from corn. \n     Consequently, not only will the price of gasoline, diesel and \n     home heating fuels, etc. drop drastically, but the price of \n     food and other products will drop back into line.\n       Of course, this would require that [partisanship be put \n     aside and that small minorities and special interest groups \n     take a back seat to the public interest.] Take action and set \n     this country back on track and bring its economy back under \n     control.\n\n                 Like to hear from yuh . . . good luck,\n\n     Bruce.\n                                  ____\n\n       Gas prices have affected my family. How have we responded? \n     We have chosen to conserve energy by driving less! We bike as \n     much as possible, and are more mindful of when and where we \n     choose to drive. In addition we drive relatively fuel-\n     efficient vehicles. I disagree with the notion that we need \n     to invade every last corner of our wonderful country in order \n     to try to squeeze as much oil out of our domestic reserves as \n     possible. That approach seems very short sighted to me. \n     Clearly the heyday of cheap, readily available oil is over. \n     Not only is oil bad for the environment, but it is not \n     renewable. Our focus must be first on conservation. We should \n     be focusing on increasing mass transit opportunities in Idaho \n     and across the nation. We should also work on developing and \n     rewarding businesses that are developing new, innovative \n     green technologies such as electric cars. Secondly, we must \n     be focusing on clean, renewable energy resources such as \n     solar and wind power. But the major emphasis must be to limit \n     the wastefulness that we have become accustom to in this \n     nation.\n     Kristin, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       This has been a great concern to our family and we have \n     wondered why there has not been more help from our government \n     with this problem. If it were just the gas prices it might be \n     something we could struggle through, but everything has \n     increased in cost, much of which, I believe, is a direct \n     result of the skyrocketing gas prices.\n       Our family is a blended family. We live in Rexburg, Idaho, \n     but transfer children on two weekends to Logan, Utah, and on \n     the other two weekends to Salt Lake City, Utah. At least this \n     is what we are supposed to be doing. We were already spending \n     around $300-$400 a month in gas before the prices jumped so \n     high. We had to cut back our visits because we started going \n     more and more in debt just to put gas in our car. It became a \n     choice of securing our family relations and seeing some of \n     our children or putting food on the table, maintaining a \n     relationship with sons and daughters or keeping ourselves \n     from going bankrupt. There are children we see sometimes less \n     than once a month because of this. We cannot attend their \n     school plays, their sports events, and have even missed their \n     first dates and dances. There has been nothing we can do \n     about it and it has been very emotionally painful for all of \n     us. My last trip to Salt Lake cost $177 in gas. It made me \n     sick to have to spend that much just so I could see my \n     daughter graduate, and as I sat at the pump watching the \n     numbers climb, I knew I was just going farther into debt but \n     I could not imagine missing that event.\n       Please, please keep trying to find an answer. We have fuel \n     resources here. Why are not we using them? Yes, we need to \n     protect the environment, but I do not think that will matter \n     much to anyone if we cannot buy food or drive to work. I see \n     articles all the time about cars that run on water or even \n     air. Is this true? If it is, why are they not available to \n     us? I believe there are answers and alternatives that do not \n     require using our food crop to fill our cars. I do not know \n     all the facts or have all the answers, but I do know that \n     we cannot continue this way. It will not take long to \n     become a bankrupt nation if we do not make some changes \n     and fast. Thank you for trying to resolve this.\n     Beverly, Rexburg.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have lived and worked as an auto mechanic in Boise for \n     nearly 30 years. A couple of years ago I became ill and \n     suffered some physical damage, which has forced a change in \n     professions. I have taken some schooling and become an \n     instructor of auto mechanics.\n       Finding a job as a new automotive teacher has been a \n     challenge, as there are few opportunities scattered around \n     the Treasure Valley. I now begin my second year of teaching \n     for the Canyon Owyhee School Service Agency, a consortium of \n     five small rural school districts. I am required to travel \n     among Parma, Notus, Wilder, Marsing, and Homedale High \n     Schools. I am proud of the students I am training, and feel \n     that I have found a worthy role to play in the lives of our \n     youth. The catch is that I must drive about 120 miles per \n     day. Because only one of these schools is equipped with an \n     actual auto shop, I must carry with me substantial weight in \n     tools, auto parts, training devices, and I have even towed \n     cars from time to time.\n       My transition to teaching may seem like a logical move for \n     a man in my physical situation, but it has cut my income \n     considerably. I also carry the burden of residual medical \n     bills and the cost of the continuing education required for \n     my teaching credentials. I do receive a small mileage \n     allowance, for miles driven within the district, but those \n     are about half of the miles I drive. (Miles to and from my \n     home in Boise are excluded.) Obviously, rising fuel and \n     maintenance costs have substantially contributed to economic \n     hardship as I struggle to rebuild some kind of a career. Fuel \n     has risen in price more than eighty cents per gallon \n     throughout this past school year, so I now must pay about $14 \n     each day, out of pocket, for my daily commute. I fear that \n     between the real issues of an inadequate teaching salary and \n     skyrocketing fuel costs, despite my efforts to remain a \n     productive citizen, I will be forced out of my home, or even \n     into unemployment lines.\n     Kelly, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My family and I have been affected in surprising ways by \n     the increase in oil prices. We have always tried to be \n     careful and conservative in our use of all of our country's \n     resources and oil and gas are no exception. So it was a \n     surprise to us that when our car's gas price went up above $4 \n     per gallon, we were suddenly more thoughtful about how and \n     when we drive the car. We had thought we were as conservative \n     as we could comfortably be with the amount we drove the cars, \n     but it turns out that, overnight, we thought of many ways and \n     times that we could leave the car in the garage and take the \n     bus or ride a bike or even combine multiple trips into one \n     weekly trip. It is only been a short time that the change has \n     occurred and it has been in the summer time that offers many \n     options. However, we are very pleased with the changes and \n     are even considering getting rid of one of our cars as it \n     they are both now sitting in the garage so much of the time.\n       I hope that this state and nation takes on the challenge of \n     giving greater and greater incentives to alternative/\n     renewable energy production and that we can work toward \n     reducing greenhouse gases that this country is producing at \n     such high rates. We are a country full of creative citizens \n     and technological skills. I hope that we can start being a \n     leader in this area rather than the most slow of followers. I \n     know that this has not been your perspective but I hope that \n     you can see the advantages to our citizens and growing \n     technological community in supporting future climate change \n     incentive and decentive bills.\n     Elizabeth.\n                                  ____\n\n       I now have a choice--medicine or gas, doctor appointment or \n     gas; I cannot afford both, health or gas. Guess I could go on \n     welfare and live off of the state. I drive ten miles to work, \n     my husband drives 30 miles (both one way). We could move, but \n     try to sell a house in this economy. So the middle class is \n     out of luck again. Please do something.\n     Jo.\n                                  ____\n\n       Since the fuel price increases have become a part of my \n     day-to-day concerns, I have observed a $240 increase in my \n     monthly spending in fuel for my vehicle. I only use my \n     vehicle to go to work. I buy groceries within two miles of my \n     work place, and that is the extent of my driving. My \n     groceries are running about 40% higher, but I am sure that it \n     something to do with using our tax dollars to subsidized the \n     corn growers to build the ethanol plants what are of no \n     significant value other than to help someone's friend make \n     money and secure their job. But I digress; the subject is the \n     fuel pricing and how it affects me. In the past, I would \n     commute to Boise once a week and enjoy a dinner out because \n     there are no restaurants in Mt Home that [I enjoy], but that, \n     too, has past because of the fuel pricing. I am sure there \n     are others in the same situation, and it must be hurting the \n     restaurants and all other businesses in that area because we \n     are dedicating our money to the rising fuel costs. \n     Nevertheless, I will go on cutting my spending to accommodate \n     the rising fuel costs until something\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\n     better comes along. No! I will not get rid of my Ford F-150 \n     because I am a tall person and require the leg and head room. \n     I know that comes at a price but I would rather do that than \n     to sacrifice the comfort.\n     Stephen, Mountain Home AFB.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9015-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE POLYNESIAN VOYAGING SOCIETY\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \nPolynesian Voyaging Society. For more than a quarter century, members \nof the Polynesian Voyaging Society have dedicated much of their lives \nto voyages of exploration and discovery that have retraced every major \nmigratory route of the ancient Polynesians. These voyages are not \nrecreational but rather journeys that illustrate the scientific prowess \nof the Polynesian people and the strong connection between science and \nculture. Their commitment to the legacy of oceanic exploration seeks to \nintegrate traditional voyaging into quality education. The Polynesian \nVoyaging Society has renewed interest in maritime exploration and \nreawakened Native Hawaiian pride in environmental awareness and ocean \nstewardship.\n  In today's age of modern technology, much can be learned from the \npast. Hawaii's past and future will always be intimately tied to the \nocean for recreation, commerce, and transportation. The society \nexemplifies the importance of raising awareness of and protecting the \nunique treasures Hawaii's culture offers, and serves to enlighten a new \ngeneration of young people. Its members are truly a testament to \nHawaii's oceanic heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9015-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PROTECTION FROM CHILD PREDATORS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I joined as a cosponsor of two \nbills to protect children: S. 1738, the Combating Child Exploitation \nAct; and S. 519, the Securing Adolescents from Exploitation-Online--\nSAFE--Act.\n  I am cosponsoring S. 1738 to signal my support for this bipartisan \neffort to create a nationwide network of highly trained law enforcement \nexperts to track down and prosecute child predators who exploit \nchildren, but it is my hope that Congress would enact the modified \nversion of this legislation that was included in bills separately \nintroduced by the majority leader--S. 3297--and Senator Coburn--S. \n3344.\n  Unfortunately, both bills have been held up by partisan gridlock \ndespite widespread support on both sides of the aisle. In fact, the \nHouse version of the SAFE Act--H.R. 3791--passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 409-2 in December 2007. That is why I \nbelieve that both bills H.R. 3791 and the modified version of S. 1738 \ncould pass by unanimous consent if they were called up and passed \ntogether.\n  It is time to stop playing politics, bring these bills to the Senate \nfloor and let the Senate approve them. Child exploitation is too \nimportant a problem to get caught up in partisan politics. I urge the \nmajority leader to call up and pass these two bills without delay, and \nwithout either being attached to other legislation that could prevent \nthem from becoming law.\n  I can't think of a more bipartisan step for the Senate to take this \nmonth than ending this impasse and passing these two worthwhile bills \nto protect children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9015-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RED RIBBON WEEK\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Murkowski, in cosponsoring a resolution commemorating Red \nRibbon Week. Red Ribbon Week, observed October 23-31, encourages \nindividuals, families, and communities to take a stand against alcohol, \ntobacco and illegal drug abuse. During this week, students all over the \ncountry pledge to live drug and alcohol free.\n  The tradition of Red Ribbon Week, now in its 23rd year of wearing and \ndisplaying red ribbons, started following the assassination of U.S. \nDrug Enforcement Administration Special Agent Enrique ``Kiki'' \nCamarena. In an effort to honor his memory and unite in the battle \nagainst drug crime and abuse, friends, neighbors, and students from his \nhome town of Calexico, CA, began wearing red ribbons. Shortly \nthereafter, the National Family Partnership took the celebration \nnationwide. Since then, the Red Ribbon campaign has reached millions of \nchildren, families, and communities across the country, spreading the \nmessage about the destructive effects of drugs.\n  In my State of Iowa, the theme for Red Ribbon Week is ``Ask me, See \nme, Be me . . . I'm Drug Free.'' Schools and community groups across \nthe State are organizing a variety of activities including pledges, \ncontests, workshops, rallies, theatrical and musical performances. \nThese events are all designed to educate our children on the negative \neffects of drugs and to promote a drug-free environment.\n  Research tells us that the longer children stay drug-free, the less \nlikely they will become addicted or even try illegal drugs. This is why \nit is so important to maintain a coherent antidrug message that begins \nearly in adolescence and continues throughout the growing years. Such \nan effort must involve parents, communities, and young people. Red \nRibbon Week provides each of us the opportunity to take a stand by \nhelping our children make the right decisions when it comes to drugs.\n  In light of the growing epidemic of prescription drug and cold \nmedicine abuse throughout the Nation, this year's Red Ribbon Week holds \ngreater importance. I hope my colleagues will join me in passing this \nresolution to demonstrate our commitment to raising awareness about \ndrugs and encourage everyone to make healthy choices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9015-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9015-S9016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  CONGRATULATING COASTAL WINDOWS, INC.\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the owners and employees of Coastal Windows, Inc., a \nfamily owned and operated business on Oahu and one of this year's \nrecipients of the 2008 Freedom Awards presented by the Secretary of \nDefense and the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard \nand Reserve.\n  Coastal Windows began their business in response to Hawaii's need for \nwindows and doors that could endure the harsh environmental climate of \nthe State's Sun, wind, rain, and salt air. They have been in operation \nfor nearly 20 years and in that time have grown to an organization \nconsisting of 62 employees. They are known for treating their employees \nas part of their ``ohana'' or family and are proud members of the \ncommunity.\n  The manner in which they take care of their employees who also serve \nin our Nation's Armed Forces should inspire all of us here in Congress \nand across this Nation. Take for example their employee U.S. Army \nsergeant Mike Echiverri, who is about to be deployed for the third time \nas a member of the National Guard. During his absence, Coastal Windows \nmaintains all his benefits, including health, dental, vision, and his \nretirement plans. He also continues to earn sick leave and vacation \ntime, and he is given additional time off to spend with his family \nbefore and after each deployment. Coastal Windows also often sends care \npackages to deployed employees and maintains regular communication via \ne-mail. The company also extends its support to family members of \ndeployed employees by staying in constant contact with the family \nmembers and ensuring that spouses are invited to social events.\n  Coastal Windows became actively involved with the Department of \nDefense's Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve, ESGR, program \nafter its vice president, Bob Barrett, learned of the organization's \nefforts to promote cooperation and understanding between Reserve \nmembers and their civilian employers. Mr. Barrett became an ESGR \nemployer outreach volunteer and works with ESGR Hawaii to educate \nemployers about the benefits of hiring Guard and Reserve members. \nCoastal Windows also supports the military community by participating \nin activities like the Marine Corps' Toys for Tots program.\n  As 1 of only 15 companies nationwide to receive this honor, I \ncongratulate Coastal Windows, and Mr. Bob Barrett in particular, for \ntheir dedication to their workers and for their selection as a Freedom \nAward recipient for 2008. They have set the standard in Hawaii as an \nexample of how the community can take care of our soldiers, sailors,\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\nairmen, and marines and their families and make a direct contribution \nto the national security of the United States. I salute them for their \noutstanding service and wish them continued success in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9016-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING ROBERT J. McCARTHY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthe memory of a dedicated attorney, community leader, and wonderful \nperson, Robert ``Bob'' McCarthy. Bob passed away on September 4, 2004. \nHe was 61 years old.\n  Born in New York City on December 31, 1946, Bob McCarthy spent his \nchildhood in the city, where he attended Regis High School in \nManhattan. Following his graduation in 1965, Bob attended Santa Clara \nUniversity, where he was a Presidential honors scholar and editor-in-\nchief of the school newspaper. In 1969, Bob received a B.A. cum laude \nin political science in 1969. While attending the university, Bob met \nhis future wife, Suzanne Bazzano, the office manager at the school \nnewspaper. They married in 1970 and had five children.\n  Following a stint in Chicago, where he earned his law degree from the \nUniversity of Chicago Law School, Bob and Suzanne moved to San \nFrancisco, Suzanne's hometown. Bob pursued a career in law, working in \nthe San Francisco office of the district attorney for 4 years, serving \nas chief deputy district attorney. In 1980, Bob started his own general \nlaw practice with his friend Lester Schwartz.\n  Throughout his career, Bob found the time to pursue his love and \npassion for politics. He served as general counsel for the California \nDemocratic Party from 1983-1990, and held a number of trustee positions \nwithin the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, including National \nFinance cochair. He also served as a close adviser and cochair of my \nown Senate campaign, and has also advised a number of other elected \nofficials in California. Bob was also well-known for the election day \nlunches that he hosted every year, a tradition among Bay Area \ndignitaries that wasn't to be missed.\n  In addition to the long hours Bob put in as an attorney, Bob carved \nout time to give back to his community. He was appointed by President \nBill Clinton to the Woodrow Wilson Center Board of Trustees; served as \na guest lecturer at Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley, and Peking University in Beijing, \nChina; sat on the board of St. Mary's Hospital; was a regent of St. \nIgnatius College Preparatory; and was also made a member of the Knights \nof the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem by Pope John \nPaul II.\n  Bob is survived by his mother, Dorothy McCarthy; his wife, Suzanne; \nhis sons Brendan, Matthew, Ryan, and Bobby; and daughter, Margaret. I \nextend my deepest sympathies to his family.\n  Bob McCarthy was a deeply loved community leader, both in the Bay \nArea and throughout the State of California, and he will be missed by \nall who knew him. Let us take comfort in knowing that his dedication \nand love for his family, friends, and community have made this world a \nbetter place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9016-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DON BOXMEYER\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, while my city of Saint Paul was \nenjoying its moment in the spotlight earlier this month, we were also \nmourning the passing of one of our great storytellers, Don Boxmeyer. \nThroughout his life as a reporter, columnist and author, Don discovered \nand brought out the human strength and variety of Saint Paul as no one \nelse has. That made him one of our most important citizens.\n  Don worked as a hard news reporter for the St. Paul Dispatch and the \nSt. Paul Pioneer Press, and wrote a column for over two decades. Here \nis how he described his career in his own words:\n\n       I realized that the interesting people and places nobody \n     ever wrote about held more fascination to me and my readers \n     than all the governors, mayors and city council members who \n     never seemed to be much persuaded by my opinions anyhow. I \n     began to collect hobos and hermits, bare-knuckled brawlers \n     and bread-baking nuns, short order cooks and hockey coaches, \n     drake mallards named Jake, and bridge tenders, band \n     directors, bear hunters and quiet old men who wept softly \n     when we talked about the friends they'd left on the \n     battlefield.\n\n  And he shared them with the rest of us with humor, respect and a love \nof the nobility of regular people.\n  In his book, ``A Knack for Knowing Things,'' Don collected many of \nhis best columns about Saint Paul and Minnesota. He wrote about Swede \nHollow in Saint Paul, the Rondo neighborhood destroyed by the \nconstruction of I-94 and Saint Joseph's Orphanage. He wrote about \nStillwater, Lake Superior and Ashby, MN, and hundreds of other places \nand the people who made them. If a new resident of our State or its \ncapital city asked me to tell them what kind of place they had moved \nto, I would just give them a copy of that book and let them discover it \nfor themselves.\n  Don Boxmeyer's life eloquently conveyed an important lesson: each of \nour communities has roots in the values and experiences of generations \nthat came before and we need to capture them before they disappear. His \noral history of places Minnesotans know well and events they only \nvaguely know about is a priceless gift to the future.\n  Somewhere I read about a moment of despondency in the life of Robert \nF. Kennedy as he mourned the death of his brother Jack. Attempting to \ncomfort him, someone said something like, ``It is tragic that he only \ngot to serve for 1,000 days, but that's as long as Julius Caesar served \nand we still remember him.'' Robert Kennedy replied, ``Yes, but Caesar \nhad Shakespeare to tell the story.''\n  Saint Paul and Minnesota are much the greater because we had Don \nBoxmeyer to tell our stories.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9016-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING DEBORAH LONG\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, it is my great honor to recognize \nPrincipal Deborah Long of Betty Kiefer Elementary School in Rathdrum, \nID. Deborah has been recognized as Idaho's 2008 recipient of the \nNational Distinguished Principals Award. The award is given jointly by \nthe National Association of Elementary School Principals and the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. Deborah is being recognized for her exemplary \nleadership in her job and in her community and contributions to her \nprofession, including professional association affiliations.\n  Deborah has established strong ties with parents and local businesses \nin Rathdrum. She has demonstrated exceptional leadership at Betty \nKiefer Elementary and in the community. She promotes a goal-oriented \nlearning environment for her students and expects great things from her \nstudents and her staff. In fact, under her leadership, Betty Kiefer \nElementary is both an Idaho School of Merit and a recipient of the A+ \nExcellence in Education Award. In today's world, young students need \nand benefit from a good role model and someone who cares for them. She \ncares about the learning environment itself the school is decorated \nwith floor-to-ceiling, hall-length murals that tell the story of a \nschool focused on principles, patriotism, pride in their State and \nkindness to others. Deborah has gone above and beyond the call of duty \nin her service as principal of Betty Kiefer Elementary School, in her \nwords, making her school ``safe, secure and caring.'' Students in this \nrural Idaho school are fortunate, indeed, to have the gift of Deborah's \nwisdom, encouragement and expectations of moral behavior and high \nintegrity. It says a lot about a principal when close to 100 percent of \nparents attend parent teacher conferences and a full 25 percent of \nparents volunteer at the school.\n  I am certain I share the sentiments of her students, their parents \nand her staff when I wish her congratulations and the best for \ncontinued excellence in her career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9016-4", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9016-S9017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING CONGREGATION BETH SHALOM\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, their Web site is called \nfrozenchosen.org. No kidding. Today I honor Congregation Beth Shalom of \nAnchorage, AK, an affiliate of the Union for Reform Judaism, on the \noccasion of its 50th anniversary. It is a pillar of Alaska's small but \nvibrant Jewish community.\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\n  Congregation Beth Shalom is one of five synagogues in the State of \nAlaska. Only two of those five synagogues enjoy the services of a full-\ntime rabbi. Congregation Beth Shalom is one of these two synagogues.\n  I am pleased to acknowledge and welcome Rabbi Michael Oblath, the \npresent Rabbi, who joined Congregation Beth Shalom in September 2007. \nHe is the fifth Rabbi to serve the congregation since its founding on \nSeptember 5, 1958. It is also appropriate to recognize the four other \nindividuals who have served as spiritual leaders to Congregation Beth \nShalom since its founding, beginning with Rabbi Lester Polonsky, Rabbi \nHarry Rosenfeld, Rabbi Johanna Hershenson, and Rabbi Fred Wenger.\n  Congregation Beth Sholom was first organized on September 5, 1958. It \nwas on that day that 20 people gathered in Burt and Bobbie Goldberg's \nhome to welcome the Shabbat and organize a synagogue. At the time, the \nonly Jewish services in Anchorage were being conducted by chaplains on \nElmendorf Air Force Base, and organizers wanted to establish a Jewish \nidentity for their children which were anchored to the city.\n  Today, Congregation Beth Shalom occupies a beautiful synagogue \nbuilding on East Northern Lights Boulevard, which opened 20 years ago \nto commemorate the 30th anniversary of the congregation's founding. The \nsynagogue houses the Joy Greisen Jewish Education Center, which \nfeatures a preschool open to the entire community, without regard to \nreligious affiliation, an afterschool arts program and a summer camp.\n  Congregation Beth Shalom has achieved Green Star recognition for its \nenvironmental and energy conservation efforts. Its Tikkun Olam program \nis engaged in numerous good works which help make Anchorage one of the \nbest places in our Nation to live and raise a family.\n  I am proud to recognize Congregation Beth Shalom on 50 years of \nservice to our southcentral Alaska community. We have great \nexpectations for your next 50 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9017-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING TOMMY L. HARBOUR\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I honor Tommy L. \nHarbour, a fellow West Virginian from Milton. He is a shining example \nof the self sacrifice and willingness to serve that is an important \npart of the culture of West Virginia. I am privileged to represent him \nand share his story with you today.\n  Tommy Harbour proudly served his country during World War II. He \njoined the Coast Guard on July 5, 1943, where he was assigned to the \nUSS Bayfield and served on the landing craft PA33-4. During the \ninvasion of Normandy, Mr. Harbour's landing craft first helped \nreinforce Omaha Beach with soldiers before making several more landings \non Utah Beach under constant gunfire from several fortified German \npositions. After the European campaign was over, Tommy continued to \nserve in the Pacific Theater. He and his fellow soldiers played crucial \nroles in the invasion of Iwo Jima and the invasion of Okinawa in 1945.\n  Following the war, Tommy Harbour was honorably discharged on May 27, \n1946, when he returned home to Milton, WV. Tommy went on to once again \nanswer the call of duty, serving as the mayor of Milton for 17 years. \nDuring his time as mayor, Tommy showed strong commitment to helping \nthose he served. Mr. Harbour had a reputation for thoroughly examining \nthe issues before him and ensuring the best possible course of action \nwas taken. As mayor, Tommy was approachable and always willing to \nlisten to people's thoughts and concerns. The enhancements he helped \norchestrate, such as flood protection and improving the police \ndepartment, will be attributes to Milton for years to come.\n  Tommy Harbour is an outstanding American and a true West Virginian. \nHe is a perfect model of the impact one man can have. Mr. Harbour has \nlived a life of service, always giving and never asking for anything in \nreturn. This story of his bravery and willingness to serve his \ncommunity is a great example of the accomplishments we are all capable \nof and I hope it has inspired my fellow colleagues and individuals \nnationwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9017-2", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING DR. EPHRAIM ZUROFF\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Dr. Ephraim \nZuroff and the Simon Wiesenthal Center for their efforts to track down \nthe last Nazi war criminals from World War II. Their work is enormously \nimportant, both in bringing the guilty to justice and preventing future \nacts of genocide. The statute of limitations does not--must not--expire \non crimes against humanity. Earlier this year, I introduced the World \nWar II War Crimes Accountability Act with Senator Nelson, which I hope \nwill help Dr. Zuroff and the Simon Wiesenthal Center in their noble \neffort.\n  One of the main targets of this effort is Milivoj Asner, who during \nWorld War II was the fascist police chief of Pozega, Yugoslavia. \nServing the Nazi-allied Ustasha regime in his native Croatia, Asner \npresided over the destruction of the local Jewish, Serb, and Gypsy \npopulations. After the war ended, Asner fled to Austria, where he lived \nin obscurity until he was finally charged with war crimes by Croatia in \n2005. His extradition has been delayed, however, by Austrian federal \nand local bureaucratic obstruction. Austrian authorities have claimed \nthat Asner is in poor health, though apparently that infirmity did not \nstop him from attending a Euro 2008 soccer game this past summer, where \nhe was spotted by a British newspaper. In light of this evidence, the \nlocal and national Austrian authorities must summon the political will \nto bring Asner to justice.\n  The Simon Wiesenthal Center launched Operation: Last Chance in 2002 \nto identify and assist in the prosecution of the remaining Nazi war \ncriminals still at large. Dr. Zuroff, who has been leading this effort, \nshould be highly commended for his outstanding efforts in bringing the \nmost guilty Nazis to justice. Of these, Asner is near the top of his \nlist.\n  Even today, the crimes of people such as Asner in the service of pro-\nNazi regimes strain our understanding of hate. National Socialist \nGermany today is an icon remembered only for its brutality, its mantra \nof genocide, and its culture of racism. And those last Nazis, who are \nwaiting out their last days under the coming twilight, must not be \nallowed to go quietly into the night, as did too many of their victims. \nFor the souls that were lost, and even more for those that remain, \nthere must be justice. I commend Dr. Zuroff and the Simon Wiesenthal \nCenter in the highest possible terms, and urge the U.S. Government to \ndo all it can to help them in their cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9017-3", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9017-S9018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ARMSTRONG-RINGSTED COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United \nStates, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools \nhave an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores \nare among the highest in the Nation.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes, today, to salute the \ndedicated teachers, administrators, and school board members in the \nArmstrong-Ringsted Community School District, and to report on their \nparticipation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize \nschool facilities.\n  This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction \nGrant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among \neducators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public \nschools. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 \nmillion for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school \ndistricts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair \nefforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building new \nschools or renovating existing facilities. In many cases, this Federal \nfunding is used to leverage public and/or private local funding, so it \noften has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district.\n  The Armstrong-Ringsted Community School District received a 2002 \nHarkin grant totaling $1 million which it used to help build an \naddition to replace a 1915 building. The new building includes a \nscience lab, an activity center/gymnasium and 10 classrooms. This\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\nschool is a modern, state-of-the-art facility that befits the \neducational ambitions and excellence of this school district. Indeed, \nit is the kind of school facility that every child in America deserves. \nThe district also received fire safety grants totaling $107,000 to make \nimprovements throughout the district.\n  Excellent schools do not just pop up like mushrooms after a rain. \nThey are the product of vision, leadership, persistence, and a \ntremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned \ncitizens. I salute the entire staff, administration, and governance in \nthe Armstrong-Ringsted Community School District. In particular, I'd \nlike to recognize the leadership of the board of education--Rod Foster, \nPaul Stevens, Howard Taylor, Betsey Ulrich, Don Looft and former \nmembers Marti Kindrick, Dale Anderson, Jan Hampton, Tom Mart, Greg \nBuum, Lisa McConnell, Greg Anderson, Anita Larsen, and Rick \nSteinberger. I would also like to recognize superintendent Randy \nCollins, former superintendent Robert Raymer, board secretary Deb \nObbink and building director Tom Mart.\n  As we mark the 10th anniversary of the Harkin school grant program in \nIowa, I am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings \nand facilities across the United States are in dire need of renovation \nor replacement. In my State of Iowa alone, according to a recent study, \nsome 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. The \nharsh reality is that the average age of school buildings in the United \nStates is nearly 50 years.\n  Too often, our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming \nsports arenas on weekends, but during the week go to school in rundown \nor antiquated facilities. This sends exactly the wrong message to our \nyoung people about our priorities. We have to do better.\n  That is why I am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in \nthe Armstrong-Ringsted Community School District. There is no question \nthat a quality public education for every child is a top priority in \nthose communities. I salute them, and wish them a very successful new \nschool year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9018-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BAXTER COMMUNITY EDUCATION\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

A bill to permit commercial vehicles at weights up to \n129,000 pounds to use certain highways of the Interstate System in the \nState of Idaho which would provide significant savings in the \ntransportation of goods throughout the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the \nIdaho Efficient Vehicle Demonstration Act of 2008. I am pleased that my \ncolleague, Senator Crapo, is fully supportive and an original cosponsor \nof this bill, and that an identical bill will be introduced today in \nthe House of Representatives by our colleagues, Representatives Mike \nSimpson and Bill Sali.\n  This is a bill that is very important to the State of Idaho. It is a \nbill that will improve the efficiency of freight movement within the \nState, provide significant economic benefits to a variety of local \nnatural resource-based industries, and establish a record attesting to \nthe safety of heavier, more efficient vehicles.\n\n[[Page S9028]]\n\n  The State of Idaho has long recognized the need to provide a more \nproductive means of freight transport. In light of that, the Idaho \nState Legislature created a pilot project in 2003 to allow vehicle \ncombinations weighing up to 129,000 pounds on designated routes within \nthe State highway system. As a result of this pilot project, Idaho has \nrealized significant economic benefits and has established a strong \nrecord of safety while utilizing more efficient vehicles.\n  Idaho's sugar beet, potato, grain, dairy and phosphate industries \nreported that participation in the pilot project resulted in reduced \nfuel consumption and equipment maintenance and increased productivity \nbased on estimates of five to eight percent savings in freight costs. \nAmalgamated Sugar Company reported 30,000 fewer truck trips, resulting \nin an estimated savings of just under $300,000.\n  This pilot project has been in effect for 5 years and no safety \nconcerns have been raised by the participants or by the Idaho \nTransportation Department in their initial report last year. In fact, \nsurvey responses from pilot project participants found that safety was \nthe same or greater due to the reduced numbers of trucks on the road. \nSimilarly, the pilot project has not been found to create a significant \nchange in pavement conditions when compared to previous years.\n  In light of this 5-year record, I believe it is appropriate and \nnecessary to make a very small, targeted expansion of this project by \nadding limited stretches of Federal highway to the existing State pilot \nproject to help connect our State and Federal roads so that the \nmovement of goods can proceed more efficiently in the future.\n  This small expansion is necessary for several reasons. Idaho's \nneighboring States of Montana, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming do not have \nsuch stringent limits on their Federal highways due to grandfathered \nrights. This puts Idaho at a distinct competitive disadvantage and \nslows the free flow of freight between neighboring States. This bill \nwould help to even that disparity in weight restrictions among our \nneighbors. It will also provide valuable data and information to the \nU.S. Department of Transportation as to the net beneficial effects to \nour infrastructure by requiring that road, bridge and accident \ninformation is gathered and reported.\n  This bill has the strong support of Idaho Governor Butch Otter, the \nIdaho Transportation Department, and the business community, including \nboth shippers and motor carriers. The Idaho Trucking Association has \nspecifically endorsed this proposal as have numerous shipper companies \nthat are based in my home State.\n  I recognize that there are significant challenges facing the freight \nindustry and, by association, our natural resource-based industries \nthat rely heavily on trucks to move their freight. Changes in truck \nemission requirements, a seemingly perpetual driver shortage, sustained \nhigh fuel costs, and increasing insurance premiums are only a few of \nthe challenges that face truck companies and struggling industries in \nIdaho. With that said, this is one step that can be taken to relieve \nsome of the burden on our freight industry, and do so in a safe, \neconomic and environmentally friendly fashion.\n  If enacted, this bill will improve safety by reducing the number of \ntrucks on Idaho roads. It will have a positive environmental impact by \nreducing diesel consumption and emissions. It will provide an economic \nboost to the State by reducing wear and tear on Idaho highways and \nimproving the competitiveness of our natural resource industries.\n  In light of the enormous task of reauthorizing our Nation's surface \ntransportation policy next year, it is important that proposals of this \nnature be allowed time to be discussed and vetted at length. \nUltimately, it is my hope that we might be able to make some targeted \nchanges to Federal weight restrictions in order to achieve significant \nenvironmental and economic gains while still keeping the highest regard \nfor safety.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to move \nforward this important issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 3517. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 and the Public Health Service Act to provide parity under group \nhealth plans and group health insurance coverage for the provision of \nbenefits for prosthetic devices and components and benefits for other \nmedical and surgical services; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Today I rise with Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa to introduce \nbipartisan legislation aimed at reducing disability in our Nation. As \nthe Congress moves this week to ensure the strength of the landmark \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, we must continue to work to ensure \nthat every American has the means to overcome physical impairment. I am \nhonored to be joined today by Senator Harkin--who has long championed \nthe ADA--as well as Senators Daniel Inouye, and Russ Feingold--as we \nact to ensure that those with group health insurance are able to access \nneeded prosthetic care in order to lead full and independent lives.\n  This year over 130,000 individuals will undergo amputation \nprocedures, often as a complication of diabetes or other chronic \ndisease. For such individuals an appropriate prosthetic limb reduces \ndisability and allows them to maintain employment and lead more \nproductive lives.\n  Today many amputees receive prosthetics through their coverage by the \nVA, Medicare, Medicaid, or S-CHIP. Yet too often individuals without \nsuch coverage find that their private plan requires copayments for a \nneeded prosthetic which they simply cannot afford, or imposes a \n``lifetime cap'' which prevents them from replacing an existing \nprosthetic when needed.\n  So with an estimated two million individuals living with limb \ndifferences or loss in the United States, the impact of severely-\nrestricted prosthetic coverage can be devastating. This is even more so \nfor the estimated 70,000 amputees under the age of 18. Sadly, we see \nthose children particularly affected as their growth increases the \nfrequency with which a prosthetic requires replacement. That can \nquickly exceed a parent's ability to meet copayment requirements--a \ncoverage cap may deny access to a replacement prosthetic.\n  So it is easy to see why 11 States--including my own State of Maine--\nhave enacted legislation to assure reasonable coverage of prosthetics, \nand why more than half of the States are now examining parity for \nprosthetics. Studies in different States have reported that the \nimposition of parity can be expected to raise monthly health plan \npremiums by approximately 12 to 50 cents a month. That low cost helps \nkeep amputees productive, and avoids shifting health costs to public \nprograms--simply because the needed prosthetic could not be obtained, \nand the individual saw their function and productivity decline until \nthey had to rely on public assistance.\n  That is so unnecessary and inappropriate. The legislation which we \nare introducing today--the Prosthetics Parity Act of 2008--will ensure \nthat group health plans treat coverage of such prosthetic devices on \npar with other essential medical care covered by health insurance. It \ndoes not mandate coverage, but it does assure than when it is offered, \nit is not so restricted or capped that it does not assure an amputee of \nthe prosthetic they require.\n  As we move forward to ensure greater opportunity and accommodation \nfor Americans with disabilities, it is so timely that we ensure the \nappropriate access to prosthetics to help reduce disability. I call on \nmy colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation to further the \nvision of greater opportunity for those with disabilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3517\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prosthetics Parity Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are more than 1,800,000 people in the United \n     States living with limb loss.\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\n       (2) Every year, there are more than 130,000 people in the \n     United States who undergo amputation procedures.\n       (3) In addition, United States military personnel serving \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world have sustained \n     traumatic injuries resulting in amputation.\n       (4) The number of amputations in the United States is \n     projected to increase in the years ahead due to the rising \n     incidence of diabetes and other chronic illness.\n       (5) Those suffering from limb loss can and want to regain \n     their lives as productive members of society.\n       (6) Prosthetic devices enable amputees to continue working \n     and living productive lives.\n       (7) Insurance companies have begun to limit reimbursement \n     of prosthetic equipment costs to unrealistic levels or not at \n     all and often restrict coverage over an individual's \n     lifetime, which shifts costs onto the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs.\n       (8) Eleven States have addressed this problem and have \n     prosthetic parity legislation.\n       (9) Prosthetic parity legislation has been introduced and \n     is being actively considered in 30 States.\n       (10) The States in which prosthetic parity laws have been \n     enacted have found there to be minimal or no increases in \n     insurance premiums and have reduced Medicare and Medicaid \n     costs.\n       (11) Prosthetic parity legislation will not add to the size \n     of government or to the costs associated with the Medicare \n     and Medicaid programs.\n       (12) If coverage for prosthetic devices and components are \n     offered by a group health insurance policy, then providing \n     such coverage of prosthetic devices on par with other medical \n     and surgical benefits will not increase the incidence of \n     amputations or the number of individuals for which a \n     prosthetic device would be medically necessary and \n     appropriate.\n       (13) In States where prosthetic parity legislation has been \n     enacted, amputees are able to return to a productive life, \n     State funds have been saved, and the health insurance \n     industry has continued to prosper.\n       (14) Prosthetic services allow people to return more \n     quickly to their preexisting work.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is te purpose of this Act to require that \n     each group health plan that provides both coverage for \n     prosthetic devices and components and medical and surgical \n     benefits, provide such coverage under terms and conditions \n     that are no less favorable that the terms and conditions \n     under which such benefits are provided for other benefits \n     under such plan.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe limitations on the deduction of interest by financial institutions \nwhich hold tax-exempt bonds, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, one of the credit crunch's most unfair--\nbut least-discussed--impacts is its severe curtailment of \nmunicipalities' ability to raise capital for critical infrastructure \nprojects. Because municipalities did not engage in the financial \n``innovation'' that led to this situation, they are merely innocent \nbystanders swept up in a national crisis. Congress must take swift \naction to mitigate the credit crunch's impact on U.S. municipalities. \nTo do so, I rise today to introduce the Municipal Bond Market Support \nAct of 2008. By relaxing outdated restrictions that prevent banks from \nacquiring municipal debt, the Act will significantly enhance demand for \nmunicipal bonds, thus aiding municipalities across the Nation--\nparticularly those in small and rural communities--in financing \nessential infrastructure projects. I thank my friend from Idaho, Mr. \nCrapo, a colleague on the Finance Committee, for joining me in \nintroducing this bipartisan legislation.\n  Federal policy has long recognized the critical role of municipal \nbonds in enabling communities to undertake critical investments. But \nthe liquidity crisis has dried up available capital for bonds, both \nmunicipal and corporate, at a time when the municipal bond market is \nalready reeling from other setbacks. The auction-rate security market's \ncollapse, which forced municipal issuers to refinance or convert more \nthan $80 billion of their total $166 billion in such securities, has \nalready cost municipalities more than $1 billion, thus pushing new \nmunicipal bond issuance out of reach for many municipalities. \nMeanwhile, when the Nation's two largest bond insurers were downgraded \nearlier this year, the underlying municipal bonds saw a corresponding \ndowngrade--a penalty for merely being ``wrapped'' in the downgraded \nfirm's insurance.\n  Taken together, these forces have driven yields on benchmark, 30-year \ntax-exempt debt to their highest levels since July 2004. These high \nrates have dramatically increased costs for municipalities facing \ninterest payments on outstanding floating-rate municipal bonds, while \nmaking it more costly for municipalities to issue new debt. In the \nfirst half of 2008, long-term municipal issuance dropped 4.1 percent \nover the prior year, and a further drop is predicted in the second \nhalf; for new issuances, the interest costs have vastly increased. \nGiven the credit crunch's severity, full recovery is probably a long \nway off. The timing could not be less opportune--the financial slowdown \nwill cause municipal budget deficits to balloon, just when the need for \ninfrastructure enhancements could not be more apparent.\n  Our bill, which largely mirrors a companion already introduced in the \nHouse by Chairman Frank and Chairman Neal of the House Ways and Means \nSelect Revenue Measures Subcommittee, would stimulate demand--and \ntherefore lower borrowing costs for issuing municipalities--by relaxing \nrestrictions on banks' ability to participate in the municipal bond \nmarket.\n  To understand the proposed changes, it is useful to briefly review \nthe tax code's current rules regarding banks' holding of municipal \ndebt. Prior to 1986, banks were generally permitted to deduct the full \ninterest costs they incurred unless a borrowing was incurred or \ncontinued to purchase or hold such bonds. Consequently, banks made up a \nsignificant share of the demand for municipal debt. But the 1986 tax \nreform eliminated this deduction for banks by requiring a pro-rata \ninterest expense disallowance, with a limited ``qualified small \nissuer'' exception that permits banks to deduct 80 percent of the cost \nof purchasing and carrying bonds of governmental entities that issue \n$10 million or less in municipal bonds in any calendar year. This \nexception was added because small issuers' infrequent and small \nborrowing amounts make it too costly for them to sell debt in the \nnational capital markets, leaving private placements with local banks \nthe most feasible and cost-effective alternative.\n  To increase demand for municipal debt, the bill makes two \nmodifications to these limitations. First, it would raise the bank \nqualified limit for small issuers from $10 million to $30 million, and \nthen index the new limit for inflation. Municipalities that issue \nbetween $10 million and $30 million will thus be able to raise capital \nthrough private placements. Because private placements generally carry \nno underwriting fees and require no offering document, the up-front \nissuing costs to municipalities are far lower than issuing debt on the \npublic markets. More critically, interest payments are far lower: \nInterest on such ``bank qualified'' debt averages 40 basis points, 0.40 \npercent, less than interest on nonbank qualified debt.\n\n[[Page S9031]]\n\n  Failing to raise the bank-qualified level from the amount set in 1986 \nhas real consequences for American communities. For instance, many \nsmall hospitals and healthcare facilities, even in small population \nStates, cannot take advantage of today's small-issuer exception because \nthey borrow through statewide authorities that issue bonds on behalf of \nmultiple institutions, thereby exceeding the $10 million limit. In my \nhome state, the New Mexico Hospital Equipment Loan Council tells me \nthat if the $10 million limit had instead been $30 million, then many \nhospitals in our state's rural communities would have been able to \nsecure funding to acquire additional hospital equipment, among them, \nSierra Vista Hospital in Truth or Consequences; the Prairie Meadows \nassisted living facility in Clovis; and the Las Cruces Mental Health \nCenter in Las Cruces. For each of these entities, the prospective \nborrower was instead forced to seek alternative, higher-cost capital \noptions--or could not secure funding to complete the transaction.\n  As another example, the City of Las Cruces would benefit from this \nbill. The city has had five debt issues in the last 5 years that \nexceeded $10 million. The financial advisor under contract to the City \nestimates that the difference in rates, with a higher limit on bank \nqualified debt, would be about 20 basis points--a savings that would be \npassed on to the taxpayers and rate payers in our community.\n  Second, as concerns municipalities that issue more than $30 million \nin debt annually, the bill would allow financial institutions to hold \nup to 2 percent of their total assets in such debt, without disallowing \na proportional amount of their interest expense deduction. This change \nis intended to restore bank demand and provide some stability by \nbringing this group of institutional investors back into the municipal \nmarket. Nonfinancial companies already benefit from this safe harbor, \nso in this regard, the bill creates parity. Many larger municipal \ninfrastructure projects have costs in excess of $30 million, and bank \ninvestment can only help these critical projects succeed.\n  Finally, it bears mentioning that this bill offers at least two \ncollateral benefits. First, enabling local governments to undertake \nadditional infrastructure investments will help to stimulate our \nchallenged economy. Second, by enabling banks to acquire municipal \nbonds--the safest class of security--the bill will enhance the \nstability of banks at a time that they face considerable financial \npressure.\n  I am pleased that this bill has been endorsed by a number of \norganizations, including the National League of Cities; U.S. Conference \nof Mayors; National Association of Counties; Government Finance \nOfficers Association; International City/County Management Association; \nNational Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers; \nNational Association of State Treasurers; Council of Infrastructure \nFinancing Authorities; Education Finance Council; and National \nAssociation of Health and Educational Facilities Finance Authorities.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with Senator Crapo and me in working \nto enhance liquidity in the municipal bond market.

A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to provide further \nprotection for puppies; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Puppy Uniform \nProtection and Safety Act, or PUPS Act.\n  In recent years, media reports have highlighted the cruel treatment \nof dogs raised by irresponsible breeders in large-scale commercial \noperations. The facilities operated by the most negligent owners are \noften referred to as puppy mills, because they churn out dogs the way a \nfactory would--with little or no respect for the animals' quality of \nlife.\n  Let me be clear, there are many responsible dog breeders across the \ncountry who care about and take great pains to properly look after the \nanimals in their care. Those breeders are not the target of this \nlegislation.\n  Unfortunately, the less scrupulous ``puppy mills'' threaten the \nreputation of the entire industry. The dogs bred or raised in puppy \nmills are often housed in cramped, dirty, wire cages. To maximize \nprofit, a breeder may stack cages on top of each other or keep the \ncages outdoors where dogs are exposed to the elements. The dogs may \nnever be given a chance to exercise or even walk on solid ground. Some \nanimals rescued from puppy mills show signs of malnutrition and \ndehydration, having been denied a sufficient supply of food and\n\n[[Page S9032]]\n\nwater. Puppies raised in these settings don't always have regular \nveterinary, and the breeding females are made to have litter after \nlitter of puppies.\n  Not surprisingly, this treatment has an effect on the physical and \nmental health of the animals raised in these facilities.\n  Veterinarians in Illinois have shared with me heartbreaking tales of \nfamilies who unknowingly purchased dogs that had been raised in puppy \nmills. Those dogs turn out to have serious health and behavioral \nproblems. By the time these conditions are diagnosed, the families have \nwelcomed the new puppy into the family and developed a strong emotional \nattachment. In some cases, the puppies could be treated, but often at \ngreat expense to their new owners. These families face very difficult \ndecisions.\n  Today, people can go on-line and research puppies available for \npurchase with the simple click of a mouse. You can't blame people for \nusing the convenience of shopping online, but some puppy mill operators \nadvertise on the internet so that they can bypass the pet store. That \nway, the breeder can avoid the Federal licensing requirements of the \nAnimal Welfare Act, which apply only to wholesale breeders. That means \nthat finding your puppy on-line may well increase the chance that \nyou'll be buying from a puppy mill.\n  The PUPS Act I am introducing today, along with Senators Feinstein, \nMcCaskill, and Wyden, would amend the Animal Welfare Act to require \nthat breeders obtain a license from the USDA if they raise more than 50 \ndogs in a 12-month period and sell directly to the public.\n  These licenses are inexpensive and the application process is simple. \nBut USDA licensing would allow the agency to ensure that large and mid-\nlevel breeders comply with minimum Federal standards. The PUPS Act also \nrequires all commercial breeders to give dogs in their care at least \ntwo daily exercise breaks, allowing the dogs to enjoy at least 60 \nminutes outside of their crates or enclosures.\n  The good news is that the public is growing more aware of the \nexistence of puppy mills. Recent investigations of the deplorable \nconditions at several large puppy mills along with the interest shown \nby celebrities, including Chicago resident Oprah Winfrey, have brought \nnew attention to the cause. As a result, many Americans seeking \ncompanion animals are doing their homework. They are choosing to adopt \nfrom local shelters or finding and visiting responsible breeders. It is \nmy hope that extending and improving oversight of this industry through \nthe PUPS Act will help Americans feel confident about the health and \nwell-being of the dog that they welcome into their family.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3519\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Federal Board of Certification to \nenhance the transparency, credibility, and stability of financial \nmarkets, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that will \nincrease the trustworthiness of our Nation's mortgage security market \nby creating the Federal Board of Certification for mortgage securities.\n  The recent collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the Federal Reserve's \nbailout of American International Group, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and \nBear Stearns, along the huge losses suffered throughout the financial \nindustry, demonstrates a catastrophic failure to accurately assess the \ndangers of imprudently made subprime mortgages to the American public \nand our financial markets. In hindsight, it appears that it was the \ninability to gauge risk in mortgage-backed securities that caused much \nof this financial turmoil. For markets to operate properly, it is \nimperative that they have effective metrics for calculating the level \nof risk securities pose to investors.\n  The secondary mortgage market has been a largely unregulated \nplayground where poorly underwritten, low-quality loans were sold as \nhigh-quality investment products. Although mortgage backed securities \ncan be a positive market force, which increases the available pool of \ncredit for borrowers, without an accurate picture of the risk involved \nin each mortgage security, buyers have no idea whether they are buying \na high-risk investment or a safe, secure investment. My legislation \nwould work to curb the excesses of the secondary market, combat future \nattempts at deception, and protect investors by making scrutinized \nmortgage investments more reliable and trust-worthy.\n  The inability of major corporations to properly assess the risk of \nthe mortgage securities they were trading is a problem whose effects \nhave not been confined to Wall Street. To put it simply: when big banks \nsneeze, the rest of America gets a cold. By 2009, more than a trillion \ndollars of the subprime mortgages originated during the housing boom \nwill reset to higher interest rates. Currently, according to the \nMortgage Bankers Association, 43 percent of subprime adjustable rate \nmortgages are already in foreclosure. In my home State of Maine, we are \nstruggling with falling home prices and a record number of \nforeclosures. Some Maine borrowers, with rising monthly payments, are \nunable to refinance out of their predatory loans. Small business \nowners, many already hurt by the economic downturn, are also finding \ncredit tight. The bad economic climate caused by the subprime credit \ncrunch is roiling the stock market causing Americans to loose billions \nin their IRAs and retirement funds.\n\n  We need to fix this crisis before it gets any worse and make sure it \nnever happens again. Francis Bacon said that ``knowledge is power.'' My \nbill would give investors the knowledge to make intelligent \ncalculations of risk and as a result, it would give them the power to \ndecide how much risk they could collectively handle.\n   Turning to specifics, my bill creates the Federal Board of \nCertification, which would certify that the mortgages within a security \ninstrument meet the underlying standards they claim in regards to \ndocumentation, loan to value ratios, debt service to income ratios, and \nborrowers' credit\n\n[[Page S9033]]\n\nstandards. The purpose of the certification process is to increase the \ntransparency, predictability, and reliability of securitized mortgage \nproducts. Certification would aid in creating settled investor \nexpectations and increase transparency by ensuring that the mortgages \nwithin a mortgage security conform to the claims made by the mortgage \nproduct's sellers.\n   The proposed Federal Board of Certification would not override any \ncurrent regulations and would not, in any way, stifle any attempts by \nprivate business to rate mortgage securities. This legislation would, \nhowever, create incentives for improving industry rating practices. \nOpen publication of the Board's certification criteria would augment \nthe efforts of private ratings agencies by providing incentives for \nincreased transparency in the ratings process. The Board's \ncertification would also serve as a check on the industry to ensure \nthat ratings agencies carefully scrutinize the content of mortgage \nproducts before issuing evaluations of mortgage backed securities.\n  Significantly, the Federal Board of Certification would also be \nvoluntary and funded by an excise tax. Users could choose to pay the \ncosts for the Board to rate their security, or they could elect not to \nsubmit their product to the Board.\n  We must quickly restore confidence in the U.S. mortgage securities if \nwe are to stabilize our housing markets and enable families to \nrefinance their expensive loans. To do this, we must certify the \nquality and content of our mortgage securities and enable those markets \nworking again to create liquidity and lending. This is why it is urgent \nto create the Federal Board of Certification for mortgage securities. \nThis legislation would create a ``good housekeeping seal of approval'' \nfor the mortgage security industry and certify that the mortgage \nproducts are in fact what they claim to be. Accordingly, I call on \nCongress to take up and pass this common-sense amendment as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  I encourage my colleagues to strongly support the creation of the \nFederal Board of Certification. This legislation will restore trust in \nU.S. financial markets and mortgage securities which will help American \nbusinesses and ultimately, most crucially, American families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3522\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I visited dozens of different \ncities in my home State, all of which have a variety of concerns and \nneeds. I found, however, one common theme throughout every town and in \nevery meeting I took. That theme was the need to do something about the \nhigh cost of energy.\n  High energy prices are hurting everyone, but they are especially \nimpacting the people of Wyoming. People in Wyoming are often forced to \ncommute long distances to get to work. Some have to drive miles for \ngroceries and general services that are common in larger cities. We \nneed to do something to make America energy sufficient and today I am \nintroducing my plan to make that happen.\n  My bill is titled Eight Steps to Energy Sufficiency, and it follows a \nsimilar model I have used before. It breaks down the deficiencies in \nour Nation's energy policy into eight separate areas and provides a \nsolution for those eight areas. It is a comprehensive approach, but it \nis broken down in a way that any one of the steps can be passed on its \nown merits.\n  First step--use less energy. The problem that we are facing today is \na supply and demand issue. We have too much demand for energy and not \nenough energy supply. My bill takes the approach that we can use less \nby aiding in the development of technology that will make vehicles more \nefficient.\n  Second step--find more American energy. Traditional energy sources \nmake up 85 percent of our energy portfolio today, and there is no way \nwe can transition to renewable energy over night. Because that is the \ncase, we should be focusing our efforts on developing as much American \nenergy as we can so that we can stop sending money to countries that \nare not necessarily friendly to the U.S. My bill does this by opening \nup the Outer Continental Shelf to energy development and ending the \nsenseless ban on oil shale development. These two actions will go a \nlong way toward making America more energy sufficient.\n  Third step--speed up the process. We can't get refineries built in \nthe U.S., even though we need them and so my bill includes a provision \nto help streamline the permitting process for refineries. In addition \nto that, it takes a look at the NEPA process in an effort to see how we \ncan limit senseless litigation that is slowing the production of energy \non already leased lands.\n  Fourth step--innovation. I am a huge believer in American ingenuity. \nEvery year, I hold an inventor's conference because I believe our \ncommunity of inventors will be key in solving our energy crisis. My \nbill recognizes this and helps move forward the development of hydrogen \ntechnologies. It also studies cellulosic ethanol to determine if we are \ndoing all that we can to help move non-corn based ethanol forward.\n\n  The fifth step of my plan deals with incentives. We need to \nincentivize the production of energy and we need to let people know \nthat the Federal Government is in it for the long haul by providing \nincentives that last for more than a year. My plan would reauthorize \nthe wind production tax credit for 5 years and it would renew the solar \nproduction tax credit for 8 years. It would repeal the Federal \nGovernment's theft of States' fair share of mineral royalties so that \nStates would be encouraged to allow for production on their lands. It \nis important that we help people who are doing their part, and making \nthese important credits available is one way to do just that.\n  The sixth step of my plan to strengthen America's energy supply deals \nwith our nation's most abundant energy source: coal. Wyoming is the \nNation's largest coal producer, and any realistic effort to make \nAmerica's energy supply more robust has to recognize that coal will \nplay a major role in making that happen. My bill provides funding for \nresearch and development to help develop and deploy carbon capture and \nsequestration technologies. It promotes using coal to make diesel fuel \nand allows the Air Force to enter into long term fuels contracts so \nthat our military has a secure source of jet fuel.\n  Nuclear energy must also play a role in making America energy \nsufficient, and the seventh step of my plan encourages the development \nof nuclear energy. The bill recognizes the important role Yucca \nMountain could play, and it offers up tax credits to help build new \nnuclear reactors. Wyoming is the Nation's largest producer of uranium, \nand because nuclear is a clean and efficient energy source, we should \nbe doing all that we can to move it forward.\n  Finally, the eighth step in my plan involves opening up a small area \nof Alaska's coastal plain to energy production. By opening up a portion \nof the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that is roughly the size of the \nNatrona County International Airport in Casper, Wyoming, we can produce \nabout a million barrels of American oil each day. The Energy \nInformation Administration recently sent a letter suggesting that the \naddition of 1 million barrels of oil a day to the market could drop the \nprice as much as $20 dollars per barrel, and we should act on this \nmatter expeditiously.\n  My bill is an eight step plan. I broke down my ideas for energy \nsufficiency into eight separate steps with the hope that each piece can \nbe passed by Congress as stand-alone legislation. In Washington, bills \nthat are smaller and more specific are much easier to pass than huge \npieces of ``comprehensive'' legislation because those big bills can \noften gain opposition very quickly, and before you know it they will \nnot pass. Whenever we try to push through big energy packages, nearly \nevery Senator objects to some aspect of it, and that means we are not \nable get enough people in support of the bill to pass it. By breaking \ndown my plan into sections, we have eight sensible solutions for \nCongress to consider, and if enacted, any one of them would ease the \nburden of high prices faced by consumers.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a look at my package and will work \nwith me to move forward with this important legislation. All summer, I \nheard about the importance of moving forward with energy legislation, \nand I believe my approach is the best way to make America energy \nsufficient.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Biden):\n  S. 3524. A bill to improve the Office for State and Local Law \nEnforcement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since September 11, 2001, our Nation has \ntaken significant steps to improve our national security. However, to \nimprove our ability to prevent and respond to a future terrorist attack \nwe need to fundamentally change the working relationship between our \nFederal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. The \nHomeland Security and Law\n\n[[Page S9035]]\n\nEnforcement Improvements Act of 2008 will do this by making State, \nlocal, and tribal law enforcement agencies full partners with Federal \nagencies in homeland security policymaking and by ensuring that these \nagencies have the resources they need to prevent and respond to \nterrorist attacks or other major incidents.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, I \nregularly talk to police chiefs and sheriffs throughout this country. \nThese men and women are on the front lines of protecting our \ncommunities from a host of dangers in these difficult times. They know \nwhere our vulnerabilities are and what it will take to keep our \nfamilies and neighborhoods safe, but, to put it simply, we haven't been \nlistening. Policymakers haven't been listening to the people on the \nground, leaving a critical gap in homeland security prevention, \npreparation, and incident response capabilities.\n  The Homeland Security and Law Enforcement Improvements Act of 2008 \nmakes a number of important improvements to this situation that I \nbelieve will strengthen our ability to prevent and, if necessary, \neffectively respond to a major terrorist incident.\n  First, the act will ensure that state and local law enforcement \nagencies are full partners in both crime fighting and homeland security \nby giving the Assistant Secretary for State and Local Law Enforcement \nthe appropriate budget and program management authority.\n  Second, the act will ensure that state and local law enforcement \nagencies have the resources needed to prevent and respond to terrorist \nacts by fully funding the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program, \nLETP, as a separate initiative. The LETPP is the only funding resource \nin the Department of Homeland Security dedicated solely to meeting the \nunique needs of law enforcement as they try to protect our communities \nfrom terrorism.\n  Third, the act ensures that first responders in local law enforcement \nhave the resources they need to effectively react to a terrorist \nincident by establishing the Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance \nProgram, CEDAP, as an authorized program. The CEDAP provides funding \nthat allows law enforcement first responders to identify and select \nspecialized equipment and technology that can help them protect the \ncommunities they serve.\n  Fourth, the act will ensure that we have a swift and coordinated \nresponse in the event of a major incident by establishing Law \nEnforcement Deployment Teams that can react immediately to major \nincidents throughout the country.\n  Fifth, the act will create an Information Sharing Resource Center to \nfacilitate information sharing between Federal, State, local, and \ntribal law enforcement agencies, intelligence officials, and Federal \nagencies so that every stakeholder has the information necessary to \nprotect our country from terrorist attacks.\n  Finally, the Act strengthens our ability to prevent and disrupt plans \nfor attacks against America hatched overseas by establishing a Foreign \nLiaison Officers Against Terrorism, FLOAT, program. FLOAT will allow \nAmerican state and local law enforcement officers to serve outside the \nU.S. as liaison officers--working closely with their foreign law \nenforcement counterparts to share information and gain a better \nunderstanding of how terrorists work abroad.\n  Each of these initiatives: the LETPP, CEDAP, the Law Enforcement \nDeployment Teams, the Information Sharing Resource Center, and FLOAT \nwill be under the direction and control of the Assistant Secretary, who \nwill report directly to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I am honored to introduce this legislation with the support of the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, the National Sheriffs Association and other law \nenforcement groups throughout this country who toil daily to keep us \nsafe from crime and terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3524\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the bicentennial of the writing of the \n``Star-Spangled Banner'', and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Star-\nSpangled Banner Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act. I am pleased that \nmy colleague, the senior Senator from Maryland, is a cosponsor. This \nlegislation will honor our National Anthem and the Battle for \nBaltimore, which was a key turning point of the War of 1812, by \ncreating a commemorative U.S. Mint coin.\n  The War of 1812 confirmed American independence from Great Britain in \nthe eyes of the world. Before the war, the British has been routinely \nimposing on American sovereignty. They had impressed American merchant \nseamen into the British Royal Navy, enforced illegal and unfair trade \nrules with the United States, and allegedly offered assistance to \nAmerican Indian tribes which were attaching frontier settlements. In \nresponse,, the United States declared war on Great Britain on June 18, \n1812, to protest these violations of ``free trade and sailors rights,'' \nas well as the violations on land.\n  After 2\\1/2\\ years of conflict, the British Royal Navy sailed up the \nChesapeake Bay with combined military and naval forces, and in August \n1814 attacked Washington, DC, burning to the ground the U.S. Capitol, \nthe White House, and much of the rest of the capital city. However, the \nAmerican defenders stopped the British as they attempted to capture \nBaltimore and New Orleans.\n  As the British Royal Navy sailed up the Patapsco River on its way to \nBaltimore, American forces held the British fleet at Fort McHenry, \nlocated just outside of the city. After 25 hours of bombardment, the \nBritish failed to take the Fort and were forced to depart. American \nlawyer Francis Scott Key, who was being held on board an American flag-\nof-truce vessel, beheld by the dawn's early light an American flag \nstill flying atop Fort McHenry. He immortalized the event in a song \nwhich later became known as ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''\n  The flag to which Key referred was a 30' x 42' foot flag made \nspecifically for Fort McHenry. The commanding officer desired a flag so \nlarge that the\n\n[[Page S9037]]\n\nBritish would have no trouble seeing it from a distance. This proved to \nbe the case as Key visited the British fleet on September 7, 1814, to \nsecure the release of Dr. William Beanes, Dr. Beanes was released, but \nKey and Beanes were detained on an American Flag-of-truce vessel until \nthe end of the bombardment. It was on September 14, 1814, by the dawn's \nearly light, that Key saw the great banner that inspired him to write \nthe song that ultimately became our National Anthem.\n  The Star-Spangled Banner Bicentennial Commemorative Coin will honor \nthis symbol of our Nation and our National Anthem. The coin will be \nminted in 2012 in coordination with the 200th Anniversary of the War of \n1812. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this measure in \nthis fitting tribute to a seminal event in American history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3525\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Star-Spangled Banner \n     Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During the War of 1812, on September 7, 1814, Francis \n     Scott Key visited the British fleet in the Chesapeake Bay to \n     secure the release of Dr. William Beanes, who had been \n     captured after the burning of Washington, DC.\n       (2) The release was completed, but Key was held by the \n     British during the shelling of Fort McHenry, one of the forts \n     defending Baltimore.\n       (3) On the morning of September 14, 1814, Key peered \n     through clearing smoke to see an enormous American flag \n     flying proudly after a 25-hour British bombardment of Fort \n     McHenry.\n       (4) He was so delighted to see the flag still flying over \n     the fort that he began a song to commemorate the occasion, \n     with a note that it should be sung to the popular British \n     melody ``To Anacreon in Heaven''.\n       (5) In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that it be \n     played at military and naval occasions.\n       (6) In 1931, the ``Star-Spangled Banner'' became our \n     National Anthem.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nadvance appropriations for certain medical care accounts of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs by providing two-fiscal year budget \nauthority; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould secure more timely health care funding for the millions of \nveterans who rely on the Veterans Health Administration for their \nhealth care.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Snowe, Feingold, Landrieu, \nJohnson, Murkowski, Stevens, and Thune in introducing this important \nbill.\n  Not all Americans realize that VA's health care system is the largest \nin the Nation.\n  They do know, to be sure, that many veterans are injured while \nserving our country and, unfortunately, some of these injuries require \na lifetime of care. Millions of veterans rely on VA for health care \nevery year, and every year that number grows.\n  Few Americans realize that the VA health care system must rely on an \nannual appropriation. While Congress has provided much-needed funding \nincreases to veterans' health care in recent years, VA health care \nfunding can be untimely and unpredictable, making it difficult for VA \nto manage its overall health care program effectively.\n  A survey recently commissioned by the Disabled American Veterans \nfound that 83 percent of respondents favor requiring Congress to \ndetermine the budget for veterans' health care a year in advance. This \nbill would do just that.\n  During my time on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have heard \nformer Secretaries of Veterans Affairs state plainly that the current \nprocess is no way to fund the Nation's largest health care system. We \nneed to provide a more secure and predictable funding system for \nveterans health care. Our legislation will do exactly that.\n  This legislation would require that veterans' health care be funded \nthrough the advance appropriations process. Under that process, \nprograms are funded 2 years in advance, rather than a year at a time.\n  Unlike the funding provided to Medicare and Medicaid, veterans' \nhealth care would not be funded as an entitlement--Congress would still \nbe able to review and manage the funding, as necessary. But with \nadvance appropriations, VA would be able to plan more efficiently, and \nbetter use taxpayer-dollars to care for veterans.\n\n[[Page S9038]]\n\n  Uncertain and untimely funding can limit VA health care's \neffectiveness, while they strive to meet the needs of veterans on a \ndaily basis, as costs grow rapidly.\n  What I am proposing today is not new. Congress already uses advance \nappropriations for programs that require funding in a timely manner, \nsuch as HUD Section 8 housing vouchers and the Low Income Heating \nEnergy Assistance Program.\n  To this extent, I submit that veterans' health care is just as \ndeserving of secured and predictable funding.\n  To increase transparency in this process, the bill I am introducing \nwould require an annual GAO audit and public report to Congress on VA's \nfunding forecasts.\n  This process of continuous open review of VA appropriations would \nhelp VA funds go even further for veterans and taxpayers.\n  Advance funding for veterans' health care has the strong support of \nthe Partnership for Veterans Health Care Budget Reform, a coalition \nwhich includes the following veteran service organizations: AMVETS, \nBlinded Veterans Association, Disabled American Veterans, Jewish War \nVeterans, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Vietnam \nVeterans of America.\n  My friend and counterpart in the House of Representatives, House \nVeterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Robert Filner, is introducing a \ncompanion bill for advance funding as well.\n  We are united in our determination to set down a marker for future \naction on veterans' health care through this bill, and place advance \nappropriations for veterans' health care on the National agenda.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to join as supporters of more secure, \ntimely funding for veterans' health care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3527\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with so many of my \ncolleagues in supporting a resolution commemorating the 50th \nanniversary of the AARP.\n  The 49 million members of the AARP take Government and public policy \nvery seriously, and their association is a model of effective advocacy \nhere in Washington. For instance, in the successful fight against the \nadministration's attempt to privatize Social Security--a truly terrible \nidea that would have put Americans' retirement security at risk in the \nstock market casino--AARP was extraordinarily effective in marshalling \nfacts, mobilizing experts, and educating members of Congress.\n  Likewise, AARP does a great job of informing and educating its own \nmembers about critical issues being debated here in Washington. I don't \nbelieve in top-down politics; I believe in bottom-up politics. And so \ndoes the AARP. The organization has members in virtually every \nneighborhood in the United States. It mobilizes old-fashioned people \npower in order to hold Government accountable. It takes on the \npowerful, entrenched interests when those interests attempt to trample \non the rights of ordinary people.\n  AARP as an institution is an invaluable resource to us here in \nCongress. Just as AARP keeps its members informed about what is \nhappening in Washington, it also closely monitors the concerns and \nwishes of its members so it can better represent them in Washington. \nJust this week, I chaired a hearing about the things that 401(k) \nparticipants and beneficiaries need to know about the fees they are \npaying. AARP was right there with the results of a timely survey of its \nmembers about what disclosure is most useful and understandable to \nthem.\n  The staff at AARP pay close attention to every regulatory move, every \nnewspaper article, every important hearing or meeting that could have \nsome impact on older Americans. They are truly a wealth of information.\n  I am grateful for their active engagement on Capitol Hill, because, \nas our population ages, it is critical that we be attuned to the impact \nof our policies on older people and retirees. When we make policy and \npass laws on everything from health care, to the economy, to improving \nworkplace options for the millions of seniors who want or need to \ncontinue working, we have a tremendous resource in the AARP.\n  I would particularly like to thank the AARP for its assistance to me \nand my staff on some of our key legislative priorities, including \nimproving retirement security; moving our health care system toward a \ngreater emphasis on wellness and prevention; combating age \ndiscrimination in the workplace; preserving and strengthening Social \nSecurity; and ending the institutional bias in Medicare and Medicaid so \nthat elderly people and people with disabilities can live in their own \nhomes rather than nursing homes.\n  I look forward to continuing this rich collaboration with the \noutstanding professionals who staff and lead the AARP. I salute the \npeople at AARP for the great job they do representing the interests of \nolder Americans and retirees. It has been a remarkable first 50 years. \nIn the years ahead, I wish them even greater success in increasing \neconomic opportunities and retirement security for older Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9039-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9039-S9040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 667--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2008 AS ``NATIONAL \n                   PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, \nMr. Inouye, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Collins, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Dole, Mrs. Boxer, \nMr. Grassley, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nStevens, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Barrasso, Ms. Stabenow, \nMr. Bunning, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Specter, Mr. \nDodd, Mr. Cochran, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Levin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \nMenendez, Mr. Casey, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Isakson \nand Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. CASEY (for Mr. Lieberman (for himself and Ms. Collins)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill S. 2606, to reauthorize the United \nStates Fire Administration, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter to be inserted, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``United States Fire \n     Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The number of lives lost each year because of fire has \n     dropped significantly over the last 25 years in the United \n     States. However, the United States still has one of the \n     highest fire death rates in the industrialized world. In \n     2006, the National Fire Protection Association reported 3,245 \n     civilian fire deaths, 16,400 civilian fire injuries, and \n     $11,307,000,000 in direct losses due to fire.\n       (2) Every year, more than 100 firefighters die in the line \n     of duty. The United States Fire Administration should \n     continue its leadership to help local fire agencies \n     dramatically reduce these fatalities.\n       (3) The Federal Government should continue to work with \n     State and local governments and the fire service community to \n     further the promotion of national voluntary consensus \n     standards that increase firefighter safety.\n       (4) The United States Fire Administration provides crucial \n     support to the 30,300 fire departments of the United States \n     through training, emergency incident data collection, fire \n     awareness and education, and support of research and \n     development activities for fire prevention, control, and \n     suppression technologies.\n       (5) The collection of data on fire and other emergency \n     incidents is a vital tool both for policy makers and \n     emergency responders to identify and develop responses to \n     emerging hazards. Improving the data collection capabilities \n     of the United States Fire Administration is essential for \n     accurately tracking and responding to the magnitude and \n     nature of the fire problems of the United States.\n       (6) The research and development performed by the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States Fire \n     Administration, other government agencies, and \n     nongovernmental organizations on fire technologies, \n     techniques, and tools advance the capabilities of the fire \n     service of the United States to suppress and prevent fires.\n       (7) Because of the essential role of the United States Fire \n     Administration and the fire service community in preparing \n     for and responding to national and man-made disasters, the \n     United States Fire Administration should have a prominent \n     place within the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR UNITED STATES \n                   FIRE ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 17(g)(1) of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control \n     Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2216(g)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (2) in subparagraph (D), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting a semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding after subparagraph (D) the following:\n       ``(E) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, of which $2,520,000 \n     shall be used to carry out section 8(f);\n       ``(F) $72,100,000 for fiscal year 2010, of which $2,595,600 \n     shall be used to carry out section 8(f);\n       ``(G) $74,263,000 for fiscal year 2011, of which $2,673,468 \n     shall be used to carry out section 8(f); and\n       ``(H) $76,490,890 for fiscal year 2012, of which $2,753,672 \n     shall be used to carry out section 8(f).''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Unmanned aerial \n     systems are indispensable in the conflict against terrorism \n     and the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       (2) Unmanned aerial systems of the Department of Defense \n     must operate in the National Airspace System (NAS) for \n     training, operational support to the combatant commands, and \n     support to domestic authorities in emergencies and national \n     disasters.\n       (3) The Department of Defense has been lax in developing \n     certifications of airworthiness for unmanned aerial systems, \n     qualifications for operators of unmanned aerial systems, \n     databases on safety matters relating to unmanned aerial \n     systems, and standards, technology, and procedures that are \n     necessary for routine access of unmanned aerial systems to \n     the National Airspace System.\n       (4) As recognized in a Memorandum of Agreement for \n     Operation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the National \n     Airspace System signed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and \n     the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in \n     September 2007, it is vital for the Department of Defense and \n     the Federal Aviation Administration to collaborate closely to \n     achieve progress in gaining access for unmanned aerial \n     systems to the National Airspace System to support military \n     requirements.\n       (5) The Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation \n     Administration have jointly and separately taken significant \n     actions to improve the access of unmanned aerial systems of \n     the Department of Defense to the National Airspace System, \n     but overall, the pace of progress in access of such systems \n     to the National Airspace System has been insufficient and \n     poses a threat to national security.\n       (6) Techniques and procedures can be rapidly acquired or \n     developed to temporarily permit safe operations of unmanned \n     aerial systems in the National Airspace System until \n     permanent safe operations of such systems in the National \n     Airspace System can be achieved.\n       (7) Identifying, developing, approving, implementing, and \n     monitoring the adequacy of these techniques and procedures \n     may require the establishment of a joint Department of \n     Defense-Federal Aviation Administration executive committee \n     reporting to the highest levels of the Department of Defense \n     and the Federal Aviation Administration on matters relating \n     to the access of unmanned aerial systems of the Department of \n     Defense to the National Airspace System.\n       (8) Joint management attention at the highest levels of the \n     Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration \n     may also be required on other important issues, such as type \n     ratings for aerial refueling aircraft.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Defense should seek an agreement with the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to \n     jointly establish within the Department of Defense and the \n     Federal Aviation Administration a joint Department of \n     Defense-Federal Aviation Administration executive committee \n     on conflict and dispute resolution which would--\n       (1) act as a focal point for the resolution of disputes on \n     matters of policy and procedures between the Department of \n     Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration with respect \n     to--\n       (A) airspace, aircraft certifications, and aircrew \n     training; and\n       (B) other issues brought before the joint executive \n     committee by the Department of Defense or the Department of \n     Transportation;\n       (2) identify solutions to the range of technical, \n     procedural, and policy concerns arising in the disputes \n     described in paragraph (1); and\n       (3) identify solutions to the range of technical, \n     procedural, and policy concerns arising in the integration of \n     Department of Defense unmanned aerial systems into the \n     National Airspace System in order to achieve the increasing, \n     and ultimately routine, access of such systems into the \n     National Airspace System.\n\n     SEC. 1040. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SALE OF NEW OUTSIZE CARGO, \n                   STRATEGIC LIFT AIRCRAFT FOR CIVILIAN USE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 2004 Quadrennial Defense Review (as submitted to \n     Congress in 2005) and the 2005 Mobility Capability Study \n     determined that the United States Transportation Command \n     requires a force of 292 organic strategic lift aircraft, \n     augmented by procurement of airlift service from commercial \n     air carriers participating in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, to \n     meet the demands of the National Military Strategy. Congress \n     has authorized and appropriated funds for 301 strategic \n     airlift aircraft.\n       (2) The Commander of the United States Transportation \n     Command has testified to Congress that it is essential to \n     safeguard the capabilities and capacity of the Civil Reserve \n     Air Fleet to meet wartime surge demands in connection with \n     major combat operations, and that procurement by the Air \n     Force of excess organic strategic lift aircraft would be \n     harmful to the health of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.\n       (3) The C-17 Globemaster aircraft is the workhorse of the \n     Air Mobility Command in the Global War on Terror. Production \n     of the C-17 Globemaster aircraft is scheduled to cease in \n     2009, upon completion of the aircraft remaining to be \n     procured by the Air Force.\n       (4) The Federal Aviation Administration has informed the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that no fewer than \n     six commercial operators have expressed interest in procuring \n     a commercial variant of the C-17 Globemaster aircraft. \n     Commercial sale of the C-17 Globemaster aircraft would \n     require that the Department of Defense or Congress determine \n     that it is in the national interest for the Federal Aviation \n     Administration to proceed with the issuance of a type \n     certificate for surplus aircraft of the Armed Forces in \n     accordance with section 21.27 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n       (5) C-17 Globemaster aircraft sold for commercial use could \n     be made available to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, thus \n     strengthening the capabilities and capacity of the Civil \n     Reserve Air Fleet.\n       (6) The sale of a commercial variant of the C-17 \n     Globemaster to Civil Reserve Air Fleet partners would \n     strengthen the United States industrial base.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Defense should--\n       (1) review the benefits and feasibility of pursuing a \n     commercial-military cargo initiative for the C-17 Globemaster \n     aircraft and determine whether such an initiative is in the \n     national interest; and\n       (2) if the Secretary determines that such an initiative is \n     in the national interest, take appropriate actions to \n     coordinate with the Federal Aviation Administration to \n     achieve the type certification for such aircraft required by \n     section 21.27 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n                          Subtitle E--Reports\n\n     SEC. 1051.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The unauthorized transfer of nuclear weapons from Minot \n     Air Force Base, North Dakota, to Barksdale Air Force Base, \n     Louisiana, in August 2007 was an extraordinary breach of the \n     command and control and security of nuclear weapons.\n       (2) The reviews conducted following that unauthorized \n     transfer found that the ability of the Department of Defense \n     to provide oversight of nuclear weapons matters had \n     degenerated and that senior level attention to nuclear \n     weapons management is minimal at best.\n       (3) The lack of attention to nuclear weapons and related \n     equipment by the Department of Defense was demonstrated again \n     when it was discovered in March 2008 that classified \n     equipment from Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles was inadvertently shipped to Taiwan in 2006.\n       (4) The Department of Defense has insufficient capability \n     and staffing in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense \n     for Policy to provide the necessary oversight of the nuclear \n     weapons functions of the Department.\n       (5) The key senior position responsible for nuclear weapons \n     matters in the Department of Defense, the Assistant to the \n     Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological \n     Defense Programs, a position filled by appointment by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, has been vacant \n     for more than 18 months.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should maintain clear and unambiguous \n     command and control of its nuclear weapons;\n       (2) the safety and security of nuclear weapons and related \n     equipment should be a high priority as long as the United \n     States maintains a stockpile of nuclear weapons;\n       (3) the President should take immediate steps to nominate a \n     qualified individual for the position of Assistant to the \n     Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological \n     Defense Programs; and\n       (4) the Secretary of Defense should establish and fill a \n     senior position, at the level of Assistant Secretary or \n     Deputy Under Secretary, within the Office of the Under \n     Secretary of Defense for Policy to be responsible solely for \n     the strategic and nuclear weapons policy of the Department of \n     Defense.\n\n     SEC. 1039. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON JOINT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE-\n                   FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION EXECUTIVE \n                   COMMITTEE ON CONFLICT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) of the Department of \n     Defense, like the Predator and the Global Hawk, have become a \n     critical component of military operations. Unmanned aerial \n     systems are indispensable in the conflict against terrorism \n     and the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       (2) Unmanned aerial systems of the Department of Defense \n     must operate in the National Airspace System (NAS) for \n     training, operational support to the combatant commands, and \n     support to domestic authorities in emergencies and national \n     disasters.\n       (3) The Department of Defense has been lax in developing \n     certifications of airworthiness for unmanned aerial systems, \n     qualifications for operators of unmanned aerial systems, \n     databases on safety matters relating to unmanned aerial \n     systems, and standards, technology, and procedures that are \n     necessary for routine access of unmanned aerial systems to \n     the National Airspace System.\n       (4) As recognized in a Memorandum of Agreement for \n     Operation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in the National \n     Airspace System signed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and \n     the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration in \n     September 2007, it is vital for the Department of Defense and \n     the Federal Aviation Administration to collaborate closely to \n     achieve progress in gaining access for unmanned aerial \n     systems to the National Airspace System to support military \n     requirements.\n       (5) The Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation \n     Administration have jointly and separately taken significant \n     actions to improve the access of unmanned aerial systems of \n     the Department of Defense to the National Airspace System, \n     but overall, the pace of progress in access of such systems \n     to the National Airspace System has been insufficient and \n     poses a threat to national security.\n       (6) Techniques and procedures can be rapidly acquired or \n     developed to temporarily permit safe operations of unmanned \n     aerial systems in the National Airspace System until \n     permanent safe operations of such systems in the National \n     Airspace System can be achieved.\n       (7) Identifying, developing, approving, implementing, and \n     monitoring the adequacy of these techniques and procedures \n     may require the establishment of a joint Department of \n     Defense-Federal Aviation Administration executive committee \n     reporting to the highest levels of the Department of Defense \n     and the Federal Aviation Administration on matters relating \n     to the access of unmanned aerial systems of the Department of \n     Defense to the National Airspace System.\n       (8) Joint management attention at the highest levels of the \n     Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration \n     may also be required on other important issues, such as type \n     ratings for aerial refueling aircraft.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Defense should seek an agreement with the \n     Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to \n     jointly establish within the Department of Defense and the \n     Federal Aviation Administration a joint Department of \n     Defense-Federal Aviation Administration executive committee \n     on conflict and dispute resolution which would--\n       (1) act as a focal point for the resolution of disputes on \n     matters of policy and procedures between the Department of \n     Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration with respect \n     to--\n       (A) airspace, aircraft certifications, and aircrew \n     training; and\n       (B) other issues brought before the joint executive \n     committee by the Department of Defense or the Department of \n     Transportation;\n       (2) identify solutions to the range of technical, \n     procedural, and policy concerns arising in the disputes \n     described in paragraph (1); and\n       (3) identify solutions to the range of technical, \n     procedural, and policy concerns arising in the integration of \n     Department of Defense unmanned aerial systems into the \n     National Airspace System in order to achieve the increasing, \n     and ultimately routine, access of such systems into the \n     National Airspace System.\n\n     SEC. 1040. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SALE OF NEW OUTSIZE CARGO, \n                   STRATEGIC LIFT AIRCRAFT FOR CIVILIAN USE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 2004 Quadrennial Defense Review (as submitted to \n     Congress in 2005) and the 2005 Mobility Capability Study \n     determined that the United States Transportation Command \n     requires a force of 292 organic strategic lift aircraft, \n     augmented by procurement of airlift service from commercial \n     air carriers participating in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, to \n     meet the demands of the National Military Strategy. Congress \n     has authorized and appropriated funds for 301 strategic \n     airlift aircraft.\n       (2) The Commander of the United States Transportation \n     Command has testified to Congress that it is essential to \n     safeguard the capabilities and capacity of the Civil Reserve \n     Air Fleet to meet wartime surge demands in connection with \n     major combat operations, and that procurement by the Air \n     Force of excess organic strategic lift aircraft would be \n     harmful to the health of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.\n       (3) The C-17 Globemaster aircraft is the workhorse of the \n     Air Mobility Command in the Global War on Terror. Production \n     of the C-17 Globemaster aircraft is scheduled to cease in \n     2009, upon completion of the aircraft remaining to be \n     procured by the Air Force.\n       (4) The Federal Aviation Administration has informed the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that no fewer than \n     six commercial operators have expressed interest in procuring \n     a commercial variant of the C-17 Globemaster aircraft. \n     Commercial sale of the C-17 Globemaster aircraft would \n     require that the Department of Defense or Congress determine \n     that it is in the national interest for the Federal Aviation \n     Administration to proceed with the issuance of a type \n     certificate for surplus aircraft of the Armed Forces in \n     accordance with section 21.27 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n       (5) C-17 Globemaster aircraft sold for commercial use could \n     be made available to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, thus \n     strengthening the capabilities and capacity of the Civil \n     Reserve Air Fleet.\n       (6) The sale of a commercial variant of the C-17 \n     Globemaster to Civil Reserve Air Fleet partners would \n     strengthen the United States industrial base.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Defense should--\n       (1) review the benefits and feasibility of pursuing a \n     commercial-military cargo initiative for the C-17 Globemaster \n     aircraft and determine whether such an initiative is in the \n     national interest; and\n       (2) if the Secretary determines that such an initiative is \n     in the national interest, take appropriate actions to \n     coordinate with the Federal Aviation Administration to \n     achieve the type certification for such aircraft required by \n     section 21.27 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n                          Subtitle E--Reports\n\n     SEC. 1051.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions (S. Res. 601, S. Res. 623, S. Res. 650, and S. Res. \n667) were agreed to en bloc.\n  The preambles were agreed to en bloc.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 601\n\n       Whereas Americans are living longer and the cost of \n     retirement continues to rise, in part because the number of \n     employers providing retiree health coverage continues to \n     decline, and retiree health care costs continue to increase \n     at a rapid pace;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States, but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States, less than \\2/\n     3\\ of workers or their spouses are currently saving for \n     retirement, and that the actual amount of retirement savings \n     of workers lags far behind the amount that will be needed to \n     adequately fund their retirement years;\n       Whereas many workers may not be aware of their options for \n     saving for retirement or may not have focused on the \n     importance of, and need for, saving for their own retirement;\n       Whereas many employees have available to them through their \n     employers access to defined benefit and defined contribution \n     plans to assist them in preparing for retirement, yet many of \n     them may not be taking advantage of employer-sponsored \n     defined contribution plans at all or to the full extent \n     allowed by the plans as prescribed by Federal law; and\n       Whereas all workers, including public- and private-sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from increased awareness of \n     the need to save adequate funds for retirement and the \n     availability of preferred savings vehicles to assist them in \n     saving for retirement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 19 through October 25, 2008, as \n     ``National Save for Retirement Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Save for \n     Retirement Week;\n       (3) supports the need to raise public awareness of \n     efficiently utilizing substantial tax revenues that currently \n     subsidize retirement savings, revenues in excess of \n     $170,000,000,000 for the fiscal year 2007 budget;\n       (4) supports the need to raise public awareness of the \n     importance of saving adequately for retirement and the \n     availability of tax-preferred employer-sponsored retirement \n     savings vehicles; and\n       (5) calls on States, localities, schools, universities, \n     nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the \n     people of the United States to observe this week with \n     appropriate programs and activities with the goal of \n     increasing retirement savings for all the people of the \n     United States.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 623\n\n       Whereas Frederick W. Lander first surveyed and supervised \n     construction of the Lander Trail in 1858 to provide emigrants \n     with a travelable link between the Oregon and California \n     Trails;\n       Whereas 13,000 emigrants traveled on the Lander Trail \n     during the settlement of the Western United States;\n       Whereas the Lander Trail was the first Federal road west of \n     the Mississippi River;\n       Whereas travelers in the American West used the Lander \n     Trail for 54 years until 1912; and\n       Whereas people can still experience the Lander Trail in the \n     same setting that Frederick W. Lander first began \n     construction in 1858: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate honors the important role of the \n     Lander Trail in the settlement of the Western United States \n     on the sesquicentennial anniversary of the Lander Trail.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 650\n\n       Whereas gestures of welcoming and kindness between \n     neighbors foster community peace, harmony, and understanding;\n       Whereas being good neighbors to those around us encourages \n     mutual respect and friendship;\n       Whereas neighborhoods facilitate positive civic engagement \n     and enhance the foundation of an effective and more caring \n     society;\n       Whereas National Neighbor Day, celebrated annually on the \n     Sunday before Memorial Day weekend in May, was first \n     celebrated in 1993 in Westerly, Rhode Island, to promote \n     equality, dignity, and respect and to encourage love of one's \n     neighbor;\n       Whereas National Good Neighbor Day, celebrated annually on \n     the fourth Sunday of September, was first celebrated in the \n     1970s in Lakeside, Montana, to place a greater emphasis on \n     the importance of community and being a good neighbor; and\n       Whereas National Neighborhood Day, celebrated annually on \n     the third Sunday of September, was first celebrated in \n     Providence, Rhode Island, to inspire, build, and sustain \n     neighborhood relationships and foster civic engagement: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate calls upon the people of the \n     United States and interested groups and organizations--\n       (1) to celebrate the goals of National Neighbor Day, \n     National Good Neighbor Day, and National Neighborhood Day in \n     2008; and\n       (2) to undertake appropriate ceremonies, events, and \n     activities associated with those goals.\n\n                              S. Res. 667\n\n       Whereas countless families in the United States live with \n     prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 1 in 6 men in the United States will be diagnosed \n     with prostate cancer in his lifetime;\n       Whereas prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-\n     skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-\n     related deaths among men in the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2008, over 186,320 men in the United States \n     will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 28,660 men in the \n     United States will die of prostate cancer;\n       Whereas 30 percent of new diagnoses of prostate cancer \n     occur in men under the age of 65;\n       Whereas a man in the United States turns 50 years old about \n     every 14 seconds, increasing his odds of developing cancer, \n     including prostate cancer;\n       Whereas African-American males suffer a prostate cancer \n     incidence rate up to 65 percent higher than White males and \n     double the mortality rates;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity \n     of prostate cancer and the probability that the disease will \n     lead to death, and high cholesterol levels are strongly \n     associated with advanced prostate cancer;\n       Whereas, if a man in the United States has 1 family member \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer, he has a 1 in 3 chance of \n     being diagnosed with prostate cancer, if he has 2 family \n     members with such diagnoses, he has an 83 percent risk, and \n     if he has 3 family members with such diagnoses, he then has a \n     97 percent risk of prostate cancer;\n       Whereas screening by both a digital rectal examination \n     (DRE) and a prostate specific antigen blood test (PSA) can \n     diagnose the disease in its early stages, increasing the \n     chances of surviving more than 5 years to nearly 100 percent, \n     while only 33 percent of men survive more than 5 years if \n     diagnosed during the late stages of the disease;\n       Whereas there are no noticeable symptoms of prostate cancer \n     while it is still in the early stages, making screening \n     critical;\n       Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in \n     prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treatments; \n     and\n       Whereas educating people in the United States, including \n     health care providers, about prostate cancer and early \n     detection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of men \n     and preserving and protecting families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2008 as ``National Prostate Cancer \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) declares that the Federal Government has a \n     responsibility--\n       (A) to raise awareness about the importance of screening \n     methods for, and treatment of, prostate cancer;\n       (B) to increase research funding that is commensurate with \n     the burden of the disease so that the screening and treatment \n     of prostate cancer may be improved, and so that the causes \n     of, and a cure for, prostate cancer may be discovered; and\n       (C) to continue to consider ways for improving access to, \n     and the quality of, health care services for detecting and \n     treating prostate cancer; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested \n     groups, and affected persons--\n       (A) to promote awareness of prostate cancer;\n       (B) to take an active role in the fight to end the \n     devastating effects of prostate cancer on individuals, their \n     families, and the economy; and\n       (C) to observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/09/18/senate-section/article/S9165-1", "month": "09", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9165-S9166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BENNETT FREEZE REPEAL ACT\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 868, S. 2606.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2606) to reauthorize the United States Fire \n     Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs with an amendment to strike all after the enacting \nclause and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Fire \n     Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The number of lives lost each year because of fire has \n     dropped significantly over the last 25 years in the United \n     States. However, the United States still has one of the \n     highest fire death rates in the industrialized world. In \n     2005, the National Fire Protection Association reported 3,675 \n     civilian fire deaths, 17,925 civilian fire injuries, and \n     $10,672,000,000 in direct losses due to fire.\n       (2) Every year, more than 100 firefighters die in the line \n     of duty. The United States Fire Administration should \n     continue its leadership to help local fire agencies \n     dramatically reduce these fatalities.\n       (3) The Federal Government should continue to work with \n     State and local governments and the fire service community to \n     further the promotion of national voluntary consensus \n     standards that increase firefighter safety.\n       (4) The United States Fire Administration provides crucial \n     support to the 30,300 fire departments of the United States \n     through training, emergency incident data collection, fire \n     awareness and education, and support of research and \n     development activities for fire prevention, control, and \n     suppression technologies.\n       (5) The collection of data on fire and other emergency \n     incidents is a vital tool both for policy makers and \n     emergency responders to identify and develop responses to \n     emerging hazards. Improving the data collection capabilities \n     of the United States Fire Administration is essential for \n     accurately tracking and responding to the magnitude and \n     nature of the fire problems of the United States.\n       (6) The research and development performed by the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States Fire \n     Administration, other government agencies, and \n     nongovernmental organizations on fire technologies, \n     techniques, and tools advance the capabilities of the fire \n     service of the United States to suppress and prevent fires.\n       (7) Because of the essential role of the United States Fire \n     Administration and the fire service community in preparing \n     for and responding to national and man-made disasters, the \n     United States Fire Administration should have a prominent \n     place within the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR UNITED STATES \n                   FIRE ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 17(g)(1) of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control \n     Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2216(g)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (2) in subparagraph (D), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting a semicolon; and\n       (3) by adding after subparagraph (D) the following:\n       ``(E) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, of which $2,520,000 \n     shall be used to carry out section 8(f);\n       ``(F) $72,100,000 for fiscal year 2010, of which $2,595,600 \n     shall be used to carry out section 8(f);\n       ``(G) $74,263,000 for fiscal year 2011, of which $2,673,468 \n     shall be used to carry out section 8(f); and\n       ``(H) $76,490,890 for fiscal year 2012, of which $2,753,672 \n     shall be used to carry out section 8(f).''.\n\n     SEC. 4.
