Madam President, this morning, following any time used by \nthe two leaders, the Senate will resume consideration of the two \nmotions to proceed to H.R. 800 and S. 1639. Debate time will extend \nuntil 11:30 this morning. That time will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Kennedy and Enzi or their designees. At \n11:30, the two leaders will control 10 minutes each, with the \nRepublican leader controlling the time from 11:30 to 11:40 and the \nmajority leader controlling the time from 11:40 to 11:50. Therefore, if \nthe leaders use the time available to them, the first vote will occur \nabout 11:50. The first vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act. \nRegardless of the outcome of that vote, even if cloture is invoked on \nthat motion, the Senate will then proceed to vote on the motion to \nproceed to S. 1639, the immigration bill. Following the second vote, \nthe Senate will then recess until 2:15 in order to permit the \nrespective party conference meetings.\n  The schedule is difficult. Last week, we worked things out so we \ndidn't have to be in on the weekend, and that was because the cloture \nvote did not succeed and we saved some 30 hours. Had that succeeded, we \nwould have had to work into the weekend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8377-6", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8377-S8378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, yesterday the U.S. Conference of Mayors \nhighlighted the toll of the Iraq war, the toll it is taking on our \nhealth, safety, and well-being here at home, by voting for a resolution \nto bring the war to a responsible end. Stanford, CT, Mayor Dan Malloy \nsaid the war has drained desperately needed funds from classrooms and \nmunicipal services. David Cicilline, Mayor of Providence, RI, said:\n\n       Continued U.S. military presence in Iraq is resulting in \n     the tragic loss of American lives and wounding of American \n     soldiers . . . reducing federal funds for needed domestic \n     investments in education, health care, public safety, \n     homeland security and more.\n\n  The mayors understand this as much as any other political body in the \ncountry. They are the ones who are seeing that desperately needed funds \nare not going to projects they believe are so important to their \nconstituents, the people who live within those cities, because the \nmoney is going at the rate of $10 billion a month to Iraq. I appreciate \nthe Conference of Mayors for taking the important stand they did.\n  Finally, last evening, just before the Senate went out, Richard \nLugar, former chairman of the Agriculture Committee, the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and ranking member on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee today, made a very important speech, one of the most \nimportant speeches we have had in the Senate in a long time. He is a \nsoft-spoken man and doesn't really talk a lot. He is a Rhodes scholar, \na brilliant man, an academic with experience, prior to coming here, as\n\n[[Page S8378]]\n\nmayor of one of the major cities in America. I appreciate what he did \nlast night, what he said last night. On foreign policy, he has the \ncredentials to speak.\n\n  Yesterday, he gave voice to the growing sentiment among his \nRepublican colleagues that we must change course in Iraq and change \nnow--not in September but now. Senator Lugar said:\n\n       Persisting indefinitely with the surge strategy will delay \n     policy adjustments that have a better chance of protecting \n     our vital interests over the long term.\n\n  I recommend and suggest to all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, \nthat they read the brilliant speech given by Dick Lugar last night. It \nwas very good. It was, I am sure, prepared by him, every word. I \nunderstand it is not easy to speak out against the war. I can vouch for \nthat. I also recognize how difficult it is for Republicans to speak out \nagainst the war. It has been hard enough for this Democrat to speak out \nagainst the war. Senator Lugar's comments and those of a handful of \nother Republicans who share his view--to this point, two have said so \npublicly--takes real courage. Courage is the only way we will change \ncourse in Iraq.\n  Some floor speeches go unnoticed. Most floor speeches go unnoticed. \nSenator Richard Lugar's speech last night is not one of them. When this \nwar comes to an end--and it will come to an end--and the history books \nare written--and they will be written--Senator Lugar's words yesterday \ncould be remembered as a turning point in this intractable civil war in \nIraq. But that will depend on whether more Republicans take the stand \nSenator Lugar took, a courageous stand, last night.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Lugar--and hope and believe a \ngrowing number of Republicans--to put his words into action by \ndelivering a responsible end to the war that the American people demand \nand the American people deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8378-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

If I could get Senator Kennedy's attention, would it be \npossible that Senator Alexander be recognized and I be recognized, both \nfor 5 minutes, at some point after Senator Specter, on Senator Enzi's \ntime? Is that possible?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is agreeable. We will try to accommodate the time. \nSenator Specter wanted 15 minutes; others are 5 minutes. But we will be \nglad to accommodate, so if he goes for 15, you can go for 5.\n  Mr. GREGG. Senator Alexander can be recognized for 5 and then I can \nbe recognized for 5.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would be fine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nyielding time. I have sought recognition to speak on the legislation \nentitled the ``Employee Free Choice Act.'' I have had numerous contacts \non this bill, both for it and against it, very impassioned contacts. \nPeople feel very strongly about it. The unions contend they very \ndesperately need it. The employers say it would be an abdication of \ntheir rights to a secret ballot. I believe there are a great many \nimportant issues which need to be considered on this matter, and that \nis why I will vote, when the roll is called, to impose cloture so that \nwe may consider the issue. I emphasize that on a procedural motion to \ninvoke cloture--that is, to cut off debate--it is procedural only and \nthat my purpose in seeking to discuss the matter is so that we may \nconsider a great many very important and complex issues. I express no \nconclusion on the underlying merits in voting procedurally to consider \nthe issue.\n  In my limited time available, I will seek to summarize. I begin with \na note that the National Labor Relations Act does not specify that \nthere should be a secret ballot or a card check but says only that the \nemployee representative will represent in collective bargaining where \nthat representative has been ``designated or selected'' for that \npurpose. The courts have held that the secret ballot is preferable but \nnot exclusive.\n  In the case captioned ``Linden Lumber Division v. National Labor \nRelations Board,'' the Supreme Court held that ``an employer has no \nright to a secret ballot where the employer has so poisoned the \nenvironment through unfair labor practices that a fair election is not \npossible.''\n  The analysis is, what is the status with respect to the way elections \nare held today? The unions contend that there is an imbalance, that \nthere is not a level playing field, and say that has been responsible \nin whole or in part for the steady decline in union membership.\n  In 1954, 34.8 percent of the American workers belonged to unions. \nThat number decreased in 1973 to 23.5 percent and in 1984 to 18.8 \npercent; in 2004, to 12.5 percent; and in 2006, to 12 percent. In \ntaking a look at the practices by the National Labor Relations Board, \nthe delays are interminable and unacceptable. By the time the NLRB and \nthe legal process has worked through, the delays are so long that there \nis no longer a meaningful election. That applies both to employers and \nto unions, that the delays have been interminable.\n  In the course of my extended statement, I cite a number of cases. In \nGoya Foods, the time lapse was 6 years; Fieldcrest Cannon, 5 years; \nSmithfield--two cases--12 and 7 years; Wallace International, 6 years; \nHomer Bronson, 5 years.\n  In the course of my written statement, I have cited a number of cases \nshowing improper tactics by unions, showing improper tactics by \nemployers. In the limited time I have, I can only cite a couple of \nthese matters, but these are illustrative.\n  In the Goya Foods case, workers at a factory in Florida voted for the \nunion to represent them in collective bargaining. Following the \nelection, the company refused to bargain with the union and fired a \nnumber of workers for promoting the union. The workers filed an unfair \nlabor practices case in June of 2000, seeking to require the employer \nto bargain.\n  In February of 2001, the administrative law judge found the company \nhad illegally fired the employees and had refused to bargain. But it \nwas not until August of 2006 that the board in Washington, DC, adopted \nthose findings, ordered reinstatement of the employees with backpay, \nand required Goya to bargain in good faith--a delay of some 5 years.\n  In the Fieldcrest Cannon case, workers at a factory in North Carolina \nsought an election to vote on union representation. To discourage its \nemployees from voting for the union, the company fired 10 employees who \nhad vocally supported the union. The employer threatened reprisal \nagainst other employees who had voted for the union and threatened that \nimmigrant\n\n[[Page S8379]]\n\nworkers would be deported or sent to prison if they voted for the \nunion. The union lost the election in August of 1991. Although workers \nfiled an unfair labor practice case with the NLRB, the administrative \nlaw judge did not decide the case until 3 years later, in 1994, and his \norder was not enforced by the Fourth Circuit until 1996--a lapse of \nsome 5 years. In my written statement, I cite seven additional cases.\n  Similarly, there have been improper practices by unions. On the \nbalance, I have cited nine on that line, the same number I cited on \nimproper activities by employers.\n  At a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing, which I conducted in \nHarrisburg, PA, in July of 2004, we had illustrative testimony from an \nemployee, Faith Jetter:\n\n       Two union representatives came to my home and made a \n     presentation about the union. They tried to pressure me into \n     signing the union authorization card, and even offered to \n     take me out to dinner. I refused to sign the card . . . \n     shortly thereafter, the union representatives called again at \n     my home and visited my home again to try to get me to sign \n     the union authorization card. I finally told them that my \n     decision was that I did not want to be represented . . . \n     despite that . . . there was continuing pressure on me to \n     sign.\n\n  At a hearing of the House Committee on Labor this February, witness \nKaren Mayhew testified about offensive pressure tactics by the unions. \nI would cite some of my own experience with the issue. When I was an \nassistant district attorney in Philadelphia, I tried the first case \nagainst union coercive tactics to come out of the McClellan Committee \ninvestigation. The McClellan Committee had investigated Local 107 of \nthe Philadelphia Teamsters Union, found they had organized a goon \nsquad, beat up people, and exercised coercive tactics to form a union. \nThat case was brought to trial in 1963 and resulted in convictions of \nall six of the union officials and they all went to jail. Without \nelaborating on the detailed testimony, it was horrendous what the union \npractices were in that case.\n  There is no doubt if you take a look at the way the National Labor \nRelations Board functions--it is not functioning at all--but that it is \ndysfunctional.\n  If you take a look at the statistics, on the one category of intake, \nit declined from 1,155 in 1994, to 448 in 2006. In another category, it \ndeclined from almost 41,000 in 1994, to slightly under 27,000 in 2006. \nOn injunctions, where the NLRB has the authority to go in and get some \naction taken promptly, it is used very sparingly, and again there is a \nsteep decline: from 104 applications for injunctions in 1995, to 15 in \n2005, and 25 in 2006. The full table shows a great deal of the \nineptitude as to what is going on.\n  So what you have, essentially, is a very tough fought, very bitter \ncontest on elections, very oppressive tactics used by both sides and no \nreferee. The National Labor Relations Board is inert. It takes so long \nto decide the case that the election becomes moot, not important \nanymore. What they do is order a new election and they start all over \nagain and, again, frequently the same tactics are employed.\n  If there is an unfair labor practice in a discharge, the most the \ncurrent law authorizes the NLRB to do is to reinstate the worker with \nbackpay. That is reduced by the amount the individual has earned \notherwise, which is in accordance with the general legal principle of \nmitigation of damages. But there is no penalty which is attached. So \nwhen you take a look at what the NLRB does, it is totally ineffective.\n  Those are issues which I think ought to be debated by the Senate. We \nought to make a determination whether the current laws are adequate and \nwhether there ought to be changes and whether there ought to be \nremedies. We ought to take a look, for example, at the Canadian system. \nWhen I did some fundamental, basic research, I was surprised to find \nthat 5 of the 10 provinces of Canada employ the card check; that is, \nthere is no right to a secret election. One of the provinces had the \ncard check, rejected it, and then I am told went back to the card \ncheck. So their experiences are worthy of our consideration.\n  In Canada, elections are held 5 to 10 days after petitions are filed. \nI believe this body ought to take a close look at whether the \nprocedures could be shortened, whether there could be mandatory \nprocedures for moving through in a swift way--justice delayed is \njustice denied, we all know--whether there ought to be the standing for \nthe injured parties to go into court for injunctive relief. That is \nprovided now in the act, but only the NLRB can undertake it.\n\n  This vote, we all know, is going to be pro forma. We have the \npartisanship lined up on this matter to the virtual extreme. There is \nno effort behind the debate which we are undertaking today to get to \nthe issues. There is going to be a pro forma vote on cloture. Cloture \nis not going to be invoked. We are going to move on and not consider \nthe matter. We know there are enough votes to defeat cloture. The \nPresident has promised a veto. So it is pro forma.\n  But that should not be the end of our consideration of this issue \nbecause labor peace--relations between labor and management--is very \nimportant, and we ought to do more by way of analyzing it to see if any \ncorrections are necessary in existing law.\n  It is worth noting, in the history of the Senate, there has been \nconsiderable bipartisanship--not present today. But listen to this: In \n1931, the Davis-Bacon Act was passed by a voice vote. In 1932, the \nNorris LaGuardia Act was passed by a voice vote. In 1935, the National \nLabor Relations Act, also known as the Wagner Act, was passed by a \nvoice vote. In 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed, again, by \na voice vote. In 1959, only two Senators voted against the Landrum-\nGriffin bill.\n  A comment made by then-Senator John F. Kennedy, on January 20, 1959, \ncommenting on the Landrum-Griffin bill, is worth noting. I quote only \nin part because my time is about to expire, but this is what Senator \nJohn F. Kennedy had to say:\n\n       [T]he necessity for bipartisanship in labor legislation is \n     a principle which should guide us all. . . .The extremists on \n     both sides are always displeased. . . .Without doubt, the \n     future course of our action in this area will be plagued with \n     the usual emotional arguments, political perils, and powerful \n     pressures which always surround this subject.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In conclusion, it would be my hope we would take a very \nclose look at this very important law in this very important field and \nrecognize that harmonious relations between management and labor are \nvery important. That is not the case today, with a few illustrations I \nhave given in my prepared statement. We ought to exercise our standing, \nwhich we pride ourselves as the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  Although that will not be done today because cloture is not going to \nbe invoked, I intend to pursue oversight through the subcommittee where \nI rank which has jurisdiction over the NLRB.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my extensive statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of Senator Arlen Specter--S. 1041, The Employee Free Choice \n                                  Act\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to \n     discuss the legislation entitled the Employee Free Choice \n     Act. The Senate will later today vote on Cloture on the \n     Motion to Proceed to this important legislation. The Senate \n     prides itself on being the world's greatest deliberative \n     body, and I am voting for cloture to enable the Senate to \n     deliberate on this legislation and the important issues it \n     raises in an open and productive manner.\n       The Employee Free Choice Act is an issue of deep and \n     abiding interest to labor organizations and to employers. \n     There has been intense advocacy on both sides. At the field \n     hearing in Pennsylvania in July 2004, and in the many \n     discussions that I have had with labor leaders and employers \n     since that time, I have heard evidence indicating that \n     employees are often denied a meaningful opportunity to \n     determine whether they will be represented by a labor union. \n     There are many stories and cases about employers asserting \n     improper influence over their employees prior to an election, \n     and there are also many cases of unions attempting to assert \n     undue influence over workers in an attempt to establish a \n     union. I am talking about threats, spying, promises, \n     spreading misleading information, and other attempts to \n     coerce workers and interfere with their right to determine \n     for themselves whether they wish to be represented by a labor \n     organization. Based on what I have heard, I have concerns \n     that we have lost the balance of the National Labor Relations \n     Act's fundamental\n\n[[Page S8380]]\n\n     promise--that workers have the right to vote in a fair \n     election conducted in a non-threatening atmosphere, free of \n     coercion and fear, and without undue delay. Workers should be \n     assured that their decisions will be respected by their \n     employer and the union--with the support of the government \n     when necessary. The overwhelming evidence demonstrates that \n     the NLRB is not doing its job and is dysfunctional.\n       In light of the numerous contacts I have had with \n     constituents on both sides of this issue, and in \n     consideration of the evidence that has been presented by both \n     sides, I have decided to hold off on cosponsoring the \n     Employee Free Choice Act in the 110th to give more \n     opportunity to both sides to give me their views and to give \n     me more time to deliberate on the matter. At a time when \n     union membership is decreasing and when employers face \n     increasing competition in a global economy, it is our duty in \n     Congress to have a vigorous debate and to reach a decision on \n     the issues that the Employee Free Choice Act purports to \n     resolve.\n       The 1935 Wagner Act guarantees the right of workers to \n     organize, but it does not require that unions be chosen by \n     election. Instead, Section 9 provides more broadly that an \n     employee representative that has been ``designated or \n     selected'' by a majority of the employees for the purpose of \n     collective bargaining shall be the exclusive representative \n     of those employees in a given bargaining unit. The Act \n     further authorizes the National Labor Relations Board to \n     conduct secret ballot elections to determine the level of \n     support for the union when appropriate. Since 1935, secret \n     ballot elections have been the most common method by which \n     employees have selected their representatives.\n       Labor organizations have experienced a sharp decline in \n     membership since the 1950s. Unions represented 34.8 percent \n     of American workers in 1954, 23.5 percent in 1973, 18.8 \n     percent in 1984, 15.5 percent in 1994, 12.5 percent in 2004, \n     and 12 percent in 2006. In Senate debate, we should consider \n     whether labor laws have created an uneven playing field that \n     has led to this dramatic decline.\n       We should also consider where the fault lies in deciding \n     what changes, if any, should be made to our labor laws. There \n     are certainly abuses by both unions and employers. The \n     Supreme Court described the problem in NLRB v. Gissel Packing \n     Co., 395 U.S. 575 (1969), noting that ``we would be closing \n     our eyes to obvious difficulties, of course, if we did not \n     recognize that there have been abuses, primarily arising out \n     of misrepresentations by union organizers as to whether the \n     effect of signing a card was to designate the union to \n     represent the employee for collective bargaining purposes or \n     merely to authorize it to seek an election to determine that \n     issue.'' The following cases and testimony are illustrative \n     of this problem:\n       At a July 2004 Senate Appropriations Subcommittee I held in \n     Harrisburg, Pennsylvania entitled ``Employee Free Choice \n     Act--Union Certifications,'' a letter from employee Faith \n     Jetter was included in the record. In that letter, Ms. Jetter \n     testified: ``Two union representatives came to my home and \n     made a presentation about the union. They tried to pressure \n     me into signing the union authorization card, and even \n     offered to take me out to dinner. I refused to sign the card \n     . . . shortly thereafter, the union representatives called \n     again at my home and visited my home again to try to get me \n     to sign the union authorization card. I finally told them \n     that my decision was that I did not want to be represented . \n     . . despite that . . . I felt like there was continuing \n     pressure on me to sign.''\n       In testimony before the Senate Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions on March 27, 2007, in a \n     hearing entitled ``The Employee Free Choice Act: Restoring \n     Economic Opportunity for Working Families,'' Peter Hurtgen, a \n     former chairman of the NLRB, testified that ``in my \n     experience, neutrality/card check agreements are almost \n     always the product of external leverage by unions, rather \n     than an internal groundswell from represented employees.''\n       On February 8, 2007, at a hearing of the House Committee on \n     Labor, Education and Pensions entitled ``Strengthening \n     America's Middle Class through the Employee Free Choice \n     Act,'' Karen Mayhew, an employee at a large HMO in Oregon, \n     testified that local union organizers had misled many \n     employees into signing authorization cards at an initial \n     question-and-answer meeting. She said: ``At the meeting, \n     employees asked the union agents questions about the purpose \n     of the cards. The union agents responded by telling us that \n     signing the card only meant that the employee was expressing \n     an interest in receiving more information about the union, or \n     to have an election to decide whether or not to bring the \n     union in. It was made clear to all of us there in attendance \n     that those authorization cards did NOT constitute a vote \n     right there and then for exclusive representation by SEIU.''\n       A May 22, 2007 National Review article by Deroy Murdock \n     entitled ``Union of the Thugs'' quoted Edith White, a food-\n     service worker from New Jersey who recalled being visited by \n     a union organizer who told her that she ``wouldn't have a \n     job'' if she did not sign the authorization card and that \n     ``the Union would make sure'' that she was fired.\n       A June 29, 2006 Boston Globe article by Christopher Rowland \n     entitled ``Unions in Battle for Nurses'' reported that \n     organizers at a local hospital had told nurses that signing \n     an authorization card would ``merely allow them to get more \n     information and attend meetings.'' The nurses were quoted as \n     saying that the process ``left [them] feeling deceived and \n     misled.''\n       On February 8, 2007, at a hearing of the House Committee on \n     Labor, Education and Pensions entitled ``Strengthening \n     America's Middle Class through the Employee Free Choice \n     Act,'' Jen Jason, a former labor organizer for UNITE HERE, \n     testified that she was trained to create a sense of agitation \n     in workers and to capitalize on the ``heat of the moment'' to \n     get workers to sign union support cards. She compared the \n     American system of free ballots to the check card system in \n     Canada, where she also worked as a union organizer, noting \n     ``my experience is that in jurisdictions in which `card \n     check' was actually legislated, organizers tend[ed] to be \n     even more willing to harass, lie, and use fear tactics to \n     intimidate workers into signing cards.'' She also noted that \n     ``at no point during a `card check' campaign is the \n     opportunity created or fostered for employees to seriously \n     consider their working lives and to think about possible \n     solutions to any problems.''\n       At that same hearing before the House Committee on Labor, \n     Education and Pensions, a former union organizer, Ricardo \n     Torres, testified that he resigned because of ``the ugly \n     methods that we were encouraged to use to pressure employees \n     into union ranks.'' He testified that ``I ultimately quit \n     this line of work when a senior Steelworkers union official \n     asked me to threaten migrant workers by telling them they \n     would be reported to federal immigration officials if they \n     refused to sign check-off cards during a Tennessee organizing \n     drive . . . . Visits to the homes of employees who didn't \n     support the union were used to frustrate them and put them in \n     fear of what might happen to them, their family, or homes if \n     they didn't change their minds about the union.''\n       Enactment of the Landrum-Griffin Act in 1959 followed \n     extensive Senate hearings by the McClellan Committee on union \n     abuses. Based on evidence compiled by that Committee, where \n     Senator John F. Kennedy was a member and Robert F. Kennedy \n     was General Counsel, I secured the first convictions and jail \n     sentences from those hearings for six officials of Local 107 \n     of the Teamsters Union in Philadelphia. That union organized \n     a ``goon squad'' to intimidate and beat up people as part of \n     their negotiating tactics. Their tactics were so open and \n     notorious that my neighbor, Sherman Landers, with whom I \n     shared a common driveway, sold his house and moved out, \n     afraid the wrong house would be fire-bombed. The trial, which \n     occurred from March through June 1963, was closely followed \n     by Attorney General Kennedy who asked for and got a personal \n     briefing on the case and then offered me a position on the \n     Hoffa prosecution team.\n       Similarly, there are many examples of employer abuses \n     during campaigns and initial bargaining. Each of the \n     following cases illustrates the principle often attributed to \n     William Gladstone: ``Justice delayed is justice denied.''\n       In the Goya Foods case, 347 NLRB 103 (2006), workers at a \n     factory in Florida voted for the union to represent them in \n     collective bargaining negotiations. Following the election, \n     the company refused to bargain with the union and fired a \n     number of workers for promoting the union. The workers filed \n     an unfair labor practices case in June of 2000, seeking to \n     require the employer to bargain. In February of 2001, the \n     Administrative Law Judge found that the company had illegally \n     fired the employees and had refused to bargain. It was not \n     until August of 2006, however, that the Board in Washington, \n     D.C. adopted those findings, ordered reinstatement of the \n     employees with back pay, and required Goya to bargain in good \n     faith--six years after the employer unlawfully withdrew \n     recognition from the union.\n       In the Fieldcrest Cannon case, 97 F.3d 65 (4th Cir. 1996), \n     workers at a factory in North Carolina sought an election to \n     vote on union representation in June of 1991. To discourage \n     its employees from voting for the union, the company fired at \n     least 10 employees who had vocally supported the union, \n     threatened reprisal against employees who voted for the \n     union, and threatened that immigrant workers would be \n     deported or sent to prison if they voted for the union. The \n     union lost the election in August of 1991. Although workers \n     filed an unfair labor practice case with the NLRB, the \n     Administrative Law Judge did not decide the case until three \n     years later, in 1994, and his order was not enforced by the \n     Fourth Circuit until 1996--five years after the election.\n       In the Smithfield case, 447 F.3d 821 (D.C. Cir. 2006), \n     employees at the Smithfield Packing Company plant in Tar \n     Heel, North Carolina filed a petition for an election. In \n     response, the employer fired several employees, threatened to \n     fire others who voted for a union and threatened to freeze \n     wages if a union was established. The workers lost two \n     elections--one in 1994 and one in 1997. Workers filed an \n     unfair labor practices case. The administrative law judge \n     ruled for the workers in December of 2000, but the NLRB did \n     not affirm that decision until 2004, and the Court of Appeals \n     did not enforce the order until May of 2006--twelve years \n     after the first tainted election.\n       In another case involving the Smithfield Company, 347 NLRB \n     109 (2006), employees at the Wilson, North Carolina location \n     sought an election for union representation. Prior to the \n     election, the company fired employees who were leading the \n     union campaign and threatened and intimidated others. The\n\n[[Page S8381]]\n\n     union lost the election in 1999. The workers filed an unfair \n     labor practices case and the Administrative Law Judge found \n     in 2001 that the employer's conduct was so egregious that a \n     Gissel bargaining order (which mandates a card check \n     procedure instead of an election) was necessary because a \n     fair election was not possible. However, by the time the NLRB \n     affirmed the ALJ's decision in 2006, it found that the NLRB's \n     own delay in the case prevented the Gissel bargaining order \n     from being enforceable and--7 years after the employer \n     prevented employees from freely participating in a fair \n     election--the remedy the Board ordered was a second election.\n       In the Wallace International case, 328 NLRB 3 (1999) and \n     2003 NLRB Lexis 327 (2003), the employer sought to dissuade \n     its employees from joining a union by showing its workers a \n     video in which the employer threatened to close if the \n     workers unionized and the town's mayor urged the employees \n     not to vote for a union. The union lost an election in 1993. \n     The Board ordered a second election, which was held in 1994, \n     that was also tainted by claims of unfair labor practices. \n     The employees brought unfair labor practice cases after the \n     election. In August 1995, the ALJ found against the employer \n     and issued a Gissel bargaining order because a fair election \n     was impossible. However, as in the Smithfield case, by the \n     time the NLRB finally affirmed the ALJ's decision, in 1999, \n     the Gissel order was not enforceable. In subsequent \n     litigation, an ALJ found that the employer's unlawful \n     conduct, including discriminatory discharge, had continued \n     into 2000--7 years after the first election.\n       In the Homer Bronson Company case, 349 NLRB 50 (2007), the \n     ALJ in 2002 found that the employer had unlawfully threatened \n     employees who were seeking to organize that the plant would \n     have to close if a union was formed. The Board did not affirm \n     the decision until March 2007, again noting that a Gissel \n     order, though deemed appropriate by the NLRB General Counsel, \n     would not be enforceable in court because of the delays at \n     the NLRB in Washington, D.C.\n       The National Labor Relations Board found unlawful conduct \n     by employers in a number of recent cases in my home state of \n     Pennsylvania:\n       In the Toma Metals case, 342 NLRB 78 (2004), the Board \n     found that at least eight employees at Toma Metals in \n     Johnstown, PA were laid off from their jobs because they \n     voted to unionize the company. In addition, David Antal, Jr. \n     was terminated because he told his supervisor that he and his \n     fellow employees were organizing a union. He was laid off the \n     same evening the union petition was filed.\n       In the Exelon Generation case, 347 NLRB 77 (2006), the \n     Board found that the employer in Limerick and Delta, PA \n     threatened employees during an organizing campaign that they \n     would lose their rotating schedules, flextime, and the \n     ability to accept or reject overtime if they voted for union \n     representation.\n       In the Lancaster Nissan case, 344 NLRB 7 (2005), the Board \n     found that the employer failed to bargain in good faith \n     following a union election victory by limiting bargaining \n     sessions to one per month. The employer then unlawfully \n     withdrew recognition from the union a year later based on a \n     petition filed by frustrated employees, automotive \n     technicians.\n       In addition to showing employer abuses, these cases \n     demonstrate the impotency of existing remedies under the NLRA \n     to deal effectively with the problem. Further, the convoluted \n     procedures and delays in enforcement actions make the \n     remedies meaningless.\n       In 1974, in Linden Lumber Division v. NLRB, 419 U.S. 301 \n     (1974), the court made it clear that an employer may refuse \n     to recognize a union based on authorization cards and insist \n     upon a secret ballot election in any case, except one in \n     which the employer has so poisoned the environment through \n     unfair labor practices that a fair election is not possible. \n     In those cases involving egregious employer conduct, the \n     Board may impose a ``Gissel'' order that authorizes card \n     checks. This remedy takes its name from NLRB v. Gissel \n     Packing Co., which I cited earlier.\n       Most often, however, when the Board finds that an employer \n     improperly interfered with a campaign, it typically only \n     orders a second election, often years after the tainted \n     election, and requires the employer to post notices in which \n     it promises not to violate the law.\n       The standard remedy for discriminatory discharge, the most \n     common category of charges filed with the NLRB, is an order \n     to reinstate the worker with back pay, but any interim \n     earnings are subtracted from the employer's back pay \n     liability, and often this relief comes years after the \n     discharge.\n       The other common unfair labor practice case involves an \n     employer's refusal to bargain in good faith. The remedy is \n     often an order to return to the bargaining table.\n       In relatively few cases each year, the NLRB finds that the \n     unfair labor practices are so severe that it chooses to \n     exercise its authority under Section 10(j) of the NLRA to \n     seek a federal court injunction to halt the unlawful conduct \n     or to obtain immediate reinstatement of workers fired for \n     union activity. The NLRB too rarely exercises this authority, \n     and the regional office must obtain authorization from \n     Washington, D.C. headquarters to seek injunctive relief.\n       Additionally, under the procedures of the Act, after the \n     union wins an election, the employer may simply refuse to \n     bargain while it challenges some aspect of the pre-election \n     or election process. The union must then file an unfair labor \n     practice charge under Section 8(a)(5), go through an \n     administrative proceeding, and ultimately the matter may be \n     reviewed by a Federal court of appeals, since a Board order \n     is not self-enforcing. All of this takes years.\n       The following tables reflect that from 1994 to 2006 the \n     number of cases handled by the NLRB regional offices declined \n     steadily from 40,861 cases in 1994 to 26,717 in 2006. Yet, \n     despite this decline in workload, in 2005 the median age of \n     unresolved unfair labor practice cases was 1232 days, and for \n     representation cases the median age was 802 days. In 1995, \n     the NLRB sought 104 injunctions; in 2005, it sought 15; and \n     in 2006, 25 injunctions. In Washington, D.C., the Board's \n     caseload declined from 1155 cases in 1994 to 448 cases in \n     2006.\n       The number of decisions issued declined from 717 in 1994 to \n     386 in 2006. The backlog hit a peak of 771 cases in 1998 and \n     declined to 364 in 2006, but that decline must be viewed in \n     the context of a case intake for the Board that had fallen to \n     only 448 cases in 2006.\n\n                                       TABLE 1: REGIONAL OFFICE STATISTICS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1994     1995     1996     1997     1998     2003     2004     2005     2006\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCase Intake....................    40861    39935    38775    39618    36657    33715    31787    29858    26717\nULP (Case Age in Days).........      758      893      846      929      985     1030     1159     1232       --\nRepresentation (Case Age in          152      305      369      370      473      473      576      802       --\n Days).........................\nSection 10(j)..................       83      104       53       45       17       14       15       25       --\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                                      TABLE 2: WASHINGTON OFFICE STATISTICS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1994     1995     1996     1997     1998     2003     2004     2005     2006\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCase Intake....................     1155     1138      997     1084     1083      818      754      562      448\nDecisions......................      717      935      709      873      708      543      576      508      386\nCase Backlog...................      585      459      495      672      771      673      636      544      364\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       What has the Board been doing? Although many cases are \n     resolved at earlier stages out in the regions where the NLRB \n     may be generally effective, one must ask why it took years \n     for the Board to order reinstatement in the cases cited \n     earlier?\n       During the Senate's debate on the Employee Free Choice Act, \n     it is important that we focus on the employees' interests, \n     not on the employers' or the unions' interests. We must \n     protect employees from reprisals from either side. We must \n     ensure they have an environment in which they may make a free \n     choice. We must ensure that employees' decision, whether it \n     is for or against representation, is respected. And we must \n     ensure that if the employees do choose to be represented, \n     they can have confidence that their employer will bargain \n     with the union, and that the employer will not try to \n     undermine the union by threatening the employees during \n     bargaining for an initial agreement.\n       And finally, we must ensure that the Federal statute \n     designed to provide this protection of employees--and the \n     government agency tasked with the statute's enforcement--are \n     effective. If the statute needs to be modified to provide \n     stronger remedies or more streamlined procedures, then that \n     should be addressed. If the NLRB itself is causing delay and \n     confusion as to what the law is, then that should be \n     addressed. We do not need symbolic votes. We need meaningful \n     debate and careful consideration of these important issues. \n     America's workers deserve nothing less.\n       It is worthwhile to look at the experience of our neighbor, \n     Canada, where five of the ten provinces use the card check \n     procedure instead of secret ballot elections. In hearings \n     this year before the Senate and the House concerning the \n     Employee Free Choice Act, witnesses testified that unions are \n     more successful in their organizing campaigns under the card \n     check system--perhaps an indication that card check prevents \n     employers from exercising undue influence over workers to \n     prevent unionization. On the other hand, there was testimony \n     suggesting that the Canadian card check system has allowed\n\n[[Page S8382]]\n\n     unions to exert undue influence on employees in order to \n     obtain their signatures on union recognition cards.\n       In a 2004 study of the gap between Canadian and U.S. union \n     densities, an economics professor from Ontario found that \n     simulations suggest that approximately 20 percent of the gap \n     could be attributed to the different recognition procedures--\n     card check or secret ballot elections--in the two countries. \n     She further noted that the election procedures in Canada are \n     not identical to those of the U.S. I am intrigued by the fact \n     that union elections in Canada must take place within 5 to 10 \n     days after an application or petition is filed, depending on \n     the province. In the U.S. there is no such statutory time \n     limit between petition and voting, and it may be several \n     months before the election is held. This creates a wider \n     window of opportunity for the employer to influence workers, \n     using legal or illegal means. The professor also notes that \n     when unfair labor practices occur, the differences in \n     procedures and the role of the courts in the two countries \n     mean that it is faster and less expensive to process \n     complaints in Canada than in the U.S.\n       In 2001, another economics professor published a study in \n     which he noted that in the previous decade, an increased \n     number of Canadian provinces had abandoned their long-\n     standing tradition of certification based on card check by \n     experimenting with mandatory elections. In British Columbia, \n     for example, legislation requiring elections was enacted in \n     1984 and then abandoned in 1993. In examining the impact of \n     union suppression on campaign success in British Columbia, \n     the professor tested whether the length of an organizing \n     drive had an impact on organizing success. The evidence \n     demonstrated that the probability of a successful \n     organization of employees decreased by 1 percent for every \n     two days of delay when an unfair labor practice was involved. \n     The unfair labor practice itself decreased the probability of \n     success even further. The professor observed that mandatory \n     elections, as compared with a card check system, were \n     detrimental to unions' success. He found that not only did \n     success rates fall, but the number of certification attempts \n     fell substantially as well. He concluded that unions believe \n     organizing will be more difficult under mandatory voting as \n     so are less willing to invest in it. He concluded his paper \n     with this observation:\n       It seems more likely, however, that the recent trend \n     towards compulsory voting represents a shift in beliefs \n     towards elections as a preferable mechanism for determining \n     the true level of support within the bargaining unit. . . . \n     If governments are opting for a more neutral stance towards \n     unions, our results suggest that stricter employer penalties \n     should be considered. Currently even when an [unfair labor \n     practice claim] is found to be meritorious, penalties for \n     illegal employer coercion are largely compensatory. . . . \n     Furthermore, our evidence shows that strict time limits form \n     a useful policy tool in encouraging neutrality in the \n     organizing process since the combination of union suppression \n     and a length certification process is quite destructive.\n       I also note a 2006 study published in the Industrial Law \n     Journal by an Oxford professor who has studied the statutory \n     recognition procedures in England's Trade Union and Labour \n     Relations Act of 1992. He compares the English, Canadian and \n     American systems, and states at page 9: ``Indeed, the law \n     itself has erected the most substantial barriers to unions' \n     organizational success, and this is manifest in the \n     dilatoriness of legal procedures. Delay erodes the unions' \n     organizational base by undermining workers' perceptions of \n     union instrumentality.'' These studies of the Canadian and \n     the English experiences are instructive if we are to \n     carefully consider the many aspects of the secret ballot \n     election process.\n       Since 1935, there have been two major substantive \n     amendments to Federal labor law. In 1947, Congress passed the \n     Taft-Hartley Act and, in 1959, it passed the Landrum-Griffin \n     Act. These additions to the law strengthened workers' right \n     to refrain from union activity and regulated the process of \n     collective bargaining and the use of economic weapons during \n     labor disputes, but Congress has not amended the provisions \n     of federal labor law that protect the right of self-\n     organization.\n       On July 18, 1977, President Carter asked Congress for labor \n     law reform legislation. His proposals were incorporated into \n     H.R. 8410, which was introduced on July 19, 1977. An \n     identical bill, S. 1883, was introduced that same day by \n     Senators Williams and Javits. Ten days of hearings by the \n     Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations began on July 25, \n     1977.\n\n\nunions, former secretaries of labor, civil rights and the right to work \n                 committee testified against h.r. 8410\n\n       In the House alone, from 1961 through 1976, over 60 days of \n     hearings were held on the National Labor Relations Act. \n     Nineteen days of hearing were held between July 15, 1975 and \n     May 5, 1976, concerning, among other bills: H.R. 8110, to \n     expedite the processes and strengthen the remedies of the \n     Labor Act with respect to delegation and treble damages; H.R. \n     8407 to include supervisors within the protection of the Act; \n     H.R. 8408, to improve the administration and procedures of \n     the Board in terms of technical amendments; H.R. 8409, to \n     strengthen the remedial provision of the Act against repeated \n     or flagrant transgressors; and H.R. 12822, to amend the \n     National Labor Relations Act to expedite elections, to create \n     remedies for refusal-to-bargain violations, and other \n     purposes. In 1978, H.R. 8410 was debated for 20 days in the \n     Senate. After failing 5 cloture votes on the bill and \n     amendments, the bill was returned on June 22, 1978 to the \n     Senate Committee on Human Resources, and there it died. We \n     should try again to address the problems raised during these \n     extensive hearings and debates.\n       The National Labor Relations Act created a system of \n     workplace democracy that to a large extent has served our \n     nation well for more than 70 years. American labor unions, \n     with a strong history of social progress and accomplishments \n     in improving the workplace, have made America and the \n     American economy strong. Yet, despite these successes, the \n     NLRA is too often ineffective at guaranteeing workers' rights \n     in the face of bad conduct by some employers and some unions.\n       The essential plan and purpose of the Wagner Act was \n     described by President Franklin Roosevelt when he signed the \n     measure into law:\n\n       ``This act defines, as part of our substantive law, the \n     right of self-organization of employees in industry for the \n     purpose of collective bargaining, and provides methods by \n     which the government can safeguard that legal right. It \n     establishes a National Labor Relations Board to hear and \n     determine cases in which it is charged that this legal right \n     is abridged or denied, and to hold fair elections to \n     ascertain who are the chosen representatives of employees.\n       A better relationship between labor and management is the \n     high purpose of this act. By assuring the employees the right \n     of collective bargaining, it fosters the development of the \n     employment contract on a sound and equitable basis. By \n     providing an orderly procedure for determining who is \n     entitled to represent the employees, it aims to remove one of \n     the chief causes of wasteful economic strife. By preventing \n     practices which tend to destroy the independence of labor it \n     seeks, for every worker within its scope, that freedom of \n     choice and action which is justly his . . .''\n\n       It has been too long since the Senate has fully and freely \n     debated whether our labor laws continue to adequately \n     safeguard workers' rights. It is important that we focus on \n     the real problems with the NLRA and try to achieve a result \n     that can garner bipartisan support. Just take a look at the \n     bipartisan support that has been a necessary basis of any \n     successful labor legislation:\n       In 1926, only 13 Senators voted against the Railway Labor \n     Act.\n       In 1931, the Davis-Bacon Act was passed by voice vote.\n       In 1932, the Norris-LaGuardia Act was passed by voice vote.\n       In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act (also known as \n     the Wagner Act) was passed by voice vote.\n       In 1936, the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act was passed \n     by voice vote.\n       In 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed by voice \n     vote.\n       In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act was passed when 68 Senators \n     voted to override President Truman's veto.\n       In 1959, only 2 Senators voted against the Labor-Management \n     Reporting and Disclosure Act (also known as the Landrum-\n     Griffin Act).\n       In 1965, the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act was \n     passed by voice vote.\n       In 1974, not a single Senator voted against the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act.\n       On January 20, 1959, Senator John F. Kennedy introduced a \n     section of the Landrum-Griffin Act. His remarks in his floor \n     speech were instructive and prophetic:\n\n       ``[T]he necessity for bipartisanship in labor legislation \n     is a principle which should guide us all. . . . So let us \n     avoid . . . unnecessary partisan politics or uninformed or \n     deliberate distortions. This is particularly true in the \n     controversial field of labor--which is precisely why no major \n     labor legislation has been passed in the last decade. The \n     extremists on both sides are always displeased. . . . [But] \n     in the words of Business Week magazine . . . `wise guidance \n     in the public interest can be substituted for concern over \n     wide apart partisan positions.' I wish to mention the key \n     provisions of the bill introduced today--the basic weapons \n     against racketeering which will be unavailable in the battle \n     against corruption if such a measure is not enacted by the \n     Congress this year: . . . Secret ballot for the election of \n     all union officers or of the convention delegates who select \n     them. . . . This is, in short, a strong bill--a bipartisan \n     measure--a bill that does the job which needs to be done \n     without bogging down the Congress with unrelated \n     controversies. Without doubt, the future course of our action \n     in this area will be plagued with the usual emotional \n     arguments, political perils, and powerful pressures which \n     always surround this subject.''\n\n       I am voting for cloture today because I believe that it is \n     time for Congress to thoroughly debate this issue and to \n     address the shortcomings in the National Labor Relations Act \n     in a bipartisan and comprehensive manner.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n\n[[Page S8383]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I have enjoyed the remarks, as always, by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. It is not a bad idea to consider labor-management \nrelations in a bipartisan way. A good place to start doing that is in \nthe Senate committees, where this discussion belongs, rather than \nbringing directly to the floor the question of whether we should just \none day decide to get rid of the secret ballot in elections.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has done a beautiful job of looking at \nhistory. Let me point to some history as well.\n  May 13, 1861, was the day set aside in North Carolina for the \nelection of delegates to the State Convention on Secession from the \nUnion. This is a book by William Trotter about bushwhackers. Part of \nthe United States in which I grew up and my family has come from is \nwhere counties and families were divided during the Civil War.\n  On that day, May 13, 1861, according to Mr. Trotter's book, there was \nto be a vote about secession, and one of the most visible people in the \nsquare on that misty spring day was the sheriff, who was an ardent \nspokesman for secession. He had been elected, according to the author, \nand supported by the wealthier farmers and merchants, nearly all of \nwhom favored the idea of secession.\n  The sheriff had gotten a little whiskey and was boisterous and \nencouraged by his supporters. He went around town making it clear the \nprevailing sentiment in the county was for secession. He was in an \nexuberant mood because he knew, at the end of day, secession would be \nratified. So exuberant was he, that he shot one of the Unionists, and \nthat person's father then shot the sheriff. That day is called ``Bloody \nMadison'' in western North Carolina.\n  But the point is that when the secret ballots were counted, despite \nthe sheriff and the wealthy farmers and merchants, there were only 28 \nvotes for secessionist delegates, and 144 voted to stay with the United \nStates of America. The secret ballot they exercised that day was for a \nreason. It made a difference.\n  In a little more personal way, a few months ago, we had a contest \nhere among friends for our No. 2 position on the Republican side of the \naisle. I sought it. So did my friend of 40 years, Trent Lott, the \nSenator from Mississippi. Going into the election, I had 27 votes. When \nthe votes were counted, I had 24. The secret ballot we employ in our \nSenate caucus we employ for a reason. It makes a difference.\n  The unions, in the 1930s, when they were gaining a foothold and being \nestablished, insisted on a secret ballot. They still have a secret \nballot when the vote is to decertify a union.\n\n  In our democracy, the right to vote is prized. We keep candidates \naway from polling places. We don't want people looking over your \nshoulder while you vote. We help you, if you can't read the ballot. We \ngot rid of the poll tax to give you access to the ballot. The Voting \nRights Act has become the single greatest symbol of the civil rights \nmovement in the 1960's. The right to vote is the essence of our \ndemocracy.\n  This proposed legislation is brazen kowtowing to union bosses. This \nbill creates the possibility that large union recruiters might come \nstand around you at the work site and encourage you to sign a card. \nThey might visit your home. They might make phone calls. They might be \nlike the sheriff in Madison County, elected by the powerful and very \npersuasive, going around with his pistol or his gun or his influence, \nor looking over your shoulder while you voted. Fortunately, instead of \nthat scenario, we have a secret ballot, and we ought to keep it.\n  What is next if we get rid of the secret ballot for union elections? \nWill we get rid of the secret ballot for union leaders, for Senators, \nfor Governors, for managers of the pension funds? Even most union \nmembers want to keep the secret ballot. According to a Zogby poll in \n2004, 71 percent said that the secret ballot process is fair, and 78 \npercent said they favored keeping the current system in place.\n  So whether it is voting day in Madison County at the beginning of the \ncivil war, whether it is the Senate caucus on the Republican or \nDemocratic side, or whether it is a union election to organize or to \ndecertify, the right to vote is precious in America. Not having someone \nlooking over your shoulder while you vote makes that precious right \neven more precious. There is a reason we have a secret ballot. It makes \na difference.\n  I intend to vote no on cloture. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, we are debating two things this morning, \nthe card check and immigration. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts earlier who made it possible for us to get an order \nfor speaking.\n  Let me associate myself with the remarks made by the Senator from \nTennessee relative to card check. It is totally inappropriate to \neliminate secret ballots in a democracy.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about the immigration bill. This is going \nto come to a vote in a few minutes, or in about an hour, and there are \nsome serious issues relative to the process. Since this is a process \nvote, I wanted to raise those issues. These are the issues: This bill \ncould have been handled well. It could have been addressed through a \nprocess that would have allowed amendments that Members wanted to hear \nand take up, but it hasn't been.\n  What has happened is there is a working organization which produced \nthe bill, and it is now controlling the amendment process. For example, \nI have requested that we have an effective, clean amendment on the \nissue of how we do H-1Bs. H-1Bs are a critical element of getting \nquality people to come to the United States and do jobs which we don't \npresently have people to do, mostly in the science field. Those people \ncreate jobs; they don't lose jobs. By bringing a person like that, we \nare actually creating a job center because that type of individual adds \nvalue to the American workplace. So we need a robust H-1B program. I \nwasn't saying it had to be in the bill, but I did say we have to have a \nclean vote on it so we can get an up-or-down vote on whether we are \ngoing to have a robust and effective H-1B program.\n  What has happened, however, is, through this process which has been \ndeveloped--which prejudices those of us who are not members of the \nprocess, and since there are only five or six people in the process, it \nis prejudicing obviously about 90 of us--there is a situation that has \nbeen created where even if I get a clean vote on H-1B, which I am not \nsure they will even give me that under this clay pigeon approach, there \nwill be language put in the managers' package which will basically gut \nthe H-1B program. It is called the Durbin language.\n  The practical effect of the Durbin language is this: It says if you \nbring somebody in under H-1B, you must pay them the prevailing wage \nunder skill level 2 of the prevailing wage. Well, the practical effect \nof that is it essentially means if you bring someone in under H-1B, \nafter you have paid all the fees, all the finding fees, all the \nattorney's fees, which adds a lot for bringing that type of individual \ninto this country, you then must pay a wage which is significantly \nhigher than other people working in that same area.\n  Take a small software company in New Hampshire, of which there are \nmany, that would use H-1B types of individuals, scientists, coming into \nour country. Let's say they had 10 positions, they only filled 9, so \nthey had to bring in a 10th person. The average wage for a software \nperson is about $80,000 in New Hampshire for nine of those people, but \nthe person who came into the country would get $100,000. On top of \nthat, they would also have the fees, the attorney's fees for getting \nthe permit to bring the individual into the country. Obviously, the \npractical effect of that would be that H-1B would not work.\n  So this language, which is essentially killer language to the H-1B \nprogram, is going to be put in the managers' package, as I understand--\nalthough I don't really know that because nobody will actually tell us \nwhat is going on; this\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\nis just a rumor--or alternatively, it is going to be put into somebody \nelse's amendment, which we know will pass. But, anyway, there is a deal \nin the works which says the people who drafted this bill are going to \nlock hands and make sure that language is put in the bill which, even \nif we get a decent vote on a decent H-1B program, will gut that vote.\n\n  That raises serious issues of process and obviously fairness. I just \nwanted to make it clear that I am not comfortable with it in its \npresent form and have significant reservations.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Kennedy, I yield \nmyself 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, history shows when the union movement is \nstrong, the middle class is strong. When the middle class is strong, \nour Nation is strong.\n  But when the union movement is under attack, the middle class is \nunder attack. When the middle class is under attack, our Nation is \nweaker economically and politically. Let there be no mistake, the union \nmovement and our middle class are under attack. Just take a look at the \nnumbers.\n  Since 1973, 26 percent of the workers in America belong to unions. \nThe pay and benefits, the working conditions, the basic dignity they \nfought for spilled over to the rest of working class Americans. We are \nall better off for it.\n  I would like to show you a couple of charts. Between 1947 and 1973, \nif you look at rising income growth, and based on the percentile of \nincome shown on this chart, essentially everyone from 1947 to 1973--the \nrising tide lifts all boats, and it lifted all boats--there was an \nactual real income growth of almost 118 percent for the lowest 20 \npercentile. The top 20 percentile grew over 80 percent. There was some \ngenuine equity.\n  Then take a look at what happened as the union movement began to take \nblows from the Supreme Court and the NLRB. There used to be card check \nback in those days, by the way. If you wanted to join a union, you got \na card check, a little like we are talking about now.\n  Look what happened between 1973 and the year 2000. Real income \ngrowth, the lowest 20 percent, grew just about 12 percent. The top 20 \npercent grew over 67 percent. We begin to see the building inequities \nas a consequence of the demise of the American union movement, as well \nas tax policy and the types of jobs we are creating.\n  Now, because I only have 5 minutes, I am going to do this quickly. \nLet's fast-forward to the era of President Bush, George W. Bush. Look \nwhat has happened in terms of real income growth, in terms of 2004 \ndollars. There has actually been a net decline in the income of the \nlowest 20 percent, almost 5 percent; the second lowest tier, almost 4 \npercent; the middle income, people making between $40,000 and $60,000 \nper family, their real income actually dropped over 2 percent--all the \nway across the board, everybody but the top 1 percent. You have to have \nan income roughly of $435,000 to make it into that category. Average \nsalary income in that category is $1.4-plus million per year. That is \nthe only outfit growing, and look at what happened.\n  If I could superimpose a chart on organized labor, you would see a \ndirect decline; you would see an inverse proportion of what happened. \nAs labor declined, the economic power of corporate America increased, \nand the power of the wealthiest among us skyrocketed.\n  It is time to change. Today, just 12 percent of American workers \nbelong to unions, and the spending power of the paycheck is actually \nlower than it was in 1973. The median income is lower, but productivity \nis up more than 80 percent since 1973.\n  It used to be we had a grand bargain in this country. As labor \nincreased productivity, as they did more, as businesses and \nstockholders were able to benefit from the increased productivity, they \nbenefited. Now it is in inverse proportion. On the sweat and their \nbacks, they have increased productivity, and they have been penalized \nfor it.\n  Even in my State of Delaware, the hourly wage is down since 2000. The \nmedian family income is below its 2000 level. The number of workers \nrepresented and protected by unions has fallen from 1 in 4 in 1973 to 1 \nin 10 today. The basic social compact that built our economy, that \nbuilt our middle class, that built our country after World War II, has \nbeen broken. That compact said if workers produce more, they would \nshare in the gains. Today, that is not true. Unions help to cut that \ndeal, and they kept their end of the bargain. Business and government \nhave not kept their part of the deal.\n  It is harder now to organize, harder to get a union certified to \nrepresent the interests of the workers. It is harder because business \nis fighting back harder because this administration has launched its \nown unrelenting attack on the union movement. It is not just pay that \nhas taken a hit. Basic benefits such as health care, pensions--things \nunions fought for and won--they are, more and more, just a thing of the \npast.\n  More and more of the American people have no health insurance--46 \nmillion as of last year--a number that just keeps growing. In my State \nof Delaware there are 100,000 uninsured.\n  Just imagine the fear, the insecurity, the helplessness that the \nfamilies must feel, going from day to day--the man lying in bed and the \nwoman lying in bed at night staring at the ceiling, having no \ninsurance, looking over at his pregnant wife, knowing it is a premature \nchild, and they will literally lose their house.\n  I yield myself 3 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, a quarter of a century ago, 9 out of 10 \nAmerican workers could count on a pension plan with a guaranteed \npayout. They had security in knowing they could pay their bills. Today, \nonly about one-third of Americans are in that shape.\n  Union membership means more security. The facts are clear. Union jobs \nearn 30 percent more than nonunion jobs.\n  We have to stop and reverse the decline of union membership, and that \nmeans passing the Employee Free Choice Act, which I have supported from \nthe beginning, and which used to exist.\n  In Delaware right now the Laborers International Union of North \nAmerica says the majority of the workers at the Walker International \nTransportation Company near my home in New Castle, DE, want to join \nthem. They want to join because they need the benefits such as decent \nhealth care, pay, and working conditions for which unions have fought. \nSince May, the union has filed four complaints with the NLRB, \ncomplaints that the company is interfering with their organizing \nefforts.\n  Under current law, this process could be drawn out indefinitely. They \nshould be able to resolve this with a clear, simple count of cards, \ncertified by the National Labor Relations Board.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act will make the will of the majority of \nworkers clearer. It will punish employers who break the law, and it \nwill guarantee that new unions will get their first contract, not just \nanother runaround.\n  It is time to bring the strength of the union movement back within \nthe reach of the American people. It is time to rebuild the middle \nclass by giving organized labor the strength to fight for decent pay \nand benefits.\n  My colleagues, it is time for a new social compact, a new social \ncompact because of white-collar workers who never thought they needed a \nunion, and who all of a sudden are finding out their companies are not \nso generous with them when they walk in and shut down a division and \nshut them out. I say to my colleagues, I believe American white-collar \nworkers who never thought about the union movement are prepared to \nthink about it now.\n  I don't want to just reverse the slide of organized labor in America, \nI want to energize a new compact between white-collar workers and blue-\ncollar workers to give back power to the middle class so this graph you \nsee here from the year 2008 through 2020 looks more like this graph \nthat existed from\n\n[[Page S8385]]\n\n1947 to 1973. It is the only way to keep the middle class in the game. \nThey are getting crushed now. They are getting crushed.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague for the time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, as I allocate the time, I do want people \nto know that the next sentence I say is tongue in cheek. I had no idea \nthat taking the secret ballot away from America's workers could solve \nall the problems of the world.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming.\n  It never ceases to amaze me the tremendous creativity that exists in \nthe Senate, just by virtue of the name of this act we are discussing \ntoday, the Employee Free Choice Act, and to, of course, hear my \ncolleague, the Senator from Delaware, talk about some of the ills that \nface labor today. Certainly, I want to say that as someone who has \nworked as a laborer and as someone who has worked with people who have \nworked in labor, I want to make sure the American people have good \nwages.\n  I agree with that 100 percent. I think all of us in America want to \nsee people make a good living, to be able to raise their families in a \nway that certainly is full of respect. I want to see the same things \noccur.\n  I wish to say this debate today is most unusual. To talk about this \nvote we are going to have a little later today as being one about \n``free choice'' is most ironic. Unlike most people who serve in the \nSenate, I have actually carried a union card. I have actually paid \nunion dues. I have actually served as a trustee on a pension fund to \nensure employees of mine who were union employees were able to receive \ntheir pensions down the road. So I worked with labor and I have been a \nlaborer. I have been one of those people who certainly was talked to \nabout organization and about people being members of a union.\n  I wish to say again--to reiterate what the Senator from Wyoming \nsaid--it is amazing that all of the ills relating to the labor movement \ntoday can be brought back to this one act that we are talking about \ntoday that has to do with card check.\n  I know people have talked about Supreme Court rulings and about books \nand about a lot of things. I wish to talk about what it means to be out \non a jobsite and to be talking with union representatives, whether it \nis on a picket line or on the jobsite itself. If this act were to pass, \ninstead of people having a secret ballot, such as we have in the Senate \nwhen we select our leadership, such as people have when they vote for \nus to be in the Senate--instead of that, what would occur is that each \nindividual would be talked to about whether they would like to see a \nunion come in. I have witnessed this, where people would go up to a \nwater cooler on a construction site, and four or five large people \nrepresenting the union gather around that person and ask them if they \nwould like to be a member of the union. I have witnessed this when \npeople are living out in rural areas and they don't want to vote for \nthe union, but people pay them a visit in the dark of night suggesting \nthey should check off a card, if you will, so they can call the union \nto form in the organization they happen to work for.\n  This is not about free choice. Certainly, this is about making sure \nthe union leaders don't have to do the job that is necessary to cause \npeople to want to join their union by offering the membership things \nthey would like to have, but instead they would have the ability to \nstrongarm people and cause people to do things that are not in their \nown interest. What is amazing to me is that union membership doesn't \neven want to see this happen.\n  What this, in essence, would do is cause union leadership not to even \nhave to carry out their jobs in a way that would cause people to want \nto be a member of the union but instead threaten people at the jobsite, \nat their homes late at night, to cause them to be a member of the \nunion.\n  For that reason, and because of the time we have at this point, I \nurge all those in the Senate to vote against this piece of legislation, \nwhich goes against the very principle we all support, and that is \nsecret ballots, freedom of choice. I vehemently oppose this legislation \nbecause I believe this would set our country back a hundred years. I \nurge my fellow Senators to vote against this act.\n  I yield the rest of my time to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, we are hearing two debates today, and that \nwas intentional. We will shift gears and go to immigration.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming, a fine \nSenator and a great manager of legislation.\n  I have to tell you we pretty well know this card check bill is going \ndown like a lead balloon. We have an issue that has galvanized the \nattention of the American public--and we will be voting on that at the \nsame time--and that is the immigration bill that we are about to go to.\n  I think it is odd that the allocators of time allocated a rather \nsmall amount of time to Senator Enzi to allocate to those who oppose \nthis legislation.\n  Let me--since I only have 5 minutes and maybe now 4--see if I can \nsuccinctly say to my colleagues why the legislation before us today is \na bad piece of legislation. Yes, we need to reform immigration; yes, we \nneed to reform immigration in much the way those who are promoting this \nlegislation say it should be reformed. But the bill we are going to \nvote on will not do that--very much like 1986, when the promoters of \nthat bill said: Let's give amnesty to 3 million people and we will \ncreate a legal system in the future that will work.\n  Why would I say that, that this bill does not work? Our own \nCongressional Budget Office, on June 4--this month--did an analysis of \nthe legislation. They concluded that if this bill were to become law, \nillegal immigration would only be reduced 13 percent. What an \nastounding number. Only 13 percent? We have been hearing we must pass \nthis immigration bill, and if you don't like amnesty, you must vote for \nit because that is the only way we are going to create a legal system \nof immigration in America.\n  My analysis, before CBO came out with theirs, was that the bill would \nnot be effective; it had loophole after loophole. They concluded the \nsame. They say a 25-percent reduction in the border security and an \nincrease in visa overstays nets a 13-percent reduction. That is in the \nCBO report, which is available to every Senator. We should look at \nthat. How can we vote for legislation that we know is not going to work \nas it is promised to work?\n  Second, I don't know that the American people or Members of this body \nrealize it will double the legal immigration flow into America over the \nnext 20 years, giving twice as many green card statuses, legal \npermanent resident statuses, as the current law provides. We are not \ngoing to get any substantial reduction in illegality. We are going to \ndouble illegality. It will cost, according to CBO, the Treasury of the \nUnited States $30 billion--not expenses of enforcement, none of that, \nbut for additional welfare and other benefits that would be paid to \nthose who come into the country illegally.\n  Senator Biden talked about the middle class. This is not a little \nissue. I don't know that his numbers were exactly correct. But for some \ntime I have been troubled by the fact that middle and lower skilled \nworkers have not seen their income levels rise at the rate that \ncorporate executives are seeing their income levels rise. Friday, when \nI left this body, right on the street there was a gentleman out there \nwho had gray hair and a gray beard and he had a sign about jobs. I \nspoke to him. He said he opposed this immigration bill. He was a master \ncarpenter from Melbourne, FL. He told me that he, in the 1990s, was \nmaking $75,000 a year. Now he is making a fraction of that. He is going \nto have to get out of the business. He attributed that solely to \nillegal immigration, this incredible flow of almost unlimited numbers \nof workers into his neighborhood, which had made his skill far less \nvaluable.\n\n  If we are concerned about the middle class, we have to ask how many \nworkers this country can accept without\n\n[[Page S8386]]\n\nseeing a marked drop in their income. The American people do not like \nthis bill. Our phones are ringing off the hook. A decent respect for \nour constituents, I urge my colleagues, would be to say you have \nrejected this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and urge that we \nvote against cloture on this legislation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I was forwarded a copy of a transcript \nof an interview of a White House official yesterday commenting on some \nremarks I made on the floor regarding the immigration bill. I wish to \nspeak to that.\n  I have argued the current bill sets up the Department of Homeland \nSecurity for failure because it requires the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to grant full work and travel authorization to applicants for \nZ visas within 24 hours of their application, whether or not a \nbackground check has been completed. That is the text in the current \nimmigration bill. Yesterday, though, the White House told reporters \nthis was part of a ``misunderstanding and mythology'' surrounding this \nprovision.\n  Let me quote the text of the provision. It reads:\n\n       No probationary benefits shall be issued to an alien until \n     the alien has passed all appropriate background checks or the \n     end of the next business day, whichever is sooner.\n\n  That is what the bill says. There is no mythology, no \nmisunderstanding. I know people think that draft language is a perfect \ndraft and believe it should attain its own mythological status, but \nthis is pretty straightforward. If an alien applies, he or she gets \nlegal status, full travel and work authorization no later than the next \nday.\n  The White House official believes this provision is workable because, \nas he says, ``Four of the layers of that background check are almost \ninvariably completed within 24 hours.'' ``Almost'' always completing a \nbackground check within 24 hours is not always completing a background \ncheck within 24 hours. He acknowledges that one of the checks takes \nlonger than 24 hours. So by his own admission, the Department of \nHomeland Security will confer legal status to nearly every applicant, \neven though they have not completed a background check.\n  This is not what the American people are hearing when they are \nselling this bill. The American people are being told that foreign \nnationals will have to pass a background check before they are granted \nlegal status. This is not true, according to the text of the underlying \nbill, and it is not factually possible, according to the lead \nnegotiator from the White House.\n  Not to be deterred by facts, however, this official believes this \nshould be of no concern because if anything comes up in the background \ncheck beyond the 24-hour period, then the Department of Homeland \nSecurity will declare that person ineligible and deport them.\n  Certainly, that is a concept we can all support; that is, if someone \nis ineligible, they should be deported. My concern is the gulf between \nthe promise being made to the American people and the likelihood that \nthat promise will be carried out. The White House said this is of no \nconcern because they will declare them ineligible and deport them. But \nthe question Americans are asking is: Will they? Can they? If they \nalready have this capability, why has nothing been done about 623,000 \nalien absconders already?\n  The Department of Homeland Security has reportedly created a unit to \ntrack down, apprehend, and deport these fugitives, but no appreciable \ndent has been made in this number. The Department of Homeland Security \nhas information on these individuals already.\n  But let's keep in mind that as the Department of Homeland Security is \nso diligently tracking down the thousands of criminal aliens who have \nalready had a chance and have gone underground, or have left the \ncountry and reentered illegally based on a deportation order, they have \nto do a lot of other things, and Americans are asking can they get all \nof this done? Can they train, hire, and deploy up to 20,000 additional \nBorder Patrol agents? Can they implement a worker verification system \nto screen the workers around the country? Can they build up to the 370 \nmiles of fencing and 300 miles of vehicle barriers? Can they deploy the \nsecure border initiative? Can they deploy the exit monitoring system of \nthe US-VISIT Program? Can they process 12 million initial applicants \nfor Z visas? Can they build 105 radar and camera towers? Can they \ndetain all removable aliens caught on the southern border utilizing \ndetention facilities with a capacity of only 31,500 people per day?\n  I think the American people can be forgiven for doubting the \ncommitment of the Federal Government and the willingness of the Federal \nGovernment to actually do all the things it is promising. That is why \nthis bill is such a tough sell, to say the least--especially because, \nas of 2 years ago, we were doing nothing to beef up border security. It \nis hard to take the commitment at face value that, yes, now we are \nserious about it.\n  So I fear that, similar to 1986, we are being promised something the \nAmerican people know we cannot and will not deliver. We should slow \ndown, read this bill, offer and debate amendments that will improve the \nbill and vote on amendments freely.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The fact is, if we sink this bill, if we vote against this bill, we \nwouldn't even have tried to do all the background checks, we wouldn't \neven have tried to get a secure border.\n  We know what so many Members of this body are against, but we have \nyet to hear what they are for. The Senator from Texas outlined in very \nconsiderable detail the kind of security to which we believe this \nlegislation is committed. Defeat this legislation and all of that \nsecurity is out the window.\n  This bill may not be perfect, but it is the best opportunity we have \nto do something significant and substantial, and I believe the bill is \ngood.\n  I see my friend from Ohio. I yield him 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise in support of the Employee Free \nChoice Act which will be in front of this body this week. Historians \nwho take a clear-eyed look at the last 30 years will tell you \nproductivity has been rising, our economy has been expanding, corporate \nprofits are up, executive salaries are way up, and yet the workers \nresponsible for our Nation's prosperity have not reaped anywhere near \ntheir share of the benefits.\n  The hallmark of our economy for generations has been those people who \nproduce the wealth, people who work with their hands, people who work \nwith their minds, the employees of this country. Those who produce \nwealth will share in the wealth they create. As productivity goes up, \nthrough most of our history, certainly in the last 100 years, so have \nwages. But things have changed.\n  In 2005, the real median household income in America was down 3 \npercent from the median income in 2000. In Ohio, my State, it was down \nalmost 10 percent. Meanwhile, the average CEO makes 411 times more than \nthe average worker. In 1990, the average CEO made 107 times more. We \ncan see, as productivity goes up for workers, executives make more, \nprofits are higher, but workers are not sharing in the wealth they \ncreate. That is what made the 2006 elections so important because the \nmiddle class spoke up, the middle class understanding their wages are \nstagnated, understanding they have not shared in the wealth they \ncreated. That is what makes today so important.\n  We are considering today landmark legislation supported by workers, \nemployers, religious organizations, civil rights groups, advocates for \nchildren's legislation, which will give employees a real choice on \nwhether they want to join a union.\n  This legislation probably won't pass this week. Republicans have \nagain, one more time, threatened to filibuster and one more time we \nprobably won't get the 60 votes to pass this legislation. But it is \nclear a majority of the American people want it, a majority of the \nHouse of Representatives wants it, a majority of the Senate wants it. \nWe will keep coming back year after year\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\nsupported by these workers, employers, religious organizations, civil \nrights groups, and advocates for children.\n  I would point out, in pursuit of economic justice, why this Employee \nFree Choice Act is so important and what has happened to our economy in \nthe last six decades. Each of these bars represents 20 percent of wage \nearners in this country, the lowest 20-percent wage earners and the \nhighest 20 percent. We can see, from 1947 to 1973, the height of \nunionism in our country, the period when the most American workers \nbelonged to unions, what happened. There was strong economic growth for \nall of society, for all workers in every category, but the strongest \neconomic growth in wages was the lowest 20-percent of wage earners from \n1947 to 1973.\n  In the seventies and eighties, the percentage of American workers in \nunions declined. Other things were going on too, such as the trade \nsurplus went to a trade deficit, and other things. The big part of that \nwas unionization. Look at 1973 to 2000; there was still economic growth \nin all segments of our society. On average, in each category, workers' \nincomes went up, but the lowest 20 percent had the lowest percentage \ngrowth in income, and the highest 20 percent had the highest growth in \nincome. We can already see a splitting apart, where wage growth did not \nquite track productivity.\n  Since 2000, we can see something else happened. This trend has \nexploded. Since 2000, all five categories have seen their wages go \ndown. The lowest 20 percent has had the biggest decline. Only when we \ncut off the top 1 percent have we seen incomes go up. The top 1 percent \nhas seen their incomes go up 6 percent; the lowest has seen their \nincomes drop about 5 percent. Again, that is in large part because \nfewer and fewer Americans belong to labor unions, and it is more and \nmore difficult to join a union.\n  Employers are stronger. Employers spend more money. Employers hire \nmore firms with great expertise on how to stop union drives, to defeat \nunions, to refuse to bargain if a union is voted in. Literally there \nhave been tens of thousands of infractions those employers have engaged \nin against their employees. This bill makes sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on \ncloture on the check card bill. I urge them to do this because a secret \nballot is not only a part of the political process in the United \nStates, but a part of a process in many organizations to make sure that \npeople vote their convictions and not their emotions or emotions that \nhave been forced upon them.\n  I want to use a personal example of why I think, in union elections \nin particular, a secret ballot is so important. I have told some of my \ncolleagues, not very often, but in past debates on the floor of the \nSenate that while I was a member of the State legislature, I worked at \na factory in Cedar Falls, IA, called Waterloo Register Company. We made \nfurnace registers. I had the glorious job for those 10 years of putting \nscrew holes with a small punch in those registers. I worked there from \nSeptember of 1961 until the plant shut down in March of 1971. During \nthat period of time, from February of 1962 until the plant shut down, I \nwas a member of the International Association of Machinists. Everything \nwas going all right for that plant until about 1967, 1968, 1969, when \nour products made by the International Association of Machinists were \nnot being installed by the Sheet Metal Workers Union members in \nPennsylvania, is what I was told at the time. Our company wanted us to \nchange from the International Association of Machinists to Sheet Metal \nWorkers. This is not an instance of the company trying to keep a union \nout. There was already a union there. The company was getting behind \nthe Sheet Metal Workers Union in a dispute that involved an illegal \nsecondary boycott against our products. So our management thought if we \nwere part of the Sheet Metal Workers Union we would get our products \ninstalled easier around the country by sheet metal worker installers. \nPresumably, we were one of the few companies making registers at that \nparticular time that was a member of the International Association of \nMachinists, as opposed to being a member of the Sheet Metal Workers.\n  So our company and that union pushed to have an election to change \nunions from International Association of Machinists to Sheet Metal \nWorkers. It was highly debated. Obviously, machinists and their members \nloyal to them wanted the machinists union to stay. The company and some \nworkers who were sympathetic to the company point of view would rather \nhave the Sheet Metal Workers Union because we were told they would not \nstay in business if the Sheet Metal Workers were not there.\n  We had an election. I forget the exact date. I tried to look up \nnewspaper stories for this debate, and I couldn't find them. My \nrecollection is that in March of 1969 or March of 1970, we had an \nelection. I remember driving 100 miles from Des Moines where the \nlegislature was in session to my factory--I had a leave of absence--to \nvote in that election. I don't mind telling people how I voted. I voted \nto keep the International Association of Machinists because I had been \na member for 6 or 7 years. I thought they were serving my interests \nright. I wanted to keep them in there, and I didn't believe the story \nof the management and I didn't believe we should ratify an illegal \nsecondary boycott.\n  In the meantime, we obviously got a lot of pressure both ways--from \nthe machinists to keep the machinists, and we got a lot of pressure \nfrom management to change the union. There was a lot of intimidation. \nBut we could go into that secret voting booth and cast our ballot, and \nnobody knew how we voted. We did vote, and we kept the International \nAssociation of Machinists in that particular election.\n  I know the overall reasons haven't changed in the last 40 years to \nhave a secret ballot. They have been debated well here. But I thought I \nwould share with my colleagues a personal story about the intimidation \nthat can come from management, not necessarily from the union, to vote \na certain way.\n  Consequently, I was fortunate we were able to keep our International \nAssociation of Machinists, and everybody went on happily until the \nplant finally closed down a couple years later.\n  So, I urge colleagues to vote against cloture and preserve the secret \nballot to ensure that the intimidation that can be active by management \nas well as labor isn't used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote \n``yes'' on the motion to proceed to S. 1639, the immigration reform \npackage. This immigration reform legislation has been long in coming. \nImmigration has been debated on the floor in the last year for almost a \nmonth. We debated it earlier this year for several weeks. It has been \nthe subject of multiple hearings.\n  The fact is this national security problem is not going to go away \nuntil the Members of the Senate have the courage to stand up and deal \nwith this issue.\n  The legislation before this body may not be the perfect legislation \neverybody wants, and there are people who will find fault with the \nlegislation, but at the end of the day, it addresses three fundamental \nprinciples we must address on immigration reform.\n  The first of those principles is that it secures America's borders, \nand it does that with tough provisions in how we police the borders, \nthe addition of more Border Patrol agents, 370 miles of fencing, 70 \nground-based radar and camera towers, 200 miles of vehicle barriers, \nnew checkpoints of entry, and so forth.\n  Second, this law will enforce our Nation's immigration laws for the \nfirst time. For far too long, for the last 20 years, what has happened \nis America has looked the other way and turned a blind eye toward the \nenforcement of\n\n[[Page S8388]]\n\nour laws in this country. This legislation has significant enforcement \nprovisions in it that will, in fact, be enforced and funded.\n  Third, this legislation secures America's economic future. It does it \nby the passage of the AgJOBS Act which is supported by more than 800 \norganizations, farmers, ranchers, and the agricultural community \nthroughout our great Nation.\n  It addresses the economic needs of America by moving forward with a \nnew temporary worker program that will address the needs of America \ntoday in terms of jobs that other people do not want.\n  And finally, it sets forth a realistic solution for America's \nundocumented workforce, and it is a far cry from what those who are on \nthe other side of this issue will say--that it is amnesty. It is not. \nWhen we are having the people pay the kinds of penalties we have in the \nbill, when we have them go to the back of the line, when we put them \nthrough an 8-year purgatory, when we put them through that probationary \nperiod of time, what we are saying to them is: You have broken the law, \nyou are going to pay significantly to get back into the line relative \nto the possibility of having a green card which will not come until 8 \nto 13 years from now.\n  So I think we have struck the right balance here, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to move forward and to give us a ``yes'' vote on the motion \nto proceed to debate this fundamental issue of national security.\n  Finally, I would say that the moral issues which are at stake, which \nare at the foundation of this debate on immigration, are moral issues \nwe cannot escape from. This Senate has to have the courage to stand up \nand say we are going to address those issues now.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are here today to bring a long overdue \nmeasure of fairness to a system that because of years of powerful \nopposition and millions of dollars spent remains rigged against the \nAmerican worker.\n  Today, it is simply too difficult for workers to claim their legal \nright to join a union and too easy for employers to prevent them from \ndoing so. This is no accident, and it must change.\n  Throughout our history, it is the labor movement above all else which \nhas stood up as the driving force in support of working Americans, a \ngateway to the middle class. So much of what we take for granted \ntoday--the 5-day workweek, paid vacations, pensions, health insurance \ndidn't happen by accident; they became reality because people in \norganized labor were willing to fight, willing to march, and sometimes \nwilling to die to stand up for the rights of the American worker.\n  But the work of making America a little bit more fair and a little \nbit more just isn't over--and once again to achieve another milestone \nwe must stand with labor over the objections of powerful corporate \nopposition.\n  As a cosponsor and strong supporter of the Employee Free Choice Act \nof 2007, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture to pass this \nimportant legislation and continue the march of progress in this \ncentury which organized labor began in the last one.\n  In 1935 Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, \nhistoric legislation that marked the first time the Federal Government \nrecognized collective bargaining as a right for workers. Employees won \nthe right to organize and a legal forum to settle disputes with \nmanagement, air grievances, and generally improve workplace standards.\n  This 1935 law represented a tremendous breakthrough for workers, but \nits unintended consequences have worked to undo its basic promise that \nwhen a majority of workers want to join a union, they have the right to \ndo so.\n  Unfortunately, the union recognition process today allows antiunion \nemployers to stall both the organizing and bargaining process for \nmonths and even years--opening up the door for the very abuses the NLRA \nexplicitly seeks to prevent.\n  First, once workers decide and demonstrate that they would like to \nunionize, our current system offers employers a window of time in which \nto lobby, cajole, and otherwise pressure them not to do so before \nholding a surreptitious secret vote. When presented with signatures \nfrom a majority of employees, employers can call for a secret \nelection--delaying the process and creating a window of opportunity \nduring which employers can hire antiunion consultants, conduct an \nunlimited number of employee meetings, and bar labor representatives \nfrom the workplace.\n  Second, under the current rules, there are too few penalties to \ndissuade companies from taking illegal actions far beyond the \nquestionable practices permissible under the NLRA. Facing light \npenalties, companies make a rational calculation that it is cheaper to \nviolate labor laws and be punished than it is to follow them.\n  In 2005, the National Labor Relations Board, NLRB, reported that \n31,000 workers were disciplined or fired for union activity. Studies \nshow that employees are fired in one-quarter of all organizing \ncampaigns and that one in five workers who openly advocate for a union \nduring an election campaign is fired.\n  The odds are stacked against workers: when they present a majority, \ntheir employers are given every chance to dissuade them from \nunionizing. When employers cross these already generous lines and break \nthe law, they are not held to account.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act of 2007 brings the letter of the law in \nline with the spirit of the law. It takes practical measures to protect \nand deliver what is supposedly already guaranteed: workers' right to \norganize.\n  The bill requires the NLRB and businesses to recognize a union when a \nmajority of employees have signed their names to authorization cards \nand presented them to the National Labor Review Board. It also requires \na binding arbitration process if an employer and a new union cannot \nreach agreement on an initial contract, empowers the NLRB to enforce \ncompliance with the law in Federal court, and levies substantial fines \non employers that engage in union-busting activities.\n  This legislation is about fundamental fairness. Millions of Americans \nwant to join a union and ought to be able to, but can't. Just ask John \nElia of Melrose, MA, field technician for Verizon who wants to organize \nhis unit within the Communication Workers of America. John has been \ntrying for months to get Verizon to recognize the union authorization \ncards he and the majority of his coworkers have signed. He even handed \nthe signed cards to Verizon's CEO Ivan Seidenberg and asked him to \naccept them, but he was refused. Earlier this year, Congressman Stephen \nLynch, Congressman John Tierney, Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Tim \nMurray, and I publicly verified the field technician's authorization \ncards and called on Verizon to recognize them but we were refused as \nwell.\n  John Elia wants what every worker wants--better pay, decent health \ncare, a stable retirement plan, and real job security. Research shows \nthat unionized workers are paid 30 percent more than nonunion workers, \n92 percent of unionized workers have some health care coverage, and \nthree out of four have defined benefit retirement plans--compared to \njust one in six nonunion members. No wonder a majority of Americans say \nthey would join a union if they could.\n  This bill is especially timely because the Bush administration has \nrolled back the clock on worker rights and created an atmosphere that \nhas emboldened many employers to engage in the kind of illegal activity \nthat this bill would help end. For instance, Wal-Mart has been known to \nshut down stores and relocate them with different employees to prevent \nthem from organizing. The Employee Free Choice Act would require the \ncountry's biggest employer to finally recognize its employees' right to \nform unions and bargain for better pay and benefits.\n  Opponents of this bill including the Chamber of Commerce want us to \nbelieve that instant card check recognition is undemocratic and will \nhurt businesses. In fact, it fulfills the promise of the National Labor \nRelations Act of 1935 by ensuring that a majority organizing vote will \nbe honored. What is more democratic than honoring the wishes of the \nmajority? Doubters at the Chamber of Commerce may also want to talk to \ncell phone provider Cingular, which has voluntarily agreed to honor \ninstant card check unionization. Cingular reported $9 billion in \nrevenue and a record $782 million fourth quarter profit in 2006. It \nhardly seems to be struggling under the weight of its unions.\n\n[[Page S8389]]\n\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship, let me assure you that this bill is not bad for \nsmall businesses. It is aimed at large businesses that engage in union-\nbusting, something small businesses cannot afford to do. In fact, 20 \nmillion out of America's 26 million small businesses don't have any \nemployees.\n  We must restore balance to a broken labor system that breeds \nresentment on both sides. We must do so most of all so that millions of \nAmericans see their hard work translate into a better standard of \nliving. I urge my colleagues to support cloture so that we can improve \nconditions for hardworking Americans everywhere.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Employee \nFree Choice Act, a bill that will ensure dignity and prosperity for \nmillions of American workers.\n  It is no secret that unions helped build in America the largest and \nstrongest middle class the world had ever seen. But where does that \nmiddle class stand today? Since 2000, real median household income is \ndown, real wages are down; real wages, in fact, are lower now than they \nwere in 1973. Nearly 50 million Americans, and more every day, are \nwithout health insurance. And all this stagnation while corporate \nprofits are up 83 percent since 2005, while the pay of CEOs has \nskyrocketed to 411 times the pay of their workers.\n  It is no secret that, while American inequality has reached these \nheights, fewer and fewer workers are members of unions. In large part, \nthat is not by choice. Worker intimidation is not the activity of a few \noutlaws--it is persistent, it is systemic, and it is devastating. \nEmployers illegally fired workers in one quarter of union organizing \ndrives. In 2005, more than 30,000 workers were discriminated against in \nconnection with union-busting activities.\n  If we are going to preserve the American middle class--if workers are \ngoing to have the ability to bargain for their fair share--then we need \nto deter coercion and discrimination; we need a way for workers to \nfearlessly let their voices be heard.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act is the tool they need. It has three key \nprovisions.\n  First, the bill recognizes that union elections are often the high \npoint of employers' intimidation tactics. Rather than provide them a \nconcentrated target, the EFCA establishes majority signup: If a \nmajority of workers sign cards stating that they want union \nrepresentation, a union is certified as their official collective \nbargaining agent. Workers are still free to participate in a secret \nballot election supervised by the National Labor Relations Board if \nthey so choose; but the Employee Free Choice Act gives that choice to \nworkers themselves.\n  Second, the bill provides strict penalties for employers interfering \nwith their workers' free choice to join or establish a union. Under the \nbill, the National Labor Relations Board may obtain a court injunction \nagainst an employer that is illegally firing or otherwise harassing \nworkers. Illegally fired workers will be entitled to three times their \nback pay--a strong deterrent. And willful and repeated violation of \nworkers' rights will result in a civil fine of $20,000 per incident. \nThese penalties replace consequences that, to date, have proven \nineffective. Companies will no longer have an incentive to ignore the \nlaw.\n  Third, the bill makes it easier for unions and employers to reach \ntheir first contract. It stipulates that bargaining must begin within \n10 days of a new union being certified. If, after 90 days, no agreement \nhas been reached, this legislation then authorizes either party to seek \nmediation through the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, \nwhich, in 2006 handled more than 5,500 cases and had an 86 percent \nsuccess rate; if no contract is reached after 30 days of mediation, the \nparties will then submit to binding arbitration, which will impose a \ncontract that lasts for 2 years. This clear process ensures that unions \nserve their purpose--because, without contracts, collective bargaining \nis meaningless.\n  There is no doubt that majority signup, stricter intimidation \npenalties, and the clear first contract process will strengthen \nAmerican unions. But this is not a union bill, not if that term is \nunderstood to mean any narrow constituency or any narrow interest. \nWhatever his or her choice, it is in the interest of every American \nworker to have that choice recorded fairly, free from fear and threat. \nWhen the unfair and illegal barriers are removed, however, I am \nconfident that more and more workers will put their trust in unions. \nUnions offer millions of us better wages, sounder health care, and more \nsecure pensions. They are the best way we have yet discovered to share \nthe fruits of our prosperity more equally. Workers know that, Mr. \nPresident--and they are waiting to be heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to H.R. 800, the so-\ncalled Employee Free Choice Act of 2007. Not only is the bill's title \ndeceptive, the enactment of such an ill-conceived legislative measure \nwould be a gross deception to the hard-working Americans who would fall \nvictim to it.\n  Since the inception of our democracy, we as citizens have placed a \ngreat amount of pride in our ability to freely cast votes and voice our \nopinions on how Federal, State, and local business should be conducted. \nOur ability to voice opinions through secret ballots stands as one of \nthe hallmarks of our democratic process. Certainly, now, perhaps more \nthan ever, we should be working to uphold this hallmark, not tear it \ndown for the convenience of organized labor, which has been struggling \nwith a declining membership. This bill is the product of partisan \npolitics at its worst, and it must be soundly defeated.\n  During the early 20th century, we experienced a rapid growth in our \nlabor force and, as a result, a push by unions to increase their \nmembership. In response to aggressive and questionable recruiting \npractices by some unions, Congress passed the National Labor Relations \nAct, NRLA, of 1947. One of the main tenets of this legislation was to \nafford hard-working Americans the right to privately cast their vote on \nwhether to organize, free of intimidation and coercion from union \nrepresentatives and employees. Unfortunately, before us today is a bill \nthat seeks to strip this fundamental right from our Nation's workers. \nIronically dubbed the ``Employee Free Choice Act of 2007,'' this \nlegislation would enact a ``card check'' process, allowing unions to \nbypass the long used and successful secret balloting system.\n  The proposed legislation is a direct attack on one of the most basic \ntenets of our democratic process, which is why it is opposed by a \nmajority of American workers. A recent poll conducted by the \nnonpartisan Coalition for a Democratic Workplace found that 90 percent \nof union households oppose this legislation. Another poll by McLaughlin \nand Associates indicated that almost 9 out of 10 voters agree that \nworkers should continue to have the right to a federally supervised \nsecret ballot election when deciding whether to organize a union.\n  My concern is--and it is a concern shared by many--that if enacted \nthis measure would expose workers to intimidation and the fear of \nretaliation for votes cast. We simply cannot allow this assault on \ndemocracy from becoming law. Instead, we should be working for the \nswift enactment of S. 1312, the Secret Ballot Protection Act of 2007, \nwhich I am proud to cosponsor along with 26 of my colleagues, to ensure \nsecret ballot elections for employees.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on H.R. 800 and to halt the \nfull Senate's debate on this ill-conceived, flawed measure.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nEmployee Free Choice Act. For far too long, our Nation's labor laws \nhave created an environment that has made it harder and harder for \nworkers to organize and form unions.\n  The current system overwhelmingly favors the employer, who too often \nuse their advantage to intimidate and coerce their employees.\n  The end result of this system has led to a squeeze on America's \nmiddle-class families, and the time has come to put an end to a union \nelection system where employer intimidation tactics prevent middle-\nclass workers from earning decent wages, health care, and fair working \nconditions.\n  It should come as no great surprise that middle-class families are \nfacing increased economic hardships because of the Bush \nadministration's policies.\n\n[[Page S8390]]\n\n  Corporate profits have jumped 83 percent since 2001, with the richest \nAmericans getting richer, while health care, energy, food, and \neducation costs have skyrocketed, creating the largest income gap in 65 \nyears.\n  In 2005, households in the bottom 90 percent experienced a .6-percent \nincome loss, while workers at the top enjoyed a 16-percent increase in \nincome.\n  Real wages for U.S. workers are lower today than in 1973, and in \nCalifornia, the real median hourly wage fell by 2.7 percent between \n2003 and 2005.\n  In addition to seeing their wages squeezed, many middle-class workers \nare unable to provide health care for their families.\n  Over 7 million Californians are uninsured and the numbers of \nuninsured increase every year.\n  In fact, from 1999 to 2005, the number of Californians with employer-\nprovided health care dropped from 60 percent to 55 percent.\n  To put into perspective the pressure being placed on the middle \nclass, I recently found my son Doug's pay stub from when he worked as a \nchecker at a supermarket in 1986.\n  Twenty-one years ago, a checker at his supermarket earned $7.41 per \nhour. According to the United Food and Commercial Workers union, an \nentry-level checker starting today would earn around $8.90 per hour, \nwhich is $4.86 less than my son's 1986 wages adjusted for inflation.\n  This downward pressure on middle-class wages must stop--and increased \nunion participation can help solve this problem.\n  Encouraging more participation in unions is a simple and proven way \nto help middle-class families.\n  Union wages are on average more than 30 percent higher than nonunion \nwages. Union cashiers earn 46 percent more than nonunion cashiers. \nUnion food preparation workers earn 50 percent more than nonunion \nworkers.\n  To help increase participation in unions, the Employee Free Choice \nAct puts to an end the current culture of intimidation and coercion \nthat surrounds some union elections, and instead presents a choice to \nworkers contemplating unionization.\n  Under EFCA, workers can choose to proceed with union elections \nthrough secret ballot or they can choose organization through a simple \ncard check procedure. Under current law, only the employer can choose \nhow its employees choose to elect union representation.\n  Responsible employers, like Kaiser Permanente and Cingular, gave \ntheir employees such a choice, and the results have been great.\n  At a Kaiser Permanente health care facility in Orange County, CA, \nnurses were able to quickly and easily form a union without fear of \nintimidation and illegal firings. The smooth unionization process has \nled to an all-time low nurse vacancy rate and low nurse-to-patient \nratios, which has increased the quality of health care provided to \nKaiser's patients.\n  But workers who have not been given a choice on how to proceed with \nunion elections have faced unfairly harsh consequences.\n  Employer intimidation and coercion are serious problems.\n  In 2005, over 30,000 workers lost wages or were fired because they \nwere involved in union organizing activities.\n  The current union election system is badly broken and breeds fear in \nthe workplace.\n  Workers under open threat of firings and layoffs from their employers \nare not given a real choice in choosing to organize a union.\n  Workers are fired in 25 percent of all private sector union \norganizing campaigns, and 1 in 5 workers involved in union organizing \nefforts is fired.\n  Over 75 percent of private employers require managers to give anti-\nunion messages to employees, and over half of all employers threaten to \nclose or relocate the business if workers elect a union.\n  At a Rite Aid distribution center in Lancaster, CA, workers thought \nforming a union would help them negotiate better working conditions. \nWorkers at this distribution center work with no job security, \nmandatory overtime after 10-hour shifts, and no temperature controls in \nthe warehouse.\n  When the union movement began to gain momentum, one of the lead \nemployees, who had worked there for 6 years with a spotless record, was \nfired for poor performance.\n  Said the worker after his termination, ``People were afraid to sign \nunion cards because they saw what happened to me.''\n  At the Los Angeles Airport Hilton Hotel, two workers leading the \nunion effort were fired on trumped-up charges. One of them, Alicia \nMelgarejo, is a single mother of a 14-year-old daughter, who worked as \na housekeeper at the hotel for 8 years.\n  Despite the fact that she had never been disciplined in 8 years on \nthe job, she was immediately fired after being accused by management of \nstealing towels.\n  She asked management to show her video to back up their claim, but \nthey refused. She believes she was simply fired for her role in union \norganizing efforts and her active support of Los Angeles' living wage \nlaw.\n  Under current law, these gross examples of intimidation can only be \npenalized by what amounts to a slap on the wrist for large companies. \nEmployers can ruin lives, like they did to Alicia and her daughter, yet \nthey often build into their budgets the costs of union-busting \nactivities and the small penalties authorized by the National Labor \nRelations Board.\n  The current union election system creates a battle between employer \nand employee, with no real winner.\n  Our workers have earned the right to work in an environment free from \nfear, and they should be given the right to choose if they want a union \nthrough a process that doesn't provide incentives for employers to \ncoerce and intimidate their employees.\n  EFCA changes the game and provides workers with a fair choice in \nchoosing to organize.\n  It also takes away incentives for employers to break the law and \nillegally fire union organizers by requiring back pay for workers who \nare fired or retaliated against, increasing civil fines to up to \n$20,000 for each illegal act, and authorizing Federal court injunctions \nto immediately return fired workers to their jobs.\n  EFCA provides employees with a choice in choosing a union, gives \nteeth to penalties for violations to prevent employer bullying and \nintimidation, and levels the playing field for workers seeking well-\ndeserved living wages, health care, and fair workplace treatment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support cloture on the motion to proceed to \nthis bill.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, all across the country, Americans are \nanxious about their future. In a global economy with new rules and new \nrisks, they have watched as their Government has shifted those risks \nonto the backs of the American worker, and they wonder how they are \never going to keep up.\n  In coffee shops and town meetings, in VFW halls and all along the \ntowns that once housed the manufacturing facilities that built our \ncountry, the questions are all the same. Will I be able to leave my \nchildren a better world than I was given? Will I be able to save enough \nto send them to college? Will I be able to plan for my retirement? Will \nmy job even be there tomorrow? Who will stand up for me in this new \nworld?\n  The Employee Free Choice Act can alleviate some of these concerns. I \nsupport this bill because in order to restore a sense of shared \nprosperity and security, we need to help working Americans exercise \ntheir right to organize under a fair and free process and bargain for \ntheir fair share of the wealth our country creates.\n  The current process for organizing a workplace denies too many \nworkers the ability to do so. The Employee Free Choice Act offers to \nmake binding an alternative process under which a majority of employees \ncan sign up to join a union. Currently, employers can choose to \naccept--but are not bound by law to accept--the signed decision of a \nmajority of workers. That choice should be left up to workers and \nworkers alone.\n  Moreover, workers who want to form a union today are vulnerable to a \nconcentrated period of union-busting tactics by employers. Far too \noften, workers petition to form a union, the employer is notified, and \nthen the employer uses the time between notification and the vote to \nforce workers into closed-door meetings where they might\n\n[[Page S8391]]\n\nmislead and scare their employees into opposing the organizing drive. \nIn thousands of cases, employers just start firing prounion employees \nto send a message. And they consider any penalties that result from \nthat behavior an acceptable cost of doing business.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act would give workers the right to collect \nsigned cards from a majority of their colleagues to form a union and \nwould require the employer to respect and accept that decision. It \nincreases penalties to discourage employers from punishing workers \ntrying to organize their colleagues, and it encourages both sides to \nnegotiate the first contract in good faith by sending stalemates to \nbinding arbitration.\n  As executive compensation skyrockets and money managers rake in \nmillions in income annually, American workers are wondering if the \nrules aren't tilted against them. They question whether their vote and \ntheir efforts matter. They feel they have an increasingly weaker voice \nin the decisions their employers and their Government make. They find \nthemselves competing against workers abroad who lack fair pay and \nbenefits. And they feel ill-equipped to challenge employers who are \ncutting wages or refusing to raise wages at the same time as they are \nshedding their health care and retirement contributions.\n  What the history of America's middle class teaches us--and what we \nhave to make real today--is the idea that in this country, we must \nvalue the labor of every single American. We must be willing to respect \nthat labor and reward it with a few basic guarantees--wages that can \nraise a family, health care if we get sick, a retirement that is \ndignified, working conditions that are safe.\n  To protect that labor, we need a few basic rights: organization \nwithout intimidation, bargaining in good faith, and a safe workplace. \nThese are commonsense principles, and this bill affirms those \nprinciples. For this reason, I stand in solidarity with working people \naround the country as an original cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice \nAct, and I urge my colleagues to pass it.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the so-called \nEmployee Free Choice Act.\n  Over the past few weeks the Democrats have painted a very partisan \npicture for the American public; coloring their failures by laying \nblame at the feet of the Republicans. In reality, Republicans have come \nto the table in good faith time and again to address the issues facing \nthis Nation and its hard-working citizens.\n  Now, this week, despite their promises to deliver energy solutions, \nthe Democrats have chosen to set aside the only energy bill they have \nbrought before the Senate. Sadly, we only had mere days to debate \nproposals that could have put this country on the path to lower gas \nprices and energy independence.\n  What is more important than securing America's future?\n  It is with complete disregard for the rights of American workers that \nthe Democrats have brought to the floor--at the cost of vital \nlegislation--the deceptively titled ``Employee Free Choice Act.'' This \nact would revoke the right of workers to cast secret ballots in \nelections when voting on whether to form a union. Workers could now be \nunionized by the practice known as ``card check,'' which would make \nemployees cast their vote publicly by signing cards that would be \nallowed to count as votes in place of a secretly cast ballot. This \npractice would allow for unionization as soon as a majority of \nemployees give consent, thus eliminating the voice and vote of a \nsignificant percentage of employees.\n  This country is founded on the fundamental principles of freedom and \nchoice. Let's be clear, this is not a debate about the merits of \nunionization, rather this is a debate about ensuring that Americans \nmaintain their right to make their choice in private, from the voting \nbooth to the workplace. The United States has a rich tradition of \nAmericans choosing their elected representatives by secret ballot in \nfree and fair elections. Every Member of Congress was elected through a \nsecret ballot process, something I have worked throughout my career to \nprotect. Ensuring that employees maintain the right to secret-ballot \nelections protects those who would choose to not unionize from undue \npeer pressure, public scrutiny, coercion, and possible retaliation. We \ncannot allow political payback to undermine 60 years worth of democracy \nin the workplace.\n  This is not what the American worker wants. Although I do not believe \nin governing by polls, it is an important tool to gauge support on an \nissue such as this. According to a Zogby poll, 78 percent of union \nworkers favor keeping the current secret ballot process in place. It is \nalso important to note that preserving the rights of workers does not \nmean the end of unionization. As a matter of fact, a study conducted by \nthe National Labor Relations Board confirmed that unions win 60 percent \nof all elections conducted by a secret ballot. Knowing that would \nprompt any reasonable person to ask why the Democrats are so eager to \nsecure the favor of big labor, especially when it is at the cost of the \nworkers they claim to protect.\n  This bill would reverse 60 years of Federal labor law that has \nguaranteed workers the right to cast a private ballot. In 1947, \nCongress made a decision to amend the National Labor Relations Act and \nexpressly mandated that workers be given the right to a secret ballot. \nBoth the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees unions, and the \nSupreme Court have upheld the law and the rights of workers by \nrecognizing that secret-ballot elections are the most satisfactory way \nto establish a union. Public support for the secret ballot for union \nrepresentation is strong and an overwhelming number of union employees \nagree that a worker's vote to organize should remain private.\n  Currently, during union elections, all votes are cast secretly, and \nevery vote is counted. This is important to protect employees from \ncoercion and retaliation, not only from the employer but also from \nunion officials. You see, what people fail to realize is that union \nofficials have been as guilty of applying pressure, as they can \nalienate individuals, kill careers, or even threaten with physical \nforce. Employees have had representatives from big labor visiting their \nplaces of employment, writing down license plate numbers, and visiting \ntheir homes later that night. Casting votes in secret provides all \nemployees protection from these and other pressures.\n  Allowing the Employee Free Choice Act to pass into law would result \nin a dictatorial rule over laborers and their civil rights. I encourage \nthis body to stand up and ensure that the Democrats are not allowed to \nmake political fodder of the civil rights of hard working Americans. We \ncannot restrict the rights of workers by denying them their fundamental \nright to cast a private ballot in union organizing elections. Let's \ncall this for what it is--a political payback--and vote against the \n``Employee No Choice Act.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe I have 6 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, again I wish to thank my friend from \nColorado for putting into 3 short minutes the compelling case for the \nsupport for cloture we will be voting on in just a very short period of \ntime and thank him not only for his eloquence and his passion but also \nthe strong ongoing effort he has made to try to make sure this \nlegislation is worthy of the goals he has outlined. He has made an \nextraordinary contribution, and history will show it.\n  If the Chair will let me know when I have 1 minute left.\n  Mr. President, on the employee checkoff legislation, first of all, we \nwant to point out that free elections are in the Employee Free Choice \nAct. They are in the legislation. We have heard a lot of issues and \nquestions about whether they are in or they are not in. They are in the \nlegislation. But let me really point out, in the few minutes that \nremain, why this legislation is necessary.\n  It is necessary because of the impact of what is happening today to \nso many workers who are trying to be able to pursue their economic \ninterests.\n  This is Verna Bader, a machine operator in Taylor, MN. Verna wanted \nto form a union to help address health and safety problems at work. \nThis is often the case. It isn't just their own economic interest; it \nis the health and safety problems they see on the job.\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\nShe and other union supporters were harassed by the foreman, who \nthreatened: ``If you do get a union in here, you're gonna find out that \nyou aren't gonna have a job.'' We have heard of intimidation, and this \nis the type of intimidation which so many workers, when they try to \nform a union, are faced with.\n  After employees voted to form a union, the harassment became \nunbearable for Verna. ``There's days that I literally went out of there \ncrying. This is the kind of conditions that the employer set.''\n  Taylor Machine illegally shut down the department where union \nsupporters worked. Eventually, the NLRB ordered the company to give \nthem back their jobs. The company refused and appealed the ruling, \ndelaying justice for the workers. Verna and her coworkers didn't get \nthe backpay the company owed them until 8 years later.\n  This is Bonny Wallace, a nurse from Roseburg, OR. Bonny and her \ncoworkers decided to form a union after the hospital began increasing \nnurses' patient loads, forcing them to work mandatory overtime. Many \ntimes, these workers would come down exhausted at the end of their 8-\nhour shift and be told: No, you are going to have to continue to work. \nMany of them had children at home or children they were picking up at \nschool, and they were told they had to go out. The workers tried to \nfind out if they couldn't get at least some kind of recognition of \ntheir needs. ``We needed some help and some representation. We needed \nsomeone to listen to us, when management would not. That's why we \ncalled the union.''\n  The hospital started a campaign of fear and intimidation. Despite a \nshortage of workers, the hospital forced them to attend antiunion \nmeetings during their shifts. The meetings were demeaning and \ndehumanizing. ``We felt insulted by the half-truths they put forward.''\n  The nurses won the election, but 1 year after the union was \ncertified, they still had no contract. Management has come to \nbargaining meetings unprepared to negotiate, stalling the negotiations \nand slow-walking the outcome.\n  So you have the situation where an individual is fired and another \nsituation where they have just refused to negotiate.\n  Now, what happens every year? These are the figures from 2005: 30,000 \nworkers--30,000 workers--have had to get backpay from the National \nLabor Relations Board because of examples I have just given here this \nafternoon. And these are not the exception. This is what is happening \nall over America. It didn't used to be that way. It didn't used to be \nthat way.\n  Years ago, when they did have the card and the checkoff, the numbers \nthat were actually being talked about at that time were about 3,000 \nindividuals. Now, as has been pointed out during the course of the \ndebate, the powers that are out there to defeat these workers, \nhumiliate these workers, intimidate these workers are very effective, \nand we have 30,000 who get backpay.\n  Employees are fired in one-quarter of all the private sector union-\norganizing campaigns. One in five workers who openly advocate for a \nunion during an election campaign is fired. That is the technique used \nin order to destroy. That is what we are trying to deal with in this \nlegislation. That is what this legislation is all about. Let us allow \nthe workers to have the choice and the employee recognition that they \ncan vote for or vote against having a union but not have intimidation.\n  Finally, what are the penalties? I mentioned 30,000 different \ninstances where they had to get backpay. The average backpay in 2005 \nwas $2,660. Imagine that worker out of work for 8 years and finally \ngets the backpay, and the backpay is $2,660. If you had the violation \non this Smokey Bear image, it would be $10,000.\n  This is not only an economic issue, it is a moral issue, and we have \nthis open letter from 124 religious leaders that states: We as leaders \nof the faith communities, representing the entire spectrum of U.S. \nreligious life, call upon the U.S. Senate to pass the Employee Free \nChoice Act so that workers will be able to represent themselves.\n  It is a civil rights issue. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights \nand the Governors understand this. There is a letter from some 16 \nGovernors, who think this makes sense.\n  There is also this extraordinary letter from a former Secretary of \nLabor, Ray Marshall, and he quotes the Dunlop Commission. John Dunlop, \na Republican, was probably one of the greatest Secretaries of Labor in \nthe history of this country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the past several days I have \naddressed the Senate several times about the dramatic changes in our \neconomy, and the overwhelming challenges facing American workers. I am \ndeeply concerned about the growing divide between the haves and have-\nnots in our country. Working families are not receiving their fair \nshare of our economic gains, and it is threatening the vitality of the \nAmerican middle class and the American dream.\n  It is time to have a real conversation about economic security. We \nneed to be talking about how we can return to the days where the rising \ntide really did lift all boats, and working Americans shared in the \nNation's prosperity.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't \nseem interested in having that conversation. Instead, they have chosen \nto spread misconceptions and half-truths about the Employee Free Choice \nAct.\n  Before we can continue talking about the economic challenges facing \nAmerica's workers, we need to set the record straight. I would like to \nclear up the misconceptions and half-truths about this legislation so \nwe can return to focusing on the issues that matter to working \nfamilies.\n  First, several of my Republican colleagues have come to the Senate \nfloor to argue that the current system for choosing a union works just \nfine. They argue that there is no real problem here because 60 percent \nof NLRB elections are won by unions.\n  Actually, I still find that number disappointing, because in a \nsubstantial percentage of the elections that unions lose, the \norganizing efforts had majority support before the election process \nbegan. And nearly half the election petitions filed by unions are \nwithdrawn even before the election occurs because union support has \nbeen so eroded that there is no point in going forward. Something \nhappened during the election process to scare and intimidate workers.\n  But more importantly, the number of NLRB elections that unions win \ndoes not tell the whole story. What tells the story is how many \nemployees want a union and don't have one. What tells the story is how \nmany workers never get to that stage of the process.\n  According to a December 2006 poll by Peter Hart Research Associates, \n58 percent of America's nonmanagerial workers--nearly 60 million--say \nthey would join a union right now if they could. But only 7 percent of \nemployees in the private sector have a union in their workplace. This \nshows that NLRB elections are not working to get workers the unions \nthey want.\n  Some critics have also taken issue with some of the supporting \nstatistics that I and my Democratic colleagues have used to demonstrate \nthe widespread problem of anti-union behavior and abuses of the law by \nemployers. Specifically, they have attacked a study performed \nby Professor Kate Bronfenbrenner of Cornell University concluding that \nemployees are fired in one-quarter of all private-sector union \norganizing campaigns. These attacks are unfounded.\n\n  Professor Bronfenbrenner's study is one of many research projects \nthat confirm what many of us have long known--that abuses of employees \nwho try to form a union are rampant and our current system has proved \ninadequate to protect workers' rights.\n  Kate Bronfenbrenner's research has been relied upon for 20 years by \nCongress and the U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission, USTDR, among \nothers, to gauge the extent of employer behavior that affects the \nexercise of rights by workers. Her research has been published in a \nnumber of peer-reviewed books and journals where it was found to have \nupheld the stringent standards for methodological review for those \npublications.\n  It's abundantly clear that there is a serious problem, but \nRepublicans argue that the Employee Free Choice Act is not the \nsolution. They have pointed to a 2004 Zogby survey of union workers and \na 2007 poll of workers by McLaughlin and Associates to argue\n\n[[Page S8393]]\n\nthat workers--even union workers--don't want this.\n  Both the McLaughlin poll and the Zogby poll are unpersuasive. Both of \nthese surveys presented people with a false choice--between majority \nsign-up and a fair and democratic election. Neither asked workers to \nchoose between majority sign-up and the NLRB election process.\n  I think if the choice was presented accurately those results would \nhave been much different, because a fair and democratic choice is just \nnot what the NLRB election process provides. NLRB elections are so \nskewed in favor of the employer there's nothing fair or democratic \nabout them.\n  The Hart research survey I have cited is far more accurate--I'll use \nthe exact wording so there's no chance of misunderstanding:\n\n       Under majority signup, once a majority of employees at a \n     company join the union by signing authorization cards, the \n     company must recognize and bargain with the union, with no \n     election held. Do you favor or oppose this proposal?\n\n  When asked this question--with no slant or bias in it--70 percent of \nunion members and 50 percent of workers overall supported majority \nsign-up, compared to only 20 percent of union members and 36 percent of \nworkers overall who opposed it.\n  Beyond public perceptions, when it comes to the substance of the \nbill, each of the three major provisions of the act--the majority sign-\nup, the first contract timeline, and the enhanced penalties--has been \nthe subject of misleading and inaccurate attacks. I will address each \nof these sections of the bill in turn.\n  On majority sign-up, the most common criticism I have heard is that \nthe Employee Free Choice Act is undemocratic or that it eliminates the \nsecret ballot election. Neither of these assertions is true--the bill \ndoes not abolish the NLRB election process, and if the goal of a \ndemocratic system is to have an outcome that reflects the will of the \npeople, the Employee Free Choice Act establishes a far more democratic \nalternative to the current system.\n  Initially, the bill does not abolish the secret ballot election \nprocess. That process would still be available. It just gives workers--\nnot employers--the choice whether to use the NLRB election process or \nmajority signup.\n  My friend and colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, has cited a \nletter from the Congressional Research Service, arguing that this \nletter proves that the bill eliminates secret ballot elections. With \nrespect, I think that's a misreading of CRS's conclusions. What CRS \nsaid was that the bill would not permit an election when the majority \nof the employees has already signed valid authorizations designating a \nunion as their collective bargaining representative. And that is \ncorrect--if the majority has already spoken and chosen a representative \nby signing authorization cards, the employees have already decided how \nthey want to choose a union. It's that majority choice--the decision to \nchoose a union through majority signup--that we want to protect. If the \nworkers were to choose to use the election process instead--if they \nwere to sign cards asking for an election rather than designating a \nbargaining representative--they would get an election. The Employee \nFree Choice Act lets the workers use the system they want. This makes \nperfect sense--after all, it is the workers' representative, why should \nthe employer get to control how the workers get to choose?\n  In their discussions of the majority signup process, my Republican \ncolleagues seem to suggest that the NLRB election process is a model of \ndemocratic fairness. But nothing could be further from the truth. NLRB \nelections are nothing like the public elections we use to elect our \nCongressional representatives. One side has all the power. Employers \ncontrol the voters' paychecks and livelihood, have unlimited access to \nvoters, and can intimidate and coerce them with impunity. By the time \nemployees get to vote in an NLRB election, the environment is often so \npoisoned that free choice is no longer possible. That is not a free \nelection or a fair election. Workers should have the option to choose a \nbetter process.\n  Another common criticism raised about majority signup is that \nemployees may be coerced by their colleagues, or by union \nrepresentatives, into supporting the union. This is really not a cause \nfor significant concern. It is already clearly against the law for \nunions to coerce or intimidate employees into signing union \nauthorization cards. Those cards are invalid and cannot be counted \ntowards majority signup, and nothing in the Employee Free Choice Act \nchanges that.\n  Along these same lines, several of my colleagues have cited a Supreme \nCourt case--NLRB v. Gissel Packing Company--for the proposition that \nauthorization cards are an ``inherently unreliable'' indicator of true \nemployee support for a union. I am distressed that my colleagues would \ntake this quotation so drastically out of context.\n  Those words--``inherently unreliable''--were used by the Court to \narticulate the employer's contention, which the Court rejected. In fact \nthe Court in Gissel held the exact opposite! They found that \nauthorization cards can adequately reflect employee desires for \nrepresentation and the NLRB's rules governing the card collection \nprocess are adequate to guard against any coercion that might occur.\n  I don't understand my colleague's suggestion that authorization cards \naren't a valid indicator of a worker's wishes. We have always used \nthese cards to determine whether workers want an election or not, and \nthere's never been any suggestion that coercion or misrepresentation \nmakes the process unfair.\n  Majority signup is a better system. It respects the free choice of \nworkers by giving them the freedom to choose a union in a simple, \npeaceful way. Experience has shown that when majority signup replaces \nthe battlefield mentality of the NLRB election process, conflict is \nminimized and the workplace becomes more cooperative and productive--a \nwin for both sides.\n  Briefly, there are three more concerns that have been raised about \nmajority signup that I would like to dispel. Each of these concerns \nreflects a misunderstanding of how the bill would affect current law.\n  First, my Republican colleagues claim that the Employee Free Choice \nAct would require ``public'' card signings, which is simply untrue. \nUnder the act, signing a card will be no more or less confidential than \nit is now. Under current law, workers can request an election if 30 \npercent of them sign cards saying they are interested in an election. \nThe NLRB keeps the cards--and the card signer's identity--confidential \nand will not reveal that information to the employer. The Employee Free \nChoice Act does that change these NLRB confidentiality requirements \nthat protect workers from being targeted by their employers for later \nretaliation.\n  Second, some of my colleagues have suggested that the Employee Free \nChoice Act will ``silence'' employers and restrict their ability to \nexpress their views about the union. But nothing in the Employee Free \nChoice Act changes the free speech rights of an employer. Employers are \nstill free to express their views about the union as long as they do \nnot threaten or intimidate workers. The act also does not change the \ntypes of anti-union activity that are prohibited by law. What the act \ndoes do is strengthen the penalties for anti-union activity that are \nprohibited by law. It also allows workers to find an alternative to the \ncontentious NLRB election process, when many of these violations of the \nlaw can occur.\n  My friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, claims that by \ngiving workers an alternative to the NLRB election process, the \nemployer is ``effectively silenced'' because it is possible that the \nemployer will not know about the majority signup campaign until the \ncards are presented to the employer. While that is theoretically \npossible, it is highly unlikely. Most employers know when employees are \nthinking about forming a union. Even in the rare instance where an \nemployer was truly taken by surprise, the employer has no ``right'' to \nan additional period of time to engage in anti-union tactics. Majority \nsignup is about workers choosing their own representative. Why should \nthe employer have a guaranteed say in the workers' decision about their \nown representative? That would be like saying that one party in a court \ncase can't hire a lawyer until the other party has a guaranteed period \nof time to argue that his opponent\n\n[[Page S8394]]\n\nshouldn't be allowed to have a lawyer. It is nonsensical.\n  Third, critics have argued that the Employee Free Choice Act \ninappropriately lets employees choose the appropriate unit for \nbargaining, instead of the National Labor Relations Board. Again, this \nreflects a misunderstanding of current law, and of the scope of the \nEmployee Free Choice Act.\n\n  Under current law, when employees petition for an election they have \na right to choose the unit for bargaining. Employees need only choose \nan appropriate unit, not the most appropriate unit. Employers then have \nthe right to ask the National Labor Relations Board to determine \nwhether the unit chosen by the employees is inappropriate or unlawful. \nThe Employee Free Choice Act does not alter the law in this respect. \nEmployees will still have the right to choose their bargaining unit. \nEFCA maintains this important right for employees, while continuing to \nprotect employers from being forced to recognize an inappropriate or \nunlawful unit.\n  Unfortunately, opponents of this bill have not confined their \nmisguided attacks to the majority signup provisions. They have also \nraised several unjustified criticisms of the provisions in the bill \nproviding a timetable to get workers a first contract.\n  Primarily, my Republican colleagues have argued that these provisions \nwould allow the government to impose a contract on the parties, \nthreatening business's bottom line. These sensationalistic references \nto ``government-imposed contracts'' are way off-base. It is a scare \ntactic that has no relationship to what this bill actually does.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act does not compel arbitration whenever the \nparties have difficulty reaching a contract, as my colleagues suggest. \nIt provides a procedure where unions or employers can seek assistance \nfrom the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service if they are \nencountering difficulties in their negotiations. The first step of this \nprocess is mediation. Collective bargaining mediation provides a \nneutral, third-party mediator to assist the two sides in reaching \ncontract agreement on their own. The FMCS has provided collective \nbargaining mediation services--including mediation of first contract \nnegotiations--for more than 50 years, and they have an 86 percent \nsuccess rate in helping the parties agree to a contract. That is a \npretty impressive record.\n  Only in the rare instance where mediation fails does the act provide \nfor arbitration. Binding arbitration is a last resort, and will rarely \nbe used. It primarily serves as an incentive to bring the parties to \nthe table. Neither the union nor the employer wants any uncertainty in \nthe process, and therefore the parties have a strong reason to sit down \nat the table and work things out on their own rather than letting an \narbitrator rule. The bill's negotiating framework is similar to what is \nused in most Canadian provinces. Canada's experience shows that \narbitration is rarely used, and is an incentive--rather than a \nroadblock--to parties reaching their own agreement.\n  Finally, even in the rare case where parties do resort to \narbitration, it will be limited to the issues that the parties are \nunable to agree on. These arbitrations will be handled by highly \nqualified FMCS arbitrators with long experience in crafting fair \ncontract provisions. They will not impose unfair or extreme terms. I \nalso don't know where my colleagues get the impression that an \narbitration through the FMCS would produce a contract biased in favor \nof the union. It is not in anyone's interest to put a company out of \nbusiness--workers would lose their jobs and unions would lose their \nmembers. Typically, arbitration produces middle-ground solutions that \neveryone can live with, and often parties settle their disputes during \narbitration, alleviating the need for the arbitrator to render a \ndecision at all.\n  The second criticism that has been leveled against the first contract \ntimeline is that in the rare instance where a contract is actually \nimposed through the arbitration process, workers will lose their \n``right'' to vote to ratify the contract. This reflects a complete \nmisunderstanding of current law. Under current law, employees do not \nhave a ``right'' to ratify a collective-bargaining agreement. A \nratification vote is a courtesy that unions routinely give the workers \nthey represent as a matter of policy. It is not a legal requirement.\n  Under the bill, if unions want to provide their members with input \nduring the first contract negotiation process, they could submit the \nunion's arbitration proposal to the membership for a ratification vote. \nThis would ensure that the position the union takes in arbitration is \nconsistent with the views of the membership.\n  Perhaps most importantly, in the rare case where a union gets a \ncontract through arbitration, this contract will only be for a 2-year \nterm--a relatively short timeframe for a labor contract. And, during \nthe short duration of the first contract, the membership will no doubt \nstill be far better off than if they had no contract at all.\n  Finally, opponents of the bill have argued that arbitration of first \ncontracts is incompatible with the collective bargaining process. In \nsupport of this assertion, they cite a text on arbitration written by \nElkouri and Elkouri, quoting it to say that using arbitration to reach \na first contract is the ``antithesis of free collective bargaining.''\n  My Republican colleagues are taking this quotation out of context. \nRead in full, the text says: ``The arguments against compulsory \narbitration as revealed in literature on the subject, are, broadly \nstated, that it is incompatible with free collective bargaining . . .'' \nElkouri and Elkouri are merely reporting arguments made by others, not \nendorsing this position.\n  Indeed, later in the book, the authors acknowledge that, in some \ninstances in which ``the parties find it difficult or impossible to \nreach agreement by direct negotiation,'' and ``the use of economic \nweapons [may] be costly and injurious to both parties'' or to the \npublic, ``interest arbitration by impartial, competent neutrals, \nwhether voluntary or statutorily prescribed, offers a way out of the \ndilemma.''\n  Using interest arbitration to resolve difficult situations is hardly \nunheard of. In fact, it has become quite common in public sector \nemployment, public utilities, and railroads. It is also used in most \nCanadian provinces, where it has been perfectly consistent with a \nrobust system of collective bargaining.\n  The system established by the Employee Free Choice Act gives a \nresponsible employer every opportunity to pursue a contract fairly. \nThere's bargaining, then there's mediation--arbitration is only a last \nresort. And the parties can always agree to keep talking or to extend \nany of the deadlines in the timetable. The process can last as long as \nit takes to reach a deal, so long as the parties are acting reasonably \nand can agree to keep talking.\n  Finally, I would like to take just a brief moment to respond to an \nargument raised by my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, regarding \npenalties. He argued that the Employee Free Choice Act is unfair \nbecause it requires employers--but not unions--to pay triple backpay \nwhen they violate workers rights. While it is true that the bill does \nnot provide for the same treble backpay penalty against unions, this is \nhardly problematic. Backpay is a remedy for wages to which an employee \nwould otherwise have been entitled. Unions do not have the power to \nfire, demote, layoff, or take away workers' raises or overtime pay. \nThose are abuses only an employer can impose. Because unions cannot \nretaliate against workers in this manner, there is no reason to impose \ntreble backpay on them.\n  In 2005 alone, over 30,000 workers received backpay from employers \nwho violated their rights. In contrast, unions paid backpay to only 132 \nemployees. This small set of backpay awards against unions primarily \ninvolves mishandled employee benefits--not the types of appalling \nabuses the Employee Free Choice Act is intended to address. When it \ncomes to causing workers to lose their pay and benefits, it is \nemployers--not unions--that are the problem, and the Employee Free \nChoice Act provides a solution, putting real teeth in the law, so that \nunscrupulous employers can no longer dismiss the penalties for \nviolating workers rights as a minor cost of doing business.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act does one thing--it empowers workers. It \ngives them the freedom to choose--\n\n[[Page S8395]]\n\nwithout fear of intimidation or harassment--whether they want union \nrepresentation. There's nothing more democratic than that.\n  I hope that my comments today have set the record straight. I hope \nthat we can now move on to discussing the critical role this \nlegislation can play in helping working families to overcome the \nchallenges of new economy return to a time of shared prosperity. I urge \nall of my colleagues to vote to proceed to this bill so we can have \nthat important debate.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we have before us a bill that will \nstrengthen the historic right of workers to join together for higher \nwages, safer working conditions, and better benefits. The Employee Free \nChoice Act, which I have cosponsored for the last three Congresses, \nwill allow workers to bolster their rights in the employment \nnegotiation process. It will offer real deterrents for that small \nminority of employers who exercise undue influence over fairly and \nlegally held elections for union representation, and as a result it \nwill ensure workers more control of their working conditions.\n  Passage of this bill will have an enormous effect in my State of West \nVirginia. It will protect the rights of working men and women in my \nState, allowing them to bargain for increased wages, employer-provided \nhealth care and pension benefits, as well as better working conditions.\n  In fact, the pendulum has swung for too long solidly in favor of \nemployers. This bill will bring us closer to equilibrium, giving \nemployees more of a level playing field. The Employee Free Choice Act \nwill enable a majority of employees to clearly and unambiguously make \ntheir decision known to organize.\n  If a majority of workers want a union, then they should be able to \nband together and speak as one. It is simple and fair, and this right \nshould be free from intimidation. Today, even within legal strictures \nin place, the current election system allows that small--group of \nemployers to intimidate workers in the midst of a union election, which \nis simply unacceptable. For example, under the current regime, \nemployers may discourage organizing activities while workers who \nsupport unions may not use the workplace as a vehicle to show their \nsupport.\n  The current system leaves employees who want to organize in a \nvulnerable position. They may be threatened with the loss of their job \nor the closure of their plant. Among workers who openly advocate for a \nunion during an election campaign, one in five is fired. In my own \nState, Ms. Mylinda Casey Hayes was unlawfully discharged from her job \nas a production line worker after she stopped wearing an antiunion \nbutton and began supporting employee efforts to organize.\n  I could give you many other examples of hard-working West Virginians \nfighting for their rights as employees who face similar tactics. \nFrankly, the penalties for employers who use these tactics are small--a \nmere slap on the wrist that does nothing to deter them from improperly \nand illegally influencing the election. It is high time that we put an \nend to this practice by showing that there are consequences for \nignoring workers' rights. We must strengthen the penalties for \ncompanies that coerce or intimidate employees. The increased penalties \nin the Employee Free Choice Act will restore a more level playing field \nfor employers and employees.\n  Now, we have the opportunity to extend democratic principles to all \nworkers across the country. The Employee Free Choice Act will give \nworkers the freedom to make their own choices free from intimidation \nand harassment. This freedom affects the wages, health care, pensions, \nand other benefits of our Nation's families. When America's hard \nworking men and women are given the opportunity to improve their \neconomic situations, we are all improved. This bill will improve wages, \nhealth care, pensions, and working conditions--in turn bolstering our \neconomy. I strongly support this legislation, and I hope my colleagues \nwill join me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is up.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will include those references in the Record, and I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  We are actually debating two things here this morning because we are \ngoing to have two cloture votes right in a row. And there are some \nsimilarities between the two bills. The similarities are that neither \nhas been through the committee process. Neither bill has been to \ncommittee. And I will tell you, when you don't send bills to committee \naround here, at least in my 11 years here, I don't think I have seen \none bill pass that didn't go to committee. Why? Because people don't \nfeel as if they had any input into it.\n  Just imagine. A coalition gets together and puts bills together and \nleaves everybody out and then tries to limit the amount of amendments \nthat can be offered on them. The way the coalition works is that one \nperson has this piece of a bill which they are really enamored with but \nhardly anybody likes it. Another person has this piece of a bill which \nhe is really enamored with but hardly anybody likes it. And you get \nenough of those people together, throwing their bad parts of the bill \nin and agreeing to support it to the bitter end in order to pass the \nbill, but it is a conglomeration, sometimes, of bad things. So it \nshouldn't be a surprise when cloture isn't invoked on these bills that \ndon't go through the committee process. The only chance for the person \nwho is not in the coalition to have any kind of a voice is at the time \nof cloture.\n  Both of these bills, both the immigration bill and the card check \nbill, have not been through committee. The main bill I am talking about \nis the Employee Free Choice Act--I have to give them a lot of credit \nfor picking a good name. Ironically, however, it is not about free \nchoice; it is about taking away free choice. It should be called the \n``Employee Intimidation Act'' or the ``Take Away the Secret Ballot \nAct.'' It should not be called the Employee Free Choice Act, and I urge \nmy colleagues to vote no on cloture on the motion to proceed.\n  For generations, this body has faithfully protected and continually \nexpanded the rights of working men and women. This legislation does \nexactly the opposite and would strip away from working men and women \ntheir fundamental democratic right. Should cloture be invoked, we will \nget to talk about this for 30 hours, and I am going to go through each \nand every one of the charts the other side has used to show that \nstatistics aren't always the truth. But everybody knew that already.\n  We see some charts that show how much people made during one 25-year \nperiod and which group, which 20 percent, made the most. Then we switch \nto another chart, and we show how that changed in the next 25 years. \nBut the third chart is the fascinating one. If you count the spaces on \nthat chart, we have gone from five slots of 20 percent to six slots \nbecause the emphasis is on what the top 1 percent in the country made. \nIf you are going to have honest charts, you have to show what the top 1 \npercent made on the first two charts as well. Statistics--yes, you can \nget them to say what you want.\n  Another chart claimed that 30,000 people got backpay because they \nwere fired for organizing. That isn't 30,000 people who got backpay \nbecause of organizing efforts; that is 30,000 people whom the National \nLabor Relations Board--through all of their proceedings has awarded \nbackpay. They do a whole lot of cases that don't have anything to do \nwith union organizing, such as contract interpretation, and those can \nresult in settlements that award backpay. For example, in 200, two \nthirds of the recipients of ``backpay'' were involved in a single case \ninvolving contract interpretation, it had nothing to do with \norganizing.\n  But I don't want to go into all that now. I will have plenty of time \nif we do invoke cloture. I suspect there are plenty of people around \nhere who can see the flaw in something called the Free Choice Act which \ntakes away the right of people to vote, so I won't dwell on that.\n  For generations, we have guaranteed all workers in our country the \nright to choose whether they do or do not wish to be represented by a \nunion. We have secured that right through the most basic means of a \nfree people--the use of the secret ballot election. Now, however, \nproponents of this legislation would cast that right aside. One can \nalmost feel the discomfort from our colleagues across the aisle as they \ngrasp\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\nat straws to ultimately prevent a futile effort to justify the shameful \nassault on workers' rights.\n  We have had related to us that it would solve fair trade, it would \nsolve executive pay, and untold issues in the world would just be \nsolved if we just took away the right to vote from people who are being \norganized.\n  We have been told the system is broken and the bill is needed to fix \nit. Simply untrue. Unions that participate in the democratic election \nprocess have never in history enjoyed as much success as in the last \ndecade, a record of 10 straight years of an increasing winning rate, \nthe last 2 years at record rates of 62 percent. I guess they are upset \nthat in 38 percent of the votes, they lost.\n  Employer unfair labor practice allegations are down dramatically, \nmore than 40 percent over prior decades. Most importantly, the National \nLabor Relations Board has only found it necessary to invalidate less \nthan 1 percent of the elections it held last year. In fact, we took a \nlook at 2,300 elections, and there were only 19 that were rerun, and \nthose were because of union violations as well as employer violations.\n  We are told, secondly, that something must be wrong with the system \nbecause there are fewer unionized employees in the workforce. That is \ntrue, but I would suggest unions need to look elsewhere to explain this \nphenomenon. Many observers believe the problem for unions is that \ntoday's employees see them as out of step, too political. They talk \nabout not having enough money to take on management. If they took some \nof the money they put into political campaigns and went after \nmanagement, they would probably win more of the elections. Their \nmembers see them as being too political and too concerned with their \nown agenda rather than the workers. I don't know if that is true, but I \ndo know that when unions push an undemocratic bill such as this, which \ntakes rights away from workers, it does little to dispel that view.\n  I also note that the level of union membership has absolutely nothing \nto do with the law this bill seeks to radically alter. The law \ngoverning unionization and the law providing for a secret ballot has \nnot changed for over 60 years. It is the same today as generations ago \nwhen union membership was at 35 percent. The law is plainly not the \nproblem.\n  Third, we have been told increased unionization is necessary to boost \nworker pay and benefits. Increased benefits and pay cost money, and \nunions do not contribute a penny to such costs. Thus, the notion that \nthese two are causally linked is simply smoke and mirrors.\n  But even if that were the case, the promise of higher wages and \nbenefits is exactly the kind of appeal a union is free to make to \nemployees in a free election process with a secret ballot. It is not an \nexcuse to strip them of the right to vote. This bill is nothing more \nthan a transparent payoff to union bosses to help them artificially and \nunfairly boost their membership numbers, to increase their bank \naccounts through more union dues, and increase the political leverage \nthat such money buys. Pandering to special interests is a bad enough \nproblem, but when the cost of such pandering is the most basic of \nAmerican rights for American workers, it is disgraceful.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this effort and to vote no on cloture.\n  I ask how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time now belongs to the Republican leader, \nthe next 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first let me thank my friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Hatch and Senator Enzi, for their hard work on the \ncard check issue. They have been passionate and persuasive in defending \nworker rights. The Republican conference and the American worker are \ngrateful.\n  We heard a lot yesterday from supporters of the so-called Employee \nFree Choice Act about the potential effect this bill would have in \nexpanding unions. But we heard next to nothing from them about how it \nwould bring that about. The way we do things in this country is just as \nimportant as what we do. This is what has always set us apart as a \nnation. So it is important we be clear about what this bill would do \nand how and why it must be defeated.\n  First, what would it do? Sixty years ago, Congress gave Americans the \nsame voting rights at work they had always enjoyed outside of work. \nWorker intimidation was common during union organizing drives in those \ndays, so Congress amended the National Labor Relations Act to include a \nright for workers to vote for or against a union without somebody \nlooking over their shoulder.\n  As a result, a lot of workers stopped joining unions. Since the \n1950s, the number of unionized workers in our country has fallen \nsharply. For one reason or another, voters opted out. This is their \nchoice. Today, less than 8 percent of private sector jobs in our \ncountry are unionized. The so-called Employee Free Choice Act would \nreverse that law. It would strip workers of a 60-year-old right that \nwas created to protect them from coercion, rolling back the basic \nworker protection that no one has questioned until now. This is what \nthe bill would do.\n  Who is behind it? It should be obvious. The unions are desperate. \nThey are losing the game, and now they want to change the rules. But in \nthis case the rule they want to change happens to be one that is so \ndeeply engrained in our democratic traditions that few people would \nbelieve it is even being debated today on the Senate floor. Surveys \nshow that 9 out of 10 Americans oppose rolling back the right to a \nprivate ballot at the workplace, including an astonishing 91 percent of \nDemocrats. Indeed, many of our colleagues on the other side have \ndefended the secret ballot with passion and eloquence in the past. This \nis why we hear about the effects but not the cause.\n  The Democrats are rolling over in support of this antidemocratic \nbill. All but two Democrats in the House voted against their version of \nit in March. I expect even fewer Senate Democrats will defect from the \nparty line today. They know the bill will fail. Senate and House \nRepublicans have vowed to block it. The President has vowed to veto it. \nYet Senate Democrats are forcing us to vote on it anyway. Why? As the \nsenior Senator from Delaware told a reporter yesterday:\n\n       I'll be completely candid . . . I would not miss that vote \n     because of the importance to labor.\n\n  Republicans appreciate the candor, and we will be candid too. This \nantidemocratic bill will be defeated today, but it will not be \nforgotten. Republicans will remind our constituents about the fact that \nDemocrats proposed to strip workers of their voting rights. No one can \nput voting rights on the table and expect to get away with it.\n  For Democrats, the end in this case clearly justifies the means. But \nthe American people disagree with the means and the end. Voting in this \ncountry is sacred, and it is secret.\n  Republicans will stand together in defense of that basic right today \nby proudly defeating this dangerous and antidemocratic bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said:\n\n       It is one of the characteristics of a free and democratic \n     nation that it have free and independent labor unions.\n\n  Roosevelt's New Deal lifted America through the Great Depression by \nshowing us the rights of working people can go hand in with economic \ngrowth. His call for equality and basic fairness, which guaranteed our \ncountry a permanent workforce of skilled, trained, and professional \nemployees, is something that is one of his legacies. But now, 70 years \nlater, for many Americans the New Deal has become a raw deal.\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\n  Today in America, hourly wages are down, way down, while the number \nof uninsured is up, way up. Today in America, household income is down, \nway down, while the average chief executive officer's pay is a \nstaggering, record-shattering, 411 times higher than the pay of the \naverage working person, and going up every day. This has happened in \npart because, to use a term from Las Vegas, ``the boss holds all the \nchips.''\n  I rise to support that we proceed to the Employee Free Choice Act, a \nbill that will level the playing field for the American worker. It is \nunquestioned that when employees join labor unions, their standard of \nliving improves and they become more productive employees. It is a win-\nwin for employers and employees alike. Yet too often some employers \ncoerce, harass, and threaten their employees to keep them from \norganizing. Our current laws give our employees little recourse when \nthat happens, and it happens a lot. The Employee Free Choice Act puts \nthe choice to organize squarely on the shoulders of the employees, and \nthat is where it belongs.\n  This bill requires employers to recognize the formation of a union \nwhen the majority of employees express their support by signing a \nsimple authorization card--a card check. It gives both sides a right to \nbring in the Federal Mediation Service to mediate the first contract \nonce a union is formed, and enforces stronger penalties for companies \nthat interfere with the right to organize.\n  Providing the American workers with free choice will ensure access to \nhigher wages and better benefits, better fringe benefits. That means \nmore working families will have good health care and will be able to \nsave, for example, for a college education for their children and maybe \neven for a better retirement. They will be guaranteed fair benefits, \nsuch as vacation time, a reasonable workday, better on-the-job safety.\n  This is particularly true for African Americans, Latinos, and \ncertainly women. There are some who claim this is a political vote, a \ngesture to labor. It is a gesture to the American working men and \nwomen. I can only venture to guess that those people who do not \nunderstand what this bill is all about are those who do not like the \nbill. This bill is an honest attempt to help improve the lives of \nAmericans who often work hardest and are rewarded the very least.\n  Opponents of this bill, I guess, see it differently. Lobbyists for \nbig business argue the status quo NLRB secret ballot election works \njust fine. It is not just fine. It doesn't work just fine. In reality, \nthe status quo is often unfair and undemocratic. Big business wields \ntremendous power in secret balloting, and too often they use that power \nabusively. Big business controls the paychecks of the voters and \nlivelihoods of labor. Big business sets the work schedule and terms of \nemployment. And big business has a captive audience, an unfiltered \naudience to voters. All of us, save our new colleague who was sworn in \nat 3:15 yesterday, Dr. Barrasso, have earned a place in the Senate \nthrough an election. But I guarantee everyone here, everyone within the \nsound of my voice, in any of the elections of the other 99 Senators who \nserve here now, if our opponents controlled 100 percent of the \ninformation that voters receive, none of us would be here.\n  That is what this is all about. There is nothing more democratic in \npolitics and in government and the workplace than a level playing \nfield.\n  For those who are skeptical of this legislation, let me remind you \nthat it is already working. The NLRB permits the use of majority \nsignup, or card check as it is often described. For example, in Nevada, \na State where business and labor work together, most union organizing \ndrives are implemented through majority signup.\n  Let me say this. Let me be very clear. This bill does nothing to \nlimit employee options in right-to-work States such as Nevada, nor does \nit eliminate secret ballot elections, as some have said. It simply \ngives employees the choice to determine their path to union \nrepresentation. That seems fair. That is the level field we are talking \nabout.\n  Skeptics of this bill should look to Nevada to see that labor \norganizing does not have to be adversarial. The Employee Free Choice \nAct will be good for both sides: It will be good for labor, and it will \nbe good for management. This legislation will help provide the fair, \nsquare deal for working people that President Roosevelt first promised \n70 years ago and will keep our country strong and certainly more \ncompetitive.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to join in supporting the Employee Free \nChoice Act. That is what it is, a free choice act.\n  Mr. President, after we vote on the Employee Free Choice Act, we will \nreturn to immigration. Attention will be brought back to that issue, \nwhich is so critical--comprehensive immigration reform.\n  We would not have been able to revisit this issue if Democrats and \nRepublicans hadn't put aside their differences to move forward. We may \nnot all agree on the destination, but we now do at least have a \nroadmap. The process for this debate and the number of amendments we \nwill consider were decided with the complete support of the Republican \nleader, Senator McConnell. Senator McConnell and I have worked together \nin good faith to ensure a full, open, and productive debate on an issue \nof such overriding national importance. But this bill will not get done \nwithout Republican support. The bill is here, but we need Republican \nsupport.\n  Sunday I had the good fortune to visit with the President. I spoke \nthe same evening with Secretary Gutierrez. I spoke to Josh Bolton, the \nPresident's Chief of Staff. I explained to them, this is not a \nDemocratic bill. They understand that. We had a Democratic bill last \nyear. It died because the Republicans wouldn't allow us to go to \nconference. This is a bill that was negotiated in good faith with the \ntotal support of the President. He has made public statements that he \nsupports this legislation. Throughout this debate, Democrats have done \nour part. Eighty percent of us voted for the President's bill; 14 \npercent of Republicans did the same. That is not enough. We are not \nasking the Republicans to equally match our support, although I wish \nthey would, for their President's bill. If they deliver even 50 percent \nof their caucus, the legislation will pass. We need 25 Republicans to \nsupport us in this matter.\n  This is important legislation. The stakes are too high for inaction. \nWe are the Senate of the United States. People have said the issue is \ntoo complex; let's not do it.\n  We have to take hard votes. We have an immigration system that is \nbroken and needs to be fixed. That is what we are trying to do, fix it. \nWe would be derelict in our duties if we didn't make every effort to \nget this legislation passed.\n  When we finish here, is it over with? Of course not. It goes to the \nHouse, and they will take up a measure. They will do what they think is \nappropriate. It will go to conference and we will come up with \nsomething that hopefully will solve most of the problems of \nimmigration. I believe that to be the case. Comprehensive immigration \nreform will require us to tackle a number of difficult issues, such as \nborder security. We have done a remarkably important thing in this bill \nregarding border security. Previously, there was authorization for \nmoney to do border security. This bill gives direct funding of $4.4 \nbillion to address border security. If for no other reason, people \nshould vote for this. I am confident this bill will take care of border \nsecurity more than anything we have talked about in recent years. It \nwill also look at a fair temporary worker program. There is in the \nlegislation an agricultural workers program that is excellent. In this \nlegislation there is the DREAM Act for education for children who \npreviously could not be educated. Of course, there are employer \nsanctions which are important.\n  I am confident this bill addresses all four of these issues in a way \nthat honors our country, our strong immigrant history, and sets us on \nthe path to a stronger future.\n  I was looking at some commentary, talking about me and immigration. \nActually, they made fun of fact that my father-in-law came from Russia, \nas if it were a negative. My wife's father was born in Russia. That is \nthe strength of our country. My grandmother was born in England. I used \nto talk to my grandmother. She didn't remember much\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\nabout anything, but she remembered a few things. The fact that my \nfather-in-law came from Russia, my grandmother came from England makes \nus a better country. Immigrants are the strength of this country. This \nlegislation honors that fact.\n  We need to proceed with this legislation and send the American people \na better life for everybody. That is what this legislation will do. It \nwill allow us to solve the problem, secure our borders, have a \ntemporary worker program that meets the demands of our country, and put \n12 million people on a pathway to legalization. As Secretary Gutierrez \nsaid, it is not amnesty. If we do nothing, there is silent amnesty. \nWhat this bill does is make sure that people learn English. It makes \nsure they pay their taxes. It makes sure they work, stay out of \ntrouble, pay penalties and fines. Even then, they go to the back of the \nline. Remember, these people, whether we like it or not, have American \nchildren. This will allow them to come out of the shadows, be \nproductive citizens and with the great work we have done on border \nsecurity, stop illegals from coming into the country in the future. \nThat is what this legislation is all about. It is good legislation. We \nhave an obligation, as the legislative branch of Government, to do \nsomething to work with the President and get this passed.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, despite the fact that we are fast \napproaching the 6-year anniversary since the terrible terrorist attacks \nof September 11, it is painfully clear we have much work left\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\nto do to protect this Nation from these awful attacks. Osama bin Laden \nand his No. 2 still remain at large, and al-Qaida has grown in strength \nand is determined to attack globally. The administration's failed Iraq \npolicy has catalyzed a whole new generation of extremists who can be \nexpected to carry out attacks against the U.S. and our friends around \nthe world. Objective analyses, including the final report of the 9/11 \nCommission, conclude that this Nation has failed to take the steps \nnecessary to protect America from terrorist attacks.\n  We need only go back to look at the report card the Bush \nadministration received in implementing the 9/11 Commission Report: Ds \nand Fs. The threats the 9/11 Commission talked about and are \nencompassed in this bill are real and growing. When Democrats took \ncontrol of the Congress at the start of this year, we said we would \nfinally and fully implement the unanimous recommendations of the \nbipartisan 9/11 Commission. It is something we fought for when we were \nin the minority, and it was one of the first bills we passed at the \nstart of this session of Congress.\n  The House passed its version early this year, January 9, by a vote of \n299 to 128--broad bipartisan support. We passed our bill on March 13. \nIt, too, had bipartisan support, passing 60 to 38.\n  As my colleagues know, Democrats and Republicans who serve on the \nHouse and Senate committees with jurisdiction over this bill have \nworked tirelessly to resolve the differences in these two bills. I have \nhad numerous conversations with Chairman Lieberman. This preconference \nprocess has carried on for months, on a bipartisan basis, with full \ntransparency and good-faith efforts to produce a final bill. Progress \nhas been made.\n  The American people, though, don't expect progress. They expect \nresults, and that is what we need. We need to finish the work on this \nbill yesterday--as soon as possible. That is why I believe we need to \ntake the next procedural step to finish these negotiations, to appoint \nconferees. That is what we normally would do.\n  When this bill is finally signed into law, it will make America more \nsecure. It will improve the morale, training, and efficiency of the TSA \nscreening workforce, allowing them to work more effectively to protect \nair travelers. It will improve the screening of all maritime cargo--all \nmaritime cargo--so Americans can be assured we are doing all we can to \nprevent the smuggling of weapons--even a nuclear weapon--through \nAmerica's ports. It will improve the congressional oversight of \nintelligence to be sure we are building the best capabilities possible \nto stop terrorist attacks. It will improve communication sharing and \ncommunications interoperability among first responders so they can work \nswiftly to protect us from terrorist attacks. It will ensure that \ntransportation and mass transit infrastructures are hardened against \nterrorist attacks.\n  We need to work together to protect the American people from \nterrorism, and we need to do so immediately. We asked numerous times in \nthe last Congress to be able to finish the 9/11 bill, and we were \ndenied that ability. I would hope that this unanimous consent request \nallowing us to go to conference would be granted.\n  I am told the minority is going to object to this request that we go \nto conference. That is too bad. Although Senate Republicans have thrown \nprocedural hurdles in front of virtually everything we have tried to do \nin the Senate this year, I was hoping they would reconsider their \nobstruction when it comes to getting through legislation that makes \nAmerica more secure. There have been issues raised, but couldn't we \nhandle these in conference?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration \nof H.R. 1, and that the Senate then proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the \ntext of S. 4, as passed by the Senate on March 13, 2007, be inserted in \nlieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on \nits amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate, with the above occurring without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, on behalf of the minority, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend, the \nSenator from Oklahoma, we are glad to have you back. We are glad the \nmedical procedure went well and that you are back with the same \nfighting spirit you had the first day you came here. We are happy to \nhave you back.\n  Mr. President, I will renew my request at a subsequent time, and \nprobably a few more times, until we get this done. I think a number of \npeople have had calls from the 9/11 survivors, those people who lost \nloved ones in the 9/11 attack. They want us to get this done. We need \nto get this done. This is an issue that affects the safety and security \nof our Nation.\n  So I would hope that there would be a reconsideration of this \nobjection at a subsequent time because I am going to continue to offer \nthis until we are able to go to conference.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest, please.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order for the Senate to \nconsider any conference report on the 9/11 Commission legislation; that \nis, H.R. 1 and S. 4, that compromises the security of America's \ntransportation system by eliminating the flexibility given to the \nTransportation Security Administration to manage its employees to most \neffectively counter terrorist threats against Americans.\n  Before the Chair responds, if I could just make a very brief \nstatement.\n  The President has clearly said he will veto any measure that makes \ncollective bargaining rights for airport screeners a higher priority \nthan protecting our national security and defeating terrorists. Passing \na conference report that includes such a provision would be an exercise \nin futility and a waste of time, as the legislation would certainly be \nvetoed. We should be working to write a conference report that we know \ncan be signed into law so we can enhance our national security and \nbetter protect the American people from the terrorists we know are \nplotting every day to harm us.\n  Mr. President, I renew my request that it not be in order for the \nSenate to consider any conference report on the 9/11 Commission \nlegislation that compromises our national security by eliminating the \ncritical personnel management flexibility given to the Transportation \nSecurity Administration to enable it to respond to terrorist threats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the minority coming \nforward and outlining their objections to the 9/11 bill. It seems \npretty clear that the objection deals with collective bargaining, which \nis in the Senate-passed version of the bill. I appreciate very much \nthat being on the record.\n  It seems, that being the case, we at least know what we are dealing \nwith.

Mr. President, I want to visit with everyone present for \njust a few minutes about S. 1, the ethics and lobbying reform bill. We \nhope to appoint conferees on this important bill today. By doing this \ntoday, we would enact this critical legislation that is so important to \nbe done. It is the most significant lobbying ethics reform, I believe, \nin the history of this country. It makes tremendous reforms--long \noverdue. It will restore the people's confidence in their elected \nofficials.\n  Last year, Americans rightly got sick and tired about story after \nstory of corruption, the culture of corruption some called it, here in \nWashington led by Jack Abramoff, who is now in prison; Randy \nCunningham, who is now in prison; Bob Ney, who is now in prison; \nSafavian, the head of Government contracting, led away from his office \nin handcuffs; Scooter Libby--numerous people who worked for various \nHouse Members who were involved in corrupt activities, airplane trips \nto golf in Scotland and places that are hard to imagine.\n  The American people responded at the polls last November with a clear \nmessage that they wanted a new direction, and we, the Democrats, \nresponded by passing the most sweeping ethics and lobbying reform in a \ngeneration. We did it with the help of the minority. I do not say that \nlightly. But let's see what is in this bill. Let's review it for a bit \nto find out what this bill does.\n  It prohibits lobbyists and entities that hire lobbyists from giving \ngifts to lawmakers and their staffs. It prevents corporations and other \nentities that hire lobbyists from paying for trips for Members or \nstaffs. And it prohibits lobbyists from participating in or paying for \nany such trips. It requires Senators to pay fair market value prices \nfor charter flights, which put an end to the abuses of corporate \ntravel.\n  Many people in this Chamber flew in corporate jets and paid first-\nclass airfare. That did not corrupt any Members of Congress, but it was \ncorrupting. It didn't look right, and therefore it is important it be \nstopped. And I hope it stopped. We need legislation to make sure it is \nstopped.\n  This legislation also slows the so-called revolving door by extending \na ban on lobbying by former Members of Congress and senior staffers, \nand prevents Senators from even negotiating for a job as a lobbyist \nuntil their successor has been elected. This legislation puts an end to \npay-to-play schemes, such as the notorious ``K Street Project.'' It \nprovides dramatic improvements to disclosure and lobbying activities by \ndoubling the frequency that lobbyists must file reports on their \nactivities, requiring disclosure of contributions and bundled \ncontributions, requiring that lobbyists' disclosures be publicly \navailable on the Internet in a searchable form. This is for the first \ntime ever.\n  This legislation requires lobbyists to certify in writing that they \nhave not violated House or Senate gift and travel rules. It ends the \npractice of corporations hiding their lobbying activities behind bogus \ncoalitions with friendly sounding names, and increases civil and \ncriminal penalties for lobbyists who violate the law.\n  The bill has brought about a revolution in earmark disclosure.\n  For the first time ever, the Senate will identify all earmarks in \nbills, the Senator who requested it, and the entity or location that \nreceives it. Further, every Senator has certified that he or she has no \nmonetary interest in their earmarks. Let me say that. This disclosure \nis the first time ever that this information will be disclosed. The \nSenate could have required the disclosure last year or the year before \nor the year before that, while the number of earmarks was exploding \nunder a Republican Congress, but it did not. This year we took the lead \nand changed the way we do business around here. At the beginning of the \nyear, we sent a message that ethics and lobbying reform was our No. 1 \ncommitment by designating the bill S. 1. We worked hard to make this a \nbipartisan bill. Now we must take the next step by appointing \nconferees. I look forward to moving the ethics bill forward so we can \nreassure the American people that Congress is as good and honest as the \npeople it represents.\n  I have gone over most everything in this bill. There are other things \nin it, but this is strong, important information the American people \ndeserve. It is a law that should become a reality as quickly as \npossible.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 182, H.R. 2316, lobbying \ndisclosure; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text \nof S. 1, as passed by the Senate on January 18, 2007, be inserted in \nlieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time, passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate with a ratio of 4 to 3, with the above occurring \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, reserving the right to object, on \nbehalf of the Republican leader, I would add an additional unanimous \nconsent request that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, \nin consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 96, S. 223, under the following \nlimitations: That the committee-reported amendment be agreed to and \nthat the only other amendment in order be a McConnell or his designee \namendment, with 1 hour of debate equally divided in the usual form on \nthe bill and 1 hour equally divided on the McConnell amendment, and \nthat following the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate proceed \nto vote in relation to the McConnell amendment, followed by a vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended, if amended, with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, here we go again, doing their best--that \nis, the Republicans--to stop us from going ahead on ethics and lobbying \nreform. The suggestion of the distinguished Senator from Utah is \nreasonable, but it should be a different matter. In fact, once we look \nat the amendment, we may be willing to accept it. But it is only an \neffort to divert attention from ethics and lobbying reform, those \nmatters--corporate jets, what lobbyists can do, what they can't do, \nbundling, what we need to do with earmarks. It is an effort to divert \nattention from that. Attention may be diverted for a few minutes this \nafternoon, but we are going to continue to focus on it. We need to pass \nthis legislation. It is important we do so.\n  We, the Democrats, support what the Senator has suggested, basic \nelectronic filing of FEC reports. There is no problem with that. \nSenator Feinstein moved it through the Rules Committee and has been \nseeking consent to pass it on the floor unanimously. We have never seen \nthe amendment Senator McConnell wishes to stick on this. Once we have a \nchance to review it, we will be able, perhaps, to move forward on this \nconsent request. In any event, let's not muddy the waters on the ethics \nbill. We want to move forward on that comprehensive bill, the most \nsweeping reforms in a long time, probably ever.\n  I wanted everyone to know there has been objection made by the \nminority to going forward on a conference. The conference will be led \nby Joe Lieberman on our side, a man who is certainly fair to both \nsides. Why would we not go to conference on this important legislation?\n  I will be back. I will be back and hope there will be the revelation \nto the Republicans that we are going to do everything we can on this \nlegislation. We are going to focus attention on why it is not going to \nconference. It is not going to conference because the Republicans are \nstonewalling our ability to do so, coming up with something as \ndiverting as FEC reports being filed electronically.\n  I object to the request of my friend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last Thursday night, very late in the \nevening, this Chamber put its arms around a new energy bill. It is an \nenergy bill that deals with making sure we move forward with \nalternative fuels in a robust and real way for the future of America. \nIt is an energy bill that says we have had enough as Americans wasting \n60 percent of our energy, and we can do much better on efficiency. It \nis an energy bill that says it is time for us to move forward from the \npoint in time where we have tolerated vehicles that have not had the \nkind of efficiency we know is technologically possible in America, so \nwe are going to adopt new CAFE standards. It is a piece of energy \nlegislation that says we recognize the linkage between how we use \nfossil fuels here in America and the global warming that is occurring \naround our globe. So we said we would move forward and take some new \nsteps in the way of sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions. This is \na good piece of legislation. It is a bill which we hope--I hope and I \nknow many Members of this Senate, led by Senator Bingaman and Senator \nFeinstein and others, and Senator Reid--makes it to the President's \ndesk.\n\n  I wish to remind my colleagues while I have the floor for a few \nminutes that, in fact, this is one of the things we have been working \non in the Senate for the last several years.\n  In 2005, we passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and we said to the \nworld: We are going to start taking the concept of energy independence \nfor America in a very real and serious way. Last year, after some \nsignificant debate on this floor, we also opened up lease sale 181 and \nits extensions on the gulf coast for exploration and development of our \nresources.\n  This year, with the passage last week of the 2007 act, we put another \nlayer on the cake in terms of trying to move forward to the reality of \na world that embraces energy independence.\n  We still have a long way to go. We have a long way to go with this \nlegislation. It is my hope we don't get it caught up in a procedural \nquagmire, either here in the Senate or in the House of Representatives, \nand that ultimately we get legislation that is adopted which President \nBush ultimately signs into law. It is good legislation and the kind of \nlegislation we ought to be working on in this body.\n  Even though there has been a lot of focus lately on the President's \ndomestic initiative relative to immigration, the fact is that when one \nlooks at the state of the Union and what the President said in his \nState of the Union Address, we as Americans are addicted to foreign \noil. He said it is time for us to move forward in an aggressive and \nambitious way to get rid of the addiction we have to foreign oil. We \nhave been able to do that by embracing the committee's legislation \nwhich had that bipartisan goal in mind, that we would take some \nsignificant steps forward in this 110th Congress to deal with our \noveraddiction to foreign oil.\n  From my point of view, as I talked about this issue with the people I \nrepresent, the nearly 5 million people in the State of Colorado, I am \nreminded of the fact that we have come a long way in this debate on \nenergy and that we are now facing some inescapable forces which have \ngrabbed the attention of the American public in a way they never have \nbefore.\n  The first of those inescapable forces is national security. How can \nwe as the United States say we are secure as a nation when we import, \nas we did in March of last year, 66 percent of our oil from foreign \ncountries? Many of those countries we are importing our oil from are \ncountries that are spawning terrorism around the world. So from a \nnational security point of view, it seems to me that embracing the \nconcept of getting rid of this addiction to foreign oil is an \ninescapable force of our time.\n  That is why on this floor of the Senate you will see Republicans and \nDemocrats, conservatives and progressives, coming together to say that \nas a matter of national security, this inescapable reality is something \nwe must deal with. It was on that basis that several years ago the \nEnergy Futures Coalition, led by the distinguished progressive, my \ncolleague and good friend, former Senator Tim Wirth, who now runs the \nUnited Nations Foundation, together with a friend of his, C. Boyden \nGray, one of the leading voices of conservative causes, came together \nand founded a piece of legislation that we are trying to get through \nthis Senate now that is called the Set America Free legislation. We \ngave it another name as we went through our processes here in the \nSenate, calling it the DRIVE Act, and broke it up into different pieces \nof legislation. But at the end of the day, the Energy Futures Coalition \nand the Set America Free concept, the proposal they pushed forward, \nhave been embodied and embraced in the legislation that was adopted by \nthis body just this last week.\n  So the national security implications of what we are doing here are, \nin fact, an inescapable reality and an inescapable force that will lead \nus to a clean energy future for America in the 21st century.\n  Secondly, there is a major issue for us and another inescapable force \nwe deal with in our country today, and that is the issue of our own \nenvironmental security. How will we deal with the issue of global \nwarming? We know that is an issue we will have to deal with some more, \nand there will be adequate time to debate the particulars on how we \nmight be able to move forward. This legislation, with its efforts on \nefficiency, with its efforts on renewable energies, including what we \ndo with biofuels, takes us a step in that direction.\n  In addition, the environmental security of our Nation is also \naddressed in that legislation because we deal for the first time in a \nvery real way with the issue of carbon sequestration. I see my good \nfriend from Kentucky here who often has lauded the importance of coal, \nand I understand why. When you are from Kentucky, you would see the \nimportance of coal, as I do as well, being from Colorado, as does my \ngood friend Jon Tester from the State of Montana.\n  So the issue for us as we look at the coal resources of our Nation, \nwhere we have enough coal to supply the needs of the United States of \nAmerica for 200 years, is how can we use this abundant energy resource \nin a manner that doesn't compromise our environment? We can do that. We \ncan do that with the new technologies we have with respect to IGCC. We \ncan do that as we learn how to sequester the carbon emissions from the \nburning of coal. It\n\n[[Page S8402]]\n\nis not a new technology. It is a technology which has been around for a \nvery long time in the oilfields of my State, the oilfields of Canada, \nand the oilfields of many places around Colorado, as the past oil \nefforts we have had in our country have been dependent upon us being \nable to put carbon dioxide into the ground. So this sequestering of \ncarbon dioxide is something which has been going on for a very long \ntime.\n  The inescapable force of global warming and environmental security is \none that is with us for a long time to come, and it is something that, \nin the energy legislation we passed last week, is very much addressed \nin that legislation.\n  Finally, the other inescapable force is the economic reality of our \nNation with respect to a clean energy economy. I think the clean energy \nfuture for the United States of America in the 21st century creates \nvery significant opportunities. All of us know how difficult the \nchallenge of energy is, and all of us also know there is not going to \nbe only one answer which is going to lead us to the necessary \nconclusion that we need to deal with these inescapable forces; it is \ngoing to be a portfolio. It is going to have a number of different \nitems on that menu which deal with the energy needs of our Nation and \nof our world. But at the end of the day, the door we have opened here \nwith respect to a clean energy future will create millions upon \nmillions of jobs in America. It will create millions of jobs in those \nareas where perhaps they have had the most difficult time in their \ncommunities, they will be creating a viable economic activity.\n\n  For me, when I look at my State of Colorado, 2 years ago out on the \neastern plains, part of that forgotten America, much like the farmland \nof America, whether it is Oklahoma, Kansas, the Dakotas, or the eastern \npart of my State, we had a population which was declining in huge \nnumbers in many of our counties, rural and remote, and withering on the \nvine--part of that forgotten America where most people are not able to \nstay there because there are such limited opportunities. Yet, in a \nmatter of 2 years since, in the State of Colorado we adopted a new \nrenewable energy program, and we have seen things turn around in a very \nsignificant way. We have ethanol plants that are now functioning, \nproviding jobs, and creating hundreds of millions of gallons of ethanol \nin places such as Yuma and in places such as Fort Morgan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. So as we look at the economic opportunity that has come \nby way of rural America, I think that causes us all to say there is a \nway in which we can revitalize rural America. We do that in the \nlegislation we passed here last week with the 36-billion-gallon \nrenewable fuels standard and the other programs we have in there that \nwill open the door to a new era of biofuels. It goes beyond corn \nbecause we all understand there are limitations on corn. But the \nDepartment of Energy 2005 study itself found that somewhere over 125 \nbillion gallons of cellulosic ethanol could, in fact, be derived once \nwe open that new technology door. The experts who have been dealing \nwith cellulosic ethanol say we may only be a year, a year and a half \naway from being able to commercially deploy that technology.\n  I make these comments only to say that as we deal with the issue \ntoday of immigration, as we move forward to that later on this \nafternoon, there are other very difficult issues we face in our Nation \nand in our world today. Last week, we took a significant step in moving \nforward with a new energy future for America. I hope it is only the \nbeginning and that time will see us develop an even more robust, \neffective, and successful clean energy future for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, today I rise to speak in opposition to \nthe so-called Employee Free Choice Act which we defeated by cloture \nvote. But cloture votes don't necessarily kill a bill; they have a way \nof resurrecting themselves, as we are about to do with the immigration \nbill.\n  Oftentimes in Congress, the people who write bills try to come up \nwith some interesting titles for their bills, something they hope will \nmake people remember it or tell them something about what it does. Many \ntimes, these titles can be somewhat misleading. This bill's title, the \nEmployee Free Choice Act, takes this concept to a whole new level.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act actually removes choice from the \nemployees. It removes the right of a secret ballot in elections--a \ncornerstone of American democracy under current law. If a group of \nemployees wants to form a union, they must collect petition signatures \nor sign cards known as card checks. If 30 percent of the workers sign \nin favor of creating a union, then they or their employer has a right \nto request a secret ballot election to decide on forming a union. This \nelection is overseen by the National Labor Relations Board, a neutral \nboard of observers created by the Federal Government.\n  The misnamed Employee Free Choice Act would change all of this. This \nlegislation would overturn 70 years of labor law and allow unions to \nform in workplaces without a private ballot election by the workers. \nInstead, if unions could twist the arms of just over half of the \nemployees to sign cards expressing consent, then the union is \nautomatically certified as the union for all of the workers. Unions \nwould be allowed to collect signatures just about anyplace: at the \nworkplace, at home, at grocery stores, and at other places. It is easy \nto see how union persuasion tactics could become harassment of those \nwho do not wish to publicly declare support for union representation.\n  What would politics be like if Senators and Representatives simply \nhad to convince people to sign cards instead of voting secretly at the \npolls? Imagine if there were no private voting booths where people \ncould vote their conscience privately. Small armies of campaign \nvolunteers would hang around your house, drop by your children's \nschool, or find you at church in the hopes of securing your signature.\n  Then if you signed the card, your vote is made public for your \nemployer, your neighbors or anyone else to see. This is why we \ncurrently use this secret ballot protection for union organizations in \nthe first place.\n  In the past, there were concerns that elections held without privacy \nwould be observed by employers, and then if an employee voted to \nunionize, they would suffer some sort of reprisals. Apparently, my \ncolleagues supporting this bill and their allies in big labor no longer \nfear employer reprisals. I think it is great that they now trust \nemployers to observe how their workers vote to join a union. We have \nmade a lot of progress in labor-management relationships, apparently.\n  However, I don't think these ballot choices should be unprotected and \nout in the open for both union organizers and employers to see. \nWhenever privacy in elections is compromised, the door is open to \nintimidation and coercion. Why take a chance on that? It would seem \nthat big labor feels they can increase union membership if they know \nhow many employees are voting on organizing. I wonder what they plan to \ndo with this information to achieve their goals of creating more \nunions.\n  Americans enjoy the right to join a union, but the decision to join a \nunion should be freely made in private and without intimidation or \ncoercion. That is the only way to ensure that the choice is truly free \nand not forced.\n  According to the National Labor Relations Board, drives to form \nunions are successful around 60 percent of the time under the rules in \nplace now--60 percent of the time. That is the highest it has been in \n20 years. Back then, the union success rate was under 50 percent. So \nthere is no indication that it\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\nis more difficult now to convince workers to organize a union than \nbefore. So why does big labor want to change this system? They don't \nwant to ever lose these elections. Even though they win most of these \nelections, union membership has declined significantly in the past few \nyears. The percentage of employees in labor unions is down from 20 \npercent in 1983 to 12 percent today. Because labor unions simply are \nnot as attractive to workers as they once were, labor bosses have come \nto Congress to demand a legislative mandate designed to circumvent \nprivate ballot elections. They want more dues-paying members.\n  Throughout this debate, there is a clear example of hypocrisy in the \nargument in favor of the new card check system. Under current law, the \nprocess to certify a union is the same as the process to decertify a \nunion. However, this bill and its supporters are silent on this matter. \nApparently, they believe that when it comes to removing a union, \nworkers will be best served by a secret ballot. But when it comes to \nforming one, they don't deserve that protection. This kind of logic and \ninconsistency is further proof that this proposal is half-baked and \nindefensible.\n  Congress should not empower big labor bosses by depriving individual \nworkers of their right to be free of intimidation. Taking away private \nballot elections and subjecting workers to undue pressure and coercion \ngoes against the basic principles on which this country was founded. \nThe secret ballot election must be protected at the workplace.\n  I understand the new majority in Congress feels they owe a great deal \nof debt to their allies in big labor for the success they enjoyed in \nNovember of 2006. That is why we are considering this flawed bill. As \nthe majority, they can bring up any piece of legislation they choose. \nFair enough. However, this bill is purely political payback in its \nworst kind of policy. I urge my colleagues--which they have done in the \nfirst instance--to vote against considering this piece of legislation, \nas they did when we had our cloture vote earlier today.\n  This is a personal aside. In 1964, I was a professional athlete. We \nwere forming a players' union at the time so we could compete with the \nowners on an equal basis when it came to negotiations. We acquired 30 \npercent of the signatures from our players and we had an election. But \nit was a private-ballot election and 85 percent of the ballots \ncollected were in favor of forming that union. I think the same should \ngo with every union that is trying to be formed under the circumstances \nin today's market. Not only did we form a union, we formed one of the \nmost successful unions in the history of the United States of America. \nNow all players at the major league level are covered by that union and \nrepresented by that union.

This is the list of the 13 Democratic amendments, the 12 \nRepublican amendments, and 1 managers' amendment, which each are at the \ndesk; that there be a time limitation of 1 hour equally divided for \neach amendment; that they be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments under the same time limitation; and that upon the \ndisposition of the amendments, the bill be read the third time and the \nSenate vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object, Mr. President. We just received the substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina objects.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how about 2 hours per amendment, with the \nsame conditions and provisions in the previous unanimous consent \nrequests I made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, with all \ndeference to the majority leader, this procedure has excluded many of \nus from our right to offer amendments on the floor. I think he \nunderstands our discomfort with this process. There will not be an \namount of time that will pave over the loss of our rights to offer \namendments on this very important bill that needs to be dealt with. So \nit is not in terms of trying to delay what the majority leader is \ntrying to do, but there is not going to be a period of time on this \nparticular set of amendments, unless there is a set of amendments that \nwe will be allowed, as Senators in the United States of America, to \noffer on behalf of our constituencies.\n  Mr. REID. So I take it there is an objection.\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished friend, the junior \nSenator from Oklahoma, he always comes directly to the point. I \nappreciate him and his objection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1934\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I tried to line up these 26 amendments for \ndebate and vote. We have been told that no matter what the time per \namendment is that would be allocated, that is not good enough. I also \nincluded second-degree amendments. That was objected to. I have no \nchoice but to offer, after consultation with the Republican leadership, \nan amendment that contains these Democratic and Republican amendments \nand ask that it be divided\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\nso that these 26 Senators may get votes in relation to their \namendments.\n  I now call up that amendment, which is at the desk, on behalf of \nSenators Kennedy and Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue to \nread.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the reading of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in light of our discussion with the \ndistinguished majority leader under which we won't take further action \nuntil tomorrow, so we can begin to digest this mammoth amendment, I \nmove to waive reading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I did have a conservation with the junior \nSenator from Louisiana and a number of his colleagues. I think it is \nonly fair that they have the evening and night to work on this big \npiece of legislation. It took a lot longer to get here, as always \nhappens. It is ``always on its way,'' be here ``right away,'' ``another \n5 minutes.''\n  Of course, it took several hours. I think in fairness, it is only the \nright thing to do. We are going to come back at 10 o'clock in the \nmorning. There will be no morning business tomorrow. I would say to all \nSenators, there is a briefing that starts at 10 o'clock with Admiral \nMcConnell. I have not had the opportunity to speak to him yet. But I am \nconfident that for any Senators who are unable to go to that briefing \nbecause of being obligated to be here on the Senate floor, another time \ncan be arranged that he and/or his staff would be happy to come and \nvisit with another group of Senators. So we are not going to be in \nrecess during the time of that briefing. But I would hope tomorrow we \ncan get some movement on this bill, and the Senator from Louisiana and \nothers will better understand this tomorrow, and make a decision of how \nif, in fact, they want to proceed, along with a number of others.\n  So that being the case, I express my appreciation to the Senator from \nLouisiana and his colleagues we met with earlier today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8404-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a colleague \nand a friend--someone whose presence is missed but whose legacy will \nundoubtedly endure.\n  Senator Craig Thomas was a westerner through and through. The story \nof his life reflects the spirit of the West--his work ethic, his \nstrength of character, and his love for the land and resources of his \ncherished Wyoming.\n  Craig's life lessons were formed as a summer horseback guide, as a \ncompetitive wrestler, as a marine, as a husband, and as a father. He \nbrought those lessons with him to Washington, D.C., as a Congressman \nand a Senator, and he never forgot them or strayed from them. That is \nclear from the issues he held closest to his heart.\n  As a fellow westerner, I always admired Craig's commitment to being \nan exemplary steward of our national parks. His love for them probably \ndeveloped during his childhood summers around Yellowstone National \nPark, but he was able to translate that passion into monumental \nimprovements that generations of Americans will enjoy.\n  He also worked tirelessly on issues impacting public land management, \nagriculture, rural healthcare, and fiscal responsibility--all issues \nthat greatly benefited his constituents in Wyoming. And they understood \nand appreciated his advocacy for their well being by electing him time \nand again to represent them in the Nation's Capital.\n  Craig definitely had a special presence on Capitol Hill. He never \ngave up a fight; he had a certain grit that drew others to him; and he \nloved to joke around--all tributes that led to his being described as a \ncowboy or a Western hero.\n  The epitome of the American cowboy, John Wayne, has inscribed on his \nheadstone: ``Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into \nus at midnight very clean. It's perfect when it arrives and it puts \nitself in our hands. It hopes we've learnt something from yesterday.''\n  Craig Thomas treated every ``tomorrow'' as a new and exciting \nopportunity to make a difference for the people of Wyoming and the \nUnited States. He loved his work; he loved his family; and he loved \nlife. While he is no longer serving as the voice of the westerner in \nthe Senate, his years of dedicated service ensured that his legacy will \nsurvive.\n  Craig was a statesman and a leader, a fighter and a friend. The \nThomas family, the people of Wyoming, and those of us who worked with \nCraig will always remember the spirit of Western freedom, trusted \nintegrity, and heartfelt kindness that he embodied. We are all \nfortunate to have known such a remarkable person.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8404-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WORLD DAY OF REMEMBRANCE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am proud to submit S. Con. Res. 39, a \nresolution supporting the goals and ideals of a world day of \nremembrance for road crash victims. This resolution is the Senate \ncompanion to H. Con. Res. 87, which was recently submitted in the \nHouse.\n  Each crash might seem to us, in its immediacy, like an isolated \ntragedy, but when we step back, we see that each has its part in a \nglobal crisis that is deepening year by year. The day of remembrance--\nset by the United Nations General Assembly for the third Sunday of \nNovember--is not just for the 40,000 people who die in road crashes \neach year in America; it is for the 1.2 million who die in crashes in \nevery part of the world and for the staggering 20 to 50 million who are \ninjured. In fact, the World Health Organization predicts that, by the \nyear 2020, the death rate from crashes each year will surpass the death \nrate from AIDS.\n  True, many of these crashes are unique disasters, but that leaves \nmany more whose causes are systemic and preventable. Unsafe roads, poor \nmedical facilities, and inadequate driver education all contribute \ntheir share to the death toll. And unsurprisingly, the toll is highest, \nand rising, in middle- and low-income countries. Road safety, then, is \nan issue of economic justice.\n  On the world day of remembrance, we will recall all of the victims of \nroad crashes; we keep their families in our thoughts, and we pray for \nthe full recovery of those still living. But our compassion for \nindividuals must not obscure the bigger picture. ``We have to change \nthe way we think about crashes,'' said Diza Gonzaga, the mother of a \ncar-crash victim in Brazil. ``The majority of people think that crashes \nare due to fate. We have to think of a crash as a preventable event.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8404-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8404-S8405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\nkind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have \ncome to the floor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred \nin our country.\n  On February 7, 2006 in San Diego, CA, James Hardy strangled Raymund \nCatolico, a gay man, to death in the victim's apartment. Allegedly, the \ntwo men met at a bus station and went to Catolico's apartment to have \ndrinks and play video games. At some point Hardy attacked Catolico \nstrangling him to death. Following the murder, Hardy went out for food \nand brought it back to the apartment to finish playing his computer \ngame. According to Deputy District Attorney Dan Link, Catolico's \nsexuality was, ``a substantial motivation'' for the killing. Hardy is \ncharged with a hate crime and is being held without bail.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8405-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist Josiah Hollopeter\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof U.S. Army SPC Josiah Hollopeter of Valentine, NE. Specialist \nHollopeter was killed on June 14 in Al Muqdadiyah, Iraq. He was 27 \nyears old.\n  Specialist Hollopeter graduated from Valentine High School in 1998. \nHe played high school football as a defensive end, starting as a senior \nopposite his brother Tyler, a sophomore at the time. Tyler would also \ngo on to serve in Iraq as an Army helicopter pilot.\n  Before joining the Army, Specialist Hollopeter worked construction \njobs in Omaha and San Diego. He also worked for a canoe outfitter along \nthe Niobrara River for several summers.\n  Like so many young men and women of his generation, the terrorist \nattacks of September 11 had a profound impact on Specialist Hollopeter \nand inspired him to serve his country. He enlisted with the Army in \nJanuary 2006. He served with the 6th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment, \n3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, based at Ford Hood, \nTexas. We are proud of Specialist Hollopeter's service to our country, \nas well as the thousands of other brave Americans serving in Iraq.\n  In addition to his brother, Specialist Hollopeter is survived by his \nparents Ken and Kelly Hollopeter; wife Heather; and sister Anna \nHollopeter.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring SPC \nJosiah Hollopeter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8405-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RETIREMENT OF FRANK J. MONAHAN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto the distinguished career of Frank Monahan, who will retire in a few \ndays after 36 years of service to the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops.\n  Since 1971, Frank Monahan has worked on many of the great social \njustice issues of our day, always taking the side of the vulnerable, \nthe voiceless, and the victims, always standing firm in his belief that \nhere on earth, God's work must be our own. In the finest Jesuit \ntradition of his alma mater, Loyola University of Chicago, Frank \nMonahan is a man who has dedicated himself to serving others.\n  Early in his career, he was a Peace Corps volunteer in Nigeria. He \nwas responding to President Kennedy's call to a new generation of \nAmericans to engage themselves in public service and to help spread \nhope and the message of peace and cooperation throughout the world. He \nwent on to work in Chicago public schools, helping to implement \nantipoverty programs and improve school lunch programs so that poor and \nhungry children would be free to learn, without fear of want.\n  His good nature, strong commitment, and eternal optimism that we can \nleave the world better than we found it will be missed by all of us in \nCongress, but they will not soon be forgotten.\n  It has been my great privilege through the years--under seven \ndifferent Presidential administrations--to work with Frank on issues of \nfundamental fairness and justice. When I think of him, I am reminded of \nmy brother Robert F. Kennedy's words:\n\n       Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve \n     the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends \n     forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a \n     million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples \n     build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of \n     oppression and resistance.\n\n  I commend Frank Monahan for the countless ripples of hope he has sent \nout in his career.\n  We will be sad to see him leave, but heart in the fact that this \ngreat friend and ally will continue, in new and different fields, to \nlive out the words of the Gospel of Mathew:\n\n       For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and \n     you gave me drink, a stranger and you welcomed me, naked and \n     you clothed me, ill and you cared for me, in prison and you \n     visited me.\n\n  He has certainly earned his retirement. As Frank and his family look \nforward to meeting the new challenges and opportunities that lay ahead, \nI am sure God is looking down on him now and saying, ``Well done, my \ngood and faithful servant.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8405-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8405-S8406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE FACE OF COURAGE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to honor the \ndistinguished service of my fellow Hoosier, SFC Jeffrey E. Mittman.\n  Throughout his remarkable career in the U.S. Army, Sergeant Mittman \nhas exemplified the professionalism and dedication that is a hallmark \nof our Nation's Armed Forces, including during deployments in support \nof Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi \nFreedom. On July 7, 2005, while assisting an Iraqi Public Order Brigade \nin Central Baghdad as a member of the Special Police Transition Team, \nSFC Jeffrey E. Mittman was wounded by an improvised explosive device. \nSince that day Sergeant Mittman has worked to recover from the injuries \nhe sustained.\n  I also appreciate this opportunity to share my best wishes with \nSergeant Mittman's wife Christy and children Jamie and Payton. As \nSergeant Mittman works to recover from the grievous injuries he \nsuffered while serving his nation in Iraq, I know that his children \nwill benefit from the example of service and dedication that he and \nChristy have set.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a poem by Albert Caswell honoring SFC \nJeffrey Mittman be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                          The Face of Courage\n\n     A Beautiful Man,\n     Who with The Heart of A Hero now here so stands!\n     Who within this his short lifetime, has so made a difference \n           . . . so very grand!\n\n     Who with but half a face,\n     Who now so in history holds such a place . . .\n     One of such honor, one of such sacrifice . . . one of such \n           most magnificent splendid grace!\n\n     As this warrior battles both night and day,\n     To rebuild his life, from which from him has so been taken \n           away!\n     In this his valiant quest, courage's best, a hero no less . . \n           . as to our world he'll bless, in so many ways!\n\n     Beauty,\n     Beauty, is but skin deep!\n     For all of those whom have so made a difference, up in Heaven \n           in his arms our Lord shall keep!\n\n     For we will all grow old some day,\n     As so surely all of our beauty shall so slip away!\n     So what then do our lives portray?

Mr. President, as a proud Oregonian and a proud \nmember of ``Beaver Nation,'' I congratulate Coach Pat Casey and the \nOregon State University baseball team, who for the second straight year \nhave brought home to Corvallis from the College World Series in Omaha, \nNE, the NCAA Baseball Championship trophy.\n  By defeating the University of North Carolina in the championship, \nthe Beavers have joined the elite group of college baseball teams who \nclaim consecutive national championships. What's more, the Beavers \nswept to the title with the most lopsided scores in College World \nSeries history.\n  As impressive as the Beaver's athletic accomplishments are, even more \nimpressive is the type of individuals they are. Each and every time a \nBeaver was interviewed, they didn't speak about themselves, they spoke \nabout the team. They spoke of heart, character, and giving it your \nbest.\n  Oregonian Columnist John Canzano wrote, ``What you didn't see on the \nfield Sunday was the pediatrics unit of Nebraska Medical Center. Coach \nCasey toured the place with players, visiting sick children this week. \n. . . What you probably didn't see where thousands of fans from Iowa \nand Nebraska who were dressed in orange, and cheering for Oregon State \nbecause they identify with hard-working, salt-of-the-earth \noverachievers and couldn't help themselves.''\n  I am delighted to join with my colleague Senator Wyden in submitting \nthis resolution extending the congratulations of the United States \nSenate to Oregon State University, and I urge my colleagues to visit \nOregonLive.com to read touching stories about this truly inspiring \nteam.\n  Allow me to specifically mention the names of all the coaches and \nplayers who have made my State so very proud: Head Coach Pat Casey, \nAssociate Head Coach Dan Spencer, Assistant Coach Marty Lees, Volunteer \nAssistant Coach David Wong, and players Erik Ammon, Darwin Barney, \nHunter Beaty, Scotty Berke, Reed Brown, Brian Budrow, Mitch Canham, \nBryn Card, Brett Casey, Jackson Evans, Kyle Foster, Drew George, Mark \nGrbavac, Chad Hegdahl Chris Hopkins, Koa Kahalehoe, Greg Keim, Blake \nKeitzman, Josh Keller, Eddie Kunz, Joey Lakowske, Lonnie Lechelt, \nJordan Lennerton, Mike Lissman, Anton Maxwell, Jake McCormick, Chad \nNading, Jason Ogata, Ryan Ortiz, Joe Paterson, Tyrell Poggemeyer, Joe \nPratt, Jorge Reyes, Scott Santschi, Kraig Sitton, Alex Sogard, Dale \nSolomon, Michael Stutes, Daniel Turpen, John Wallace, Braden Wells and \nJoey Wong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8406-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF BARBARA KERR\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me for \na moment as I reflect on the many accomplishments of Barbara Kerr, who \nhas just stepped down as president of the California Teachers \nAssociation. Barbara's dedication to California's teachers is matched \nonly by her dedication to California's schoolchildren.\n  Barbara Kerr began her career in education as a first grade teacher \nat Woodcrest Elementary School in Riverside, CA. After a very long \ninvolvement with the California Teachers Association, she took the \nreins as its president 4 years ago. During her presidency, Barbara has \nhad an intimate hand in six statewide elections, and she has been on \nthe winning side in most of them. Her success can be attributed to her \nboundless energy, her ability to connect across the political spectrum, \nher keen insight, and her passion for giving every child the best \npossible educational opportunities.\n  Last year, the Los Angeles Times named Barbara Kerr the third most \npowerful person in southern California, ranking her well ahead of both \nbusiness leaders and elected officials. And the Los Angeles Times was \nright. Barbara has led the California Teachers Association through some \nof the most turbulent times in California's history and has done so \nwith a clear aim to put California schools and their teachers and \nstudents first.\n  Barbara is retiring from both the California Teachers Association and \nfrom teaching. I know that teachers across California will miss her \nstrong leadership, and I will miss her perspective and wisdom on issues \nof education and more. But Barbara is also considering where the future \nmay lead, and I can only hope that she will continue to stay involved \nand stay active. Where ever the future leads her, I know that Barbara \nwill continue putting the needs of our children first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8406-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING DR. NATHAN CARLINER\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the life \nand legacy of Dr. Nathan Carliner. Dr. Carliner was a well-respected \ncardiologist who practiced at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter and a professor at the University of Maryland School of \nMedicine. He will be remembered for his commitment to his patients, his \ncolleagues, and his students, as well as his devotion to friends and \nfamily.\n  Dr. Carliner was born in Baltimore and raised on South Road in Mount \nWashington. He followed in the footsteps of his father, Dr. Paul \nCarliner, who was also a doctor and codiscovered Dramamine in 1947. \nAfter his father's untimely death at just 46 years old, Nathan decided \nto devote his life to medicine. He was a 1958 Gilman School graduate \nand earned a bachelor of science degree at Johns Hopkins University. He \nwent on to graduate from Hopkins Medical School in 1965.\n  After completing his internship and residency, Dr. Carliner joined \nthe Army Medical Corps. He was medical service chief at the 3rd Mobile \nArmy Surgical Hospital, MASH, at Binh Thuy in the Mekong Delta during \nthe Vietnam war. After the war, Dr. Carliner studied cardiology and \nadvanced electrocardiography before moving back to Baltimore in the \n1970s. Once he returned to his hometown, Nathan continued his service \nboth to his state and his country. He was a full professor at the \nUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine and he was associate chief of \ncardiology and director of noninvasive cardiology services at the \nveterans hospital.\n  Dr. Carliner was known not just for his professionalism and his \nexperience but also for his calming demeanor and his commitment to \nmentoring medical students and postgraduate trainees. Nathan touched so \nmany lives and made many great contributions both to his field and to \nhis colleagues.\n  Nathan Carliner's death is a tragedy. Yet his life was a triumph. I \noffer my heartfelt condolences to his family--his brother Mark, his \nsister Esther Carliner Viros, and his four nephews, particularly Paul \nCarliner, who worked in my office for over 12 years and who shares his \nuncle's commitment and dedication to helping others.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting this extraordinary \nman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8406-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8406-S8407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING HASTINGS, NEBRASKA\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \nCity of Hastings, NE, for being named ``America's Greenest City'' by \nYahoo, Inc., the online search engine. During a time when people around \nthe world are concerned about energy security and environmental \nquality, they need look no further than the city of Hastings as a \nperfect example of what a community can do to help clean up the \nenvironment.\n  Hastings, with a population of 25,000, located in south-central \nNebraska, has just won Yahoo's ``Be a Better Planet--\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\nGreenest City in America'' challenge, beating 350 other cities across \nthe Nation which had entered the competition. Some of the environmental \nprojects accomplished by the city of Hastings include conversion of \nmethane to energy at its pollution control center, production of E85 \nethanol, installation of energy-efficient street lighting, and creation \nof an extensive network of parks and hiking and biking trails.\n  Hastings, NE, the birthplace of Kool-Aid, is in the heart of farm \ncountry, which most certainly contributed to its environmentally sound \npolicies. Farmers have always been leaders when it comes to being good \nstewards of the land, water, and air.\n  For its efforts, Yahoo offered the city of Hastings its choice of \neither a fleet of hybrid taxi cabs, similar to those donated to New \nYork City during the campaign's kickoff on May 14, 2007, or the \nequivalent cash donation. Hastings, which has signed the U.S. Mayor's \nClimate Protection Agreement, selected the latter in order to further \nits environmental programs and become an even greener city. In addition \nto the top prize awarded to Hastings, the top five cities are being \nrewarded with deliveries of thousands of energy-efficient compact \nfluorescent lightbulbs, compliments of Yahoo.\n  Hastings mayor Matt Rossen plans to solicit ideas from residents for \nfuture projects, and Global Green USA will also work with the city of \nHastings to identify potential city greening projects, such as \nexpansion of renewable energy programs and energy-efficient renovations \nfor city buildings.\n  As Nebraska's Senator, I am extremely proud of Hastings, NE, which \nhas shown an outstanding commitment to the development of renewable and \nsustainable energy solutions for protecting the environment, improving \nhealth, and saving money. In commending the city of Hastings, NE, for \nbeing named America's Greenest City, I wish to highlight the sentiments \nexpressed by Yahoo's cofounder, David Filo, who said, ``The determined \ngreen spirit demonstrated by the people of Hastings, Nebraska, \nunderscores Yahoo's belief that individual actions can add up to \nsignificant change.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8407-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING KATIE BEHRENS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge \nLouisiana Tech University for its scientific breakthrough and \ninnovation in the department of nanotechnology. I would like to take a \nfew moments to expand on Louisiana Tech's achievements and wish the \nfacility and student body continued success.\n  Nanotechnology is the art of manipulating materials on an atomic and \nmolecular level, and Louisiana Tech University has risen to the top of \nthis scientific threshold. This year a trade magazine, Small Times, \nranked LA Tech third in micro and nanotechnology education. Small Times \nevaluated each college based on various criteria, and Louisiana Tech \nsurfaced as one of\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\nthe elite universities. Louisiana Tech also stands as one of the only \nuniversities in the country that offers a nanotechnology degree at both \nthe undergraduate and graduate levels. Their diversity within the \nprogram, and their excellence in both faculty innovation and curriculum \nranks them among the best major scientific universities.\n  Louisiana Tech University also ranked tenth in the Nation for \ncommercializing nanotechnology inventions, or the capability to process \npatents and turn them into profitable ideas. The university alone \napplied for 24 patent applications in the last year, 20 of which \ninvolved micro and nanotechnology, proving Louisiana Tech's dedication \nas a national contributor to the scientific spectrum. As Louisiana Tech \nblossoms, many profitable institutions have invested and settled within \nthe university, such as Avoyelles Renewable Fuels, which is working to \ndiscover a way to convert biomass waste into a biofuel through a \nnanocatalyst.\n  I would also like to take a moment to honor Joshua Michael Brown. At \nLouisiana Tech University, he became this first person in the entire \nworld to graduate with a nanosystems engineering degree. He will \ncontinue at Louisiana Tech University in order to gain his doctorate in \nmicronanotechnology.\n  Thus, today I congratulate Louisiana Tech for its innovation in the \never-changing fields of science, and I look forward to the continued \ngrowth of the school and its students as they shape the future \ndevelopment of micro and nanotechnology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8408-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) announced that on today, June \n26, 2007, he had signed the following enrolled bill, previously signed \nby the Speaker of the House:\n\n       S. 1352.

A bill to enhance the adoption of a nationwide interoperable \nhealth information technology system and to improve the quality and \nreduce the costs of health care in the United States; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is long past time for the Nation's \nhealth care industry to adopt modern information technology. Such \ntechnology has revolutionized a wide array of American industries, and \nit holds the same promise for the health care industry. It has a clear \ncapacity to increase efficiency and reduce costs at a time when the \nindustry is being plagued by the alarming rise in health costs.\n  Staggering inefficiencies imbedded in our health care system prevent \npatients across the country from receiving the type of care they \ndeserve. Forty percent of Americans have been victims of preventable \nmedical errors, and as many as 100,000 patients die each year from such \nerrors. In a Nation which already spends more on health care than any \nother country, a modest investment in health IT is a small price to pay \nfor a safer and less costly health care system.\n  Some health facilities with resources at their disposal have already \ninvested in IT systems with great success. Meanwhile, the most \nvulnerable institutions lag further and further behind in the adoption \nof necessary technology. It now costs a physician's office about \n$40,000 to implement a new IT system. Providers with financial need \ndeserve access to information technology to close the health IT gap, so \nthat patients across the country have access to quality health care.\n  The Senate unanimously approved the Wired for Health Care Quality Act \nin the last Congress. Today, Senator Enzi, Senator Hatch, Senator \nClinton, and I are reintroducing that bill, and we urge its swift \npassage. By setting national standards for health information \ntechnology and by offering funds for IT investment, the legislation \nwill help providers overcome both the technical and the financial \nbarriers to adopting and implementing health IT systems.\n  Recognizing the financial challenges of such investments, our bill \nestablishes several Federal funding mechanisms to encourage the \nadoption of this technology. The legislation authorizes Federal grants \nfor providers in need and funds low interest loans in order to ease the \nburden on health care professionals who invest in new systems for \nelectronic medical records and other purposes. Since the ability of \nphysicians to share information is essential to ensuring effective \ntreatment and eliminating wasteful spending, our bill also provides \nfinancial assistance to establish regional and local health IT \nnetworks.\n  Rapid exchange of information is essential to ensuring that providers \nhave complete patient information, but the adoption of such technology \nmust be accompanied by strong patient privacy protection. Our bill \nspecifies that the American Health Information Community will be a body \nto make recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services \non patient privacy, information security, and appropriate uses of the \ntechnology. In addition, the bill ensures that freestanding health \ninformation databases are subject to the same privacy rules as other \nhealth care entities and requires grant recipients to implement strong \nprivacy protections themselves.\n  To encourage the implementation of modern health information systems \nacross the Nation, the legislation codifies the role of the National \nCoordinator for Health Information Technology in the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to coordinate and expedite the adoption of \nhealth IT by Federal agencies. In addition, the bill establishes a \npublic-private partnership, the Partnership for Health Care \nImprovement, to streamline the nationwide implementation of health \ninformation systems by establishing standards for interoperability that \nmust be adopted by grant recipients and Federal contractors.\n  Estimates indicate that the widespread adoption of electronic health \nrecords could save up to 30 percent in annual health spending, or more \nthan $600 billion a year. Since 45 million Americans are uninsured, we \ncan't delay the nationwide adoption of health IT systems any longer. \nInteroperability standards will eliminate inefficiencies caused by lack \nof uniform technology. Increased funding will reduce the widening \nhealth IT gap, making the advances of the information age available to \nall health facilities. The savings generated by these initiatives have \nthe potential to give all Americans access to the Nation's state-of-\nthe-art health care industry.\n  I especially commend the work of my colleagues Senator Enzi, Senator \nClinton, and Senator Hatch in developing this needed legislation, and I \nlook forward to its enactment as soon as possible.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about my commitment to \nimprove the quality and reduce the cost of health care in this Nation.\n  Some of the most serious challenges facing health care today, medical \nerrors, inconsistent quality, and rising costs, can be addressed \nthrough the effective application of available health information \ntechnology linking all elements of the health care system. Information \nsharing networks have the potential to enable decision support anywhere \nat any time, thus improving the quality of health care and reducing \ncosts.\n  But what does this mean for patients? Well, first of all, the \nwidespread use of health IT would allow medical data to move with \npeople as they move. When someone goes to the doctor's office, he or \nshe won't have to take the clipboard and write down everything they can \nremember about themselves. Better use of health IT also would cut down \non medical errors with prescriptions, instead of trying to decipher the \ndoctor's handwriting, a pharmacist could access the prescription \ninformation electronically.\n  The widespread use of health IT could also save lives. If someone is \ntraveling and gets in a car wreck or gets hurt in some other way, the \nemergency room doctor would be able to find out everything he or she \nneeds to know to make the right treatment decisions. If someone falls \ninto a coma and can't tell a doctor or nurse about their medications, \nbeing able to access an electronic medical record could prevent \ndangerous drug reactions.\n  Beyond saving lives and saving time, more effective use of health IT \nalso could save us a lot of money. A Rand study suggested that health \nIT has the potential to save the health care system $162 billion a \nyear. In order for these savings to be realized, we must create an \ninfrastructure for interoperability. The bill I am introducing today is \nthe first step toward building that infrastructure.\n  Last Congress, the Senate unanimously passed the Wired for Health \nCare Quality Act, which I wrote with Senator Kennedy. We have worked \nwith Senator Hatch and Senator Clinton and are introducing an updated \nbill today. We plan to bring this revised bill before our committee \nthis Wednesday.\n  This legislation addresses one of the primary barriers to widespread \nadoption of interoperable health IT, which is the lack of agreed-upon \nstandards, common implementation guides, and a certification process. \nThe bill directs the Secretary to establish and chair the public-\nprivate American Health Information Collaborative, which is composed of \nrepresentatives of the public and private sectors. The greatest \nimprovements in quality of health care and cost savings will be \nrealized when all elements of the health care system are electronically \nconnected and speak a common technical language; that is, they are \ninteroperable.\n  In order to address the health information technology ``adoption \ngap'' in the U.S., the bill authorizes three grant programs that will \ncarefully target financial support to health care providers and \nconsortia for the purpose\n\n[[Page S8415]]\n\nof facilitating the adoption of interoperable health information \ntechnology.\n  Another barrier to greater adoption is cultural. I recognize that \nmany physicians and hospitals are hesitant to move from paper-based \nsystems to electronic systems. Some physicians have been writing \nprescriptions by hand for many years and may resist changing to \nelectronic prescribing. One way to address this cultural barrier is to \nsupport teaching hospitals that integrate health information technology \nin the clinical education of health care professionals. Exposing \nstudents and residents to effective everyday uses of health IT will \nlead to a greater adoption by these students and residents when they \ngraduate and begin practicing on their own.\n  The wise deployment of health IT is also critical for effective \nresponse in public health emergencies. Interoperable health IT systems \nwill help to track infectious disease outbreaks and increase the \nFederal Government's rapid response in emergency situations.\n  I am eager to work with members of the Finance Committee to ensure we \nproduce a bill that will pass the Senate unanimously once again this \nCongress. This bill ensures that avenues to measure and report the \nquality of care are available through health information technology. \nImproving the quality of care provided in this country is one of my top \nlegislative priorities.\n  I look forward to passing this important legislation, which will help \nfacilitate the widespread adoption of electronic health records to \nultimately result in fewer mistakes, lower costs, better care, and \ngreater patient participation in their health and well being. This is a \ngreat stride forward in the journey to improve our Nation's health care \nsystem. I look forward to seeing meaningful health information \ntechnology legislation signed into law this Congress.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, for several years now I have been \npromoting the adoption of health information technology as a means to \nimprove our health care system. Modernizing our system will improve \nquality of care and reduce costs. A RAND study found that, as a nation, \nwe could save more than $77 billion annually through the widespread use \nof electronic medical records, and these savings could double with the \naddition of prevention and chronic disease management components.\n  I introduced comprehensive health quality and IT legislation in 2003 \nto set us on the path to creating a health IT infrastructure. \nSubsequently, the Senate unanimously passed bipartisan legislation that \nI worked on with Senators Frist, Kennedy, and Enzi. We were unable to \nreach final agreement on that bill before the adjournment of the 109th \nCongress and today are reintroducing the Wired for Healthcare Quality \nAct to bring our health care system into the 21st century.\n  I am pleased to be working again on this critical effort with \nSenators Kennedy and Enzi and want to welcome Senator Hatch and thank \nhim for his work and contributions to the bill we are introducing \ntoday.\n  While there are a number of things I believe we need to do to improve \nour health care system, one of the most fundamental avenues for change \nis modernizing our system of care by developing a nationwide \ninteroperable health information technology infrastructure that \nprotects patient privacy. It is past time that our health care delivery \nsystem allow providers to easily manage their information needs and \nsecurely and privately manage the needs of their patients.\n  We have the most advanced medical system in the world, yet patient \nsafety and quality is compromised because health care providers are \ntreating patients without all the information they need. It happens in \nthe emergency room or when you are seeing multiple doctors who are \nunaware of treatments you are receiving from others. Harnessing the \npotential of information technology will eliminate these problems and \nhelp reduce errors and improve quality in our health care system.\n  Interoperable health IT will also help eliminate inefficiency and \nduplication in the system. Every time patients see a doctor, they fill \nout forms, have to remember their medical history, their medications, \nimmunizations, and previous test results. No wonder a study in \nCalifornia found that one out of every five lab tests and x rays were \nconducted solely because previous lab results were unavailable.\n  There is no reason why people's health files--their medical history, \ntest results, lab records, x rays--can't be accessed securely and \nconfidentially from a doctor's office or hospital. In fact, if all \nhospitals used a computerized physician order entry system, an \nestimated 200,000 fewer adverse drug events would occur, saving roughly \n$1 billion per year.\n  We should also eliminate administrative inefficiencies that drive up \nhealth care costs. Today, processing paper claims costs an average of \n$1.60 to $2.20 per claim. It costs 85 cents for an electronic claim.\n  We can also use information technology to disseminate clinical \nresearch. A government study recently showed it takes 17 years from the \ntime of a new medical discovery to the time clinicians actually \nincorporate that discovery into their practice at the bedside. Health \nIT will dramatically reduce this time and help drive improvements in \ncare.\n  The Wired for Healthcare Quality Act is designed to address these \nissues through Federal leadership to develop and adopt the technology \nstandards necessary to ensure that electronic medical records are fully \nportable and confidential for patients and accessible to their health \ncare providers. The legislation encourages the development of a private \nand secure nationwide interoperable health IT infrastructure through:\n  Codifying the role of the National Coordinator for Health Information \nTechnology in coordinating the policies of federal agencies regarding \nhealth IT.\n  Establishing a public-private partnership known as the Partnership \nfor Health Care Improvement to provide recommendations to the Secretary \nwith regard to technical aspects of interoperability, standards, \nimplementation specifications, and certification criteria for the \nexchange of health information.\n  Requiring all Federal IT purchases to conform to the standards \nrecommended by the Partnership and adopted by the President.\n  Establishing the American Health Information Community as a body \nproviding recommendations to the Secretary regarding policies to \npromote the development of a nationwide interoperable health \ninformation technology infrastructure. These include recommendations \nregarding patient privacy, information security, and appropriate uses \nof health information. A wide variety of stakeholders including \npatients, providers, insurers, employers, and experts in information \ntechnology, privacy, security, and quality--will have representation on \nthe AHIC.\n  Establishing three competitive grant programs for the adoption and \nincreased utilization of qualified health information technology \nsystems. The first grant program would award funding to eligible \nentities, including nonprofit hospitals, community health centers, and \nsmall physician practices to purchase, train, and use qualified health \ninformation technology systems and improve the management of chronic \ndiseases. The second grant program would award funding to States to \nestablish loan funds for the purchase of qualified systems, and the \nfinal competitive grant program would assist with the establishment of \nregional or local health information technology exchanges.\n  Ensuring privacy and security by delineating the rights of \nindividuals to inspect and correct their records and take action to \naddress fraud, as well as requiring breach notification and audit \ntrails so patients can know who has accessed their information.\n  Establishing a Health Information Technology Resource Center to \nprovide technical assistance and highlight best practices associated \nwith the adoption, implementation and effective use of health \ninformation technology systems.\n  I am especially pleased by the focus that this legislation places on \nensuring that information technology will improve the quality of care \ndelivered in our Nation. The Wired for Healthcare Quality Act will \nprioritize quality through the following provisions: Developing quality \nand efficiency reports at the national, regional, and, when requested, \ninstitutional or individual\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\nprovider level, that will help to improve quality and efficiency and \nenhance the ability of consumers to evaluate the quality and delivery \nof healthcare services; Establishing a process through which to develop \nevidence-based, consensus health care quality measures, through which \nto determine the quality and efficiency of care received by patients; \nand adopting the quality measures established by such process and \nproviding for the integration of these measures into the nationwide \nhealth IT infrastructure, thus fostering uniformity in quality measures \nacross our healthcare system.\n  Information technology has radically changed business and other \naspects of American life. It is time we use the power of the \ninformation age to improve health care. If we do, we can dramatically \nimprove the quality of care we all receive. The Wired for Healthcare \nQuality Act is critical to this effort. Again I want to thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Kennedy, Enzi and Hatch for their partnership on \nthis legislation, and I look forward to working with them and all of my \ncolleagues to enact this important bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nS. 1693, the Wired for Healthcare Quality Act. The goal of achieving \nhigh quality health care is not reachable without use of information \ntechnology. For instance, the 21 quality measures that hospitals now \nreport for Medicare must usually be manually extracted from paper \ncharts. The Government Accountability Office reports that hospitals are \nnear the limit of the number of quality measures that they can report \nby these antiquated techniques. Implementation of information \ntechnology is critical because with it there is no practical limit on \nthe ability to measure quality.\n  Dr. Brent James, a national quality expert from Intermountain \nHealthcare of Salt Lake City, UT, tells me that a health care provider \nwho wishes to improve performance starts by defining detailed measures \nof quality health care and then builds information technology around \nthe measures so that routine, automatic reporting of compliance with \nthe measures becomes part of the health information technology \nplatform. The Wired for Healthcare Quality Act does not just impose \nstandards for interoperability of information technology it creates a \nmechanism by which quality measures are embedded in those standards.\n  The legislation encourages the development of standards by codifying \nthe office of the National Coordinator for Health Information \nTechnology who coordinates the health information technology policies \nof Federal agencies.\n  It creates a public-private partnership, the Partnership for Health \nCare Improvement to advise the Secretary on technical aspects of \ninteroperability, on standards, on implementation, and on certification \nof compliance with those standards.\n  The bill establishes the American Health Information Community as a \nbody providing recommendations to the Secretary regarding the broad \npolicy issues of implementation of technical standards created by the \npartnership. For instance, it will advise the Secretary on issues of \npatient privacy, information security, and appropriate uses of health \ninformation.\n  The bill directs the Secretary to provide for the development and use \nof quality measures in the health information technology platform by an \narrangement with a private entity that establishes standards for \nmeasurement development and coordinates and harmonizes measures so that \nproviders are able to use the same set of measures, if not the same \nmeasures, for all their patients.\n  The legislation requires that all Federal information technology \npurchases conform to the standards recommended by the Partnership and \nadopted by the President within 1 year and that all Federal agencies \ncomply within 3 years. Adoption of these standards is voluntary for \nprivate entities except for functions they contract with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The legislation encourages the adoption of qualified health \ninformation technology by providing grants for the purchase of health \ninformation technology systems to providers demonstrating financial \nneeds, by providing low interest loans to states to help providers \nacquire health information technology systems, and by providing grants \nto facilitate the implementation of regional or local health \ninformation exchanges.\n  The legislation provides for the development of national reports of \nhealth care quality based on Federal health care data and private data \nthat is publicly available. Reports are to be contracted to quality \nreporting organizations.\n  The legislation assures strong privacy protections for electronic \nhealth information by forbidding funding under the bill to any \ninformation technology system that lacks strong privacy and security \nprotections, by requiring recipients of funding to notify patients if \ntheir medical information is wrongfully disclosed and by requiring that \nthe national strategy on health information technology include strong \nprivacy protections.\n  Before I close, I must raise a concern with the bill. Building a \nnational, interoperable health care information technology platform is \nlike building two houses with a common driveway. Federal programs such \nas Medicare and Medicaid are one house. Private health plans are the \nother. They both must share common standards for health information \ntechnology so that systems all talk with one another. They both must \nimplement from a common pool of quality standards otherwise providers \nwill be impossibly confused. The two houses will not look alike but \nthey must share a common driveway and common building standards.\n  I use this analogy to emphasize that the rules for the quality \nmeasures used by the Medicare Program are the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Finance Committee on which I serve as a senior member. The rules \nfor quality measures in a national health information technology \nstandard, and private health insurance plans, are under the \njurisdiction of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. We \nmust be certain that these distinctions are made with clarity to avoid \nconfusing ourselves and the medical community. I look forward to \nworking with Senators Enzi, Kennedy, and Clinton, and my colleagues \nChairman Max Baucus and Ranking Minority Member Chuck Grassley on the \nFinance Committee to ensure that these important distinctions are made.\n  If we do not accomplish the task of integrating quality and health \ninformation technology standards between public and private programs, \nproviders will be placed in the impossible position of having one set \nof quality and information technology standards for publicly insured \npatients and other requirements for privately insured patients. If such \na Tower of Babel is allowed to develop, providers will simply not be \nable to implement the improvements in care that we all want to see \nthrough the use of health information technology. We cannot miss this \nchance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 1699. A bill to amend the provisions of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 regarding school library media \nspecialists, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am joined by Mr. Cochran in \nintroducing important legislation, the Strengthening Kids' Interest in \nLearning and Libraries, SKILLs, Act, to support our Nation's school \nlibraries and librarians. This legislation is also being introduced in \nthe House of Representatives by Representative Grijalva and \nRepresentative Ehlers.\n  The SKILLs Act enhances the value of school libraries by \nreauthorizing and strengthening the Improving Literacy through School \nLibraries program of the No Child Left Behind Act. The Department of \nEducation found that the Improving Literacy through School Libraries \nprogram is successful in improving the quality of school libraries \nreceiving grants and school libraries are a critical component in \nimproving student literacy skills and academic achievement by giving \nstudents access to up-to-date library materials, including well-\nequipped and technologically advanced school library media centers.\n  The SKILLs Act seeks to build on this success in several ways. It \nensures that funds serve elementary, middle, and high school students. \nIt encourages the hiring of highly qualified school library media \nspecialists in our Nation's\n\n[[Page S8417]]\n\nschool libraries. Additionally, it expands professional development to \ninclude information literacy instruction appropriate for all grade \nlevels, an assessment of student literacy needs, the coordination of \nreading and writing instruction across content areas, and training in \nliteracy strategies.\n  Today's librarians do so much more than catalogue collections and \ncheck out books, they are educators in every sense of the word.\n  They provide tech support, guidance, and social services to patrons \nin need. They help teach our children how to safely and effectively \nnavigate electronic media like the Internet and help instill a love of \nlearning and reading in young students. In short, school libraries and \nlibrarians play an essential role in helping students get the skills \nthey need to succeed in an increasingly competitive world and this \nlegislation provide the necessary support for that endeavor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1699\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Major energy producer.--The term ``major energy \n     producer'' means a country that--\n       (A) had crude oil, oil sands, or natural gas to liquids \n     production of 1,000,000 barrels per day or greater average in \n     the previous year;\n       (B) has crude oil, shale oil, or oil sands reserves of \n     6,000,000,000 barrels or greater, as recognized by the \n     Department of Energy;\n       (C) had natural gas production of 30,000,000,000 cubic \n     meters or greater in the previous year;\n       (D) has natural gas reserves of 1,250,000,000,000 cubic \n     meters or greater, as recognized by the Department of Energy; \n     or\n       (E) is a direct supplier of natural gas or liquefied \n     natural gas to the United States.\n       (2) Major energy consumer.--The term ``major energy \n     consumer'' means a country that--\n       (A) had an oil consumption average of 1,000,000 barrels per \n     day or greater in the previous year;\n       (B) had an oil consumption growth rate of 8 percent or \n     greater in the previous year;\n       (C) had a natural gas consumption of 30,000,000,000 cubic \n     meters or greater in the previous year; or\n       (D) had a natural gas consumption growth rate of 15 percent \n     or greater in the previous year.\n\n     SEC. 703. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENERGY DIPLOMACY AND SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is imperative to the national security and \n     prosperity of the United States to have reliable, affordable, \n     clean, sufficient, and sustainable sources of energy.\n       (2) United States dependence on oil imports causes \n     tremendous costs to the United States national security, \n     economy, foreign policy, military, and environmental \n     sustainability.\n       (3) Energy security is a priority for the governments of \n     many foreign countries and increasingly plays a central role \n     in the relations of the United States Government with foreign \n     governments. Global reserves of oil and natural gas are \n     concentrated in a small number of countries. Access to these \n     oil and natural gas supplies depends on the political will of \n     these producing states. Competition between governments for \n     access to oil and natural gas reserves can lead to economic, \n     political, and armed conflict. Oil exporting states have \n     received dramatically increased revenues due to high global \n     prices, enhancing the ability of some of these states to act \n     in a manner threatening to global stability.\n       (4) Efforts to combat poverty and protect the environment \n     are hindered by the continued predominance of oil and natural \n     gas in meeting global energy needs. Development of renewable \n     energy through sustainable practices will help lead to a \n     reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and enhance \n     international development.\n       (5) Cooperation on energy issues between the United States \n     Government and the governments of foreign countries is \n     critical for securing the strategic and economic interests of \n     the United States and of partner governments. In the current \n     global energy situation, the energy policies and activities \n     of the governments of foreign countries can have dramatic \n     impacts on United States energy security.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States national security requires that the \n     United States Government have an energy policy that pursues \n     the strategic goal of achieving energy security through \n     access to clean, affordable, sufficient, reliable, and \n     sustainable sources of energy;\n       (2) achieving energy security is a priority for United \n     States foreign policy and requires continued and enhanced \n     engagement with foreign governments and entities in a variety \n     of areas, including activities relating to the promotion of \n     alternative and renewable fuels, trade and investment in oil, \n     coal, and natural gas, energy efficiency, climate and \n     environmental protection, data transparency, advanced \n     scientific research, public-private partnerships, and energy \n     activities in international development;\n       (3) the President should ensure that the international \n     energy activities of the United States Government are given \n     clear focus to support the national security needs of the \n     United States, and to this end, there should be established a \n     mechanism to coordinate the implementation of United States \n     international energy policy among the Federal agencies \n     engaged in relevant agreements and activities; and\n       (4) the Secretary of State should ensure that energy \n     security is integrated into the core mission of the \n     Department of State, and to this end, there should be \n     established within the Office of the Secretary of State a \n     Coordinator for International Energy Affairs with \n     responsibility for--\n       (A) developing United States international energy policy in \n     coordination with the Department of Energy and other relevant \n     Federal agencies;\n       (B) working with appropriate United States Government \n     officials to develop and update analyses of the national \n     security implications of global energy developments;\n       (C) incorporating energy security priorities into the \n     activities of the Department;\n       (D) coordinating activities with relevant Federal agencies; \n     and\n       (E) coordinating energy security and other relevant \n     functions currently undertaken by offices within the Bureau \n     of Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs, the Bureau \n     of Democracy and Global Affairs, and other offices within the \n     Department of State.\n       (5) the Department of Energy should be designated as the \n     lead United States Government agency in charge of formulating \n     and coordinating the national energy security policy of the \n     United States, and in furtherance of these goals, there \n     should be established within the Department of Energy an \n     Assistant Secretary of Energy for Energy Security whose \n     responsibilities should include--\n       (A) directing the development of the national energy \n     security strategy of the United States;\n       (B) coordinating the national energy security policy of the \n     United States with the Department of Defense, the Department \n     of State, and the National Security Council, as appropriate, \n     to address the impact of, and integrate national security and \n     foreign policy on, the national energy security policy of the \n     United States;\n       (C) monitoring international and domestic energy \n     developments to gauge their impact on the national energy \n     security policy of the United States and implementing changes \n     in such policy as necessary to maintain the national security \n     and energy security of the United States;\n       (D) identifying foreign sources of energy critical to the \n     national energy security of the United States and developing \n     strategies in conjunction with the Department of State for \n     ensuring United States access to critical foreign energy \n     resources;\n       (E) developing strategies for reducing United States \n     dependence on foreign sources of energy, including demand \n     reduction, efficiency improvement, and development of \n     alternative and new sources of domestic energy; and\n       (F) developing strategies in conjunction with the \n     Department of State for working with major international \n     producers and consumers, including China, Russia, the \n     European Union, and Africa, to minimize politicization of \n     global energy resources while ensuring access through global \n     energy markets.\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\n     SEC. 704. STRATEGIC ENERGY PARTNERSHIPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) United States Government partnership with foreign \n     governments and entities, including partnership with the \n     private sector, for securing reliable and sustainable energy \n     is imperative to ensuring United States security and economic \n     interests, promoting international peace and security, \n     expanding international development, supporting democratic \n     reform, fostering economic growth, and safeguarding the \n     environment.\n       (2) Democracy and freedom should be promoted globally by \n     partnership with foreign governments, including in particular \n     governments of emerging democracies such as those of Ukraine \n     and Georgia, in their efforts to reduce their dependency on \n     oil and natural gas imports.\n       (3) The United States Government and the governments of \n     foreign countries have common needs for adequate, reliable, \n     affordable, clean, and sustainable energy in order to ensure \n     national security, economic growth, and high standards of \n     living in their countries. Cooperation by the United States \n     Government with foreign governments on meeting energy \n     security needs is mutually beneficial. United States \n     Government partnership with foreign governments should \n     include cooperation with major energy consuming countries, \n     major energy producing countries, and other governments \n     seeking to advance global energy security through reliable \n     and sustainable means.\n       (4) The United States Government participates in hundreds \n     of bilateral and multilateral energy agreements and \n     activities with foreign governments and entities. These \n     agreements and activities should reflect the strategic need \n     for energy security.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States--\n       (1) to advance global energy security through cooperation \n     with foreign governments and entities;\n       (2) to promote reliable, diverse, and sustainable sources \n     of all types of energy;\n       (3) to increase global availability of renewable and clean \n     sources of energy;\n       (4) to decrease global dependence on oil and natural gas \n     energy sources; and\n       (5) to engage in energy cooperation to strengthen strategic \n     partnerships that advance peace, security, and democratic \n     prosperity.\n       (c) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish and expand strategic energy partnerships with the \n     governments of major energy producers and major energy \n     consumers, and with governments of other countries (but \n     excluding any countries that are ineligible to receive United \n     States economic or military assistance).\n       (d) Purposes.--The purposes of the strategic energy \n     partnerships established pursuant to subsection (c) are--\n       (1) to strengthen global relationships to promote \n     international peace and security through fostering \n     cooperation in the energy sector on a mutually beneficial \n     basis in accordance with respective national energy policies;\n       (2) to promote the policy set forth in subsection (b), \n     including activities to advance--\n       (A) the mutual understanding of each country's energy \n     needs, priorities, and policies, including interparliamentary \n     understanding;\n       (B) measures to respond to acute energy supply disruptions, \n     particularly in regard to petroleum and natural gas \n     resources;\n       (C) long-term reliability and sustainability in energy \n     supply;\n       (D) the safeguarding and safe handling of nuclear fuel;\n       (E) human and environmental protection;\n       (F) renewable energy production;\n       (G) access to reliable and affordable energy for \n     underdeveloped areas, in particular energy access for the \n     poor;\n       (H) appropriate commercial cooperation;\n       (I) information reliability and transparency; and\n       (J) research and training collaboration;\n       (3) to advance the national security priority of developing \n     sustainable and clean energy sources, including through \n     research and development related to, and deployment of--\n       (A) renewable electrical energy sources, including biomass, \n     wind, and solar;\n       (B) renewable transportation fuels, including biofuels;\n       (C) clean coal technologies;\n       (D) carbon sequestration, including in conjunction with \n     power generation, agriculture, and forestry; and\n       (E) energy and fuel efficiency, including hybrids and plug-\n     in hybrids, flexible fuel, advanced composites, hydrogen, and \n     other transportation technologies; and\n       (4) to provide strategic focus for current and future \n     United States Government activities in energy cooperation to \n     meet the global need for energy security.\n       (e) Determination of Agendas.--In general, the specific \n     agenda with respect to a particular strategic energy \n     partnership, and the Federal agencies designated to implement \n     related activities, shall be determined by the Secretary of \n     State and the Secretary of Energy.\n       (f) Use of Current Agreements To Establish Partnerships.--\n     Some or all of the purposes of the strategic energy \n     partnerships established under subsection (c) may be pursued \n     through existing bilateral or multilateral agreements and \n     activities.

INTERNATIONAL ENERGY CRISIS RESPONSE MECHANISMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cooperation between the United States Government and \n     governments of other countries during energy crises promotes \n     the national security of the United States.\n       (2) The participation of the United States in the \n     International Energy Program established under the Agreement \n     on an International Energy Program, done at Paris November \n     18, 1974 (27 UST 1685), including in the coordination of \n     national strategic petroleum reserves, is a national security \n     asset that--\n       (A) protects the consumers and the economy of the United \n     States in the event of a major disruption in petroleum \n     supply;\n       (B) maximizes the effectiveness of the United States \n     strategic petroleum reserve through cooperation in accessing \n     global reserves of various petroleum products;\n       (C) provides market reassurance in countries that are \n     members of the International Energy Program; and\n       (D) strengthens United States Government relationships with \n     members of the International Energy Program.\n       (3) The International Energy Agency projects that the \n     largest growth in demand for petroleum products, other than \n     demand from the United States, will come from China and \n     India, which are not members of the International Energy \n     Program. The Governments of China and India vigorously pursue \n     access to global oil reserves and are attempting to develop \n     national petroleum reserves. Participation of the Governments \n     of China and India in an international petroleum reserve \n     mechanism would promote global energy security, but such \n     participation should be conditional on the Governments of \n     China and India abiding by customary petroleum reserve \n     management practices.\n       (4) In the Western Hemisphere, only the United States and \n     Canada are members of the International Energy Program. The \n     vulnerability of most Western Hemisphere countries to supply \n     disruptions from political, natural, or terrorism causes may \n     introduce instability in the hemisphere and can be a source \n     of conflict, despite the existence of major oil reserves in \n     the hemisphere.\n       (5) Countries that are not members of the International \n     Energy Program and are unable to maintain their own national \n     strategic reserves are vulnerable to petroleum supply \n     disruption. Disruption in petroleum supply and spikes in \n     petroleum costs could devastate the economies of developing \n     countries and could cause internal or interstate conflict.\n       (6) The involvement of the United States Government in the \n     extension of international mechanisms to coordinate strategic \n     petroleum reserves and the extension of other emergency \n     preparedness measures should strengthen the current \n     International Energy Program.\n       (b) Energy Crisis Response Mechanisms With India and \n     China.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish a petroleum crisis response mechanism or mechanisms \n     with the Governments of China and India.\n       (2) Scope.--The mechanism or mechanisms established under \n     paragraph (1) should include--\n       (A) technical assistance in the development and management \n     of national strategic petroleum reserves;\n       (B) agreements for coordinating drawdowns of strategic \n     petroleum reserves with the United States, conditional upon \n     reserve holdings and management conditions established by the \n     Secretary of Energy;\n       (C) emergency demand restraint measures;\n       (D) fuel switching preparedness and alternative fuel \n     production capacity; and\n       (E) ongoing demand intensity reduction programs.\n       (3) Use of existing agreements to establish mechanism.--The \n     Secretary may, after consultation with Congress and in \n     accordance with existing international agreements, including \n     the International Energy Program, include China and India in \n     a petroleum crisis response mechanism through existing or new \n     agreements.\n       (c) Energy Crisis Response Mechanism for the Western \n     Hemisphere.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish a Western Hemisphere energy crisis response \n     mechanism.\n       (2) Scope.--The mechanism established under paragraph (1) \n     should include--\n       (A) an information sharing and coordinating mechanism in \n     case of energy supply emergencies;\n       (B) technical assistance in the development and management \n     of national strategic petroleum reserves within countries of \n     the Western Hemisphere;\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\n       (C) technical assistance in developing national programs to \n     meet the requirements of membership in a future international \n     energy application procedure as described in subsection (d);\n       (D) emergency demand restraint measures;\n       (E) energy switching preparedness and alternative energy \n     production capacity; and\n       (F) ongoing demand intensity reduction programs.\n       (3) Membership.--The Secretary should seek to include in \n     the Western Hemisphere energy crisis response mechanism \n     membership for each major energy producer and major energy \n     consumer in the Western Hemisphere and other members of the \n     Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum authorized under section \n     706.\n       (d) International Energy Program Application Procedure.--\n       (1) Authority.--The President should place on the agenda \n     for discussion at the Governing Board of the International \n     Energy Agency, as soon as practicable, the merits of \n     establishing an international energy program application \n     procedure.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of such procedure is to allow \n     countries that are not members of the International Energy \n     Program to apply to the Governing Board of the International \n     Energy Agency for allocation of petroleum reserve stocks in \n     times of emergency on a grant or loan basis. Such countries \n     should also receive technical assistance for, and be subject \n     to, conditions requiring development and management of \n     national programs for energy emergency preparedness, \n     including demand restraint, fuel switching preparedness, and \n     development of alternative fuels production capacity.\n       (e) Reports Required.--\n       (1) Petroleum reserves.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy \n     shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     report that evaluates the options for adapting the United \n     States national strategic petroleum reserve and the \n     international petroleum reserve coordinating mechanism in \n     order to carry out this section.\n       (2) Crisis response mechanisms.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     State, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     on the status of the establishment of the international \n     petroleum crisis response mechanisms described in subsections \n     (b) and (c). The report shall include recommendations of the \n     Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy for any \n     legislation necessary to establish or carry out such \n     mechanisms.\n       (3) Emergency application procedure.--Not later than 60 \n     days after a discussion by the Governing Board of the \n     International Energy Agency of the application procedure \n     described under subsection (d), the President should submit \n     to Congress a report that describes--\n       (A) the actions the United States Government has taken \n     pursuant to such subsection; and\n       (B) a summary of the debate on the matter before the \n     Governing Board of the International Energy Agency, including \n     any decision that has been reached by the Governing Board \n     with respect to the matter.\n\n     SEC. 706. HEMISPHERE ENERGY COOPERATION FORUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The engagement of the United States Government with \n     governments of countries in the Western Hemisphere is a \n     strategic priority for reducing the potential for tension \n     over energy resources, maintaining and expanding reliable \n     energy supplies, expanding use of renewable energy, and \n     reducing the detrimental effects of energy import dependence \n     within the hemisphere. Current energy dialogues should be \n     expanded and refocused as needed to meet this challenge.\n       (2) Countries of the Western Hemisphere can most \n     effectively meet their common needs for energy security and \n     sustainability through partnership and cooperation. \n     Cooperation between governments on energy issues will enhance \n     bilateral relationships among countries of the hemisphere. \n     The Western Hemisphere is rich in natural resources, \n     including biomass, oil, natural gas, coal, and has \n     significant opportunity for production of renewable hydro, \n     solar, wind, and other energies. Countries of the Western \n     Hemisphere can provide convenient and reliable markets for \n     trade in energy goods and services.\n       (3) Development of sustainable energy alternatives in the \n     countries of the Western Hemisphere can improve energy \n     security, balance of trade, and environmental quality and \n     provide markets for energy technology and agricultural \n     products. Brazil and the United States have led the world in \n     the production of ethanol, and deeper cooperation on biofuels \n     with other countries of the hemisphere would extend economic \n     and security benefits.\n       (4) Private sector partnership and investment in all \n     sources of energy is critical to providing energy security in \n     the Western Hemisphere.\n       (b) Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum.--\n       (1) Establishment.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Energy, should immediately seek to \n     establish a regional-based ministerial forum to be known as \n     the Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum.\n       (2) Purposes.--The Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum \n     should seek--\n       (A) to strengthen relationships between the United States \n     and other countries of the Western Hemisphere through \n     cooperation on energy issues;\n       (B) to enhance cooperation between major energy producers \n     and major energy consumers in the Western Hemisphere, \n     particularly among the governments of Brazil, Canada, Mexico, \n     the United States, and Venezuela;\n       (C) to ensure that energy contributes to the economic, \n     social, and environmental enhancement of the countries of the \n     Western Hemisphere;\n       (D) to provide an opportunity for open dialogue and joint \n     commitments between member governments and with private \n     industry; and\n       (E) to provide participating countries the flexibility \n     necessary to cooperatively address broad challenges posed to \n     the energy supply of the Western Hemisphere that are \n     practical in policy terms and politically acceptable.\n       (3) Activities.--The Hemisphere Energy Cooperation Forum \n     should implement the following activities:\n       (A) An Energy Crisis Initiative that will establish \n     measures to respond to temporary energy supply disruptions, \n     including through--\n       (i) strengthening sea-lane and infrastructure security;\n       (ii) implementing a real-time emergency information sharing \n     system;\n       (iii) encouraging members to have emergency mechanisms and \n     contingency plans in place; and\n       (iv) establishing a Western Hemisphere energy crisis \n     response mechanism as authorized under section 705(c).\n       (B) An Energy Sustainability Initiative to facilitate long-\n     term supply security through fostering reliable supply \n     sources of fuels, including development, deployment, and \n     commercialization of technologies for sustainable renewable \n     fuels within the region, including activities that--\n       (i) promote production and trade in sustainable energy, \n     including energy from biomass;\n       (ii) facilitate investment, trade, and technology \n     cooperation in energy infrastructure, petroleum products, \n     natural gas (including liquefied natural gas), energy \n     efficiency (including automotive efficiency), clean fossil \n     energy, renewable energy, and carbon sequestration;\n       (iii) promote regional infrastructure and market \n     integration;\n       (iv) develop effective and stable regulatory frameworks;\n       (v) develop renewable fuels standards and renewable \n     portfolio standards;\n       (vi) establish educational training and exchange programs \n     between member countries; and\n       (vii) identify and remove barriers to trade in technology, \n     services, and commodities.\n       (C) An Energy for Development Initiative to promote energy \n     access for underdeveloped areas through energy policy and \n     infrastructure development, including activities that--\n       (i) increase access to energy services for the poor;\n       (ii) improve energy sector market conditions;\n       (iii) promote rural development though biomass energy \n     production and use;\n       (iv) increase transparency of, and participation in, energy \n     infrastructure projects;\n       (v) promote development and deployment of technology for \n     clean and sustainable energy development, including biofuel \n     and clean coal technologies; and\n       (vi) facilitate use of carbon sequestration methods in \n     agriculture and forestry and linking greenhouse gas emissions \n     reduction programs to international carbon markets.\n       (c) Hemisphere Energy Industry Group.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Secretary of State, in coordination \n     with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, \n     should approach the governments of other countries in the \n     Western Hemisphere to seek cooperation in establishing a \n     Hemisphere Energy Industry Group, to be coordinated by the \n     United States Government, involving industry representatives \n     and government representatives from the Western Hemisphere.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of the forum should be to \n     increase public-private partnerships, foster private \n     investment, and enable countries of the Western Hemisphere to \n     devise energy agendas compatible with industry capacity and \n     cognizant of industry goals.\n       (3) Topics of dialogues.--Topics for the forum should \n     include--\n       (A) promotion of a secure investment climate;\n       (B) development and deployment of biofuels and other \n     alternative fuels and clean electrical production facilities, \n     including clean coal and carbon sequestration;\n       (C) development and deployment of energy efficient \n     technologies and practices, including in the industrial, \n     residential, and transportation sectors;\n       (D) investment in oil and natural gas production and \n     distribution;\n       (E) transparency of energy production and reserves data;\n       (F) research promotion;

and\n       (ii) to ensure prompt and equitable compensation in the \n     event of a nuclear incident;\n       (D) the Convention benefits United States nuclear suppliers \n     that face potentially unlimited liability for a nuclear \n     incidents outside the coverage of section 170 of the Atomic \n     Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) by replacing a \n     potentially open-ended liability with a predictable liability \n     regime that, in effect, provides nuclear suppliers with \n     insurance for damage arising out of such an incident;\n       (E) the Convention also benefits United States nuclear \n     facility operators that may be publicly liable for a Price-\n     Anderson incident by providing an additional early source for \n     a Price-Anderson incident by providing an additional early \n     source of funds to compensate damage arising out of the \n     Price-Anderson incident;\n       (F) the combined operation of the Convention, section 170 \n     of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210), and this \n     section will augment the quantity of assured funds available \n     for victims in a wider variety of nuclear incidents while \n     reducing the potential liability of United States suppliers \n     without increasing potential costs to United States \n     operators;\n       (G) the cost of those benefits is the obligation of the \n     United States to contribute to the supplementary compensation \n     fund established by the Convention;\n       (H) any such contribution should be funded in a manner that \n     neither upsets settled expectations based on the liability \n     regime established under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act \n     of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) nor shifts to Federal taxpayers \n     liability risks for nuclear incidents at foreign \n     installations;\n       (I) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, funds \n     already available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act \n     of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) should be used; and\n       (J) with respect to a nuclear incident outside the United \n     States not covered by section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of \n     1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210), a retrospective premium should be \n     prorated among nuclear suppliers relieved from potential \n     liability for which insurance is not available.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to allocate \n     the contingent costs associated with participation by the \n     United States in the international nuclear liability \n     compensation system established by the Convention on \n     Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna \n     on September 12, 1997--\n       (A) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, by using \n     funds made available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy \n     Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) to cover the contingent costs in \n     a manner that neither increases the burdens nor decreases the \n     benefits under section 170 of that Act; and\n       (B) with respect to a covered incident outside the United \n     States that is not a Price-Anderson incident, by allocating \n     the contingent costs equitably, on the basis of risk, among \n     the class of nuclear suppliers relieved by the Convention \n     from the risk of potential liability resulting from any \n     covered incident outside the United States.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission.\n       (2) Contingent cost.--The term ``contingent cost'' means \n     the cost to the United States in the event of a covered \n     incident the amount of which is equal to the amount of funds \n     the United States is obligated to make available under \n     paragraph 1(b) of Article III of the Convention.\n       (3) Convention.--The term ``Convention'' means the \n     Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, \n     done at Vienna on September 12, 1997.\n       (4) Covered incident.--The term ``covered incident'' means \n     a nuclear incident the occurrence of which results in a \n     request for funds pursuant to Article VII of the Convention.\n       (5) Covered installation.--The term ``covered \n     installation'' means a nuclear installation at which the \n     occurrence of a nuclear incident could result in a request \n     for funds under Article VII of the Convention.\n       (6) Covered person.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``covered person'' means--\n       (i) a United States person;

and Nelson Chamisa was badly injured by \n     suspected state agents at Harare airport on March 18, 2007, \n     when trying to board a plane for a meeting of European Union \n     and Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific Group of States lawmakers \n     in Brussels, Belgium;\n       Whereas Zimbabwe's foreign minister warned Western \n     diplomats that the Government of Zimbabwe would expel them if \n     they gave support to the opposition, and said Western \n     diplomats had gone too far by offering food and water to \n     jailed opposition activists;\n       Whereas victims of physical assault by the Government of \n     Zimbabwe have been denied emergency medical transfer to \n     hospitals in neighboring South Africa, where their wounds can \n     be properly treated;\n       Whereas those incarcerated by the Government of Zimbabwe \n     were denied access to legal representatives and lawyers \n     appearing at the jails to meet with detained clients were \n     themselves threatened and intimidated;\n       Whereas at the time of Zimbabwe's independence, President \n     Robert Mugabe was hailed as a liberator and Zimbabwe showed \n     bright prospects for democracy, economic development, \n     domestic reconciliation, and prosperity;\n       Whereas President Robert Mugabe and his ZANU-PF government \n     continue to turn away from the promises of liberation and use \n     state power to deny the people of Zimbabwe the freedom and \n     prosperity they fought for and deserve;\n       Whereas the staggering suffering brought about by the \n     misrule of Zimbabwe has created a large-scale humanitarian \n     crisis in which 3,500 people die each week from a combination \n     of disease, hunger, neglect, and despair;\n       Whereas the Chairman of the African Union, President Alpha \n     Oumar Konare, expressed ``great concern'' about Zimbabwe's \n     crisis and called for the need for the scrupulous respect for \n     human rights and democratic principles in Zimbabwe;\n       Whereas the Southern African Development Community (SADC) \n     Council of Non-governmental Organizations stated that ``We \n     believe that the crisis has reached a point where Zimbabweans \n     need to be strongly persuaded and directly assisted to find \n     an urgent solution to the crisis that affects the entire \n     region.'';\n       Whereas Zambian President, Levy Mwanawasa, has urged \n     southern Africa to take a new approach to Zimbabwe instead of \n     the failed ``quiet diplomacy'', which he likened to a \n     ``sinking Titanic,'' and stated that ``quiet diplomacy has \n     failed to help solve the political chaos and economic \n     meltdown in Zimbabwe'';\n       Whereas European Union and African, Caribbean, and Pacific \n     lawmakers strongly condemned the latest attack on an \n     opposition official in Zimbabwe and urged the government in \n     Harare to cooperate with the political opposition to restore \n     the rule of law; and\n       Whereas United States Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Christopher \n     Dell, warned that opposition to President Robert Mugabe had \n     reached a tipping point because the people no longer feared \n     the regime and believed they had nothing left to lose: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) the state-sponsored violence taking place in Zimbabwe \n     represents a serious violation of fundamental human rights \n     and the rule of law and should be condemned by all \n     responsible governments, civic organizations, religious \n     leaders, and international bodies; and\n       (B) the Government of Zimbabwe has not lived up to its \n     commitments as a signatory to the Constitutive Act of the \n     African Union and African Charter of Human and Peoples Rights \n     which enshrine commitment to human rights and good governance \n     as foundational principles of African states; and\n       (2) Congress--\n       (A) condemns the Government of Zimbabwe's violent \n     suppression of political and human rights through its police \n     force, security forces, and youth militia that deliberately \n     inflict gross physical harm, intimidation, and abuse on those \n     legitimately protesting the failing policies of the \n     government;\n       (B) holds those individual police, security force members, \n     and militia involved in abuse and torture responsible for the \n     acts that they have committed;\n       (C) condemns the harassment and intimidation of lawyers \n     attempting to carry out\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\n     their professional obligations to their clients and repeated \n     failure by police to comply promptly with court decisions;\n       (D) condemns the harassment of foreign officials, \n     journalists, human rights workers, and others, including \n     threatening their expulsion from the country if they continue \n     to provide food and water to victims detained in prison and \n     in police custody while in the hospital;\n       (E) commends United States Ambassador Christopher Dell and \n     other United States Government officials and foreign \n     officials for their support to political detainees and \n     victims of torture and abuse while in police custody or in \n     medical care centers and encourages them to continue \n     providing such support;\n       (F) calls on the Government of Zimbabwe to cease \n     immediately its violent campaign against fundamental human \n     rights, to respect the courts and members of the legal \n     profession, and to restore the rule of law while adhering to \n     the principles embodied in an accountable democracy, \n     including freedom of association and freedom of expression;\n       (G) calls on the Government of Zimbabwe to cease \n     illegitimate interference in travel abroad by its citizens, \n     especially for humanitarian purposes; and\n       (H) calls on the leaders of the Southern Africa Development \n     Community (SADC) and the African Union to consult urgently \n     with all Zimbabwe stakeholders to intervene with the \n     Government of Zimbabwe while applying appropriate pressures \n     to resolve the economic and political crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8520-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

The resolution, with its preamble, reads as \nfollows:\n\n                              S. Res. 225\n\n       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines are \n     extremely safe, effective, and potentially lifesaving when \n     used properly, but the abuse and recreational use of these \n     medicines can be extremely dangerous and produce serious side \n     effects;\n       Whereas 6,400,000 individuals who are age 12 or older \n     reported using prescription medicines non-medically in a \n     recently sampled month, and abuse of prescription medications \n     such as pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and \n     sedatives is second only to marijuana, the number 1 illegal \n     drug of abuse in the United States;\n       Whereas, recent studies indicate that 1 in 10 youth ages 12 \n     through 17, or 2,400,000 children, has intentionally abused \n     cough medicine to get high from its dextromethorphan \n     ingredient, and 1 in 5 young adults (4,500,000) has used \n     prescription medicines non-medically;\n       Whereas, according to research from the Partnership for a \n     Drug-Free America, more than \\1/3\\ of teens mistakenly \n     believe that taking prescription drugs, even if not \n     prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using street \n     drugs;\n       Whereas teens' and parents' lack of understanding of the \n     potential harms of these powerful medicines makes it more \n     critical than ever to raise public awareness about the \n     dangers of their misuse;\n       Whereas, when prescription drugs are misused, they are most \n     often obtained through friends and relatives, but are also \n     obtained through rogue Internet pharmacies;\n       Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives \n     teens access to websites that promote medicine misuse;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month promotes \n     the message that over-the-counter and prescription medicines \n     are to be taken only as labeled or prescribed, and when used \n     recreationally or in large doses can have serious and life-\n     threatening consequences;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month will \n     encourage parents to educate themselves about this problem \n     and talk to their teens about all types of substance abuse;\n       Whereas observance of National Medicine Abuse Awareness \n     Month should be encouraged at the national, State, and local \n     levels to increase awareness of the rising misuse of \n     medicines;\n       Whereas some groups, such as the Consumer Healthcare \n     Products Association and the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of \n     America, have taken important proactive steps like creating \n     educational toolkits, such as ``A Dose of Prevention: \n     Stopping Cough Medicine Abuse Before it Starts'', which \n     includes guides to educate parents, teachers, law enforcement \n     officials, doctors and healthcare professionals, and \n     retailers about the potential harms of cough and cold \n     medicines and over-the-counter drug abuse;\n       Whereas the nonprofit Partnership for a Drug-Free America \n     and its community alliance and affiliate partners have \n     undertaken a nationwide prevention campaign utilizing \n     research-based educational advertisements, public relations \n     and news media, and the Internet to inform parents about the \n     negative teen behavior of intentional abuse of medicines so \n     that parents are empowered to\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\n     effectively communicate the facts of this dangerous trend \n     with their teens and to take necessary steps to safeguard \n     prescription and over-the-counter medicines in their homes; \n     and\n       Whereas educating the public on the dangers of medicine \n     abuse and promoting prevention is a critical component of \n     what must be a multi-pronged effort to curb this disturbing \n     rise in over-the-counter and cough medicine misuse: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of August 2007 as ``National \n     Medicine Abuse Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and \n     activities to educate parents and youth of the potential \n     dangers associated with medicine abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8521-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL TEEN SAFE DRIVER MONTH\n\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 256\n\n       Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by \n     brain damage, typically resulting from a stroke;\n       Whereas, while aphasia is most often the result of stroke \n     or brain injury, it can also occur with other neurological \n     disorders, such as in the case of a brain tumor;\n       Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or \n     paralysis in their right leg and right arm, usually due to \n     damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls \n     language and movement on the right side of the body;\n       Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss or \n     reduction in ability to speak, comprehend, read, and write, \n     while intelligence remains intact;\n       Whereas stroke is the 3rd leading cause of death in the \n     United States, ranking behind heart disease and cancer;\n       Whereas stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term \n     disability in the United States;\n       Whereas there are about 5,000,000 stroke survivors in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas it is estimated that there are about 750,000 \n     strokes per year in the United States, with approximately \\1/\n     3\\ of these resulting in aphasia;\n       Whereas aphasia affects at least 1,000,000 people in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas more than 200,000 Americans acquire the disorder \n     each year;\n       Whereas the National Aphasia Association is unique and \n     provides communication strategies, support, and education for \n     people with aphasia and their caregivers throughout the \n     United States;\n       Whereas as an advocacy organization for people with aphasia \n     and their caregivers, the National Aphasia Association \n     envisions a world that recognizes this ``silent'' disability \n     and provides opportunity and fulfillment for those affected \n     by aphasia; and\n       Whereas National Aphasia Awareness Month is commemorated in \n     June 2007: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of, and encourages all \n     Americans to observe, National Aphasia Awareness Month in \n     June 2007;\n       (2) recognizes that strokes, a primary cause of aphasia, \n     are the third largest cause of death and disability in the \n     United States;\n       (3) acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and \n     study in order to find new solutions for serving individuals \n     experiencing aphasia and their caregivers; and\n       (4) must make the voices of those with aphasia heard \n     because they are often unable to communicate their condition \n     to others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/26/senate-section/article/S8521-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8521-S8522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.
