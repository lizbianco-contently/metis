Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have voted for cloture today because \nunless we end the Republican filibuster and act on this legislation, we \nwill continue to experience the record-high oil and gasoline prices \nthat are badly hurting millions of American consumers and businesses. \nWithout action on this legislation, these record-high prices will \ncontinue to reverberate throughout our economy. I have spoken at length \nin the last couple of days about the investigations conducted by my \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations and the importance of acting \nnow to address excessive energy speculation as a way of bringing down \nthe extraordinary high energy prices, which are not the result of \nordinary operation of supply and demand.\n  Today, I would like to speak more broadly on energy policy and the \nneed to decrease our dependence on oil. We need a long-term \ncomprehensive energy policy that will decrease our dependence on \nforeign oil and reduce our climate change emissions while at the same \ntime promote use of renewable energy sources and environmentally \nresponsible domestic production of conventional energy sources. We need \na balanced portfolio that includes energy from a broad array of \nsources--renewable technologies such as solar, wind, and biomass, as \nwell as more conventional sources such as coal and natural gas--and we \nneed to develop new and advanced technologies that will allow us to use \nthat energy in a clean and responsible fashion. I am a strong advocate \nof advanced technology and believe that the Federal Government must \nplay a key role in the development of that technology, both in \nproviding funds for development and in being an early adopter of \nadvanced technology. Equally important to the successful development of \nadvanced technologies are tax incentives for these technologies across \nthe energy spectrum--including energy efficiency\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\ntechnologies, renewable energy technologies, advanced clean coal \ntechnologies, advanced vehicle technologies, and development of clean \nand renewable low-carbon and carbon-free fuels.\n  The Congress has passed significant energy legislation three times in \nthe last 4 years. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included provisions \nthat increased the diversity of our Nation's fuel supply, encouraged \ninvestment in infrastructure and alternative energy technologies, \nincreased domestic energy production, improved the reliability of our \nNation's electricity supply, and improved energy efficiency and \nconservation. In 2006, Congress enacted legislation to increase the \nsupply of natural gas in the United States by opening up new areas of \nthe Gulf of Mexico to development. In 2007, Congress enacted the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act, which contained several measures to \nlower our dependence on oil and reduce our energy consumption, \nincluding an ambitious increase in fuel economy standard for cars and \nlight trucks, an increase in the renewable fuel standard, and \nsignificant new energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs and for a \nwide range of appliances. I supported all of these measures because \neach one moved us toward a sounder energy policy and greater energy \nsecurity and efficiency for the United States.\n  Far more must be done, however. I regret that we are unable to move \nforward with this legislation today because it offered us a vehicle not \nonly to address excessive energy speculation but also to address other \ncritical energy issues--such as development of advanced automotive \ntechnologies and advanced batteries, development of new wind and solar \nenergy technologies, assured funding for home energy assistance under \nthe Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and diligent development \nof areas on Federal land that are already open for oil and gas leasing. \nThese are all issues that were addressed by Senator Bingaman's \namendment, which we will not have an opportunity to consider because of \nthe Republican filibuster.\n  Senator Bingaman's amendment will take significant strides toward \ndevelopment of the advanced automotive technologies that are needed to \nmeet new fuel economy standards and to reduce our oil consumption and \ngreenhouse gas emissions. We need strong Federal efforts to make \nrevolutionary breakthroughs in automotive technology, and we need to \ninvest in leap-ahead technologies such as advanced batteries and plug-\nin hybrid vehicles that will reduce our dependence on oil, reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and reduce what we pay for fuel at the pump. \nTwo provisions of Senator Bingaman's bill would have taken important \nsteps in this regard--first, by providing funding for direct loans \nauthorized in 2007 for retooling of manufacturing facilities to produce \nthese new technologies; and second, by requiring a new interagency \nFederal effort to develop advanced battery technologies. I believe it \nis critical that this Congress support Federal assistance for retooling \nof our existing manufacturing facilities and Federal assistance for \ndevelopment of the advanced battery technologies that will be required \nto support plug-in hybrids and other advanced vehicle technologies. \nWithout this support, our companies will simply not be able to compete \nwith their global competitors who benefit from significant support from \ntheir governments and we will not be able to reach the goals for \nreducing our dependence on oil that we all share. I applaud Senator \nBingaman's efforts to put these issues before the Senate. Indeed, we \nhave similar advanced battery provisions in the Defense authorization, \nwhich we approved in the Armed Services Committee many months ago and \nwhich awaits Senate consideration.\n  Finally, I would like to address the importance of Congress acting \nthis year to extend existing tax credits for renewable production of \nelectricity and for energy efficiency technologies. Renewable \ntechnologies such as wind and solar are becoming more economical every \nyear, and our manufacturing sector can play a major role in the \nproduction of these technologies. Extension of the tax credits that \nwill expire this year, or in some cases have already expired, is \ncritical to the development of these technologies and critical to our \ndevelopers' and manufacturers' ability to commit to projects that will \nutilize these technologies. Also included in the so-called tax \nextenders package is an extension of the tax credit for alternative \nfuel pumps and establishment of a new tax credit for plug-in hybrid and \nall-electric vehicles. These tax incentives are key not only to the \ndevelopment of these technologies but also to consumer acceptance of \nthese vehicles. We have been unable, so far, to pass these critical tax \nprovisions because the Republicans in the Senate continue to filibuster \nthe bill. I hope that we will overcome that filibuster and extend these \nprovisions.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it so ordered.\n\n\n                   Master Sergeant Mitchell W. Young\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, we celebrated the Fourth of \nJuly. Nine days after that, on July 13, 2008, MSG Mitchell Young, 39 \nyears old, of Jonesboro, GA, was killed in action while conducting \ncombat reconnaissance patrol to the eastern Helmand Province of \nAfghanistan.\n  Master Sergeant Young was attached to Company B, 1st Battalion, 7th \nSpecial Forces Group (Airborne) at Fort Bragg, in my State of North \nCarolina, where he lived with his wife, Robyn. It was Sergeant Young's \nfourth deployment in the global war on terror.\n  His awards and decorations include four Bronze Star Medals, a \nMeritorious Service Medal, a Joint Service Commendation Medal, and \nthree Army Commendation Medals. Today, Sergeant Young's memorial \nservice is being held at Fort Bragg.\n  A little over a year before his death, Master Sergeant Young posted a \nletter that was published in the July 4, 2007, edition of his hometown \nnewspaper, the Clayton News Daily, in which he celebrated the spirit \nand sacrifices of the American soldier.\n  I would now like to read the text of that letter:\n\n       To the editors:\n       Today is July 4th, our country's Independence Day, and 231 \n     years ago, our forefathers won this for all to enjoy. Today, \n     our country has more freedoms and wealth than any other in \n     the world. We have all of our freedoms granted to us by the \n     U.S. Constitution. This document sets the standards for all \n     Americans to be guaranteed their freedoms and rights.\n       Of all the freedoms and rights granted to each American, it \n     is not the news reporter or politician who ensures that each \n     American enjoys these rights, but it is the American Service \n     Member (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard). \n     This is the person who every American should be thanking \n     every day for what they do.\n       Even though less than 1 percent of the American population \n     serves in the military, it is that sacrifice made by an \n     individual to help protect and guarantee these freedoms. \n     While enjoying the day's festivals celebrating our country's \n     birth, take the time and effort to thank a veteran, or a \n     current service member for their sacrifice in helping to \n     protect your freedom.\n       If you are unable to thank a vet, say thanks to either the \n     parents or the spouse of a vet, because they are the ones who \n     worry the most while the service member is away, protecting \n     your freedoms.\n\n  Today, we thank God for the life of MSG Mitchell W. Young.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from North Carolina \nfor sharing with us those very memorable words from a brave American \nwho gave the ultimate sacrifice. His words and his example ought to be \nsomething we keep in our hearts and our minds every day. I thank my \ncolleague for saying it.\n  I wish to talk about a crisis--a crisis we are going to have to \naddress in the coming week on this floor. The gas prices are a crisis; \n$4 and up gasoline prices are hurting Americans.\n  In my State of Missouri--and I trust in every State in the Union--\nfamilies, farmers, truckers, and small businesses are suffering record \npain at the pump. We deserve real action now to get prices down.\n  Fundamentally, it is a problem of not enough supply to meet the \ndemand. It is economics 101. We need to find more oil and use less.\n  My amendments and the measures I support will bring Missouri and \nAmerica the new oil supplies and conservation we need to bring those \nprices down, to get the supply we need.\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\n  Instead, the Democratic leadership in this body is desperate to deny \nthe people of America the relief they need.\n  One amendment I have, No. 5122, would lower gas prices through \nopening opportunities to explore for oil supplies in the United States \noffshore, the off-coastal drilling area, 50 miles out.\n  The amendment to the bill currently on the Senate floor--and I plan \nto stay until I can offer it--would open a potential for 18 billion \nbarrels of oil, a 10-year supply currently off-limits off America's \nshores.\n  The bill would give States the choice to opt into production at least \n50 miles off their coasts and share lease proceeds with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership is currently blocking this \namendment and the gas price relief it would bring to all Americans.\n  I am cosponsoring another amendment with my colleagues to open oil \nproduction in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. There are almost 3 billion \nbarrels of oil in the eastern gulf waiting to help bring prices down \nfor Missouri and America. The Democratic leadership is currently \nblocking consideration of this amendment as well.\n  Not only do we need to produce more, but we need to use less. So I \nhave an amendment, No. 5123, to help America use less oil. It would \naggressively promote advanced vehicle batteries for plug-in hybrid and \nelectric vehicles. That way, you could avoid using gas--or at least \navoid a lot of gas usage. This amendment, when we pass it, will drive \ndown the price of advanced vehicle batteries for hybrid and plug-in \nvehicles.\n  My amendment will provide significant new funding for hybrid battery \nresearch and development, manufacturing equipment and capabilities, and \nreequipping and expanding or establishing U.S. domestic manufacturing \nfacilities for hybrid vehicle batteries.\n  U.S. domestic mass production of hybrid batteries would get their \nprices down and get the price of hybrid vehicles down.\n  Right now, we depend largely on supplies from Asia, and there is not \nenough supply to meet the demand. We need these batteries to conserve \noil, give jobs to blue-collar manufacturing workers, and help the \nenvironment. But the Democratic leadership is blocking consideration of \nthis amendment.\n  There is a bill before us to address abusive speculation. I agree we \nshould deal with the areas of speculation that are abusive. We need to \ncover the over-the-counter market. Fundamentally, it is a problem of \ntoo little supply to meet demand. Exports know this. The American \npeople are smart enough to know this.\n  I don't understand why the Democratic Party continues to block our \nresponsible efforts to get gas prices down through new oil production. \nThe American people deserve better. The people of Missouri deserve \nbetter. I think they know better.\n  We have to get gas prices down. We need to open offshore supplies, \nand we need to provide ways of using less. I believe the people of our \ncountry need and deserve no less.\n\n\n                                housing\n\n  Mr. President, I voted against cloture on the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act, which we concluded.\n  I commend Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby for working long and hard \nto address the housing crisis, the need to reform regulatory oversight \nof the mortgage government-sponsored enterprises, and to modernize the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's FHA. The bill also \nincludes emergency authorities for the Government to shore up Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac. I support the Government's involvement in helping \nstruggling responsible homeowners. In fact, I support many key \nprovisions of the legislation, such as a stronger regulator of the \nGSEs, additional housing counseling funding, increased bond authority \nfor State housing finance agencies to refinance troubled loans, \nelimination of seller-financed downpayment programs, and improved \ndisclosure and transparency in the home-buying process. That was in the \nbill I introduced on the floor--the bill that left the floor and went \nto the House. Unfortunately, I cannot support--and I urge my colleagues \nnot to support--H.R. 3221 because it is a major bailout for subprime \nlenders and potentially a budget buster for the taxpayers of America.\n  I am strongly opposed to the proposed expansion of FHA with a new \nprogram called the HOPE for Homeowners loan program.\n  As I explained during our last floor debate about the Senate's \nversion of the bill, the HOPE Program is fatally flawed since it \nprovides limited help to troubled homeowners, while allowing lenders to \ndump their worst subprime mortgages on an already stressed FHA. \nFurther, the program will result in HUD becoming a huge landlord of \nforeclosed properties, which we know is an extremely bad outcome for \ncommunities and other homeowners based on the Department's history of \nbeing unable to manage the real estate it owns.\n  The CBO estimates that under this program, ``mortgage holders would \nhave an incentive to direct their highest-risk loans to the program.'' \nThis means lenders who were, in a number of cases, either fraudulent or \nnegligent in their treatment of borrowers, will be able to clear out \nmany of the biggest problem loans. Not surprisingly, CBO estimates that \na cumulative default rate for the HOPE Program would be 35 percent--\nmeaning that one out of every three loans refinanced would fail. In \nother words, over 130,000 homeowners would still go into foreclosure, \nand FHA would be the inept administrator of those.\n  FHA is significantly limited in plan managing and implementing its \nloan activities, which have been documented by the HUD inspector \ngeneral and GAO for several years. Not too long ago, the entire \ndepartment was on the GAO's high-risk list.\n  Unfortunately, FHA's history of problems is going unheeded. I am \nfurther concerned that we are setting up this new program when FHA is \nplaying a growing role in assisting distressed homeowners. And to add \n400,000 of the worst new loans to FHA's portfolio would create a \nperfect storm for failure. We can do better.\n  We have characterized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as being too big to \nfail. I believe this 694-page bill has become too big to succeed.\n  We have to address the solvency of Fannie and Freddie, but it must be \ndone responsibly. We must address the GSEs' management and a new \nregulator with new personnel must ensure that the GSEs act consistently \nwith their mission and better manage risk. CBO's cost estimate of the \nGSE rescue plan reported that the ``riskiest loans, known as alt-A and \nsubprime mortgages, account for about 15 percent'' of the GSEs' \nportfolio. Not surprisingly, a significant portion of the subprime \nportfolio was likely originated by lenders such as Countrywide. \nAccording to Fannie Mae's annual report, filed with the SEC for the \nfiscal year ending December 31, last year, its top customer was \nCountrywide. The report states that Countrywide accounted for 28 \npercent of Fannie Mae's single-family business volume in 2007, which \nwas actually higher than its volume in 2006. No one can deny that \nholders of Countrywide paper will be the biggest beneficiaries of this \nbill. It will not be homeowners. They are not bailing out homeowners; \nthey are bailing out the banks that hold the Countrywide paper and the \nother financial institutions that hold them.\n  The legislative process was supposed to be a compromise, but this \ncompromise is unacceptable. Let me state for the record that I have \ngreat respect and confidence in our current Treasury Secretary. He has \nstated he would take care to protect the American people, and I believe \nin the months he has left in that office he will do so. But this GSE \nrescue authorization will continue for a full year after he \nleaves. This is a huge gamble we are taking, and this compromise does \nnot address that issue. It provides too little benefit to struggling \nhomeowners, too much benefit to the subprime lenders, such as those who \nhold Countrywide paper--who contributed to the housing crisis--and it \nprovides too much risk to the American taxpayer.\n\n  I cannot support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                         Amendments to S. 3268\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my colleague from Missouri has just spoken \nvery clearly about a fundamental problem facing the American consumer \nand\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\nthe American family, and he has used the word ``crisis.'' I totally \nagree with him that $4-a-gallon gas or more at the pump today is truly \na crisis for the American family and for the budget of every American \nhousehold.\n  He joined with me in cosponsoring an amendment, and he spoke of that \namendment a few moments ago that we would like to offer to the bill the \nmajority leader, the Democratic leader, has brought to the floor, S. \n3268, a bill to allow drilling in this area of the gulf where we know \nthere is substantial oil potential. The Senator from Missouri spoke of \nsome 3 billion barrels, or somewhere near that, available in this \nyellow zone off the coast of Florida and down from the coasts of \nAlabama and Mississippi and Louisiana.\n  It is critical that the American oil industry be allowed to lease \nthat land and begin development and exploration. Why? Not only do we \nbelieve the oil is there, but it is immediately adjacent to pipelines, \nrefineries, and the facilities that will immediately process that oil \nand put it into the American distribution system.\n  Many are saying: Well, it is going to take 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, \nor 8 years if we drill now in the Outer Continental Shelf. It will take \nsome time. But in this area, it will take potentially a great deal less \ntime because we know the oil is there and it is immediately adjacent to \nthe distribution system of this country and the refinery capacity in \nthe Gulf States.\n  The American consumer today goes to the pump and pays $4, $4.10, \n$4.15, nearly $5 in some States and asks the question: Why? Here is \nwhat has happened in the American oil supply system that answers that \nquestion.\n  Starting in 1950, as the rate of use of oil in our country grew, we \nbegan a slow but very aggressive spread between our supply and the \ndemand. As you will notice here, starting in the 1990s, we actually \nbegin to supply less of our own oil into the market and we begin to buy \nmore and more oil from foreign countries.\n  This debate today is about a supply-and-demand issue. Yes, there \ncould be--pointed out yesterday by our Federal Trade Commission--a \nsmall amount of speculation in the market, and we ought to address it. \nBut the reason there is so much activity in the market is the equation \nright here--the dramatic difference between what supply is entering the \nmarket and the demand from use, world use, in the market.\n  It really is that fundamental a problem. When we are using more than \nwe are producing in the world market--and it is a world commodity--\nthen, of course, prices begin to escalate, as they have dramatically \nover the last several years and now in the last year even more so.\n  Why are we saying to the rest of the world: Drill your oil; we don't \nwant to drill ours. Produce from your oilfields; we are going to keep \nours off limits. I don't understand and I don't think the average \nconsumer in any way understands that kind of an argument. Yet, for the \nlast 15 years, that has been largely the public policy of this \ncountry--to put off limits known oil reserves while we ask the rest of \nthe world to supply for us.\n  This is a larger picture of exactly what we are talking about. We are \nproducing oil in this area of the gulf now. Our largest domestic volume \nof oil is coming from that area. But look at this area here, almost \nequivalent in size and potentially as rich in oil, and yet it is off \nlimits. It is politically off limits. We can go there and we can \nexplore and we can develop it if we have the political will to say yes \nto it. And the amendment I am offering--or I would like to offer to the \nbill that is on the floor--would allow us to do that and create a 50-\nmile safe zone for the citizens of Florida. But we are not given that \nopportunity. That is really the fundamental issue at hand.\n  The bill that we refuse to let go any further until we get the \nopportunity to offer amendments is this bill, S. 3268. As I said \nyesterday, look, not one drop of oil in it, not one drop of oil to \nsatisfy the supply side of a very aggressive, demanding market. The \nonly way we are truly going to bring prices down at the pump is to send \na very clear message to the marketplace that we are going to allow a \ngreater volume of supply to enter that market. While we are doing that, \nover the next 5 to 10 years, we are going to make every effort, through \nloan guarantees, through new types of technology, to reduce the demand \nside of our market. That is what we ought to be about here as we shape \npublic policy for our future--to assure that we have the abundant \nsupplies we need, while we recognize that it is a finite item and that \nthere will be a day when there will be substantially less oil out there \nthan there currently is and that we ought to be going toward the new \ntechnologies--the electric cars, the plug-ins, the hybrid, and all \ndifferent kinds and versions of that.\n\n  I am one of those who now believe we ought to be looking at every \npossible source of energy for the energy supply of our country. But we \nshouldn't be openly denying known supplies today, and that is exactly \nwhat is happening here on the floor of the Senate. For the last 2 days, \nor nearly 3 days now, the leader has simply refused to allow the \nprocess to go forward, to allow my amendment and other amendments by my \ncolleagues that would ensure a public policy allowing us to go into \nthis area and develop it and to go into other areas we have taken off \nlimits for political purposes only and put them within our limits \nagain. Our technology is there. The technology we have for the deep \nwater of the gulf is truly the finest in the world, it is the safest, \nand it is environmentally by far the soundest of any other country in \nthe world. Yet we deny ourselves the right to use our own technology to \nsupply our own energy to the American household.\n  No, I suspect the average person listening can't quite figure out \nwhat is going on here on the floor of the Senate, and it is really a \nfundamentally simple argument: The Democratic leader will not allow \nthis country to produce in the areas where we have known oil reserves \nthat we can get to the quickest and that we can bring online the \nfastest. I hope the phones start ringing as Americans grow angry with a \npolitician who denies them the supply to the marketplace that would \nbring down the price of oil at the pump. S. 3268 is the vehicle with \nwhich we could do that if we were allowed to amend it, if we were \nallowed the normal process of the Senate.\n  Republicans unanimously said today that we ought to have the right to \namend it, that we ought to stay here all next week working on it, until \nwe can say to the American people that the energy crisis isn't over, \nbut we have done everything within our power to bring down the price \nand lessen the burden on the family budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know Senate procedure can be confusing, \nbut by the vote that was just held, we have said we are not leaving, we \nare not giving up, and we intend to fight to help bring down the price \nof gasoline at the pump.\n  People may ask: How in the world can Congress do that? Well, the \nreality is, Congress has been the problem when it comes to accessing \nthe American sources of oil we have right here at home. The consequence \nhas been that we send $700 billion a year to foreign countries for the \noil we consume here in America because we are so unwise and so stubborn \nand so opposed, for some reason, to developing those natural resources \nright here in America.\n  That is what this vote meant, that we are not going to quit and we \nare going to stay on this issue until we can convince the people \nresponsible for setting the agenda here in the Senate to provide us an \nopportunity to vote on additional supply as we consider a comprehensive \napproach which includes conservation, renewable fuels, and clean energy \nalternatives. The fact is, we know we are not going to be able to deal \nwith the high price of gasoline at the pump until we increase American \nsupply--until we find more and we use less right here at home.\n  It is important to talk about responsibility. None of us here in the \nSenate can control what the majority leader, the Democratic leader of \nhis caucus, does. Only he has the power to allow a full debate and an \namendment process that will allow Democrats and Republicans a vote on \nadditional supply.\n  I know Congress is held in low esteem. All you have to do is look at \na public opinion poll. But it is important for the American people to \nknow that\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\nit is not necessarily Congress as a whole. It is the leadership that \nactually has the power and the authority to allow something to happen.\n  We are here imploring the majority leader, the leader of the \nDemocratic caucus, to allow us a vote on provisions in this bill which \nwe believe will have a dramatic impact on the price of gasoline at the \npump.\n  Right now, we have, in effect, a moratorium on 85 percent of the \ndomestic natural resources here in America, whether it is the submerged \nlands in the Outer Continental Shelf along the coastlines or the oil \nshale out West or the oil up in the Arctic. We not only have a \nmoratorium, or a ban passed by Congress for the last 30 years \nprohibiting the production of those natural resources, but we have a \npolitical blockade. And the people who have imposed that political \nblockade are the Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, Speaker  Nancy \nPelosi, and the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party for \nPresident, Barack Obama. They have the power to allow an opportunity \nfor the American people to get some relief at the pump, but they are \nthe ones who are blocking it through this political blockade.\n  We know there are at least 44 Republicans who agreed to a bill we \ncall the Gas Price Reduction Act. We are looking for about 10 or 11 or \n12 Democrats to join us in saying: Yes, we can, Because all we hear on \nthe other side of the aisle is no, we can't.\n\n  Yes, we can. We can tear down these walls that prohibit domestic \nenergy production here in America and I hope Barack Obama, if he thinks \nit is important enough to go to Berlin yesterday and talk about tearing \ndown walls, will come back here to the Senate and say let's tear down \nthis wall. If he does so, and the Democratic leadership follows suit, \nwe can open up America's vast national resources to production. We can \nacknowledge the existence of the laws of supply and demand, and the \nAmerican people will get the relief they want and so desperately need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority controls the next 30 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                        Aggressive Drug Pricing\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with outrage \nover what some of the pharmaceutical companies have been doing with \npricing for important medications affecting the lives of people in this \ncountry. I know that you, the Presiding Officer from the State of Rhode \nIsland, have been a leader in this health care area and share many of \nthe concerns I have and in fact are working on this issue as well.\n  Yesterday I chaired a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee to \ndiscuss the phenomenon of dramatic price increases of these \nmedications. These are drugs that, because of aggressive pricing \npractices, have seen dramatic increases in cost. Oftentimes because of \na limited market or other factors, the drug's price goes up to an \nastronomical level.\n  I first became aware of this issue when I received word from \nChildren's Hospital in Minneapolis, one of the leading children's \nhospitals in the country, that the price for a drug called Indocin--it \nis also known as indomethacin--has increased substantially. It is a \nmedication used to treat little babies with patent ductus arteriosis, \nPDA, and it is a disorder that prevents holes from healing in the \nhearts of premature infants. This drug has been around since the 1970s \nand it is the commonly used method of treating this condition. It is a \ngreat drug because it allows doctors to prescribe medication instead of \nresorting to surgery.\n  We had an event in Minnesota a few months ago with the head of \nChildren's Hospital and a number of doctors who are specialists in this \narea and a family named the Bensons, whose little child survived \nbecause of the help of this drug. To see this little baby and then to \nthink of what this drug company had done when they jacked up the price \nof this drug--you cannot even imagine why they would have done such a \nthing. I will go into the facts.\n  This drug has been around since the 1970s. Merck had the drug, this \ndrug called Indocin. Two years ago Ovation Pharmaceuticals acquired the \nrights to the drug from Merck. The company quickly increased the price \nby more than 18 times--from $100 a dose to $1,800 a dose. Was there \nresearch? No. Were there more changes to the drug? No. It was the very \nsame drug and they increased the price, because they could, from $100 \nto $1,800 a dose, for three 1-milligram units of the drug.\n  Even though it is an American company, and this is what gets \noutrageous--even though it is an American company, the price Ovation \ncharges for this lifesaving drug for babies is now 44 times higher in \nthe United States than what they sell it for in Canada. It is 44 times \nhigher in the United States than they sell the same drug for in Canada. \nNothing can justify this kind of price disparity except that this \ncompany wants to bring in more money to their coffers.\n  As it happens, there is only one other drug approved by the FDA for \nthis heart problem, a formulation of intravenous ibuprofen. Ovation, \ninterestingly enough, the same company that bought the drug from Merck \nwhen the drug was selling at $100 and now it's up to $1,800, is the \nsole source of the other drug in the United States. Not surprisingly, \nthe price it charges for this medicine is nearly identical to what it \ncharges for Indocin.\n  A number of other Ovation products have seen similar drastic price \nincreases, drugs that, like Indocin, have been around for a long time \nand are the premier treatments for a number of diseases.\n  In a recent article in the medical journal Pediatrics, Dr. Alan H. \nJobe of Cincinnati Childrens' Hospital, described Ovation's pricing of \nits two drugs for the premature babies' heart condition as ``quite \nextraordinary.'' He didn't mean extraordinary in a good way. He wrote:\n\n       Words such as ``unconscionable,'' ``unethical,'' and \n     ``socially irresponsible'' come to mind.\n\n  The issue we have is that an upstart company purchases a number of \ndrugs from another company and, even though these drugs have been on \nthe market for years, the upstart company increases the prices \ndrastically.\n  But Ovation is not the only company engaged in this disturbing trend. \nLook at this chart. It shows why this is a timely issue as we approach \nthe major health care debate we are going to be going into next year. \nLook at why this is such a timely issue. These are what we call, using \nthe doctor's language, extraordinary price increases.\n  What this chart shows is they are becoming more and more common. What \nthis measures is the number of branded drug products whose prices have \nmore than doubled in a single price increase. We are used to going to \nthe drugstore, sadly, these days, and seeing a 1-percent increase or 5 \npercent increases going up. Then we see other markets, such as the oil \nmarket, where things are completely volatile. Here you have it in the \ndrug market. Look at these drug products where the prices have more \nthan doubled in one single price increase. Back in 1988 it only \nhappened five times. Back in 1994 it happened zero times. Then you see \nthis gradual trend up where to we are now, in the year 2008: It has \nhappened 64 times. This is a full-year projection, based on 6 months of \ndata. This is a projection of 64 times. Then, in 2007 you see it was at \n47 times.\n  Questcor Pharmaceuticals--this is an example--was once losing money \nat the rate of $1 million a month. The company's fortunes turned around \nafter they purchased HP Acthar from Aventis. This drug was approved in \nthe 1970s, similar situation, a drug approved years and years ago to \ntreat multiple sclerosis, but it is now primarily the gold standard for \ntreating infantile spasms, a disorder that affects about 2000 families \nin the United States.\n  We were privileged to have one of the families from Rhode Island, the \nhome of the Presiding Officer, there with us at the hearing. Danielle \nFoltz was the mother who testified--I will never forget her story about \nhow her little baby is sick in the hospital, suddenly having spasms. \nThese could actually have affected his brain. His name is Trevor. He is \nin the hospital and she tries to get the drug that helps with this, \nthis Acthar. She found out it is about $1,700 per vial at the initial \nstages. That is what they thought it was going to be. Then what \nhappens? Once it was sold to Questcor, when her little baby needed\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\nthis drug, the price of the drug skyrocketed to $23,000 per vial--that \nis a 14-fold increase. This mom and dad are in the hospital with their \nlittle baby Trevor and this drug has gone up to $23,000 per vial. What \ndo you think is going to happen? Do you think the insurance company, \nwhen they used to pay for it when it was $1,700, was going to say: Oh, \nno problem. They had to negotiate for 5 days with the insurance \ncompanies, they had to get their neurologist involved, and she had to \nwrite a letter saying that this is going to affect this baby's life, \nthe baby could be mentally retarded if he doesn't get the drug. It is \nactually a short-term treatment. I think the baby had the drug for a \nmatter of months and then went off the drug--talk about short-sighted. \nEventually, after 5 days, she was able to get the drug approved.\n\n  These people were missionaries in Africa. They had worked in Africa. \nThey didn't have the money, they didn't have the house to mortgage, but \nthey were able to save their little baby's life because finally they \nfought hard enough to get it covered.\n  From the data we heard yesterday we are hitting only the tip of the \niceberg because the problem is not isolated to drugs that benefit a \nsmall number of patients. Abbott Pharmaceuticals increased the price of \nNorvir, a drug used to treat AIDS. The drug was often used as an \ningredient in their drug therapies. In 2003, Abbott jacked up the price \nfor Norvir by 500 percent. This was done at the same time they began \nmarketing their new product, Kaletra, another AIDS product that \nincluded Norvir, and served as a replacement for the competition's drug \ntherapy. The result forced patients and providers to turn to Abbott's \nKaletra instead of the formerly cost-effective alternative that used \nNorvir and competitors' drugs. Previously undisclosed documents and e-\nmails reviewed by the Wall Street Journal in 2007 show that Abbott's \nleadership actively considered ways to promote Kaletra over Norvir.\n  As you can see from this bar graph of the price increase of Norvir, \nyou see before the change was made, $257.18 and then up to $1,285.89. \nThis is an egregious increase.\n  Another example. The next chart shows only a few examples of enormous \nprice increases that we have seen. Mustargen, which is used to treat \nrare cancers, had a 1,000-percent increase. You see Cosmegen, which \ntreats kidney disease--that had a 3,500-percent increase. You can see \nthe names of the companies here: Abbott, Questcor, Ovation, Sigma-Tau. \nYou can see what the prices were before. Here is Cosmegen, $16.79. It \ngoes up after the sale to $593.75, a 3,436-percent increase in the drug \nprice.\n  Look at what we have seen with Matulane. Matulane goes nearly off the \ncharts. Look at this. This is used to treat rare Hodgkin's lymphoma and \nyou see an increase of 7,999 percent. That is an 8,00-percent increase. \nWhat is this?\n  I am not an economist. To me this looks like simple price gouging. It \nnot only hurts the hospitals that have to purchase these expensive \ndrugs, but also the patients who rely on them.\n  An elderly woman from Park Rapids, MN, who suffers from cutaneous T-\ncell lymphoma was forced to pay over $8,000 in out-of-pocket expenses \nfor Mustargen, the drug I discussed which was sold by Ovation, whose \nsingle dose price increased from around $50 to nearly $550 after the \ncompany acquired the rights to the drug.\n  What is the solution? In America, we have a serious problem with \nhealth care inflation and runaway costs. That is not a surprise to \nanyone. It is no wonder, when we have pharmaceutical companies such as \nOvation or Questcor increasing prices to astronomical price levels \nbecause of the lack of competition in the market. Their actions are \nable to exploit an extremely vulnerable and captive market. It is not \nas though the pharmaceutical industry is withering on the vine. You can \nsee pharmaceutical companies earn higher profits than other Fortune 500 \ncompanies. Here you have the profits for other Fortune 500 companies. \nThese are huge companies. Then you look at pharmaceutical profits. What \nhave we seen over time? They are always significantly ahead of other \nFortune 500 companies.\n  I want to mention the Orphan Drug Act because this is timely for what \nwe are talking about, the treatment of these rare diseases. The Orphan \nDrug Act was passed in 1983 to provide incentives to drug companies to \ndevelop innovative drugs for rare diseases because, without incentives, \ndrug companies may never be able to recoup research and development \ncosts in niche markets. What we have seen, however, is that at least a \nhandful of drug companies have used the status of orphan drugs to keep \nincreasing costs well beyond the cost of research, development, and \nmanufacturing. These staggeringly high prices in turn threaten the \nfinancial security of middle-class families relying on these drugs.\n  Where generic drugs have helped lower the cost of many prescription \ndrugs on the market, generic competition is also less likely to occur \nfor orphan drugs. According to a study published in the RAND Journal of \nEconomics, the market size for a drug has to be about $32 million--that \nis 2007 dollars adjusted for inflation--to justify the entry of a \ngeneric into the market.\n  When we are talking about indomethacin to treat populations of only a \nfew thousand, there is often not enough of an incentive for the generic \ndrug to enter the market.\n  Beyond hospitals and patients, a dramatic, unforeseeable increase in \nprice for one of these drugs has a significant impact on the Federal \nGovernment--Medicare, Medicaid. Look at what is going on. I know \nRepresentative Waxman in the House held a hearing showing what is going \non with the pricing of these pharmaceuticals across the board.\n  I have asked the Federal Trade Commission to initiate an \ninvestigation into any potential anticompetitive conduct or \nconsequences arising out of Ovation's market actions and dominance in \nthe area of nonsurgical treatment for PDA.\n  We need to ensure that the FTC continues to conduct these crucial \ninvestigations to guarantee competition; keeping costs low for \nconsumers and encouraging innovation. That is one drug that is coming \nout of my State, the State of Minnesota, because some doctors had the \nforesight to see that this was outrageous and figured out that one \ncompany owned both of the drugs that were competing with each other. It \nis disturbing that our providers, hospitals, and patients are being \nblindsided by these exorbitant price increases. Our Federal Government \nshould be able to track these trends in pharmaceutical pricing. If we \nstart to monitor the data, there is more of a paper trail, giving us \nenhanced ability to do something about these companies' practices.\n  You know, I am a supporter of reimportation of drugs from Canada; I \nfavor negotiating under Medicare Part D to save our seniors some money. \nAll these things must be on the table as we approach health care reform \nin the next year.\n  When provided with the right information on drug prices, especially \nin smaller markets, doctors can be alerted of big price increases, \npotentially spurring generic alternatives to expensive drugs and giving \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid the tools and the information to \nbetter track pricing in this market. To start looking at this \ninformation, I am in the process of working with the GAO to look into \nthe issue of drug pricing and these enormous increases.\n  Finally, I intend to investigate whether the FDA can fast-track \napproval for generic drugs, that that would be just as safe and \neffective but much less expensive, creating competition in markets with \ndramatic price increases.\n  I understand we have a market-based economy. It is fine for companies \nto make money on the products they sell. They should. But when we are \ndealing with the well-being of sick patients, babies and the elderly \nand everyone in between, we know something is wrong.\n  These companies cannot be allowed to make money off the backs of \nlittle babies who have holes in their hearts. I hope yesterday's \nhearing was a starting point for addressing problems that accompany \nsuch enormous price increases, problems that have been plaguing our \ndoctors, our insurance companies, our Medicare and Medicaid Programs, \nand most importantly, our patients for far too long.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. I appreciate the opportunity to talk for a few minutes \nabout two subjects. First of all, the legislation, one of the two \npieces of legislation that came before us today dealing with \nspeculation in the oil markets, I wish to talk a little about that. And \nthen maybe a word or two, if time permits, on the housing legislation, \nwhich we have taken another step forward toward enacting.\n  On this chart, we see a couple of numbers mentioned. In a moment, I \nhope they will be clear why they are relevant to this discussion, with \nrespect to oil prices and the availability of oil.\n  The first number is 25 percent. We consume, as a nation today, this \nweek, this month, this year, roughly 25 percent of the oil that is \nconsumed on our planet, 25 percent. But we have, within this Nation, \nonshore and offshore, less than 5 percent of the world's oil reserves. \nWhen people wonder why are prices running up, this is one of the \nreasons.\n  When people say we ought to simply drill, whether it is in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge or on the Outer Continental Shelf, drilling is \npart of the answer, not necessarily in those places, but drilling is \npart of the answer.\n  But when you are consuming 25 percent of the world's oil every day, \nand we have less than 5 percent of the world's known oil reserves, \nthere is a mismatch here. That suggests to, among others, T. Boone \nPickens, a long-time renowned Texas oilman, that this is a problem we \ncannot drill ourselves out of.\n  While drilling is part of the solution, it is by no means the entire \nsolution. What we need is a comprehensive strategy. I wish to talk a \nlittle bit about that this morning.\n  We have had any number of hearings in recent weeks, actually in \nrecent months in the Senate, that focused on why are oil prices, why \nare gas prices going up. I keep coming back to three major reasons. The \nfirst of those is supply and demand. There is a limited amount of oil \nthat is being produced. The nations that have most of it in their \ncontrol do not want to produce a whole lot more. They do not want to \nincrease supply dramatically.\n  Demand meanwhile continues to rise. We are a country in love with our \ncars, trucks, and vans. For every 1,000 Americans in this country \ntoday, there are about 800 vehicles. Pretty amazing. There are 800 \nvehicles for every 1,000 people who live here.\n  Over in China, for every 1,000 people who live there, they have 16 \ncars, trucks, and vans. I do not know that they want to get to 800 \nright away, but they are going to have a lot more than 16 per 1,000. \nThey may have 116, 216, 316. But they want to buy and they want to be \nable to have their own vehicles. They are adding dramatically to the \nnumber of vehicles on the road.\n  That, along with the growth in the economy and other aspects of the \neconomy in China, places such as India, we have seen a dramatic \nincrease in demand, and we are going to continue to see that increase \nin demand.\n  The second thing that is going on is the drop in the value of the \ndollar. The dollar today, we all know, is not worth what it used to be. \nSome friends of mine returned from traveling in Europe, and they told \nme how unfortunate they felt in having gone this year instead of about \n3 or 4 years ago because the value of the dollar has dropped by roughly \na third against most of the European currencies. In fact, it has \ndropped dramatically in currencies around the world.\n\n  And we see, it takes more dollars because oil is traded in dollars. \nThese countries that have all this oil, they want to make sure they are \ngetting their money's worth. As a result, they raise the price of oil \nto offset the drop in the value of dollars. So that is part what is \ngoing on.\n  The third thing that is going on, and we have heard from people a lot \nsmarter than I on these issues, but the third thing that is going on is \nthere is a lot of trading in oil futures, people who do not have any \nintention of ever taking possession of a barrel of oil, but they see it \nas a way to make money--not buying oil and refining the oil and selling \nthe product, but they see a way to make money by speculation and \ntrading in these futures, and they hope the value of the price of oil \nwill go up, they will make money and not take possession of the oil.\n  In the meantime, we as consumers are paying more for oil. Not every \nday. We have seen some trending down in the at least week, which is \ngood, but this is part of what is going on.\n  Is speculation 10 percent of the problem, 20 percent of the problem, \n30 percent of the problem? I do not know. I do not know that anyone \nknows. But as we can be convinced that that supply and demand is part \nof the problem. It is not the whole problem. The drop in the value of \nthe dollar is part of the problem. It is not the whole problem. And \nneither is speculation. But each of them is a contributing factor in \nthe runup in the price of oil. If we want to bring down or stabilize \nthe price of oil, to keep the price from getting any worse, we need to \nwork on supply, we need to work on demand, we need to do some things \nhere at home to restore the value of the dollar, to prop it up, to \nstrengthen the dollar, and we need to do something with respect to \nspeculation.\n  I wish to mention a thing or two about the legislation I supported, \nintroduced by the majority leader on speculation. Without getting into \nthe weeds on the legislation, the bill that is designed more than \nanything to provide greater transparency, not to come in and command \ncontrol the way the markets are being run but to make sure we have a \nlittle better disclosure, a little better transparency into that \noperation.\n  The legislation did not pass. I think most people here actually favor \ndoing something similar to that. For reasons that are maybe more \npolitical than practical, we could not move that legislation today \nbecause we did not have the 60 votes to break a filibuster.\n  Let me talk a bit about supply. Along with Senator Voinovich of Ohio, \nwe are privileged to lead a subcommittee of the Environment Committee \nthat focuses on, among other things, clean air and on nuclear power.\n  Part of the answer to our supply situation is growing in our fields \nthe fuels that we need. I am not suggesting that taking kernels of corn \noff an ear of corn and turning that into ethanol is a smart idea, at \nleast in the long haul. I do not think that it is. It disrupts our food \nsystem, our food chain, makes the prices of meat, poultry, and milk \nmore expensive than it needs to be.\n  But there are things going on with respect to biofuels that I think \nare very encouraging. I wish to mention a couple of those. Our folks up \nat DuPont, they are headquartered in my State, they have a research \ncenter. At the research center they have been working on cellulosic \nethanol for 3, 4, 5 years.\n  They have launched joint ventures on cellulosic ethanol with another \ncompany. They are going to be building out in the Midwest a refinery to \nbe able to create, in some quantities, a biofuel that will be much \nbetter than ethanol; have better energy content than ethanol, travel \nbetter in pipelines than ethanol, mix better with gasoline than \nethanol.\n  They are coming up with a biofuel called biobutanol, partnering with \nour friends from BP, and actually they are test marketing the product \nover in England this year. Again, biobutanol, better energy density \nthan ethanol, travels better in pipelines than ethanol, mixes better \nwith gasoline at different temperatures than does ethanol.\n  There is another company called Coskata, C-o-s-k-a-t-a. I had not \nheard of them before this year. But they are a small startup biofuels \ncompany. They have interesting technologies that enable them to take \nplant waste, corn, corn hulls, cornstalks, corn leaves, corncobs, \nwoodchips, switchgrass, any variety of products, and turn it into a \nbiofuel.\n  And they not only can take that plant waste, they can take municipal \nwaste and transform it into a biofuel. They can take the old tires off \ncars, trucks and vans and turn that into a biofuel as well. They use \nabout maybe less than a gallon of water to create a gallon of biofuel. \nAgain, they can create this biofuel from a variety of sources without \ndisrupting the food system.\n  The energy content of the fuel they create, the biofuel they create \nis about\n\n[[Page S7443]]\n\nseven times greater than the amount of energy that is used to create \nthe biofuels.\n  The amount of CO2 that is released in burning this biofuel \nis about 85 percent less than the carbon dioxide that is created by \nburning gasoline, and they can create it for maybe about a buck a \ngallon.\n  They are going to be creating it in more significant quantities about \n2011. Coskata is an example of one biofuels company that has an \nexciting technology that I think portends hope, should convey hope to \nall of us as we try work on the supply side.\n  Some people ask me why I believe nuclear power can actually be \nhelpful on the supply side too. I always say, the answer is two words: \nChevrolet Volt. Chevrolet Volt is a vehicle that GM is going to launch \ntoward the end of 2010. This is a flex-fuel, plug-in hybrid vehicle. \nPlug it into your electric outlet at your house, charge it overnight \nwhen electric prices are low, leave the next day, drive away, you can \nyou go 40 miles with a charge on your battery.\n  We are working hard to develop a lithium ion battery. The Federal \nGovernment is helping to partner the research on that. The idea is to \ngo out, run the first 40 miles on your battery, and then when your \nbattery runs low, to recharge the battery with an alternative power \nsource aboard the vehicle. It could be a fuel cell, it could be a low-\nemission diesel, it could be a traditional internal combustion engine. \nThose power sources, auxiliary power sources, recharge the battery, and \nthen the battery continues to run the vehicle.\n\n  The opportunity to get 80, 90, even 100 miles per gallon off a Chevy \nVolt flex-fuel, plug-in hybrid is not unrealistic. And it is a source \nof great encouragement. The question is where are they going to get the \nelectricity to charge the battery.\n  Today, nuclear provides about 20 percent of our electricity in this \ncountry. I think 70 percent of the carbon-free electricity that is \nproduced comes from nuclear. We have about nine new applications in. We \nhave not built a new nuclear plant in 30 years. We have nine \napplications in right now to build about 14 more. We expect next year \nmaybe another dozen or so applications and the opportunity for a \nrenaissance in nuclear power.\n  As we go forward, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has their hands \nfull, as you might imagine, making sure that the 104 powerplants we \nhave in existence today are run well, safely; relicensing a number of \nthose powerplants so their life can be extended for another 20 years, \nand then saying grace over all these new applications for new \npowerplants that are coming in.\n  It is important for us in this body to make sure the NRC has what \nthey need so they can oversee a safe renaissance in nuclear power. And \nthat renaissance will help us on the supply side, especially as we move \ntoward electric vehicles.\n  On the demand side, in talking about the Chevrolet Volt, a vehicle \nthat if it gets 80 to 90 miles per gallon, helps us on the demand side, \nI think that is pretty obvious. There are other things we can do on the \ndemand side as well. For my home, we went out, about a year ago, and \nbought a new air-conditioning unit. It is one that sits up about this \nhigh. It is pretty big. It is a SEER 18; we have energy efficiency \nratings on our appliances.\n  But one of the things we can do is buy more energy-efficient \nappliances. We basically have cut our electricity bill in half since we \nwent from a SEER 10 up to about a SEER 18. As we buy new appliances, we \nneed to continue to do those sorts of things.\n  Gee, as I look at the lights in the Senate Chamber, and as we change \nout the light bulbs in our offices, in our homes, we can buy more \nenergy-efficient light bulbs, change out the ballast systems in our \nlighting systems, put in new lighting systems. There is a lot we can do \nin terms of lighting.\n  The drop in the value of the dollar is coming from a couple things. \nOne of the things it flows from is the uncertainty in the housing \nmarket, the collapse in housing prices, great uncertainty about the \nbanking system, the mortgage financing system with Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac.\n  One of the things we can do--and hopefully we will take the final \nstep tomorrow--is provide a strong independent regulator for Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac. We do that in this legislation. We take steps to make \nsure people who are facing foreclosure--and it is not something they \nhave done wrong or no malfeasance involved, because we don't want to \nreward bad behavior--are given an opportunity to avoid it. We make the \nFHA relevant in the 21st century. We are going to provide housing \ncounselors for thousands.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time controlled by the \nDemocrats has expired.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that speakers on \nthe Republican side be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the U.S. Congress has had its ups and \ndowns, but the way the 110th Congress has handled our energy crisis is \na low point.\n  High energy prices affect every American, whether they are Democrat, \nRepublican, or Independent; whether they are labor unions, school \nteachers, or lawyers; whether they are white, African American, or \nHispanic. But no group is hurt more by high oil prices than the poor. \nRestricting our Nation's oil supply is the most regressive policy \nimaginable.\n  All we have heard from the other side is let's blame oil company \nprofit; let's blame oil companies for sitting on the leases; let's \nblame speculators for responding to a very small spare capacity of oil \nin the world.\n  Our citizens are begging us to drill more, but all the Democrats can \ndo is blame more. Listening to the energy debate these past few days, I \ncouldn't help but wonder whether the Democrats really believe their own \narguments. Are they really drinking the Kool Aid the anti-oil \nenvironmentalists are serving them, or do they actually know better?\n  I am no expert on energy, but the arguments the anti-oil \nenvironmentalists are selling to my friends on the other side of the \naisle are so obviously wrong that I would like to put some of their \nstatements to the test.\n  Let's take a look at this chart here.\n  The first item on this chart states that an oil lease allows an oil \ncompany to drill. The truth is you cannot drill on your own oil leases \nwithout a permit to drill, and there is a huge backlog of applications \nfor permits to drill. It is a very long, expensive, and frustrating \nprocess.\n  Let's take a look at this chart. This is what happens after an oil \ncompany gets a lease. First of all, the oil company must pay rental \nfees to hold onto its lease. Often, the detailed analysis of the actual \nenergy resource is completed after a lease has been won. If the \nanalysis indicates the resource is economic, the oil company must apply \nfor a permit to drill, and that kicks in the NEPA process requiring the \nenvironmental studies.\n  And then there is still no guarantee the oil company will get a \npermit to drill. But if they do, there are still serious hurdles to \novercome. They must comply with hundreds of State and Federal \nenvironmental rules, seasonal restrictions due to wildlife patterns, \nand very, very often, they must overcome protests and lawsuits by anti-\noil environmentalists.\n  So let's go back to our first chart. We can see that this first \nstatement is not true, so I'll put an ``F'' there for false.\n  The next line on the chart states that companies don't want to drill. \nThe irony here is astounding, because the Democrats have been fed this \nline by the very same anti-oil extremists that are putting up all the \nlawsuits against drilling permits.\n  Let's take a look what the trend has actually been with oil permits \nand drilling.\n  The data on this chart shows what's been happening at the BLM Office \nin Vernal, UT. This is very representative of the rest of the country. \nSince the year 2000, applications for permits to drill have doubled, \npermits granted by the government have doubled, and new wells completed \nsince the year 2000 have doubled. And even with a doubling of efforts \nby the government and the oil companies, there is still a very large \nbacklog of applications for permits to drill. Mr. President, these are\n\n[[Page S7444]]\n\nfacts, so I hope we can stop all the innuendo about oil companies not \nwanting to drill.\n  The last line is based on data the BLM just gave me yesterday, and \nthis number applies to all oil and gas permitting in the Nation. Since \nthe year 2000, environmental protests against oil and gas permits have \ngone up 700 percent.\n  It is an insult to the American people to mislead them this way. Is \nit any wonder that Americans are getting completely fed up with this \nCongress?\n  Anyway, let's go back to our chart and put a big ``F'' on the line \nthat says oil companies don't want to drill.\n  And that leads us to the third line on the chart, which states that \nthe release of final commercial lease regulations on oil shale would \nlead to a ``fire sale'' on oil shale leases.\n  It is an argument I have heard more than once, but a very quick \nreview of existing oil shale law proves it to be false.\n  I was the sponsor of the Oil Shale and Tars Sands Development Act. It \nis now Public Law and referred to as Section 369. Senators Pete \nDomenici and Wayne Allard were heroic supporters of the proposals, and \nwe consulted with Senators Jeff Bingaman and Ken Salazar on the \nlegislation.\n  It is worth taking a look at the actual language in the law, and I am \nparaphrasing to save time, but the law states it very clearly:\n  ``The Secretary shall consult with the Governors of the States . . . \nto determine the level of support and interest in the States in the \ndevelopment of tar sands and oil shale. . . .''\n  Even after final commercial lease regulations are published, not one \nlease can be put out to bid until after the Secretary of the Interior \nconsults with the relevant Governor to determine the level of State and \nlocal support for such activity. Then the law states that:\n  ``If the Secretary finds sufficient support and interest exists in a \nState, the Secretary may conduct a lease sale in that State.''\n  Notice that the Secretary may move forward only if there is support \nfrom the State. Anyone who reads the actual law, Mr. President, will \nsee that issuing final regulations on commercial oil shale leases will \nnot lead to a fire sale.\n  This chart shows the five major steps the law requires before the \nfinal regulations are released and then another set of major steps that \nmust be taken after the final regulations are published, but before a \nsingle lease can be put up to bid.\n  A fire sale is when a business sells damaged goods at basement \nbargain prices. The public auction of oil shale leases is just the \nopposite. The auction would offer up valuable leases of only to the \nhighest bidder. The winners will be paying a premium price to the \nGovernment with the goal of getting a return on their investment, and \nthe Government wants them to be successful, because everyone wins when \nenergy production occurs.\n  The oil shale law specifically ensures that no company will just sit \non commercial oil shale leases. The law reads that ``The Secretary \nshall, by regulation, designate work requirements and milestones to \nensure the diligent development of the lease.''\n  So let's go back to our original chart, and put a ``F'' on the third \nline. Oil shale leasing is, in every way, the opposite of a fire sale.\n  I am the sponsor of the FREEDOM Act, which provides strong tax \nincentives for plug-in electric vehicles. I also sponsored the CLEAR \nAct, which is the existing law giving tax credits for hybrids and \nalternative fuels. I understand that there are alternatives to oil, but \nI also choose to deal in the real world when I make policies. Just as \nwith oil shale, each alternative will take years to fully develop, but \nwe must work on them today if we want the benefits tomorrow.\n  Today, alternatives make up only about 3 percent of transportation \nfuels, and most of that is corn ethanol.\n  I hate the mandate on ethanol, but I am on record as a strong \nsupporter of incentives for ethanol.\n  But let me remind my colleagues of some of the points I made on the \nSenate floor earlier this week. And these facts are based strictly on \nGovernment data and science journals.\n  If ethanol production were expanded to make up 20 percent of our fuel \nsupply, it would move into drier areas and require irrigation.\n  This chart shows a comparison of how much water would be required to \nmake that much ethanol, compared to the amount of water for the same \namount of oil shale. The idea that oil shale needs huge amounts of \nwater is an absolute myth, but the media keeps repeating it.\n  This chart shows us how much land would be required to produce enough \nethanol for 20 percent of our fuel supply. As you can see, it would \ntake the equivalent of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, and South \nDakota combined to grow that much ethanol. This is calculated based on \ndata from the Energy Information Administration which shows it would \ntake about 353,000 square miles to make that much ethanol, which is \nrepresented by the green area on the map.\n  Now, you probably cannot see it from your chair. But this red arrow \non the chart points to a tiny dot on the map, which is the smallest \ncounty in Kansas. It is about 156 square miles, and that is all the \narea it would take to produce enough oil shale for 20 percent of our \nfuel supply. It is important to remember that after an acre of oil \nshale is used up, the law requires that it be restored back to nature.\n  If you look at this large green area on the map you can recognize \nthat ethanol requires a lot of land cultivation.\n  The February issue of Science magazine published a peer-reviewed \narticle which states that when land is cultivated, it releases gigantic \namounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.\n  The Science article determined that because of the land disturbance \nassociated with corn ethanol production, ethanol emits 93 percent more \ncarbon than gasoline. And switchgrass, even when grown on existing corn \nlands, emits 50 percent more carbon than gasoline.\n  On the other hand, the Department of Energy calculates that oil \nshale, without using any carbon capture technology, emits only 7 \npercent more carbon than gasoline.\n  Whether you are talking about water, land use, or greenhouse gases, \noil shale is certainly an improvement over ethanol. I continue to \nsupport ethanol production, but I know it is limited in what it can do.\n  On the other hand, as you can see by this chart, we have between 1 \nand 2 trillion barrels of recoverable shale oil in the United States. \nThat is a pretty important number, because it is about the same of \namount of the entire world's proven oil reserves. All government has to \ndo is get out of the way.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has been exceedingly dysfunctional when it \ncomes to energy.\n  On one hand they complain about oil companies sitting on oil leases, \nwhich we know isn't true, and on the other hand they ban development of \nour Nation's biggest oil resource, oil shale.\n  I wish they would make up their mind. And so do the American people, \nespecially those Americans who fall well under the poverty line.\n  Let's take a look at the last item on our energy quiz today. It \nstates that our poorest citizens spend about half their income on \nenergy costs.\n  A book written by one of our Nation's civil rights crusaders, Roy \nInnis, shows how the poorest of the poor spend up to 50 percent of \ntheir income on energy needs. Can you imagine the impact the anti-oil \nagenda has had on these Americans?\n  So, for this final item, I will be marking it with a ``T'' because it \nis a true statement. Historically, the poor have looked to the liberals \nto promote their needs in Congress, but on energy, they have been sold \nout.\n  Earlier this month, a group of protesters came to Capitol Hill \ncalling on Congress to stop the war on the poor by groups and \ncongressmen who are closing off America's energy resources.\n  Included in the group were pastors and civil rights leaders calling \non this body to unlock America's oil resources for the benefit of \nAmericans and especially for the benefit of lower income Americans.\n  One of the participants was Bishop Harry Jackson. I would like to \nquote some of his remarks for the record. These are his words:\n\n       I am a registered Democrat, but this has nothing to do with \n     partisan politics. Unless the public understands that there \n     are specific people and organizations that are fueling this \n     war against the poor, nothing will\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\n     change and the poor will continue to suffer. We will unmask \n     those behind this war regardless of their political party or \n     ideology. Party labels and partisan ideologies are \n     meaningless when it comes to protecting the lives of \n     America's most vulnerable citizens.\n\n  Democrats in Congress must choose between the very well funded \nextreme anti-oil interests, or the poor, because on energy prices, \nthere is no compromise between the two. To be honest, I believe \nAmericans have put their finger on this conflict, even before their \nrepresentatives in Congress have fully begun to understand it.\n  Representative Henry Waxman passed a law that bans the Federal \nGovernment from purchasing oil sands from Canada, unless it can be \nproven that it has a lesser greenhouse gas footprint than gasoline. In \nother words, we are turning away 1.5 million barrels of oil a day from \na friendly neighbor in favor of oil from the Middle East and Russia. \nWhat about the greenhouse gas footprint of shipping that oil all the \nway over here?\n  Last year, Representative Mark Udall, who represents Aspen, CO, \npassed the one-year moratorium on commercial oil shale leasing. At \nfirst, I thought he was simply seeking a little extra time for \ncomments, but a year moratorium on leases is a very long time. Now he \nis trying to extend the moratorium for another year.\n  I guess there are not too many poor in Aspen. I love Aspen and the \npeople there, but it is no secret that it is home to plenty of wealthy \nelites and environmentalists. I have no problem with Representative \nUdall choosing the elite anti-oil crowd over the poor. But let's be \nhonest about the choices we're making around here.\n  Just a couple months ago a local Aspen newspaper reported about how \nthe city of Aspen has been besieged with building permit applications. \nThe article states that new building permits every day equate to about \n$2 million. From what I know about Aspen, I am sure there are some very \nnice brandnew homes, stores and restaurants going up, and more power to \nthem.\n  Ironically, the local governments in Colorado's oil shale areas \nsupport oil shale development. But it is the wealthy environmentally \nminded citizens like the good people of the not so nearby Aspen who are \nopposing it. I addressed the environmental benefits of oil shale \nproduction earlier in my remarks, but extreme views are sometimes \nextremely hard to change.\n  The American people are not asking for a big appropriation or some \ndifficult action by Congress. They are not asking us to give oil \ncompanies big subsidies or environmental loopholes. All they ask is \nthat this Congress stop locking up our domestic oil resources. They are \nasking us to stop relying on foreign governments who are much smarter \nthan we are about developing their own oil resources. They are asking \nus to find more and use less.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republicans control 18\\1/2\\ \nminutes in 10-minute increments.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with \nmy Republican colleagues for the 18\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Would the Chair be so kind as to let me know when 1 \nminute remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senate just voted, because of the \nway Republicans voted, to stay on $4 gasoline until we can find a \nserious solution to this problem. This is the biggest problem facing \nour country. The point we are trying to make is that we think we ought \nto take it up, take a week, take several days, offer our ideas, and the \nDemocratic ideas--there are many about which we agree--and see if we \ncan make some substantial progress to finding more oil and gas and \nusing less oil and gas, which is the way we lower price if you believe \nin the law of supply and demand.\n  What we have discovered, to our surprise--we are willing to do both, \nto find more and use less, but the Democratic leader, at least, is not. \nWhenever we say we want to use more, he says: No, we can't. More oil \nshale: No. More offshore drilling: No.\n  So what we would like to emphasize in these next few minutes is that, \nunlike the way the Democratic leader has characterized our proposal, we \nare equally interested in using less oil and finding more. After all, \nthe United States uses 25 percent of all the oil in the world. So if we \nreally want to reduce the demand for oil as a way of affecting price, \nwe need to get serious about using less oil as well as finding more.\n  I went to Oak Ridge National Laboratory in May and suggested we need \na new Manhattan Project for clean energy independence, to put us on a \npath, over the next 5 years, toward clean energy independence. We would \nstart with doing the things we already know how to do, such as building \nmore nuclear powerplants--we know how to do that--offshore drilling, \nfor which 85 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf is now, by law, off \nlimits.\n  But I mentioned, then, several things we do not know how to do. We \nought to have crash programs and do them quickly. One was to make solar \nenergy cost competitive with fossil fuels in 5 years. Another was \nresearch in advanced biofuels so we can make alternative fuels from \ncrops we do not eat as well as crops such as corn that we do eat. That \nis another way to use less oil. Another is to make all new buildings \ngreen buildings. We waste a lot of energy, and much of it is in our \nbuildings. Another goal is to make plug-in electric cars and trucks \ncommonplace. That is another way to use less oil.\n  The Senator from Alabama has been an effective spokesman not only for \nusing and finding more American energy but for using less of it. I \nheard him on the floor yesterday, and I would ask the Senator, isn't it \ntrue that an essential part of the Republican plan--but let's call it \nthe American plan--for really dealing with the price of gasoline today \nis to deal with both supply and demand, and that we are equally \ninterested in the demand part and using less part as we are in the \nsupply part?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I certainly agree. I say to Senator \nAlexander, I think you have articulated that so well. I just heard most \nof the remarks of Senator Carper, our Democratic colleague. He was \ntalking about ways to produce more nuclear power, biofuels. I think--\ndon't you--there is a basis for compromise between our parties that \nwill have conservation plus more production? Both of those together, I \nam convinced, will help break this cycle of ever-rising prices of fuel. \nThat is the direction we need to go. I do find it odd that the \nDemocratic leader is keeping this negotiation--really, this discussion \nthat would occur from a real Energy bill debate--keeping that from \noccurring and keeping progress from being made.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alabama, I \nwas just thinking last night, we could have been taking these \namendments up since last Friday. The Democratic leader brought up his \nspeculation bill, which is a perfectly appropriate energy bill to bring \nto the floor, and instead of having the Senator from Delaware come make \na speech about nuclear power, he could have offered an amendment about \nnuclear power. So we could have already spent 1 whole week dealing with \nissues on the supply side and demand side that would help lower the \nprice of gasoline and other expenses.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think that is exactly right. I just \nwant to thank the Senator for his leadership and study. One of our \nMembers said there are few issues in which more Members of this Senate \nhave educated themselves than on energy. I think most of our Members \nare deeply committed to doing something. If they are listening to their \nconstituents, they are.\n  I calculated out, I say to Senator Alexander, that according to the \nestimates of the Government, the average family travels 24,000 miles a \nyear. That means in their budgets they will spend this year, based on \nthe increase in gasoline prices, $1,260 more. That amounts to $105 per \nmonth. After they pay their Social Security, after they pay their \ntaxes, after they pay their insurance, after they pay their house loan, \nand all these fixed expenses all of us have, they have that little \nremaining money\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\nthat discretionary money to do the things they want to do to take care \nof their family and many critical needs, and they have $100 less per \nmonth.\n  I believe we have to do something. I do not believe we should go home \nwithout confronting this question. It requires conservation, less \nutilization, alternatives to this high price of oil, as well as more \nproduction.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alabama, one \nof the parts of the Republican proposal is to make plug-in electric \ncars and trucks commonplace, which sounds like a startling idea the \nfirst time you hear it, the idea that you would just take your car or \nyour truck and plug it into the wall at home and fill it up with \nelectricity instead of gasoline.\n  But the fact is, Nissan announced in Tennessee the other day that it \nwill have a pure electric car out in about 3 years. General Motors, \nToyota, Ford--they are all going to be selling these cars. We are going \nto have the cars. The Tennessee Valley Authority, which serves the \nregion where we live, says it has plenty of electricity at night which \nit can sell at low cost. So we have the cars coming. We have the \nelectricity. All we need is the cord.\n  We could use a debate and discussion on the Senate floor to help make \nthis country a place in which plug-in electric cars and trucks would \nsucceed. That is part of our amendment.\n  I ask the Senator from Alabama, don't you think there is widespread \nsupport for plug-in cars and trucks on that side and widespread support \non this side? Why don't we have some amendments about that? Why aren't \nwe allowed to do it?\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I could not agree more. In fact, Senator \nCarper, our colleague, just 10 or 15 minutes ago emphasized plug-in \nhybrids as one of the key solutions. I think you and I agree from our \ndiscussions that in the immediate future, a plug-in hybrid automobile \nmay have more potential to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels than \nalmost any other thing that is within our technological capabilities to \nachieve. Would the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, that is exactly my view. What makes it \nespecially appealing is that the Government is not in charge of it. The \ncar companies are making the cars. The utilities have the electricity. \nIt is estimated that we could electrify half of our cars and trucks in \nAmerica without building a single new powerplant.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask Senator Alexander this. I get so \nfrustrated when I say and Members on this side say: Well, we need to \nproduce more oil and gas, we have blocked 85 percent of our offshore \nlands--not south of Alabama, we have supported that, but other areas \nare blocked--and they say that is because we are for oil companies. But \nthe truth is, this idea you and I are talking about--a plug-in hybrid--\nwould take us from oil, would give some competition to the big oil \ncompanies, and would have a significant effect, would it not, in, \nhopefully, reducing the price of oil and their profits in the process?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It would.\n  I see the Senator from South Dakota, who has been in many ways the \nforemost champion of renewable energy here. We often hear him say that \nin the Dakotas they have more opportunity for wind energy, which, to \nthe extent we use it, would reduce the amount of oil we use if we plug \nin electric cars and trucks, as an example, or use biofuels that are an \nalternative fuel.\n  I wonder if the Senator from South Dakota would not agree that using \nless oil, giving big oil some competition, is not a big part of the \nRepublican proposal?\n  Mr. THUNE. Absolutely, the Senator from Tennessee is correct. I \nappreciate his leadership on the energy issue. I think putting it in \nvery simple terms--finding more and using less--is something the \nAmerican people understand and something that is seriously missing in \nthis debate.\n  The Democratic leadership, by filling the amendment tree, has \nprevented the opportunity for Senators on our side or Senators on their \nside to offer amendments that would address the very basic issue of \nfinding more and using less. What we have before us on the floor is a \nvery narrow solution that does nothing to address America's dangerous \ndependence upon foreign sources of energy, does nothing to add to our \ndomestic supply in dealing with the ``finding more'' side of the \nequation, and, frankly, does nothing to deal with the ``using less'' \nbecause all the good amendments--and I have looked at the list of \namendments here on our side, at least--we have 24 ``finding more'' type \nof amendments, 14 ``using less'' type of amendments. We have a number \nof people who would like to offer amendments with regard to \nconservation and renewable energy.\n  As the Senator said, I am very much supportive of renewable energy. \nWe are just going over--South Dakota will eclipse now the 1 billion-\ngallon level annually in ethanol, biofuels. We think there is a \ntremendous upside in the potential future in advanced, what we call \nnext-generation biofuels, cellulosic ethanol, which would \ngeographically diversify ethanol production in this country. So, I say \nto the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Tennessee, their \nStates might be able to participate in that as well because they would \nbe able to make it from other forms of biomass.\n  I am very much for having a wide-ranging debate that includes \nopportunities to offer amendments on conservation, on renewable energy, \non biofuels, on wind. South Dakota is home--maybe second to Washington, \nDC, because there is a lot of hot air in Washington--but when it comes \nto wind energy, South Dakota and the upper Midwest, the Great Plains \nStates, probably have more of an abundance of wind than about anywhere \nin the country.\n  Everybody says: Well, wind is intermittent, and it does not blow all \nthe time. That is true, although you would have an argument from people \nin South Dakota because it does seem to blow all the time there. But we \nhave very consistent wind which can be converted to energy and help \naddress the ``find more'' part of the energy solution in this country.\n  But here we are in the Senate, the world's greatest deliberative \nbody, having amendments being blocked that would do anything to address \nthis issue of supply and demand. In fact, as to the Energy bill we \nvoted on in 2005, we adopted 57 amendments and we spent 10 days on the \nfloor debating amendments. As to the Energy bill we passed in 2007--\nlate last year--we spent 15 days of time on the floor of the Senate and \nadopted 49 amendments. So we have a history on big issues such as this \nof allowing the Senate to work its will, and here we have probably the \nmost important economic issue affecting America, not only currently but \nin the future, and the pocketbooks of every single American--and that \nis this incredible toll and economic hardship that the high price of \nfuel is taking on our economy and on Americans' pocketbooks. And we are \nbeing cut off from even offering any debate that would address these \nissues of conservation.\n  We have some great ideas on conservation, renewable energy, advanced \nbattery technology. The Senator from Tennessee talked about--and so did \nthe Senator from Alabama--having these electric hybrids that run for 40 \nor 60 miles on electricity and then convert over to fuel. I would like \nto be able to talk about and offer some amendments that would--once \nthey get to that, where they start kicking in and running on a gasoline \nengine, making those flex-fuel vehicles because then you could run on \nany type, whether it is gasoline, whether it is E85. You could use \nblends that could be used to not only run the cars but also move us \naway from dependence upon fossil fuels and petroleum and more toward \nbiofuels.\n  But in any event, the point of all this is, we are standing on the \nfloor of the Senate with an opportunity to do something about an issue \nthat is incredibly impacting Americans in this country, and we are \nbeing blocked from even having an opportunity to have some of these \namendments that would impact the ``finding more'' side of the equation \nin additional domestic production and also the ``using less'' side, \nwhich is the conservation component.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator who has helped us frame the \ndebate has arrived on the floor, the Republican leader. I have heard \nhim say repeatedly that we want a result. This is not a time for \nplaying games. This is not a time for scoring points. This is a\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\ntime when Americans--South Dakotans, Alabamians, Tennesseans--we are \nall hurting.\n  I get stories from marines who do not have money for their vacation \nwith their family after 18 months in Iraq, from moms who are losing \ntheir job because they cannot afford the commute.\n  We have an opportunity. We could be doing it this day. We could be \ndebating Senator Thune's proposals on wind and renewable energy and \nbiofuels, Senator Sessions' proposals on conservation and plug-in \nvehicles. Yet we are in this parliamentary procedure to block us from \noffering anything that has to do with finding more and using less--\nexcept the one proposal.\n  I see the Republican leader in the Chamber. I wonder if he would \nagree with me that the American people are ready for the Senate to act \nand get a result on $4 gasoline, and the Republicans are at least as \ninterested in using less oil, giving big oil some competition, as we \nare in finding more?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it strikes me that the public opinion \npolls are overwhelming. People, frankly, do not care who gets it done, \nbut they know they need both sides to cooperate to get there. I think \nSenate Republicans this morning spoke almost with one voice, saying: \nLet's stay on this subject and get it right now.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say to Senator Alexander, I have great \naffection for the Democratic leader, but I just could not agree with \nhis statement that we do not have time. We have a whole month coming up \nfor which we are supposedly going home for recess. Our soldiers are \nworking 7 days a week, with 15-hour days. This Congress cannot stand to \nstay in session a while and confront this issue and do some things we \nknow will work?\n  I know there are a lot of specific steps everybody in this Chamber \nwould agree would be positive to deal with this problem. We need to \ntake those steps, and on a bipartisan basis; but we can't get there \nunless we are able to bring up the bill and debate it.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We should start today. I wonder if the Senator would \nagree with me. What I hope I never hear on the Senate floor again is it \nwill take 10 years or it will take 5 years because, I wonder what we \nare supposed to do, not look ahead for the kind of country we want for \nour children?\n  What if President Kennedy said: I would like to go to the Moon, but \nit will take 10 years, so forget it. What if President Roosevelt had \nsaid: We need to build an atom bomb to win World War II, but it is \ngoing to take 3 years, so we better drop that idea. Or what if Benjamin \nFranklin had said: I would like to see a republic for these colonies, \nbut it might take 50 years, so let's not do that.\n  Our job is to look down the road a few years and try to create a \nbetter environment for people. In addition, the price of gasoline today \nis based upon the expected supply and expected demand tomorrow. So if \nthis world saw the United States of America take major steps today to \nchange the supply and demand in the world for oil and gas, the price \nwould be affected today, in my view.\n  I wonder if the Senator from South Dakota would agree that the family \nbudget--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.--that the family budget is more important than the \nlegislative calendar, and that the family budget in America is more \nimportant than a legislative vacation, and what we ought to be doing \ntoday and over the weekend and next week is figuring out what to do \nabout $4 gasoline by finding more and using less.\n  Mr. THUNE. There is no doubt the folks I represent in South Dakota, \nas well as the people of Tennessee and the people of Alabama, are \nspeaking loudly and clearly about this. They want this addressed. They \nthink all this finger-pointing and playing the blame game in Washington \nisn't doing anything to solve their problem, which is the tremendous \ntoll and impact this is having on their pocketbooks. I would hope we \nwould be able to have a wide-ranging debate, be able to vote on \namendments, look at a balanced, comprehensive approach that includes \nmore production, that includes conservation, that includes use of \nrenewables.\n  That is not happening in the Senate, and it is not happening because \nthe Democratic leadership has decided they don't want to take votes. \nThey don't want to take votes on additional production, and so they \nhave done what they call in Washington ``filling the tree.'' In simple \nterms that basically prevents anybody--including Members on their side \nbut Members on our side as well--from offering amendments that would \nactually solve the problem.\n  It is unfortunate where we are, but the Senator is exactly right.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican time has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to proceed on my leader time. I \nam unsure what the time situation is.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate took a defining vote this \nmorning.\n  Americans have been crying out, asking us to act to lower high gas \nprices. They just heard the official response from the Democratic \nleadership in Congress: A few new guidelines for the energy futures \nmarket is enough. We don't need to do anything other than that. That is \nit. That is the Senate Democratic position.\n  The American people have been telling us for months that the house is \non fire, and the Democrats just showed up at the scene with a squirt \ngun--a squirt gun.\n  The vote we took this morning was their response to $4-a-gallon \ngasoline. That is what a few of our friends on the other side are doing \nfor all of those people out there who are standing at the gas pump, \nhopping mad at what it just cost them to fill the tanks of their cars. \nThey have told 49 Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats who are \nopen to increased domestic exploration the same thing: take it or leave \nit, speculation or nothing.\n  Americans are insisting that we do a lot more than that. They want us \nto do something to cut the price of gas and to lessen our dependence on \noil in the Middle East. They don't want us to quit working until the \njob is done, and leaving this issue is what the Democratic leadership \njust voted to do.\n  A majority in the Senate wants America to be self-reliant and to find \nmore American energy, but the Democratic leadership says: No, we can't.\n  To drive down gas prices, we should be opening the Outer Continental \nShelf today, but the Democratic leadership says: No, we can't.\n  To drive down gas prices, we could be lifting the ban on development \nof the vast oil shale deposits in Western States that sit on three \ntimes the reserves of Saudi Arabia. The Democratic leadership says: No, \nwe can't.\n  To drive down gas prices, we could have approved incentives for \nbattery-powered electric cars and trucks today. The Democratic \nleadership says: No, we can't.\n  To drive down gas prices, we could have voted to open up untapped \nAmerican oil today, but the Democratic leadership says: No, we can't.\n  To drive down gas prices, we could have voted today for new, clean, \nnuclear technology, but the Democratic leadership says: No, we can't.\n  To drive down gas prices, we could have approved new coal-to-liquid \ntechnology today, but the Democratic leadership says: No, we can't.\n  Nearly eight in ten Americans say we should do these things, but the \nDemocratic leadership and their Presidential nominee have the same \nsimple response to every one of them: No, we won't.\n\n  A dozen Democrats in the Senate say we should consider these things, \nbut the Democratic leadership had the same answer for them: No, we \nwon't.\n  The Democratic leadership just voted to give up on finding a solution \nto high gas prices. They just voted to give up on trying to find more \nand to use less. They just voted to give up on our effort to consider \nserious ideas from both sides of the aisle. They want us to tell the \nAmerican people the Senate's time would be better spent on other \nthings, and that it is time to simply move on.\n  Well, Republicans have a three-word response for the Democratic \nleadership: No, we won't.\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\n  I just voted to keep the Senate on the most important domestic issue \nfacing our Nation. If there is a more important domestic issue facing \nthe country, let's hear it; otherwise, let's get serious and work \ntoward a big solution to this very big problem.\n  I mentioned yesterday that I received recently a letter from a \ndialysis center in Kentucky. They were pleading with the Senate to take \naction now on the high price of gas at the pump. The letter said that \nsome of the rural patients who have to go to this center for treatment \nthree times a week are now foregoing some of their treatments because \nthey can't afford the gas to get there.\n  So I ask my friends on the other side the same simple question I \nasked them yesterday: If you won't act now, with dialysis patients \ncutting back on treatments because of high gas prices, when will you \nact? What is it going to take?\n  I know my colleagues across the aisle are stuck between the ``No, we \ncan't'' position of their Presidential candidate and the Democratic \nleadership--stuck between them on the one side and the guy at the gas \npump with smoke coming out of his ears on the other. For me, though, \nthat decision is an easy one: I am going to be with the guy at the \npump.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the pending passage of \nextraordinarily important legislation: the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act. We are debating it today, and it is one of the most \nsignificant pieces of legislation that we will address in this Congress \nand perhaps in many Congresses to come. It is in direct response to the \nhousing crisis, which has not only undermined home values throughout \nthis country, forcing thousands and hundreds of thousands of people \ninto foreclosure or onto the verge of foreclosure, but its effects have \nessentially been transmitted throughout the entire economy, and we are \nseeing a huge economic downturn. Unless we provide some type of footing \nfor housing in the United States, I do not think the economy will begin \nto recover. It is perhaps the most significant economic issue that we \nface.\n  For months now we have been battling to get this legislation through, \nand we are now on the verge of passing this significant bill. I am \nexcited for that moment, and I wish to first commend individuals who \nhave played a critical role. Senator Dodd has been remarkable in his \nmanagement of this legislation, along with Senator Shelby. They have \nplayed a dynamic and very creative and very positive role in bringing \nthis legislation to final passage. They have been ably assisted by \ntheir staff, and I have been particularly assisted by my staff members, \nKara Stein and Didem Nisanci. They have done a remarkable job.\n  For the first time in a generation with this legislation, we are \nbeginning to update, modernize, and strengthen the institutions that \nundergird our mortgage and housing markets to provide some footing, \nsome economic traction, so that Americans can begin to feel somewhat \nhopeful and confident about their economic future again. We are also \nproviding grants and tax incentives to encourage the development of \nhousing across the Nation for low-income families.\n  One of those issues that has been persistent and, indeed, pernicious \nfor many, many, many years before the onset of this housing crisis is \nthe lack of affordable housing in many parts of the country--in fact, \npractically every part of the country. Low-income families have been \nstruggling for decent, affordable housing.\n  In this legislation, we are providing a response to their struggle--a \nresponse I think will not only benefit low-income families but benefit \ncommunities throughout the Nation.\n  This legislation is a comprehensive and realistic response to the \ncurrent crisis. I believe it will help millions of Americans to find \ndecent, safe, and affordable housing.\n  Again, let me thank Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby for all of their \nhard work and their very astute, very wise judgments at various places \nalong the way where this legislation could have gone off the track. \nThey have done a remarkable service for this body and for the American \npeople. This bill is not just going to provide families with some hope; \nit is also going to provide families with real help, and that is so \ncritical at this juncture.\n  For families, such as many in Rhode Island who are struggling to stay \nin their homes, this legislation creates a new program at the Federal \nHousing Administration--the FHA. This HOPE for Homeowners Program will \nallow families who have mortgages that are underwater--their mortgage \nis greater than the value of their home at this time--to refinance into \n30-year, fixed-rate, FHA-insured mortgages they can afford. It is going \nto increase funding for home ownership counseling so that more families \nhave access to these much needed services.\n  This legislation also aids our returning soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines. I just had the privilege of traveling into Iraq and \nAfghanistan with Senator Hagel and Senator Obama to personally thank \nthese young men and women and to tell them we are with them. We are \nwith them not just there in the war zone, but we have to be with them \nwhen they come home so they have a chance when they come back to \nmaintain their homes and get the services they need. This legislation \nwill help them by lengthening the time a lender must wait before \nstarting the foreclosure process and by providing these soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines with 1 year of relief from increases in \nmortgage interest rates. It is fitting that we spend a moment in this \nlegislation to recognize these brave young Americans.\n\n  It will also provide $3.92 billion for States and local governments \nfor the development of abandoned and foreclosed homes. It has been \nestimated that Rhode Island will receive about $56.7 million of this \ncommunity development block grant funding, which should help stabilize \nmany of our neighborhoods and stem the significant losses in the home \nvalues of surrounding neighbors.\n  What happens when a home is foreclosed? It affects dramatically and \ntraumatically the individual family, but the effect is not contained to \nthat home because the values of the surrounding homes go down as well. \nAlmost like a cascading effect, one foreclosure follows another, home \nvalues descend, and then you have a blighted community. We have seen \nthis in Rhode Island.\n  My colleague, the Presiding Officer and junior Senator from Rhode \nIsland, has traveled through some of our communities where not one \nhome, but two, and then three, and four, and then ten are foreclosed--\nthen suddenly we have a problem which is eating at the heart of the \ncommunity.\n  This CDBG money will help cities move aggressively, first, to protect \nthe physical structures of these homes. One of the things we have \nseen--not just in Rhode Island but nationwide--is that when these homes \nare abandoned, they are subject to predators who come in, rip out the \ncopper piping, the wiring, take off the siding, and before you know it, \nyou have lost that opportunity to put another family in that home. It \nis a great loss to the community.\n  We have done much over the last several decades to begin to turn the \ncorner in many of our communities in Rhode Island. You could see the \nsense of pride and progress as homes were fixed up and new properties \nwere developed, but we stand the chance of losing that, of letting it \nslip away. So without this community block grant development money, we \nwill see neighborhoods turned inside out, begin to fail, and provide a \nfurther pull downward on the economy in so many communities in this \ncountry. This is another important aspect of this legislation.\n  This legislation also will help to stabilize and stimulate the real \nestate market.\n  This has been one of the great engines of our economy over the last \ndecade or more.\n  This legislation contains a provision that will provide a $7,500 tax \ncredit for first-time homebuyers--help people get back into the real \nestate market.\n  It will also provide States with $11 billion of additional tax-exempt \nbond authority in 2008 to help refinance subprime loans, make loans to \nfirst-time homebuyers, and finance the building of affordable housing. \nMany States--particularly in our State of\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nRhode Island--have housing authorities that have done a remarkable job \nof partnering with private, not-for-profits, and local commercial and \nfinancial institutions to try to help develop affordable housing, help \npeople who are having difficulties with their mortgages. This \nadditional bonding authority will give more support to these local \nefforts. It is a critical issue.\n  The legislation also increases the GSE--which are Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac--FHA, and VA loan limits. This is going to allow more \nfamilies to access conventional mortgage rates and be able to place \nthemselves in affordable and sustainable mortgage products. One of the \nproblems we have seen over the last several years has become much more \nvivid. Looking back, because we didn't empower the VA, FHA, and GSEs to \nmore aggressively provide access to conventional loans, many families \nturned to these exotic mortgages with accelerating interest rates. As a \nresult, they find themselves now in a great dilemma. Studies have shown \nthat many people who were getting these subprime loans would have \nqualified for one of these conventional loans with a conventional \ninterest rate. Because we weren't reaching out through these Government \nagencies, the VA, Federal Housing Administration, and also \nincentivizing the quasi-governmental agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac, these people had very little choice but to be subject to the \nblandishment and allure of these seemingly good deals in the subprime \nmortgage market. Now we are getting much more aggressive with \nconventional mortgages. That will be, I think, going forward a good \nthing.\n  Important also, this legislation helps restore confidence in Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac. It creates a new, strong, independent, world-class \nregulator for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks.\n  The bill also includes a provision, at the request of Secretary \nPaulson and the administration, which will authorize the Department of \nthe Treasury to provide an explicit backstop should the GSEs encounter \ngrave financial problems.\n  I am pleased also that the Federal Reserve's consultative role with \nthe newly created regulator will also be also limited to the duration \nof this authority rather than in perpetuity.\n  I firmly believe that issues surrounding regulatory reform need to be \nseriously considered at length for the remainder of this year and in \nthe upcoming year. We should not be merely bootstrapping these issues \nto the current bill without significant deliberation on the role and \nthe ability of the Federal Reserve to perform such responsibilities. \nLet me say that again. It is vitally important to signal to the markets \nand the American people that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are still \nvital, valuable parts of our mortgage market. In fact, they represent \nright now roughly 70 percent of that market. If they are faltering, if \nour real estate markets decline further, that is going to be a \nsignificant weight on our overall economy--even more significant than \nin the present day. Restoring confidence in Fannie and Freddie and the \nmarketplace is one of the building blocks to beginning to restore and \nrebuild our economy going forward. These provisions will, I hope, do it \nin such a way that they provide psychological support so that actually \ndrawing down funds by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be unnecessary. \nThis backstop will send, I think, the right message to the marketplace \nso we can move on to begin to deal with some other issues with respect \nto the larger financial markets of this country, and indeed the world.\n  Finally, let me mention some of the provisions I am particularly \nproud of in the bill. They represent the culmination of years of work--\nnot my work alone, but work on which I have taken upon myself to \nprovide some, I hope, leadership.\n  I have been working to create a national affordable housing trust \nfund, this in response to the needs I have seen--and my colleague, the \njunior Senator from Rhode Island, has seen--around the country, with \nfamilies struggling to find a decent place to live. Without a decent \nand a permanent place to live, how can you expect children to succeed \nin school, if they are in three different schools when families move \nfrom one rental to another one? How can families choose between \nshelters at all, when apartments are riddled with lead hazards, which \nimpacts the health and welfare of a child and the family? How can you \nexpect someone to confidently go out and look for a job and maintain a \njob, when they are asked for a permanent home address and they have to \nscribble something--either make it up or change it repeatedly? These \nare the challenges many face because we don't have adequate affordable \nhousing for many of our citizens. Prompted by that, I have, since I \nhave been in the Congress--the House and the Senate--been working for \nthe day we can provide more support for affordable housing for our \ncitizens.\n  When I was chair and ranking member of the Housing and Transportation \nSubcommittee of the Banking Committee during the last few Congresses, \nit became clear to me that our Nation had this affordable housing \ncrisis. One of my first public policy endeavors as a young lawyer in \nRhode Island was to be the pro bono legal counsel to Amos House, a \nwonderful organization in our home State, in Providence, which \nattempted to provide support to people who were poor and also provide \nsome housing. I first became convinced that if we can provide stability \nin housing, that would go a long way towards giving people the \nconfidence, self-esteem, and the skills needed to master the challenges \nof living in a very difficult economy.\n\n  Housing is expensive now--very expensive. It is falling, but it has \ngone up dramatically. The affordable housing crisis continues to be \nwith us. Indeed, one of the ironies of the marketplace will be--and I \nhope quickly--when the market restores itself and home values begin to \nrise because of this legislation and other legislation, it will make it \neven more difficult for low-income and modest income Americans to find \na place to rent or buy. We want the economy and the housing market to \ncome back strong, and we want housing values to rise. But we cannot \nforget the people who may be left behind because their income is flat.\n  So this affordable housing provision is critical. There is no place \nin this country, for example, where an individual with a full-time job, \nat the minimum wage, can afford a two-bedroom apartment. Today, the \nminimum wage is going up, which is long overdue; but even at $6.65 an \nhour, that doesn't leave a lot for a good, safe two-bedroom apartment \nfor a family. We have to do more. This legislation does more.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, the average wage for a renter is $11.61. \nIn order to afford the fair market rent for an apartment at this wage, \na renter must work 68 hours per week, 52 weeks a year. If you are \nmaking the average wage, in order to afford a decent two-bedroom \napartment, you have to work 68 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. People \nare doing that. They are doing it for their children; they are doing it \nto make sure that at least there is a safe and healthy place for their \nchildren. That is an extraordinary burden. That is just to pay the \nrent. What about the increased food prices? What about the gasoline \nprices we are all recently talking about with such intensity?\n  This legislation creates an affordable housing trust fund from a less \nthan one-half cent fee on each new dollar of business that Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac engage in. This is not from the taxpayer. This is from \nthe business activities of these government-sponsored entities. A less \nthan a half-cent new fee on each new dollar of business.\n  The fund, we estimate, is going to provide approximately $500 million \nper year for the building, preservation, and rehabilitation of housing \nfor low-income families. Rhode Island should receive approximately $3 \nmillion from the trust fund program once it gets up and running.\n  Part of the money collected from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will also \nbe allocated to a new program that will be run by the Secretary of the \nTreasury, called the Capital Magnet Fund.\n  Community development financial institution and nonprofit housing \ndevelopers will be able to apply for funding if they can show an \nincreased investment in the development, preservation, rehabilitation, \nand purchase of affordable housing for primarily low-income families. \nSo there are basically two funding streams. We hope it will incentivize \nthe use not just of these\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\nfunds but additional private funds so we can provide even more support \nfor affordable housing.\n  The grantees of the capital magnet program must show they can \nleverage at least $10 in private dollars for each dollar they receive \nfrom the Capital Magnet Fund. That is a pretty good deal. If they can \nleverage $10 of private investment for $1 of investment from that fund, \nthat will multiply many fold the effect of these affordable housing \ndollars. These grantees will have to show that leverage and show \ninnovative ways in which they can deliver affordable housing services. \nThis will be a private solution to this problem. These grantees are \nprimarily community development financial institutions or not-for-\nprofits, who want to go ahead and support affordable housing in their \ncommunities.\n  This funding will be used to create and support financial programs \nthat dramatically increase investment in low-income housing, such as \nrevolving loan funds, risk-sharing loan programs, loan-loss reserves, \nand affordable housing trust funds at the local level.\n  I also helped draft provisions that would require Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac to purchase more mortgages made to low- and very low-income \nfamilies. This should increase the access of these families to 30-year \nfixed rate conventional mortgages. These provisions also require Fannie \nand Freddie to purchase more mortgages for rental housing built for \nlow-income families, which decreases the mortgage rates on these \nmortgages. Frankly, more financial institutions will make the mortgages \nbecause they will be able to sell them to the secondary market.\n  The legislation also includes the text of a bill I introduced, called \nthe Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act. These provisions require that \nconsumers are provided with timely and meaningful information regarding \nthe terms of their loan, including loans that refinance a home or \nprovide a home equity line of credit. As we look back on this subprime \ncrisis, so many times borrowers were totally unaware of the details of \nthe mortgage. They might have been able to afford the first year of \npayments, but once the escalator kicked in, they were out of the box. \nThey never understood this fully. Frankly, there were more incentives \nfor the brokers and dealers of the loans to obscure the bad news than \nto deliver the news to the borrowers. With these improvements, people \nwill have fair warning. They will have the information they need to \nmake a better judgment about the mortgages they will sign up for.\n  In particular, the TILA, the Truth-in-Lending Act form, will now show \nthe maximum payment a consumer might have to make under the terms of \nthe loan, and increase penalties if a lender doesn't provide this \ninformation in a truthful and timely way to the consumer. You will know \nthe maximum exposure you will have as a borrower. That should be a \nsobering caution for people who are trying their best to get into a \nhome.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes language I authored to \nexpand access to HUD-approved counseling programs by allowing any low \nor moderate income homeowner to be eligible for financial counseling \nservices. This provision will allow many more families to get the \nadvice or assistance they need to help keep their homes.\n  As most of you know, FHA also insures reverse mortgages that can be \nused by homeowners age 62 or older to convert their home equity into \nmonthly streams of income, or a line of credit to be repaid when they \nno longer occupy the home.\n  As the coauthor with Senator Allard of a bill to improve the home \nequity conversion mortgage program, I am pleased this bill contains our \nlanguage to remove the current congressionally imposed 275,000 cap on \nthe number of reverse mortgages that FHA can insure per year. This \nshould allow the successful FHA program for seniors to expand and serve \nmore seniors.\n  The bill also includes important provisions to protect our seniors \nfrom fraudulent practices, such as requirements for independent, third-\nparty counseling before they enter into the mortgage, limits on the \namount of origination fees that can be charged, and prohibitions on \nrequiring the purchase of other products, such as insurance or \nannuities. This is a good program. We think we have made it better and \nbelieve it will now be able to serve more seniors.\n  Additionally, the legislation contains language I authored to use $25 \nmillion in FHA savings every year for the purpose of modernizing and \nimproving FHA's technology, processes, and program performance. This \nfunding can also be used to provide more staffing for FHA's newly \nexpanded programs. This funding is critical to ensure the success of \nthe FHA modernization proposal since it will allow FHA to access \ncutting-edge mortgage industry practices and procedures. If we want the \nFHA to be a strong participant in the mortgage market, they have to \nhave the modern tools to do that, not only to serve more borrowers but \nalso to protect against problems, to protect the resources they are \ncommitted on behalf of the Government to use for the benefit of our \nfellow citizens. So this modernization provision is absolutely \ncritical, it is important, and I am glad it is in the bill.\n\n  We are at a critical juncture, and I am very pleased that we have \nfinally been able to reach bipartisan agreement on this legislation. \nAgain, it is a tribute to Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby and so many \nothers and to a remarkable staff who have worked so hard. I am most \nproud of what we have been able to do to increase access to credit and \naffordable housing for low-income people in Rhode Island and across the \nNation. This legislation is going to be the linchpin that helps \nmillions of families have decent, safe, and affordable housing.\n  It also should restore confidence in not only our Nation's housing \nmarket but in our Nation's economy. As we move forward, I think we have \nmuch to learn from this experience, including how integrally connected \nour housing markets and capital markets have become. Safe, decent, and \naffordable housing should not just be the American dream, it should be \nthe American promise. I look forward to witnessing the good this bill \ndoes in moving us in that direction.\n  As a final point, my colleague, Senator Sanders, has shown remarkable \nleadership to get LIHEAP funding onto the floor of this Senate. We need \nit. One of the responses, one of the immediate responses--not talking \nabout drilling that 10 years from now will put more gasoline into the \nworld market--in immediately dealing with the crisis this fall and \nwinter for families everywhere is to pass a LIHEAP bill. I hope we can \ndo that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I wish to welcome back our \ncolleague, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who has returned from a trip \nto Iraq and Afghanistan with Senators Obama and Hagel. I know he has \nmade many trips there and I thank him for his service in the Senate and \nhis contact with our troops and we are glad to have him back.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on the Democratic side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, briefly, I will say that we have pending \nbefore us a housing bill. You couldn't have missed this story in \nAmerica; it has hit so many communities so hard. My home State of \nIllinois is fourth or fifth in the Nation in mortgage foreclosures. Our \nlargest county, Cook County, is No. 2 among counties in the Nation in \nmortgage foreclosures. I have gone to the west side of Chicago and \ntaken a look--with Bob Fioretti, the local alderman--and seen a \nbeautiful row of houses, and among those are many well-kept places, \nwith the lawns manicured, and smack dab in the middle is one boarded-up \nhouse with trash all over the front yard and a sign that says it will \nbe up for auction in a few weeks.\n  Of course, that is dragging down the property values for the good \nneighbors who are trying to keep their homes nice and make their \nmortgage payments on time. So mortgage foreclosure isn't just your \nneighbor's misfortune, it is your misfortune. And when 2\\1/2\\ million \nAmericans lose their home to foreclosure, 44 million homes see a \ndecline in values.\n  In my hometown of Springfield, IL, when somebody files for \nforeclosure a block or two away, it affects my property value. Of \ncourse, a home is one of\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\nthe most important assets most families own. So we want to get this \nunder control.\n  Those people who have been defrauded by mortgage practices that never \nshould have been allowed need a second chance. I don't have any \nsympathy for speculators--those high flyers trying to make a fortune. \nBut for those families who need a second chance to stay in their homes \nand not lose everything they have put into them, this bill can help.\n  We worked on this bill on a bipartisan basis. We now have the \nPresident's support. The fact is, this bill should be on the \nPresident's desk today, and it could be. Sadly, one Republican Senator \nis holding up this bill and making the Senate stay in session until \ntomorrow. I hope that Senator is here for the vote when it takes place \ntomorrow, but this is totally unnecessary. It is just a matter of \ndelaying critically important bipartisan legislation that can try to \naddress the terrible home situation we have across America.\n  The National Association of Realtors has reported that home sales \nhave dropped yet again last month, leaving sales 15\\1/2\\ percent below \nwhere they were a year ago. The median price of a home sold in June \ndropped 6.1 percent from a year ago. That is the fifth largest year-\nover-year price reduction on record.\n  In Illinois, my home State, sales were down again, and the median \nsale price was down 6.1 percent from June of last year. Unfortunately, \nit doesn't look like it is going to get better soon.\n\n  Six months ago, the Center for Responsible Lending estimated that 2.2 \nmillion homes may be lost to foreclosure in the near future. That means \n44\\1/2\\ million families will see a decline in the value of their \nhomes. The total decline in home values across America from \nneighborhood foreclosures is expected to be over $220 billion.\n  This bill that we have before us, that will be passed--I hope \ntomorrow--with a strong bipartisan vote, the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act, will take several steps to help families facing \nforeclosure keep their homes, help other families avoid foreclosure, \nand help communities that have been devastated by foreclosure to \nrecover.\n  Chairman Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, and ranking member \nRichard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, came together and crafted a \nbipartisan bill and worked hard to do it. Chairman Barney Frank of \nMassachusetts, over in the House, did an extraordinarily good job, and \nwe were able to not only improve the regulation of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, two Government agencies that are directly involved in \nalmost half the home sales in America, but the bill also gives tax \nbenefits to families who want to buy homes and cities trying to rebuild \nlow-income housing.\n  It helps veterans--and we should always do that--by increasing loan \nlimits for their mortgages and extending the period of time that lapses \nafter a soldier returns from service before he can face foreclosure.\n  Cities receive $4 billion under the bill to purchase and rehab \nforeclosed property, and it helps avoid foreclosures in the future by \ntightening licensing requirements on mortgage brokers.\n  All these steps are in the right direction, but we also need a good-\nfaith effort from lending institutions. For too long they have stood by \nthe sidelines watching these foreclosures stack up. They should be in \nthe game, working with these families to save the homes, where they \ncan. That is not only the right thing to do morally, it is the right \nthing to do for their industry. If we are going to get the American \neconomy moving again, create jobs, and have a bright economic future, \nwe need to get our housing sector back on its feet.\n  I am sorry that one Senator makes us wait until tomorrow to get it \ndone, but I trust tomorrow we will get it done. We are going to pass \nthis bill, send it to the President, and I hope start the economic \nturnaround this country needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I join with the assistant Democratic \nleader in looking forward to passage of the housing bill. Americans are \ncaught in what appears to be a perfect storm. The subprime mortgage \ncrisis, of course, causes a collapse in that area, and then all other \nhousing is impacted by what happens to a neighbor. People lose value in \ntheir homes, they lose equity, they can't reinvest, can't fix the \nfloors, and then we see jobs impacted. It is a problem, and I look \nforward to dealing with that tomorrow. I am pleased we have come \ntogether in a bipartisan way to address this very critical problem.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  The other side of the coin--that perfect storm--is the issue of \nenergy, the gas crisis--$4-a-gallon gas, a barrel of oil costing $130, \n$135, $140, and who knows where it ends. I come to the floor to discuss \nan energy amendment I introduced yesterday, with the support of 24 \nother Senators, including the distinguished ranking member of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Domenici.\n  Before I begin making my remarks, I wish to make a parliamentary \ninquiry: I filed an amendment to S. 3268, the energy speculation bill. \nWhen the Senate resumes consideration of that bill, which I presume we \nwill go to after we deal with the housing bill, would it be in order \nfor me to offer that amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent to offer that \namendment.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. So if anyone on the other side objects, then I do not \nhave the opportunity to move forth that amendment; is that correct, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If any Senator objects.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, we are dealing here, for those who watch \nthe Senate, with a procedure where the majority leader has done what is \ncalled filling the tree. It is a tactic where the Democratic leader \nbrings a bill to the Senate, fills the tree so no amendments can be \noffered without his consent, and then files cloture on the bill, which \nstops debate. The end result is a process that is designed to fail \nbecause it prevents any other Senator from offering amendments.\n  I would note the number of times the amendment tree has been filled \nby the present majority leader has been 14 in this 110th Congress. That \nis more than the total number of times that procedure was used by the \nleaders in the 107th Congress, the 108th, and the 109th Congress.\n  Here we stand in the Senate, while our constituents are raising their \nvoices, expressing their frustration, and asking us to do something on \nan issue which is ``the issue'' of the day. We worry about the high \ncost of food. My farmers have an increase in the cost of energy that is \ndriving up the cost of food, and we are taking more money out of our \npockets now to pay for gas. I tell folks at home, not so jokingly, that \nwhen you go to the gas station today and you put the pump in the tank, \nyou wonder what is going to get filled first, the tank or your credit \nlimit. So what we have is an energy speculation bill. This is what we \nare allowed to debate when it comes to answering the most urgent crisis \nfacing America. This is the Senate. It is supposed to be the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, and this is not the way you deal with \nthe energy crisis. You don't set up a procedural process that is \ndesigned to fail. I am going to talk further about speculation, but we \nhave to do all of it.\n  In Minnesota, we play hockey. It is a way of life for many. There is \nno question we have plenty of ice to play on, and everyone knows hockey \nisn't exactly a no-contact sport. In the same way, it is reasonable to \nexpect there will be differences of opinion and lively debate among \nSenators when an important bill is considered on the floor. But what \nthe majority leader has done with the process on this Energy bill is \nakin to a hockey team throwing their gloves on the ice before the puck \nis even dropped.\n\n  This isn't about solving a problem. This no-amendment process is set \nup to deliver a political fight, and that is not in the best interest \nof the American people. It is the last thing Americans want and need. \nMinnesotans are smart--Americans are smart--and they get it. They know \nwe need to use every resource at our disposal to deal with this energy \ncrisis. They also know politicking when they see it. I don't think \neither party wins if we go home in August without passage of a strong \nenergy bill. Not this. Not this, designed\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\nto fail, addressing a narrow aspect of it. I wish to address it, but \nthere is so much more that has to be done.\n  I agree speculation is an important issue. I have been looking into \nthis matter, as ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigation and when I was chairman before that. So as both the \nchairman and ranking member, since 2006, we have been looking at this. \nBut speculation can't be dealt with substantively without changing the \ncurrent supply-and-demand dynamic. The bottom line is we need to find \nmore, we need to produce, and we need to consume less.\n  Speculation is based on the belief that there is going to be scarcity \nin the future. If you tell folks: No, no, there is not going to be \nscarcity because we are going to tap into American resources, we are \ngoing to do what has to be done to break that dependence on foreign \noil, to do what we have to do to tap into our resources in an \nenvironmentally safe way--you change the dynamic.\n  We had testimony before our subcommittee, and one of the witnesses \nsaid that if we did it--and he was talking mostly, by the way, about \nrenewables and conservation and production--if we put it all together, \nthe price of gas would drop like a rock. Now, I can't guarantee that, \nbut I can tell you if you are concerned about speculation, then one of \nthe things you want to do is to tell the speculators who are betting on \nscarcity that there is not going to be scarcity in the future because \nwe are tapping into American resources.\n  We have those resources to tap into. That is what the Coleman-\nDomenici amendment would do; it would untie America's hands as we try \nto deal with this energy crisis by allowing States to explore for \ndeepwater oil and natural gas that is 50 miles or more off the Nation's \neast and west coasts. That amendment would also focus on the \nconservation side because you have to do both. It would pave the way \nfor plug-in hybrid vehicles, by making battery production more \nefficient and more affordable.\n  Currently, 85 percent of the lower 48 Outer Continental Shelf acreage \nis off-limits--85 percent of the OCS is off-limits right now in the \nlower 48. Meanwhile, undiscovered OCS reserves are expected to be as \nlarge as 86 billion barrels of oil and 420 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas. Producing just 1 million barrels a day from the OCS would \nincrease domestic oil production by nearly 20 percent for 40 years.\n  I live in a State that is cold in the winter, and that winter starts \nearly. We are going to see the price of natural gas start spiking in \nSeptember and October. My farmers are impacted by that because natural \ngas is important to the production of fertilizer. They are having \ntrouble getting price quotes--not just for next year, some are having \ntrouble getting price quotes for the near future. If we tell the world \nwe are tapping into this resource that is there, regardless of when it \ncomes on, we are going to change the dynamic today.\n\n  On the demand side, widespread use of plug-in hybrid electric \nvehicles will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, greenhouse gas \nemissions, and the costs associated with driving. In fact, we could \nreduce the petroleum consumption by 3 to 4 million barrels a day by the \nmid-21st century and cut the cost of driving by about 75 percent.\n  This amendment is not a silver bullet. In fact, there are many other \nareas we need to look to--coal to liquid, oil shale, ethanol, expand \nnuclear production now, wind energy--expand that now. We had Boone \nPickens come into our caucus--and he spoke to our colleagues on the \nother side--and say: Do it all. Do wind, do nuclear, do Outer \nContinental Shelf exploration, do oil shale--do it all. I think there \nis a better way to address the speculation issue than what has been \ndone in the underlying bill.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate has been handed a take-it-or-leave-it \nprocess on a speculation bill that doesn't cover production and doesn't \ncover conservation. I believe if we abandon the type of take-it-or-\nleave-it process that failed to allow full consideration of a whole \nrange of bills, as we have seen with this process of filling the tree, \nand look to the bipartisan template that was so effective during the \nfarm bill debate, we have a chance to pass an energy bill. That is the \nway the Senate works.\n  There are Senators on both sides of the aisle who want to do this. \nThey are listening to their constituents. They understand.\n  I want to go back to the farm bill. If you recall, last November it \nlooked as though the farm bill was dead. The legislation responsible \nfor ensuring America's food security had fallen victim to disagreement \nabout amendments. There were 285 amendments filed to the farm bill, and \nthe stalemate over process lasted weeks. But at the end of the day, the \nmajority and minority leaders agreed to 20 amendments on each side. \nVoting began on December 11, and the farm bill was passed by 79 votes \non December 14. Argument over process had lasted for weeks. Yet in 4 \ndays the Senate was able to breeze through an incredibly complex \nreauthorization bill. Senators did not need to vote on 285 amendments, \nbut they did need enough votes to ensure the Senate could fully \nconsider the measure and do the job.\n  The farm bill debate not only proved reasonable accommodation of \nprocess can be found on important issues, but it also proved the power \nof bipartisanship to allow this body to serve the American people. The \nfarm bill couldn't have been passed without Senators on both sides \ncoming together for the greater good of the Nation.\n  The American people are in desperate need of a good energy policy. We \ndon't need to vote on every amendment that has been filed, but there is \nno reason we can't start out with seven amendments on each side. Time \nshould not be a problem either, as surely it will not take the 4 days \nit took doing the farm bill. Maybe this could be shorter. But we need \nto do it. We need to move forward. Americans are demanding it.\n  I will be the first to sign up. I want to work with the Presiding \nOfficer. I want to work with others. We need to find a bill that finds \nmore and uses less. Let's find something for production, for \nconservation, and speculation. Do it all. That is what the Senate \nshould have a chance to vote on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand I am entitled to speak now, for how long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before the Senator leaves the floor, I wanted to say--I \nwanted to talk about three things, briefly.\n  First, the Senator is talking about an amendment that I cosponsored \nwith him. He adequately explained that if the tree were not filled by \nthe majority leader, that amendment could very well be before the \nSenate. It is very important and very simple. We would have a chance at \nsome point in time to vote, would we not, on that amendment? And it \nwould say we are going to open the 85 percent of the offshore of the \nUnited States that is closed today, and we are going to let the \nGovernors work with us and try to give them part of the royalties so we \ncan have a seamless growth in the offshore production, which could \nindeed change the supply-demand pendulum that is currently causing this \nbig spiral upwards that causes gasoline prices to go up--that is what \nthat amendment is for?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I say to my colleague from New Mexico, if the tree were \nnot filled, and the majority had not used that procedure, we could put \nit on the table and it would be another option for Americans to tap \ninto the resources that we have, more production and more opportunity. \nThat would have an impact today by telling folks we would have less \nscarcity in the future.\n  I tell my friend from New Mexico, because the tree has been filled, \nwe are not going to have the opportunity to have that debate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to make one more point. I heard the Senator talk \nabout his hope for a bipartisan bill. We could get plenty of people on \nbecause there ought to be Democrats who are for this. Wouldn't it help \na lot if eight or ten Democrats on the other side were to tell their \nleader they do not like this, they do not like the way he has filled \nthe tree, he ought to take down some of those amendments so we could go \nto work, bipartisan or otherwise, so we could try to have an amendment \nto vote on? That would help, wouldn't it?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I tell my friend from New Mexico I certainly can't \ninfluence what the majority leader does. But I\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\nhave to believe the American people are talking to me as I know they \nare talking to the Senator from New Mexico. When I go home, they are \nscared, they are anxious. They have to be speaking to folks on both \nsides of the aisle. If that voice is then heard by the majority leader, \nmaybe then we could have an opportunity to fully debate and fully \nconsider the most important issue facing Americans today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't know where the voices are going. All the voices \nin America, up to 75 percent, are saying they want to open the offshore \nso we will have that asset for them to use. You cannot do that without \nhaving a vote on the Senate floor. That would not happen but by a \nmiracle; you would have a vote.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I say to my colleague, as one who is on the forefront of \nrenewable technology in Minnesota, we pride ourselves as being the land \nof 10,000 lakes. Actually, we have more than that. Minnesota is prone \nto understatement. But clean water and clean air is an important part \nof where we live. We are an environmentally strong State. The people of \nMinnesota are telling me: Senator Coleman, we have to do it all. We \nneed to open drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf; we need more \nproduction; we need commitment to consume less, but we also need the \nopportunity to find more and produce more. Those are the voices I am \nhearing in Minnesota. I have to believe we are hearing it in New Mexico \nand Arkansas and Pennsylvania and throughout this country.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That amendment the Senator has spoken of that he was \ngoing to offer, but it is out of order--he is going to have to ask the \nmajority leader for permission. That is a real strange U.S. Senate. I \nnever understood that we had anybody of whom you had to go ask \npermission, but that is the way they have it set up. You will have to \ngo ask him. If he says no, you can't offer this wonderful amendment.\n  The second part of your amendment is the part that concerns energy, \nand it could be working within a couple of years, couldn't it? The part \non batteries that would help us with new electric cars, it could come \non by the numbers, by the hundreds?\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I would say to the Senator from New Mexico, there has to \nbe strong bipartisan support for moving forward on new battery \ntechnology. I do not know who is against that; it is part of the \nsolution. More production is part of the solution. More conservation is \npart of the solution. Addressing speculation is part of the solution. \nBut, unfortunately, because of this process that we are seeing so much \nmore frequently today, we are losing the ability for the Senate to do \nwhat the American public expects the Senate to do, and that is to have \na full debate, put the ideas on the table, and let it come to \nconclusion. I want to come to conclusion.\n  I want a bill. We have a process that is set up right now to fail, to \nsay we addressed it or say somebody blocked it, and move on without any \nreal desire to solve the problem. I think that is a great tragedy. I \nthink it is inconsistent with the traditions of the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to say, the Senator from Minnesota couldn't put \nit more clearly before the American people than he has done. He has \ntried to offer an amendment that goes right to the problem and \nconfronts it head on. The Senator has heard from the Parliamentarian--\nyou have requested permission to offer the amendment, and you heard you \ncannot. Why you cannot is because the tree is filled; that is, the \nnumber of amendments allowed has been filled by amendments by the \nmajority leader, and there is no more room. There is no more room for \nsomething really good--your amendment. There is no room for it.\n  You have shown everybody what that all means. This means we are going \nto be around here telling the American people: We cannot help you. We \ncannot help you with the amendment that you talked about because we \ncannot consider it.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Unfortunately, the Senator from New Mexico is right. We \ndo not have the opportunity to come before the American public and say \nwe fully debated, fully considered the opportunity to produce more \nenergy, to find more energy, to do more with conservation because the \ntree has been filled. Now, I believe that right of the Senate, that \nobligation and responsibility, cannot be fulfilled.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to proceed. How much time do \nI have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the Senator from Oklahoma wanted to speak?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have been listening to the debate. We need more supply. \nWe need to have about 10 Democrats come along and help us to pass the \nlegislation, the amendments that we have that would allow us to go out \nand drill and bring in energy.\n  Mr. President, I have two unanimous consent requests. First of all, I \nask unanimous consent that my statement be reflected in the Record \ntomorrow on the LIHEAP, S. 3186 vote; and, second, my statement \npertaining to the housing, H.R. 3221 vote tomorrow be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have spoken on the Senate floor about \nhow the majority leader has used this process and eliminated our \nability to offer amendments. I refer my colleagues to a speech given on \nthe floor last night by the senior Senator from Pennsylvania where he \nlays out a compelling case against the growth of this process known as \nfilling the tree by the majority leader in the Senate. It is a good \nspeech. My colleagues should read it and heed it, heed the warning, \nbecause the more it is used, the less this place is a Senate. The more \nit is used, the less we have the rights of Senators to offer amendments \nand debate and have votes because we are curtailed, cut off, eliminated \nby this process. You ought to read the speech and be fearful of the \nfuture of this institution but, more important--equally important--your \nrights as a Senator. You ought to be worried about that.\n  It will not be the Senate you thought it was if you sit around and \nlet this happen. We are going to stay on it until the leader \nunderstands that there is a group of Senators who do not like it and \nare not going to sit here and take it.\n  I would like to speak for a minute for the American people. I would \nlike to talk about a great amendment that is going to be pushed aside \nbecause of this short-circuiting in this bill. This amendment gets to \nthe heart of what we have been saying. We need to find more and use \nless.\n  We have a great quantity of American resources on the Atlantic and \nPacific offshore coast. So the first part of the Coleman-Domenici \namendment which Senator Coleman has been speaking about would allow the \ncoastal States--to say to those areas that we can open the waters \nwithin their offshore boundaries for leasing 50 miles out. Believe it \nor not, we know how to do that. Platforms can be built 50 miles out or \n60 miles out, drill down 50,000 feet and have 12 or 14 wells under one \nplatform. They do not have to drill a platform for each well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask, who has time next? How much time does the \nSenator have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes remaining under the control \nof the Republicans.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. I yield the floor and hope later on to talk \nsome more with the Senate about this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I commend Senator Domenici on his passion \nfor energy and what we need to do to preserve the future of our \ncountry. I have had a chance, as many Senators I am sure have, as well \nas Americans all over the country, to look in on the debate about \nenergy this week. Frankly, if it were not so serious and perhaps sad, \nit would be entertaining. I have been entertained to see my Democratic \ncolleagues bobbing and weaving and trying to change the subject and \ndeflect the attention from the real needs, trying to obscure 20 years \nof obstruction on developing American energy and to shift the blame to \nbig oil, to speculators or President Bush instead of talking about the \nreal subject.\n  It is sad that this is probably the most important issue of this \ngeneration. We know it is hurting Americans every day, who are paying \nmore and\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\nmore for gasoline, families who are just making ends meet, increasingly \nhaving to make the decision of whether to buy the gas they need to go \nto work or even buy the right food they need for their children.\n  This is a serious crisis. Yet we are playing games here on this very \nimportant issue. The Democratic majority will not even allow an open \nand honest debate. They will not allow Republicans to bring amendments \ndown because they fear their Members will have to take a vote to show \nAmerica where they stand on the issue.\n  If we had an open and honest debate, America would find out that \nDemocrats would prefer the prices to be high; that based on the input \nfrom the environmental extremists who tell them the higher the price \nis, the less fossil fuels we will use, that is better for the \nenvironment.\n  The problem is, over the last 20 years, as the Democrats have \nobstructed the development of nuclear energy, they have obstructed the \ndevelopment of America's own oil and natural gas supplies. Our \ndependence on foreign oil has gone up. We have burned more coal than \nother countries that have developed clean alternatives such as nuclear.\n  The environmental extremists have actually hurt the environment. They \nhave made our country hostage to other countries that would like to \nharm us. And when it comes to the point where we need to decide what we \nare going to do as a country, the majority leader will not even allow \nus amendments. He wants to ram it through and change the subject and go \non to the next thing.\n  That is where we are today. We have put in the middle of this the \nhousing bill, which, like the Energy bill, the majority leader will not \nallow any amendments to. This is a huge, unprecedented bill, putting on \nthe line $300 billion that can be used for mortgage companies to unload \nbad loans onto the taxpayers, making the Federal Government the owner \nof mortgages in real estate for the first time, and crossing that line \nbetween freedom and socialism where we actually get so involved in the \nprivate sector and the managing of the financial markets that our \ncountry is moving more toward a European style of socialism than the \nAmerica we know.\n  We have a bill here that on one side adds nearly $1 billion of taxes \non Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and then, on the other side, is asking \nAmerica to bail them out because they are not making enough money. That \nis the kind of logic Congress is using.\n  And we do not want to debate it. We want to get this thing done \nimmediately. The majority leader scheduled a vote that would come out \non Saturday. He did not give us the courtesy of offering one amendment. \nThen he is demanding that we shorten the time period so he can have a \nFriday vote and let folks go home.\n  I have been entertained by the suggestion that I have actually \nscheduled votes tomorrow. As I understand it, and the Parliamentarian \nmay want to correct me, there is only one person in this Senate who can \nschedule a vote. That is the majority leader on the Democratic side, \nand he scheduled a vote on Saturday and will not change it in order to \ngive us an amendment.\n  There are a lot of amendments that could improve this bill. Setting \nup a slush fund so local communities and their agencies can buy real \nestate and rehab it and sell it is a bad idea. It is a slush fund that \nis not going to be accountable. It puts those governments in the real \nestate business.\n  I wish to have an amendment to remove that, and to remove the new \ntaxes that are going to cost everybody who buys a home after we pass \nthis bill. Everybody is going to pay more to get a mortgage because \nthis bill adds taxes to it. The folks who are pushing it do not want \nyou to know that. The President had threatened to veto it over this bad \npolicy, but he decided to change his mind because he felt we so much \nneeded to provide the backup for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So because \nwe cannot have the amendments that we need to improve the bill, I asked \nfor one amendment that is basic and common sense.\n  We have seen in the Wall Street Journal and publications all over the \ncountry the growing suspicion that the fact that the reforms that were \nneeded for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over the last 10 years were not \neven talked about in Congress because of so many political \ncontributions to Congressmen and Senators.\n  Now, we do not like to think that about ourselves, but there is a \nreason Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spent over $200 million over the last \n10 years on campaign contributions to those of us here in the House and \nthe Senate, and they got something for it. They got left alone. They \ngrew out of control. They grew into a big monster where now we say they \nare too big to fail. If we let them fail, they are going to bring down \nthe whole American economy. So we have got to put the American taxpayer \nbehind them with an open checkbook to write any check that is needed to \nkeep them in business. That is what we are being told in this bill \nright now. If we are going to do that, if we are going to make the \nAmerican taxpayer stand behind those companies, then there is one \ncommonsense thing we can do to keep it more open and honest. These \norganizations that are now guaranteed by the American taxpayer should \nno longer be able to spend millions of dollars buying influence in \nCongress. That is a conflict of interest. My amendment would simply \nstop the political activity, the lobbying and the contributions of \nthese organizations which are now a part of the Federal Government \nbecause of this explicit guarantee. That is the only amendment I asked \nfor. We could have voted on it yesterday and finished the housing bill \nyesterday if the majority leader had wanted it. We could vote on it \ntoday and move straight to passage.\n  I have offered the majority leader several options. It does not even \nhave to be a part of this bill if he thinks it is going to delay it. \nAll I have asked for is a straight-up vote on this bill that would \neliminate lobbying by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and we could do it \nsometime before the end of the session.\n  We could vote on housing immediately, right now, send it to the \nPresident unchanged, so there would be no delay. But the majority \nleader is so afraid of asking his Democratic colleagues to vote on this \nbill that would ban lobbying, that benefits us so much in our \ncampaigns, he does not want them to take that vote in public view. So, \ninstead, he is going to keep everyone here Saturday and try to say I am \nscheduling this vote when, in fact, he is scheduling that vote because \nhe does not want the lobbying and the campaign contributions to stop \nfrom these organizations which are now basically being backed up by the \nfull faith and credit of the American people.\n  That is what is going on here. It would be entertaining if it were \nnot so sad. Again, the blame is trying to be deflected to someone else \nso the American people cannot see where people stand. Instead of having \namendments we can vote on, and instead of seeing where people stand on \nthe lobbying of these organizations the American people now have to \nstand behind, they are trying to blame it on the fact that we are going \nto have a Saturday vote.\n  Over half the American people do not want us to pass this bill. They \ndeserve a voice in this Chamber. And if there is no one else who is \ngoing to stand up and speak against it, I will, because it is wrong to \npass a bill of this magnitude so quickly, 700 pages that have not been \nread by one Senator here. It has so many flaws in it that they want to \nget it off the floor before people figure out what is in it. It is a \nmistake to pass this bill so quickly. I am not going to allow it to go \nthrough today. We are going to be here tomorrow for a vote because \npeople are afraid to show the American people what they stand for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if we wanted to solve this \nproblem on energy, if we wanted to solve the problem on health care, if \nwe wanted to solve the problem on housing, which we are finally going \nto get to final passage on tomorrow, if we wanted to do it and we had \nthe political will, we could.\n  The problem is the Senate is all wound around the axle because people \ncannot get along with each other. That is being reflected in the two \nleaders not being able to get agreement on unanimous consent, which to \noperate in this\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\nSenate is necessary to have that kind of good will and mutual trust.\n  Yet we do not have it. So now someone is listening on TV or sitting \nup in the galleries right now and hearing the statements on this floor \nthat are completely contradictory of each other. We have had statements \non this floor over the last several days. People say, for example: \nWell, there is no problem drilling out in the waters off of the Outer \nContinental Shelf of the United States because we do not have any \nexperience on oil spills now.\n  As a matter of fact, we have had Senators on this floor who have said \nthere were no oil spills after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. And, of \ncourse, I have pointed out the White House itself came out with a \nreport, Lessons Learned After Hurricane Katrina. It came out in \nFebruary of 2006. I quoted at length from that document that pointed \nout over 7.4 million gallons of oil were spilled after Hurricane \nKatrina. That is the White House report.\n  But let me give you another example. We have had, including the \nRepublican Leader has said: There was not a drop of oil spilled after \nHurricane Katrina.\n  I want to show you a satellite photo. This is a NOAA photo 4 days \nafter Hurricane Katrina. This is the coast, the gulf coast. Would you \nlook at the oil spills that are out there as a result of Hurricane \nKatrina, a Category 3, and it was a Category 4 at one point out in the \nGulf.\n  What is it doing to those oil platforms? What do you think all of \nthat is? That is oil. What do you think all of that is? It is oil. What \ndo you think all of that is? And that. And that. And that. And that. It \nis oil.\n  I am pointing out that people are making extreme statements that have \nno basis in truth. As a result, we are getting ourselves so worked up \ninto our own little positions that if we wanted to, we could come \ntogether and we could have a bill that could be part speculation, part \ndrilling.\n  There are still plenty of places out there to be drilled. I am not \ntalking about the 68 million acres that are under lease, under lease by \nthe oil companies on public lands, the lands of the U.S. Government, \nthe 68 million acres that are under lease to the oil companies that \nhave not been drilled that are out in the Gulf of Mexico. There are 32 \nmillion acres that have been leased and have not been drilled.\n  This Senator knows something about that because 2 years ago, we did a \ncompromise to try to protect the interests of Florida from oil spills \non our beaches, from oil spills in our delicate estuaries that spawn so \nmuch of the marine life in the gulf, indeed, to try to protect the \ninterests of the national security of the country in keeping oil rigs \naway from the military testing and training area, which is the largest \ntesting and training area for our military in the world.\n  So we struck a compromise. Originally they wanted 2.5 million acres, \nbut it was headed on a line straight from Tampa Bay, entering the \nmilitary mission area. Instead, we worked out a compromise where they \ngot four times as much. They got 8.3 million acres. But we kept it away \nfrom the military testing and training area and kept it away from the \ncoast of Florida where that testing and training area is.\n  We worked it out then 2 years ago. But now that is not enough, even \nthough none of that 8.3 million acres has been drilled. This is getting \nto be ridiculous in the amount of hyperbole and rhetoric and, oh, the \nsky is falling, the sky is falling, when it would take that for us to \ncome together and have a bill that would go after speculation, the \nunregulated speculation after the Enron loophole was opened that allows \nunregulated trading.\n  I have commentary here. I will not go through it. I have got three \noil executives who have testified to the Congress saying that in normal \nsupply and demand, one executive says, would have oil at $60 a barrel; \nanother executive says it would be $50 to $55 a barrel.\n  These are oil company executives saying, if the world oil market were \nonly operating by supply and demand, but it isn't. It is up close to \n$130 a barrel. So there are other factors contributing to it. One of \nthem is unregulated speculation on these unregulated markets that bid \nthat price up and up and up. We can address that. We can address \ndrilling in other parts of the gulf. In addition to the 68 million \nacres of public lands, there are more public lands that you could drill \nin in the central and western gulf, if we really wanted to, but \neverybody wants to sit around here and fight.\n  Then we could do something really important. We could get serious \nabout putting Federal money into research and development for \nalternative fuels and creating new engines and tapping renewables such \nas Sun and wind, really get serious about that, get serious as we did \nwhen we finally raised the miles per gallon. It only took us the 8 \nyears that I have been in the Senate to increase the miles per gallon \non the fleet average of our cars.\n  My goodness, look who is in trouble in Detroit. It is not Toyota and \nother foreign manufacturers. They have a 50-miles-per-gallon standard \nin Japan and in the high 40s in Europe. It is not those automobile \ncompanies. It is the American automobile companies that are in \nfinancial trouble because they have fought us the whole way on \nincreasing miles per gallon. Their problems, as we say back home, are \nlike chickens coming home to roost. We could do that, if we just had \nthe political will and we would put our differences aside.\n  On this issue of speculation, the bill that was turned down today \nbecause we can't get 60 votes to cut off debate to get to the \nspeculation bill, I know Senators on the other side are saying they are \nnot able to offer amendments, but again, it could happen like ``that,'' \nif we would get together to offer a certain number of amendments and \nuse the speculation bill that Senators on that side have already spoken \nin favor of. If we wanted to, we could get it done.\n  We do need an additional law on speculation because when we tried to \nplug the loophole in the farm bill, we didn't completely plug it. \nSenator Reid has offered this leadership bill that reins in speculation \nby imposing limits to ensure that legitimate speculation doesn't get \nout of hand. It is a complicated approach, but it can get us to where \nwe need to be. I believe there are some improvements that could be made \nto the bill. If we really wanted to come to agreement, we could have \nthose amendments offered. If we pass a bill that allows speculators to \nevade limits of how much they can control, then we are going to be in \nthe worst of all possible worlds--a bill that purports to tamp down on \nspeculation but fails to do so.\n  Wall Street financiers and the Wall Street Journal call the effort to \nshut down excessive speculation ``misguided.'' They say that the \nspiking price of a barrel of oil is just the market telling us that \ndemand exceeds supply. But ask yourself if that makes sense. When the \nSaudis agreed to increase production--in other words, increasing \nsupply--there wasn't any decrease in the price of oil. The price of oil \nkeeps on spiraling, and there is no evidence that dramatically \nincreased demand is going to do anything but allow speculative money to \npour into the energy futures markets.\n  We have had the CEOs of all the various airlines come to see us. They \nwrote all Senators a letter. They said:\n\n       Normal market forces are being dangerously amplified by \n     poorly regulated market speculation. The nation needs to pull \n     together to reform the oil markets and solve this growing \n     problem.\n\n  That is the CEOs of every major airline.\n  What do we hear in this debate? We hear: Drill here, drill now, pay \nless. It is an easy slogan, but it will not solve it because it is \ncruelly misleading and deceitful.\n  If we are really going to do something, we are going to have to have \nthe political will in a bipartisan way to get to the bottom of this. \nThink about it. Why such a seductive argument about ``drill here, drill \nnow,'' when, in fact, there is 68 million acres that has not been \ndrilled of public lands? What does that do for oil companies? The more \nleases of acres they can have, the more reserves they can show on their \nbooks, which is shown as an asset, increases the value of the oil \ncompany. That, of course, is to their advantage. But unless we can get \nthem to start drilling and show good faith that they are going to drill \non the 68 million acres they have now, why is that the answer? Well, it \nisn't.\n  That is, again, where we need the balanced approach--alternative \nfuels,\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\nrein in speculation, drill where it is available now with existing \npermits, drill onshore, offshore, continue to work with our \ninternational partners, lessen our consumption of foreign oil by doing \nall of the above plus shifting to alternative fuels with a vigorous \nresearch-and-development project of developing those alternative fuels \nand alternative motors.\n  I have had the privilege of being a part of one of this Nation's \ngreat accomplishments; when a young President said, in the midst of the \nCold War, when we looked as if we were having our lunch being eaten by \nthe Soviet Union because they were taking the high ground in space and \nwe had not even flown John Glenn in orbit, President Kennedy said: We \nare going to the Moon and back in 9 years. If ever there has been an \nexample of a nation having a determination and coming together in a \nbipartisan way and focusing the political will on solving what seemed \nto be an insolvable task and committing the resources, that is the \nexample of how to do it.\n  Another example I can think of is 1983. We were at a point in which \nSocial Security was going to run out of funds within 6 months. Social \nSecurity was not going to be able to pay its bills. Two old Irishmen--\none the President of the United States, President Reagan, and the other \none the Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill--got together and said: We \nare going to solve this in a bipartisan way. We are going to put \ntogether a bipartisan, prestigious panel, and they are going to come up \nwith the recommendations of how we can make Social Security actuarially \nsound and safe. That is another one of the great examples where \npolitical leaders of different parties came together in a bipartisan \nway and took that highly volatile issue of Social Security off the \ntable at the next election by saying: We are going to solve it, because \nwe had the political will. We had the political will in the Apollo \nproject going to the Moon and, in 1983, to solve the Social Security \ncrisis.\n  If we had the political will in a bipartisan way to solve this energy \ncrisis right now, right here, we could do it. But you can't do it if \nthe attitude is ``my way or the highway.'' You have to do what this \nbody is best adapted to do. As the Good Book says: Come, let us reason \ntogether. Let us work this problem out together.\n  I am tired of hearing all of this excessive rhetoric. I am tired of \nhearing this rhetoric that does not display truth. I am tired of \nhearing the ``it is my way or no way'' attitude. Our people out there \nwant us to solve this problem, not only for here and now but for \ngenerations to come. For example, since we get in excess of 60 percent \nof our daily oil from foreign shores, can you imagine the disruption of \nany one of those foreign sources such as coming out of the Persian \nGulf, such as coming from Nigeria, such as coming from Venezuela, all \nof which are substantial percentages of our daily consumption of oil? \nCan you imagine what that would do if it happened today or if it \nhappened to our children or our grandchildren? It is up to us to solve \nthis by coming together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, let me first say to my colleague from \nFlorida that he is very correct in making the statement that the only \nway you solve big problems around here is if you work together. That \nhas happened in the past. It certainly has happened here in the Senate \nin the last several years, as we have worked on energy legislation. The \npassage of the 2005 act was an example of Republicans and Democrats \ncoming together and passing what was one of the most significant pieces \nof energy legislation in recent times. The passage of the 2006 \nlegislation, which the Senator from Florida supported, which opened \nlease sale 181 and 8 million acres of the gulf coast for exploration, \nis another example of that bipartisanship. This last year, passage of \nthe Energy Efficiency Act, signed by the President in December, was \nalso another example of Republicans and Democrats working together to \nreach for higher efficiency with new CAFE standards that have been long \nneglected and doing other things to move forward with alternative fuels \nand trying to create an energy future for America that works.\n  Those pieces of legislation all came together because of the \nwillingness of Democrats and Republicans to move forward on the energy \nagenda. I hope we can find the same kind of bipartisan spirit in moving \nahead now on the next chapter to try to address the pain Americans are \nfeeling at the pump. I appreciate his comments and his wisdom in this \narea.\n  I come to the floor to speak in support of the housing bill which we \nare now debating in the postcloture timeframe.\n  Housing is an incredibly important part of the American economy. \nHousing is, in fact, a cornerstone of the American economy. Many of the \neconomic ills which the United States is feeling today, frankly, have \nbeen brought about because of the housing crisis we are seeing today.\n  Since housing prices peaked in the summer of 2006, our Nation has \nseen some very sharp declines in home values. We have seen a staggering \ndecrease in the number of home starts and home sales, and we have seen \na dramatic increase in the number of foreclosures nationwide.\n  For most people across America, and certainly in my State of \nColorado, when you drive down a neighborhood and you see there are \nsigns, where there were very few of these signs 2 years ago--but now \nthe signs are not only sprouting up everywhere with houses that are for \nsale, but you also see price-reduced signs--we know we have a \ntremendous glut in the housing market, in part, caused by the number of \nhomes we have in foreclosure.\n  So a picture of this kind of a sign that you see in front of a home \nis a picture that tells a story about a family who has lost their home \nor is losing most of their equity in their home, as they try to sell it \nat some reduced price. It is a pain that is being felt all across the \ncountry, and it is certainly being felt in my State of Colorado.\n  In the State of Colorado, this is what has happened with respect to \nforeclosure filings over the last 4 years. In the year 2003, the whole \nState of Colorado saw about 10,000 foreclosures that year. Now in 2007, \nwe are seeing a foreclosure number that is almost 50,000 homes being \nforeclosed upon in the State of Colorado. You can see the dramatic \nincrease in the number of homes that have been foreclosed upon in my \nState of Colorado.\n  Mr. President, 1 in 45 households in the State of Colorado has filed \nfor foreclosure. This is not a problem which is circumscribed in some \nway only to those tens of thousands--hundreds and hundreds of \nthousands--of Americans who are facing foreclosure. It is also a \nproblem that affects the entire American population that is in home \nownership because as houses have been foreclosed upon, as the housing \nmarket has faced such a huge glut in terms of the large inventory that \nis out there in the market, it has had a dramatic impact also on the \nvalues of the homes in the neighborhoods.\n  In Colorado, as we look ahead at 2008 and 2009, we know there are \nabout 50,000 more homes that will be foreclosed upon in 2008 and 2009, \nas adjustable rate mortgages adjust upward and families will no longer \nbe able to afford to pay the higher mortgage rates. But what also \nhappens as that occurs is the surrounding homes will suffer declines in \nvalues.\n  According to the Center for Responsible Lending, it is expected that \nabout 750,000 homes in the State of Colorado will see a decline in \ntheir value. So it is a problem which does start with the foreclosure \nmarket and the financial markets that we have seen, but it spreads out \ninto all of America that is in home ownership, including most of the \nhome ownership in my State of Colorado.\n  Mr. President, 748,000 homes--almost 750,000 homes--represent almost \nhalf of the homes in the State of Colorado that are going to see a \nsignificant decline in value. So it is a major problem we face.\n  I am thankful for the leadership of the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Dodd, as well as the ranking member, Senator Shelby, \nand all of those who have worked to put this housing package together.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I am honored to have had a \nsmall part in putting together parts of this bill working with Senator \nBaucus, the chairman of the committee, and\n\n[[Page S7457]]\n\nSenator Grassley, the ranking member of the committee.\n  I think it is instructive that this legislation appears to have the \nkind of broad bipartisan support we ought to have when we are \naddressing the major problems that face America today. Certainly, I am \nhopeful by the time we get to about this time tomorrow we will have had \na housing bill that will help the people of America.\n  This legislation contains numerous provisions that will help us \naddress this cornerstone of our economy.\n  First of all, the bill provides targeted relief to families and \ncommunities that are affected by foreclosure. The legislation will \nreverse the downward trend in home values and sales and get the housing \nmarket back on track.\n  The housing bill contains help for homeowners, for homebuilders, and \nfor home buyers. It creates a tax incentive to reinvigorate the housing \nmarket by providing a refundable first-time home buyer credit of 10 \npercent of the purchase of a home--up to $8,000--for homes that are \npurchased between April of this year and April of 2009. That $8,000 tax \ncredit will create major incentives for new homeowners to buy homes and \nhelp us get rid of the glut we currently have in the market.\n  In addition, the legislation provides tax relief for families that \nare facing high property taxes. It is the kind of middle-class tax \nrelief we ought to be working on more in this country. This tax relief \nwill provide nonitemizing taxpayers the opportunity to deduct their \nproperty taxes from the taxes they currently pay.\n  In addition, the housing bill will increase the availability of \nstable home financing, and it will do so by allowing Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac and the Federal Housing Authority greater flexibility in \nterms of the kinds of mortgages they can purchase and insure. That will \nhave the direct consequence of increasing the availability of stable \ncredit.\n  In addition, an amendment in the Finance Committee that was sponsored \nby Senator Kerry will add $11 billion in the use of tax-exempt mortgage \nrevenue bonds. That will provide low-interest financing and refinancing \nassistance to low- and moderate-income home buyers. That is an \nimportant component of this legislation.\n  The housing bill also contains help for families and communities \naffected by foreclosure. It does so in a variety of ways. One way is it \nwill provide $150 million for credit counseling.\n  In the State of Colorado, we have developed a foreclosure assistance \nhotline. It has helped tens of thousands of families since the \nbeginning of this program a few months ago. What we have found through \nforeclosure counseling in the State of Colorado is that 80 percent of \nfamilies who contact the foreclosure hotline ultimately end up \nrenegotiating their loan terms at their bank and are able to stay in \ntheir home. So it is a very successful program, and the $150 million \nthat is included in this legislation for mortgage foreclosure \ncounseling assistance will be very helpful in keeping people in their \nhomes.\n  The legislation also helps communities which have been, in many \ncases, devastated by the number of foreclosures, and it will do so by \nadding $3.9 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Program, \nwhich will help communities purchase and rehabilitate foreclosed homes.\n  It is also important there are protections against future \nforeclosures by requiring mortgage companies to have stronger \ndisclosure requirements, all in the name of truth in lending, so home \nbuyers know what it is they are getting into prior to the time they are \nsigning on the dotted line of very extensive documents.\n  I am proud of this bill. This housing bill sends a strong signal to \nthe families and businesses of America that we care about one of the \ncornerstones of our economy in America today.\n  It sends a strong signal to the financial markets that we in Congress \ncan work together, Democrats and Republicans, to address one of the \ntoughest economic issues our country has seen. Indeed, the housing \ncrisis we are looking at today is probably the worst housing crisis \nsince the Great Depression. That is why it requires strong medicine to \ncure the problem. The legislation we have in front of us will do \nexactly that.\n  In conclusion, this legislation represents months of hard work and \nbipartisan cooperation to address this key cornerstone of our economy. \nCongress should pass this legislation here, hopefully in the next 24 \nhours, and send it to the President for his immediate signature, so the \nlegislation can start providing the cure that is so needed for America \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for listening and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yesterday I drew the Senate's attention to \nan editorial in the Wall Street Journal. It said that liberal leaders \nin Congress are ``gripped by a cold-sweat terror. If they permit a vote \non offshore drilling, they know they will lose. . . .''\n  Today's Washington Post featured a similar editorial, which you \nnormally don't get that would be favorable to the conservative view. \nThey said:\n\n       Why not have a vote on offshore drilling? There's a serious \n     debate to be had over whether Congress should lift the ban on \n     drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf that has been in \n     place since 1981. Unfortunately, you won't be hearing it in \n     the House of Representatives--certainly, you won't find \n     lawmakers voting on it--anytime soon.\n\n  This same editorial ended with another good question. It said:\n\n       If drilling opponents really have the better of this \n     argument, why are they so worried about letting it come to a \n     vote?\n\n  That is critical.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Florida and the junior Senator \nfrom Colorado were talking about: Let's all get along. Let's work \ntogether. Let's have a bipartisan solution.\n  I think we should. All you have to have for a bipartisan solution is \na vote. For those people--and I am sorry to say it is right down party \nlines--ever since the veto took place back in the middle 1990s, when \nwe, the Republicans, were the majority, we tried to open everything for \nexploration: the Outer Continental Shelf, ANWR. And, of course, we have \nthose huge other reserves that if we had been able to do that, we would \nnot be faced with this problem today. Yet all we want now is a vote.\n  So I do not know why becoming self-sufficient for America should be a \npartisan issue. Look at the reserves. Look at the possibility of what \nis out there, what we would be enjoying today if it had not been for \nthat veto.\n  Now, that is not the worst part. The worst part is that if you go to \nmy Web site, epw.senate.gov, you will see I have called up every vote \nthat has taken place since that 1995 veto; and right down party lines, \nDemocrats refused to increase the supply of oil and gas in America.\n  Look at the Outer Continental Shelf. We have been talking about that. \nThat is what all these editorials are about. Look at ANWR. That is not \nas much as a lot of people think, although anyone who has been to ANWR, \nwho has been up there, they don't come back saying it is a pristine \nwilderness, because it is not. It is a frozen tundra. Everybody up \nthere wants to explore there. We know. We have a pipeline ready. That \ncould be coming down here.\n  The Rocky Mountain oil shales--that is the biggest of all reserves \nout there. Right now we are under a Democrat-sponsored moratorium that \nkeeps us from getting at those oil shales. We are talking about 2 \ntrillion barrels. It is huge.\n  The Senate has been in session all week. It held one vote Tuesday and \ntwo votes this morning. Those were both procedural votes. All we want \nto do is consider amendments.\n  When my good friends from Florida and Colorado say: We want to all \ncooperate with each other, all we have to do is bring out amendments \nand vote on them, I would love to have the Senator from Colorado have \nthe opportunity to vote in favor of expanding the supply of oil and gas \nin America.\n  A lot of people have tried to denigrate the idea of supply and \ndemand, and yet there is no one I know of in America who has gone \nthrough the high school level who has not studied supply and demand. It \nis a very simple thing.\n  The Senate Democrat majority, after wasting an entire week, is \nengaged in a process, a scheme, to go ahead and have some votes \ntomorrow.\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\n  By the way, let me share, as I did once before earlier, the two bills \nthat will be voted on tomorrow are bills that I have opposed in the \npast. I think it is very interesting, when they talk about LIHEAP, when \nthey talk about doing something about supplying gas to heat homes in \nthe Northeast, instead of subsidizing, let's open the supply line, \nlet's start producing gas and oil, and bring the price down so we do \nnot have to subsidize it. It is a very simple thing. So I am going to \nvote ``no'' on that. I oppose it. In fact, I do not even think I will \nstay here for that vote.\n  The other one--the housing vote--I respectfully disagree with some of \nthe comments that were made. Of course, we do not have some of the \nproblems in Oklahoma they do in other places. But, nonetheless, the \nidea is we could have been doing these all week long, but we also could \nhave been doing amendments. We could have been voting on amendments.\n\n  We have consistently tried not only to go out there and explore and \nto develop the resources we have--we are the only country in the world \nthat doesn't export our own resources--but we also have to have an \nincrease in refinery capacity. I have to say this: We have--I \npersonally have in legislation not just opening it up for exploration \nso that we can increase the supply but also refining it. If we had all \nthe supply in the world, we wouldn't have the refining capacity because \nof some of the stringent requirements we have in this country and the \nunwillingness to allow new refineries in the United States. We wouldn't \nhave the refinery capacity. So I have what is called the Gas Price Act. \nI introduced it some time ago--I guess 3 years ago now--and we never \nhave been able to get it passed. It divides right down party lines. The \nDemocrats will not allow us to increase our refining capacity. This is \na bill no one should be opposed to.\n  A lot of people know what the BRAC process is, the Base Realignment \nand Closure Commission. What we have had an opportunity to do is to \nclose some of these bases, these military installations that are not \nperforming a function commensurate with the cost. What do the adjoining \ncommunities do when this happens? They are in dire straits economically \nbecause they don't have anything to do with that property. Yet this \nwould allow them to do it and have EDA grants to attract refining \noperations in these areas.\n  That is what the Gas Price Act was all about. That is what we have \ncurrently in legislation that we hope will be considered before very \nlong.\n  We are presently considering a bill to impose new rules on \nspeculating, claiming that speculators have been driving up the price \nof oil. It is always easy to find somebody to blame when we have not \ndone the responsible thing as legislators. I know it is tough for some \nDemocrats to face up to some of the extremists, the environmentalists, \nand agree to go ahead and develop the resources we have and explore and \nproduce and drill for oil. However, if you talk to the smart people out \nthere who are looking at this bill--this bill we are talking about is \ntrying to blame everything on speculators. T. Boone Pickens, who has \nhad a lot of attention recently, says:\n\n       Speculation doesn't have anything to do with it. You have \n     85 million barrels of oil available in the world and demand \n     is at 86.4.\n\n  Warren Buffett:\n\n       It is not speculation, it is supply and demand.\n\n  Walter Williams. This is a good one. He says:\n\n       Congressional attacks on speculation do not alter the oil \n     market's fundamental demand and supply conditions.\n\n  Then the International Energy Agency says:\n\n       Blaming speculation is an easy solution which avoids taking \n     the necessary steps to improve supply-side access and \n     investment.\n\n  I see the Senator on the floor who will be able to go into some other \naspects of this. I think this debate is very significant, but the \ndebate in absence of votes is really meaningless, except we are letting \nthe American people know that it is the Democrats in the Senate and in \nthe House of Representatives who are not allowing the Republicans to \npass legislation that will increase the supply and will bring down the \nprice of gas at the pumps. I will be going back tonight to my State of \nOklahoma, and I can assure you, the No. 1 problem in the Nation is the \nprice of gas at the pumps.\n  Let me clarify one thing before I yield the floor. I have known Boone \nPickens for a long time. Let me tell you, he is not very pleased with \nthe misinterpretation that the Democrats are coming down and \nattributing to him. When he ends his ad saying, ``We can't drill \nourselves out of this problem,'' he is talking about, we have to drill \neverywhere. This is his statement. We need to drill on the Outer \nContinental Shelf. We have to drill in ANWR. We have to have the Rocky \nMountain oil shales. We have to preserve access to the Canadian oil \nsands. We need it all. Even after all of this, we still need to do \nmore. I agree with that. I have another piece of legislation that will \nhelp him in taking the compressed natural gas so it can be used to get \na more immediate response to this growing problem in America.\n  So I would only say we need to keep talking about this. The American \npeople need to keep listening until they realize and accept the fact \nthat the Democrats are blocking the Republicans from increasing the \nsupply of oil and gas, and we are not going to be able to bring down \nthe price at the pumps until we are successful and have enough public \nsupport to get this country back producing again.\n  It is interesting. If you look at the polling data, one State--I \nwon't mention the State because it is quite a liberal State \nphilosophically--2 years ago, only 28 percent of the people in that \nState wanted to drill on ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf. Today, \nit is 68 percent. So with that, I think it is a very simple solution. \nWe need to get busy with it to increase our supply.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe I am recognized for 10 minutes; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to speak for as long \nas he wishes to speak under his 1 hour of cloture.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the Chair to advise me when I have spoken for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so advised.\n\n\n                             Majority Power\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I wish to congratulate the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma for bringing some facts to the floor of the Senate which \nneed to be stated over and over, one of which is that we as a nation \nhave a significant supply of oil and natural gas which we are not using \nand which, if we did use, would significantly reduce the price of \ngasoline and home heating oil for Americans. If we produce more \nAmerican energy and we conserve more American energy, we will reduce \nthe price of gasoline and home heating oil for Americans.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma has so appropriately pointed out, there \nis a huge amount of available resources which are locked up now because \nof language in legislation which was placed there by the Democratic \nleadership of this Congress--language which limits our ability to drill \non the Outer Continental Shelf, which we can do in a safe and \nenvironmentally sound way, and language which limits our ability to use \noil shale, of which there is 2 trillion barrels of reserve, which is \ntwice the reserves of Saudi Arabia. So the resources are there, but we \ncan't get to them because we have legislative language at the Federal \nlevel which locks down those resources.\n  What we have asked for as a party is the ability, first, to debate \nthat fact, and secondly, to have a vote in this Senate of the United \nStates on the issue of whether we should be able to drill on the Outer \nContinental Shelf and explore on the Outer Continental Shelf, to use \noil shale, to use more nuclear power, to create electric cars, to \nconserve energy, to have renewables. But we are being barred from \nhaving that vote.\n  The Democratic leader, for the 15th time in this Congress, has done \nwhat is known as ``fill up the tree,'' which means he has essentially \nlocked down the floor so that only one person, one person in this body, \ngets to decide what is voted on, what amendments are allowed to come to \nthe floor, and what the debate will be about, and that becomes the \nmajority leader of the\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\nDemocratic Party of the Senate, the leader of the Democratic Party.\n  That is not the way the Senate was supposed to function. We are on a \nserious slippery slope to destroying the integrity and the purpose of \nthe Senate. This continual action of barring Members of the Senate from \ncoming to the floor and offering amendments in what has been the \nregular and typical order of the Senate for over 200 years is truly \nundermining the character of the Senate and, as a result, it undermines \nthe character of democracy in this country.\n  You don't have to believe me. Let me quote from a little pamphlet \nthat is put out called ``Traditions of the U.S. Senate.'' It is \nactually published by the Senate, and I think the majority leader's \noffice may pay for this. Let me quote from the leading authority in the \nhistory of the Senate on the issue of the way the Senate works--on its \nhistory, its prerogatives, and procedure--a Senator who has served in \nthe Senate longer than any other Senator and who has cast more votes in \nthe Senate than any other Senator. He has held the position of majority \nleader. He is the senior Senator from West Virginia, and he still \nserves here. Let me quote. He was giving a lecture or a speech or a set \nof comments to a new group of Senators who had come to the Senate in \n1996.\n  Robert C. Byrd said to those Senators:\n\n       Few, if any, upper chambers in the history of the western \n     world have possessed the Senate's absolute right to unlimited \n     debate and to amend and block legislation passed by a lower \n     House.\n\n  Let me read that again because it is very important because it really \ndoes go to the essence of what the Senate has for its power:\n\n       Few, if any, upper chambers in the history of the western \n     world have possessed the Senate's absolute right--\n\n  Absolute right--\n\n     to unlimited debate and to amend and block legislation passed \n     by a lower House.\n\n  He goes on to explain why this is the situation:\n\n       The Framers recognized that a minority can be right and \n     that a majority can be wrong.\n\n  This is Robert C. Byrd, the leading authority on the Senate, its \npurpose within the context and the constellation of American democracy.\n  The essence of the Senate is the ability of Members to bring \namendments to the floor--especially minority Members of the Senate--to \nbring amendments to the floor and have them voted on, have them \ndiscussed, and have unlimited debate if that is what is needed. Without \nthat right, the Senate no longer functions as set up by the Framers. \nThe Senate becomes an institution like the House of Representatives, \nwhich is dominated by the majority to the point where the minority \nessentially has no rights.\n  It is not minority Senators who are being denied their rights when \nthe Senate rules are changed so fundamentally by one individual--the \nmajority leader--when 200 years of precedence is thrown aside, and when \nthe majority leader decides to take an autocratic position here in the \nSenate. It is not minority Members whose rights are being lost; it is \nall the people of this Nation who are represented by those of us who \nare sent to the Senate to speak for them in the American people's \nforum. Where they get to be heard and they cannot be muzzled is here in \nthe Senate. It is not in the House of Representatives because in the \nHouse of Representatives, Members can be muzzled. In the Senate, for \n200 years, Members and the rights of Members have never been trampled \non to the point where Members have been muzzled, but that is exactly \nwhat is happening under this Putin form of democracy which is being \nplaced on the Senate.\n  What we have occurring here is a situation where power--the desire \nfor power by the majority party--is taking absolute precedence over the \nability of the people to present policy, have it debated, and have it \nvoted on.\n  In this instance, of course, where the right of the people, through \nthe amendment process, to be heard on whether we should have drilling \non the Outer Continental Shelf, on whether we should use oil shale, on \nwhether we should use more nuclear power, on whether we should have \nelectric cars--the denial of the right of the people to be heard on \nthose issues is doing the people fundamental harm because we are not \nbeing allowed to bring up those issues, as the price of gasoline is \nreally having a staggering impact on Americans.\n  I can tell you that in New England and in New Hampshire, the fear of \nhaving home heating oil prices triple this winter has a lot of folks \nvery scared--and rightly so. Those people whom I represent and whom \nothers represent in this body have every legitimate right to expect \nthat the Senate will debate and will vote on the issue of whether we \nshould expand America's supply of energy. They have every right to \nexpect that the Senate will vote on whether you can reduce the price of \nenergy in this country by bringing more supply to the market and have \nit be American supply. The American people have every right to expect \nthat amendments will be taken up on the floor of this Senate and will \nbe voted on that address the issue of whether we should be paying \nAmericans to produce energy or whether we should be giving our money to \nVenezuela and to Iran, nations which have expressed a deep resentment \nof us. The American people have every right to expect that amendments \ncan be brought up on the floor of the Senate and can be voted on that \ndeal with conservation, that deal with renewables, that deal with a \nwhole panoply of ideas as to how you can better deliver energy to the \nAmerican people.\n  But those rights are being trampled on here. They are being trampled \non in a way that has never occurred in the history of the Senate. That \nis what is important to focus on. This has never happened before. \nFifteen times, on major pieces of legislation, the majority party has \nfilled the tree, so the minority does not have the right to bring \nforward an amendment. And then the majority says we are obfuscating, \ndelaying or in some way impeding progress--when they are pursuing such \na clear autocratic approach.\n  Well, I hope to come back to this issue a few more times, since this \nappears to be the policy of the leadership on the other side of the \naisle. But it flies in the face of the essence of the purpose of the \nSenate, as defined by one of America's great Senators, the historian of \nthe Senate, when he said:\n\n       Few, if any, upper chambers in the history of the western \n     world have possessed the Senate's absolute right to unlimited \n     debate and to amend and block legislation passed by a lower \n     House. . . .\n\n  The purposes of this right is that:\n\n       The Framers recognized that a minority can be right and \n     that a majority can be wrong.\n\n  I will add that the minority should be heard from and should be \nallowed to offer amendments, and those amendments should receive a \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire has made a \ncompelling speech with which I associate myself entirely. It is obvious \nhe has traveled to his State, as I have traveled to mine, and listened \nto constituents who tell me their biggest problem, in particular, is \nthe price of gas. It seems to me the world's most deliberative body \nshould never stop deliberation on what is the crisis of the day. The \nSenator from New Hampshire made a tremendous speech that was right on \npoint. We may have our differences one way or another on what to do but \nobjecting to letting us debate those differences is not acceptable.\n  For 25 years, the United States has encouraged consumption and \ndiscouraged production. It is time we encourage conservation and \nempower production, as we bridge our way from gasoline today as an \nenergy source to the next energy source of the 21st century, whether it \nbe the lithium battery, hydrogen engine or whatever.\n  There is another crisis on our economy I wish to talk about for a \nsecond that is equally compelling and that is the housing industry and \nthe tremendous stress our financial markets are under and our financial \ninstitutions. There have been a number of speeches made on the housing \nbill, which we will vote on tomorrow at 11 a.m., which, quite frankly, \ntrouble me because they\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\nhave not been on target. For a second, I would like to make a few \npoints.\n  There are a lot of people saying the housing bill we will pass is a \nbailout for the people who caused the problem. That is not correct. The \npeople who caused the problem are off the radar screen; the investment \nbankers and Moody's and Standard and Poor's caused the subprime \nmortgage problem. Wall Street securitized the paper, and Moody's and \nStandard and Poor's rated it investment grade. It wasn't investment \ngrade and should not have been packaged, but it was. They put out all \nover America--the originators and lenders--loans that didn't require \ndocumentation or a downpayment and that only cost a high yield on the \nmortgage to make it a nice instrument to sell.\n  As the housing crises of 1968, 1974, and 1991 were predicated, in \npart or in whole, on easy credit and shoddy underwriting, so is the \nstress on our economy today based on that easy credit and shoddy \nunderwriting generated by the subprime market.\n  The bill we are doing tomorrow is not a bailout to Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae or the institutions that made bad loans. It is an infusion \nof confidence the financial markets need. Fannie and Freddie suffer by \nperception from the difficulties of our mortgage market. If anybody \nwould take the time to go look at default rates, for example, they \nwould look at the loans Fannie Mae holds, and they are at 1.2 percent, \nwell under what is considered a normal, good, healthy balance. The \nsubprime market's defaults are in the 4- to 6- to 8-point range. That \nis causing that problem. That wasn't Fannie Mae paper, and it wasn't \nsecuritized by Fannie Mae. They have $50 billion in capital, when the \nrequirement is to have $15 billion, so they are sound. But the \nfinancial markets, because of the collapse of the mortgage market, have \ngotten worse.\n\n  I think Secretary Paulson has done the right thing. I commend Senator \nDodd and Senator Shelby for the second key component of the bill. The \nDodd-Shelby provision ensures that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will have \nregulatory oversight and be held accountable, as the banking system in \nour country is. What Paulson has done is said, in return for that, we \nwill give to Freddie and Fannie what the American banking institutions \nhave and that is access to the Treasury window for secured \ncollateralized borrowing.\n  You might say: What does all this mean? What it means is we will put \nliquidity back into the mortgage market. There will be good \nunderwriting and accountable credit issued by mortgages that are then \nsold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to provide the liquidity in the \nmarketplace. This is not a bailout for those two institutions. It is an \ninsurance policy that the credit markets will understand that, A, those \ninstitutions are strong and the United States is going to hold them \naccountable and, B, provide them with liquidity when they need it. That \nis good for this country and this economy, and it would be a tragedy if \ntomorrow this Senate doesn't overwhelmingly embrace that legislation.\n  The second component of the legislation is the reform of FHA, raising \nthe loan limits and providing mechanisms also for troubled loans to be \nrefinanced--not a gift as a bailout but providing a lender whose loan \nis in trouble because the house depreciated below the outstanding \nbalance on the loan--it is going to be allowed to refinance on a fixed \nrate--an FHA underwritten loan the individual has to qualify for. If \nthe lender takes the discount down, or takes the hit, that loan can be \nrefinanced and that homeowner, instead of being foreclosed on and \nhaving a vacant house, ends up having a chance to pay for that mortgage \nand the economy is improved.\n  What is happening today in America is the combination of a large \nnumber of foreclosures and no liquidity, as the housing market is off \nin many areas by as much as 50, 60 percent. Home values are declining \nat a rate of 15 percent per year this year and 11 percent last year. \nWhat has happened to American families' main source of spendable \nincome--their equity line of credit--is that it has vanished. That is \nwhy the economy has gone into the tank. We had a housing/fuel boom in \nthe 1990s and early 2000s, and now again we have a housing/fuel \nrecession. The only difference between the boom and recession is, \nduring the boom, we had liquidity, but underwriting got too shoddy. Now \nunderwriting is strong, but the liquidity is not there. The FHA reform \nand Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae reform will, in fact, do that.\n  There is a third feature I wish to talk about. It is a feature I \nintroduced, originally, 6 months ago in the Senate. It is a housing tax \ncredit for first-time home buyers to go into the marketplace and buy a \nhouse. The United States, in 1974, had a serious recession similar to \nthe one we have today. It was fueled by an oversupply of unsold houses \nin the marketplace. A Democratic Congress and the Republican President, \nGerald Ford, in 1975, passed a $2,000 tax credit for first-time home \nbuyers who went and bought a standing vacant inventory house and \noccupied it as their home. That incentive brought Americans off the \nsidelines and into the marketplace, and we absorbed a tremendous amount \nof the standing inventory. Values came back in the United States and \nthe housing market responded. The $8,000 tax credit--$4,000 a year for \nthe first 2 years--on a home that a first-time home buyer buys and \noccupies is going to be a huge incentive to the housing market. It \ndoesn't bail anybody out; it incentivizes a market to come back. When \nthat happens, the problems go away. We cannot regulate ourselves, as a \nnation, into a strong economy. But we can incentivize our people and \nget confidence to the financial markets and restore what is a very \nshaky economy.\n  I come to the Senate floor with the following message: I thank \nSenator Dodd and Shelby for all their work. I commend the House on what \nthey did to make this housing bill a good bill.\n  Again, I reassure everybody we are not bailing out anybody. What we \nare doing is incentivizing Americans to come back into the marketplace, \nproviding them with good, accountable, credible credit, so there is \nliquidity in the housing market, and seeing to it that two institutions \nthat ensure that Americans can be homeowners--Freddie Mac and Fannie \nMae--are strong, and the investment markets have the confidence they \nneed to have the support of the United States and, lastly, under the \nsame type of transparency and accountability that the American banking \nsystem has been under since Alexander Hamilton.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Disaster In Iowa\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to remind my \ncolleagues and the American people, once again, about the deadly \ntornadoes, storms, and floods that affected the Midwest earlier this \nyear. Iowa, my State, was especially hard hit by this severe weather \nevent. The people in Iowa have great pride and resiliency. They don't \nlike to complain, and it is even harder for them to ask for help. \nHowever, I wish my colleagues to know that Iowans are hurting, similar \nto people in other natural disasters. I see it in their eyes as they \nsort through the rubble and try to rebuild their lives.\n  As their Senator, their friend, their neighbor, I am asking my \ncolleagues to help and to help now. I thank my colleagues who have come \nto me and the rest of the Iowa congressional delegation and other \nMembers whose States were affected. We have all had colleagues come to \nus to share their condolences and ask how they can help.\n  However, I have heard some comments that this disaster was not severe \nenough to warrant special legislative attention. Washington doesn't \nseem to understand the devastation. That is the way I see it. In other \nwords, it is not on television for 2 months in a row such as it was in \nNew Orleans, so we don't seem to be getting the attention of colleagues \nsuch as we did from Hurricane Katrina. But we do have an emergency, and \nCongress needs to respond such as we did after 9/11 for New York City \nor after Katrina for New Orleans.\n  Ten States were affected by this severe weather system. In Iowa \nalone, 340 communities were affected by these tornadoes, storms, and \nflooding. Iowa\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\nsuffered well over $10 billion in damages. Of this amount, \napproximately $4 billion was agricultural loss, $4 billion was business \nloss, and $1 billion was housing damage and loss. Right now, those are \nvery rough figures. I think they are only going to climb every day \nafter these initial estimates.\n  The floods in Iowa were well over a 500-year flood event level in \nmany parts of my State. For example, the Cedar River in the Cedar \nRapids area was 11 feet over record flood stage. Since we began keeping \nrecords in the 1850s, the highest flood level had been 20 feet. The \nlevees protecting the city are at 22 feet. In June, Cedar Rapids had 31 \nfeet of water, well over the 22 feet of the levee protection and the \nthe previous record of 20 feet.\n  Even my small hometown of New Hartford, IA, was first hit by an F5 \ntornado, which caused several deaths and severe damages and, just 2 \nweeks later, hit by severe flooding. Mr. President, 240 out of 270 \nhomes had moderate to complete damage. Many of the businesses also \nsuffered severe loss. They are trying to figure out how to stay in \nbusiness. Unfortunately, for my small town, several have decided not to \nreopen.\n  On Monday, I visited the home you see in this photo. This is one of \nmy constituents in Cedar Rapids, IA. As you can see, they have already \ntaken out the moldy drywall. Here, this lady, Shirley, is showing how \nhigh the water was on the first floor, and that is after the basement \nhad been completely filled with water. We also couldn't go to the \nsecond floor in this home because half of the steps were washed away.\n\n  So we are not just talking about standing water. At one point this \nwas rushing water, turning over appliances and leaving boats in \npeople's living rooms. It is people such as Shirley, who are in limbo \nbecause Congress is not acting, needing to know what assistance can be \nprovided. They do not know whether the Government will help. Should \nthey stay or should they leave?\n  Then we have business owners who are worried about their employees \nnot having homes. Will they leave town because they do not have a place \nto live? Then will the small businesses be closed because customers who \nuse the local diner won't be there or the local flower shop won't be \nthere? It is a vicious circle when you don't have housing for your \nworkers.\n  My colleagues in the Midwest and I have been working with \nappropriators on additional emergency assistance to help us with the \nrecovery and with the rebuilding process. I happen to be concerned that \nthis additional emergency assistance is being held up by nonemergency, \nnonrelated, and, in fact, quite controversial provisions. I believe we \nshould do what we did for New York and what we did for New Orleans: \nconsider the emergency portion separately from other appropriations \nthat people think need to be done, and do it before the August \ncongressional recess.\n  Aid to the Midwest should not be held hostage to politics. Iowans are \nbeginning to notice the inaction in Congress. I get asked why--why \nhasn't something been done? I would like to read to you parts of an \neditorial running in the Waterloo Courier. Waterloo is close to my \nhometown. I am not going to read it all, but, I want to include the \nentire editorial in the Record. I will read from just portions of it \nbecause it tells what Iowans are thinking about the inaction in \nCongress and that maybe there is a double standard.\n  The headline is: ``Congress Needs To Make Time To Help Iowa.''\n\n       Iowans who don't agree with the recent minuscule approval \n     ratings of Congress may want to take a second look. Congress \n     has delayed consideration of a bill that includes further \n     disaster aid for Iowa until after Congress' August recess.\n\n  The editorial goes on:\n\n       That's quite a slap in the face to those people and \n     businesses already confused by which direction to take \n     concerning housing and rebuilding issues. The Senate \n     Appropriations Committee was scheduled to take up the \n     supplemental package on Thursday, but Senator Robert Byrd, \n     Democrat of West Virginia, the committee chairman, announced \n     late Tuesday it was putting off consideration until after the \n     recess.\n\n  Then they quote Senator Byrd:\n\n       There is no opportunity to begin consideration of a \n     supplemental appropriations bill during the next 10 days.\n\n  Then the editorial goes on to say that Byrd said the Senate was busy \ndebating legislation on housing, energy, defense policy, and taxes \nbefore the recess.\n  Continuing to quote the editorial:\n\n       Our response to Senator Byrd and the rest of the Congress \n     is: Make the time. Delay the recess if you have to. We'd also \n     like to remind the Senator of his comments just last month \n     after areas in West Virginia were ravaged by storms.\n\n  The editorial refers to that statement, with Senator Byrd saying \nthis:\n\n       Once again, West Virginia has suffered at the hands of \n     Mother Nature. Every moment counts in the recovery efforts, \n     and every little bit of help is crucial.\n\n  Then the editorial repeats again the last words of Senator Byrd's \nstatement--``every moment counts.'' That was his plea then.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Sounds very similar to situations faced today by many Iowa \n     communities, businesses, families, and individuals. It \n     appears that Byrd's view on timely assistance doesn't extend \n     to the Midwest.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe entire editorial so people can read it in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From The Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier, July 25, 2008]\n\n                Congress Needs To Make Time To Help Iowa\n\n       Iowans who don't agree with the recent minuscule approval \n     ratings of Congress may want to take a second look.\n       Congress has delayed consideration of a bill that includes \n     further disaster aid for Iowa until after Congress' August \n     recess.\n       That's quite a slap in the face to those people and \n     businesses already confused about which direction to take \n     concerning housing and rebuilding issues.\n       ``Congress doesn't seem to understand the devastation,'' \n     Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said. ``We've got an \n     emergency, and Congress needs to respond. If my colleagues \n     doubt me that this is an emergency, I'm in Iowa every weekend \n     and I'll be happy to show them around.''\n       Don't expect too many of Grassley's cohorts to take him up \n     on his invitation.\n       On Tuesday, Iowa Gov. Chet Culver met with a congressional \n     delegation and said he was asking for an additional $1 \n     billion in disaster relief. The government has already \n     approved $2.6 billion in assistance.\n       The Senate Appropriations Committee was scheduled to take \n     up the supplemental package on Thursday, but Sen. Robert \n     Byrd, D-West Virginia--the committee chairman--announced late \n     Tuesday it was putting off consideration until after the \n     recess.\n       ``There is no opportunity to begin consideration of a \n     supplemental appropriations bill during the next 10 days,'' \n     Byrd said in a statement.\n       Byrd said the Senate was busy debating legislation on \n     housing, energy, defense policy and taxes before the recess.\n       Our response to Sen. Byrd and the rest of Congress is: Make \n     the time. Delay the recess if you have to.\n       We'd also like to remind the senator of his comments just \n     last month after areas in West Virginia were ravaged by \n     storms.\n       ``Once again, West Virginia has suffered at the hand of \n     Mother Nature,'' Byrd said. ``Every moment counts in the \n     recovery efforts, and every little bit of help is crucial. I \n     appreciate the willingness of the Bush Administration to \n     extend relief to additional counties in our state. This wise \n     decision will bring much needed FEMA aid to these struggling \n     communities so they can begin the difficult task of \n     rebuilding.''\n       Just to reiterate: ``Every moment counts,'' was his plea \n     then.\n       He had previously written to the president asking for a \n     disaster declaration as soon as possible, as the damage was \n     ``beyond the capabilities of the State of West Virginia and \n     the affected local governments.''\n       Sounds very similar to the situations faced today by many \n     Iowa communities, businesses, families and individuals.\n       It appears Byrd's view on timely assistance doesn't extend \n     to the Midwest.\n       Sen. Byrd's Web page is www.byrd.senate.gov. An e-mail \n     address can be found there. If you feel compelled to leave \n     him a message, please make it brief. We would hate to take up \n     too much of his time.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have also, as an individual Senator, \nbeen working on a comprehensive plan to provide tax relief to flood, \ntornado, and severe storm victims in the Midwest. My Midwestern \ncolleagues have been helping me with this effort. We urge Congress to \nact quickly on enacting a tax relief law because we acted very \nquickly--within 3 weeks--after Katrina for New Orleans.\n  On Wednesday, I introduced this tax bill with Senators Harkin, Bond,\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\nMcCaskill, Coleman, Klobuchar, Durbin, Obama, Roberts, Brownback, \nLugar, and Bayh and called it the Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief Act of \n2008. The same bill was introduced in the House by the Iowa \ncongressional delegation in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Federal tax relief has proven to be very helpful to disaster recovery \nefforts in recent years. We modeled this legislation after the tax \nlegislation that Congress passed to help victims of Hurricanes Katrina, \nRita, and Wilma in 2005, and the tornadoes of Kiowa County, KS, in \n2007. We took into account the lessons learned from the other disaster \npackages, so we have been able to slim down this package and tailor it \nto meet the needs of this major natural disaster and not repeat the \nmistakes we made for Katrina, where some people who weren't hurt by the \ndisaster were able to take advantage of it.\n  So we are curtailing the cost considerably. But there is another \ninconsistency. I have been told by the chairman of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee, Mr. Rangel, that our disaster tax relief package needs \nto be offset. Well, he didn't hear Chuck Grassley say the tax package \nwe passed for New York City after 9/11 had to be offset. It was an \nemergency. New York City needed help and New York City got help from \nthis Senator, chairman of the committee at that time. I guess at that \ntime I was ranking member, but still helping. And when Katrina came \nalong, I was chairman of the committee once again, and we did not ask \nfor offsets for Katrina. People in New Orleans were hurting and we \npassed the legislation and the President signed it 3 weeks after \nKatrina. We appropriated $60 billion within 5 days after reconvening \nafter Labor Day in 2005.\n  So I don't want anybody telling me that we have to offset a disaster \nrelief package for the Midwest where people are hurting, when we didn't \ndo it for New Orleans. Why the double standard? Is it because people \naren't on rooftops complaining for helicopters to rescue them, and you \nsee it on television too much? We aren't doing that in Iowa. We are \ntrying to help ourselves in Iowa. We have a can-do attitude. It doesn't \nshow up on television like it did in New Orleans for 2 months.\n  So we are going to move ahead. We have targeted this assistance in \nthis tax bill to those who have suffered damage and lost specifically \nfrom this severe weather event--individuals and businesses located in \npresidentially declared disaster areas due to floods, tornadoes, or \nsevere storms, in just these States--Iowa, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, \nKansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wisconsin--just \nwhere the harm has happened this spring.\n  Among other provisions, this legislation would let disaster victims \nwith damages to their primary residence tap their assets and access \ncash by withdrawing money from retirement plans without penalties and \nsuspend limits on tax incentives for charitable contributions, thus \nstrengthening local and other fund-raising drives collecting money to \nhelp small businesses and families recover. We also create tax-credit \nbond authority to help local governments rebuild infrastructure with \ninterest-free loans; increase the amount of tax-exempt bond authority \nto help businesses receive below-market interest rate financing; remove \nlimitations on deducting casualty losses due to natural disasters; and \nreduce the 2008 tax burden for businesses by substantially increasing \nthe 2008 deductions from depreciation and expensing the business \nproperty.\n  We tried to add a disaster tax relief package as an amendment to the \nhousing bill--and I have to say Senators Shelby, Dodd, and Baucus were \nvery helpful in that process--but we didn't get all these details \nironed out in time to get it in the housing package.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have agreed to pursue Midwestern tax relief either \nas a separate bill, which would have to start in the House of \nRepresentatives, or on another tax bill that is over here under \nconsideration in the Senate. I want to thank Senators Shelby, Dodd, and \nBaucus, though, for their consideration of putting that in the housing \nbill.\n  We have had further discussions since then with Chairman Rangel and \nBaucus. It is our hope that we can swiftly reach a bicameral agreement \nwith Ways and Means and the Senate Finance Committee on our proposals. \nI think we basically have it ironed out, except for this offset issue. \nAnd we should pass this tax bill in both the House and Senate by \nunanimous consent before we leave for the August recess. That would get \nit done in still a longer period of time than it took me to get tax \nrelief for New Orleans.\n  Once again, assistance to Iowa and the Midwest should not be held \nhostage to politics and gamesmanship. We treated the victims of the \ngulf coast with quick and fair action, as I have indicated twice during \nmy remarks. We passed $60 billion in appropriations bills within a week \nof returning to Washington after the August recess--Katrina happening \njust days before Labor Day, during our recess--and we passed that tax \nrelief bill that I have mentioned that was signed by the President \nwithin 3 weeks. Those were clean bills. They weren't loaded down with \ncontroversial extraneous positions and didn't need offsets.\n  Efforts underway by Democratic leadership are letting down the people \nof the Midwest. They are trying to use this disaster assistance as a \nvehicle to promote an agenda and pet projects, and I will give you some \nexamples. The majority would like to include a provision to give $1.2 \nbillion in tax credits to New York City, even though New York City does \nnot pay Federal taxes. This proposal is widely reported to fund the \nbuilding of a train from Manhattan to John F. Kennedy Airport through \nthe use of New York Liberty Zone tax credits. According to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, Congress has never before provided a limited tax \nbenefit such as this to a government unit.\n  This provision is very controversial, is nonemergency, and it would \nslow down getting assistance to the Midwest, and Iowans, where people \nare hurting and hurting right now. I reiterate that politics should not \nget in the way of helping the victims of the storms and tornadoes in \nthe Midwest. To cut through this hogwash, we ought to pass the \nMidwestern disaster tax relief bill by unanimous consent even this \nweek.\n  As Iowans and others in the central United States start recovering \nand rebuilding their lives and communities after these record deadly \nstorms and floods, they need and deserve swift Federal action. The \nassistance should not be held up over politics.\n  I am often asked by constituents not to forget them. Therefore, I am \nasking my colleagues in Congress this very minute not to forget my \nconstituents or other constituents of Midwestern States. We only ask \nthat Congress give Iowans and those in the Midwest the same \nconsideration we gave victims of other disasters--and most often I \nmention New York City and New Orleans--nothing more, nothing less.\n  If any of my colleagues doubt that this is an emergency and that \nFederal aid is needed, I am in Iowa every weekend--except this weekend, \nI am sorry to say, because we are in session on Saturday. But whenever \nthey come, I will be happy to show them around. I have all kinds of \npictures, which I think my staff has been putting up from time to time, \nto demonstrate this disaster that we have had in the Midwest.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask the Senate stand in recess subject \nto the call of the Chair.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 2 p.m., recessed until 2:03 \np.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. \nCasey).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/25/senate-section/article/S7462-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7462-S7474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need to\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\nharmonize our energy, environment, and economic policies.\n  In the midst of summer it is hard to think about our Nation's winter \nheating needs, but experts say we are at a pace for skyrocketing energy \nprices this winter that will place even further financial strain on the \nbudgets of too many Americans. The chickens have come home to roost. \nFor 27 years the Federal Government has helped disadvantaged Americans \nwith their heating costs through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram. It is one of the programs I supported while I was mayor and \nthen as Governor of Ohio.\n  Last year in my State alone, LIHEAP assisted some 387,000 Ohio \nhouseholds earning less than 175 percent of poverty on about $37,500 \nfor a family of four. Furthermore, over 188,000 Ohio households were \nserved by the Emergency Winter Crisis Program. This program provides a \none-time payment for eligible households whose home heating sources \nhave been disconnected, threatened with disconnection, or have less \nthan a 10-day supply of bulk fuel. The fact that so many Ohioans have \nutilized these programs demonstrates a need for help.\n  Congress has not sat idle. Since I came to the Senate in 1999, \nCongress has increased LIHEAP funding from $1.1 to $2 billion in 2008. \nThat is an 80-percent increase. In 2006, Congress provided $2.5 billion \nfor LIHEAP, a 32-percent increase above the previous year's \nappropriations.\n  I have consistently supported these increases, but I have become \nfrustrated that despite the new money in the program, fewer families \nare getting real help on their heating bills. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service reports that despite the increase in the \nnumber of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance, climbing energy \nprices have reduced the number of families actually receiving help.\n  From 1983 to 2005, the percentage of eligible families receiving aid \ndecreased from 31 percent to 15 percent. The increased funding simply \nis not keeping up with the rising cost of heating fuel. Our dollars are \nnot going so far. The Ohio Department of Development tells me they are \nexpecting the same rapid increases in costs this coming winter. Natural \ngas is the best example of what has happened in my State and perhaps in \nthe State of the Presiding Officer. The prices for consumers like me \nwent from $3 an mcf in 2000 to $11 per mcf today. In fact, prices for \nthis June-July are nearly double what they were during the same period \nlast year. And it isn't getting any better. I understand that the \nVectren Natural Gas Utility Company in the Dayton area, is so alarmed \nabout the expected spike in the price of natural gas this winter it is \nwarning customers now to prepare for rates to increase by as much as 50 \npercent. This would devastate a lot of Ohioans living on fixed incomes \nwho already have tight budgets.\n  Unfortunately, Ohioans are not alone. There is a growing number of \nfamilies across this country who will need help this coming winter. I \nunderstand the need for the safety net LIHEAP provides and support its \nfunding at reasonable levels, but when I look at the numbers, it \nbecomes clear that appropriating more and more money for LIHEAP is not \nthe answer.\n  The real reason some folks will be having such a hard time this \nwinter making ends meet is our Nation has no energy strategy. For \nexample, large-scale fuel switching from coal to gas began with the \nimplementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act. These requirements continue \nto be phased in and have become increasingly stringent. One can see a \nclear correlation between regulation and the increasing cost of natural \ngas. More utilities are turning from coal to gas.\n  A major contributor to these skyrocketing energy prices is \nenvironmental policies that discourage our use of abundant domestic \nenergy supplies and a failure to harmonize our country's energy, \nenvironmental, economic, and national security policies. This has \nresulted in substantial unintended costs in the form of increased fuel, \nfood, electricity prices and lost jobs, and has contributed to the \nalmost doubling of the LIHEAP program.\n  Sadly, this is not a new problem. We have know for years that we need \na comprehensive energy strategy, and I have been calling for one since \nI came to the Senate.\n  But it took us 5 years and 6 weeks of floor debate for Congress to \nPass the 2005 Energy Policy Act--a bill that took only limited strides \nforward. And while the bill encouraged improved national energy \nefficiency, boosted research and development funding for advanced \nenergy technologies and promoted increased use of biofuels. It didn't \ngo far enough toward increasing our domestic energy supply, which has \nbeen hamstrung by moratoria on exploration that would have given us \nincreased oil and natural gas.\n  We have to make real investments today that will help us achieve our \ngoal tomorrow. If our goal is to help those who are less fortunate with \ntheir heating bills, then we should be treating the disease rather than \nthe symptoms. We must increase our supply, reduce our demand through \nalternative energies, and conserve what we have. We must be also \ncareful to avoid--I like to refer to them as smokescreens that cloud \nour paths to real solutions.\n  The debate here in Washington over oil speculation is something that \nis part of this what I call smokescreen. It is causing us to not face \nup to the situation where we have to increase the supply if we expect \nto deal with the problems in oil and in natural gas here in the United \nStates. I firmly believe that we find ourselves in this situation today \nbecause of a tail wagging the dog environmental policy. This has \nparalyzed Congress and polarized us in such a way that we have been \nunable to find common ground on the most important issue currently \nfacing our nation.\n  But let's keep in mind that our situation could be much worse. This \nJune, amidst what at the time were record high gas and energy prices, a \nbill was brought to the floor to attempt to address climate change. \nWhile finding a solution to climate change is a goal I share, this bill \nwas a bureaucratic and economic disaster, creating over forty new \ngovernment agencies and spending programs--constituting a $6.7 trillion \ndollar tax increase on American families. This bill would have sent \nripple effects through the economy.\n  Indeed, it was estimated that the State of Ohio would loose 139,000 \njobs by 2020 as a result of the legislation. And with Ohio consumers \npaying as much as 29 percent more for gasoline, 50 percent more for \nnatural gas and 80 percent more for electricity, disposable household \nincome could be reduced $1,928 per year by 2020 and $3,522 per year by \n2050.\n  Fortunately, this legislation was defeated. But if we continue to \nignore the economic impacts of our country's environmental policies, we \nwill further erode our competitive position in the world marketplace, \nall the while increasing costs for those among us who are least able to \npay.\n  Few would argue that the economic consequences of those regressive \npolicies fall hardest on the most vulnerable of our population--the \npoor and elderly. And that is what brings us to this LIHEAP debate.\n  I agree the program plays a key role in helping our neediest brothers \nand sisters with the high cost of heating their homes this winter. \nHowever, it is disconcerting to me that many of my colleagues who \nsupport the increase in LIHEAP, as I have, have also supported \nenvironmental policies that have encouraged the use of natural gas, and \nat the same time prevented the exploration for new natural gas \ndeposits.\n  Most of us understand that when you drive up the demand for gas and \nlimit the supply, prices will go up. Yet, unfortunately those that \nsupport these short-sighted environmental polices ignore the impact \nrising prices have on all of us, particularly the middle class, the \nelderly, and poor. Some of the people back in my State say: What do \nthey think we all are, rich? What is worse, as the Band-Aid we use to \ntemporarily treat the symptoms of rising energy prices gets bigger--in \nthis case almost doubling the funding for LIHEAP, as I mentioned over \nwhat was appropriated this year--we are adding to our growing national \ndebt. We cannot continue to live in the United States of Denial, \nborrowing money for programs and passing the cost, including interest, \nonto the backs of our children and grandchildren.\n  Instead, those demanding more LIHEAP should also be required to vote \non increasing our energy supply or at least give the Senate an up-or-\ndown\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\nvote on lifting the ban on exploration of the Outer Continental Shelf. \nThe Mineral Management Service estimates that the undiscovered \ntechnically recoverable resources contained in the OCS, Outer \nContinental Shelf, could equal 420 trillion cubic feet. This is 40 \npercent of the total natural gas estimated to be contained in the \nundiscovered fields in the total United States. So I think we owe it to \nour children, we owe to it our grandchildren to take care of our larger \nenergy problem and get to its root. Moving forward, we must ensure our \nenvironmental policies are not considered in a vacuum. They should be \ncomplimentary to--not in opposition to--our country's energy and \neconomic needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I agree with the previous speaker, the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio, about the need for a national energy policy. He and \nI may disagree as to what that policy should look like, but at a time \nwhen we are spending $700 billion a year importing oil from abroad, at \na time when we are contributing toward global warming, at a time when \nthe oil companies are enjoying recordbreaking profits, at a time when \nsome people will tell us, experts will tell us, that speculation is \ndriving up the cost of a barrel of oil by 25 to 50 percent, I think we \nneed a new energy policy.\n  But I sincerely hope my good friend from Ohio will not penalize the \nmillions of low-income people who are not here on that debate. For \nthem, it is a life-and-death issue, in some cases, about whether we \ndouble LIHEAP funding in order to provide the benefits they desperately \nneed. There are many reasons that any of us can give for not voting for \na piece of legislation, but I hope in terms of the very important \nLIHEAP vote, we do not have folks coming up, well, I believe in LIHEAP; \nI am not voting for A or B; this is why--if we do not double the amount \nof money for LIHEAP at a time when home heating oil costs will be \ndouble what they were a couple of years ago.\n  Natural gas prices, as the Senator from Ohio said, are rising very \nrapidly. People throughout the country, in the southern part, are \nunable to afford electricity and are trying to get by without air-\nconditioning at a great threat to their health. I hope those people \nwill not be held hostage to the debate we are having.\n  Yes, of course, we need a national energy policy. Yes, of course, \nthis current policy is a disaster. But, please, let's not create a \nsituation where people die and people suffer. Who gets LIHEAP? My \nfriend from Ohio knows who gets LIHEAP. Those are the elderly people \nwho get LIHEAP. Those are lower income families with children. Those \nare people with disabilities. Please, let's not hold those people \nhostage tomorrow while we continue the debate.\n  So, I say to my good friend from Ohio, count me in as someone who \nwill continue to fight for a national energy policy. I happen to \ndisagree with the Senator on some of the particulars, but we need a \nnational energy policy. Of course, we need to lower the cost of energy.\n  But, right now, when we are seeing in the northern tier of the \ncountry, in the Northeast, a doubling of the price of home heating oil, \npeople will go cold, people will freeze if we do not provide them with \nthe help they need. I hope I can count on my friend's support tomorrow \nfor that legislation.\n  I am very happy to say, in terms of LIHEAP, we are getting very \nsignificant bipartisan support for this legislation. This bill which, \nas I mentioned, would double the amount of money we are spending on \nLIHEAP--it is S. 3186, the Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer Act. It \nnow has 52 cosponsors, 35 Democrats, 13 Republicans, and 2 \nIndependents. I want to thank all of them. I want to thank Majority \nLeader Reid, Senators Obama, Durbin, Murray, Landrieu, Leahy, Cantwell, \nJack Reed, Kerry, Kennedy, Schumer, Levin, Cardin, Brown, Klobuchar, \nMenendez, Casey,--and I want to thank you, the Presiding Officer, for \nyour strong support for this legislation--Bingaman, Lautenberg, \nStabenow, Bill Nelson, Baucus, Salazar, Wyden, Whitehouse, Rockefeller, \nDodd, Tester, Mikulski, Biden, Kohl, Dorgan, McCaskill, and Boxer.\n  I also want to thank 13 Republican cosponsors of this legislation. It \nis no secret that we are in the midst of a lot of partisanship, a lot \nof bad feelings. But I am very glad that 13 Republicans have come on \nboard this legislation. They are Senators Grassley, Snowe, Stevens, \nColeman, Smith, Sununu, Collins, Murkowski, Gregg, Lugar, Bond, Dole, \nand Specter.\n  I appreciate their support, as well as Senator Lieberman, the other \nIndependent, in addition to myself. I thank Senator Reid, the majority \nleader, for trying to push this legislation.\n  Not only do we have a significant amount of support in the Senate, we \nare getting support from dozens and dozens and dozens of organizations \nfrom all over this country who understand the importance of LIHEAP and \nthe need to substantially increase funding.\n  Now, one of the organizations that has been very active and actively \ninvolved in this issue is the AARP, which is the largest senior group \nin this country. I would like to, if I may, read briefly from a \nstatement that the AARP made in support of the legislation that is \ncoming up tomorrow.\n  And that is:\n\n       AARP fully supports the Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer \n     Act. This legislation will provide needed relief for many \n     older persons who may not receive assistance despite their \n     eligibility due to a lack of funding. Older Americans who are \n     more susceptible to hypothermia and heat stroke know the \n     importance of heating and cooling their homes. They often \n     skip on other necessities to pay their utility bills.\n       However, today's escalating energy prices and the Nation's \n     unpredictable and extreme temperatures are adding to the \n     growing economic hardship faced by seniors. LIHEAP is \n     underfunded and unable to meet the energy assistance needs of \n     the program's eligible households. Studies show that while \n     LIHEAP serves more households than ever before, only 16 \n     percent of eligible households received assistance in 2006.\n\n  Let me repeat that. Only 16 percent, in 2006. The need is now \nsubstantially greater because of the rising cost of fuel and because of \nthe recession we are in currently.\n  AARP finishes by saying:\n\n       An estimated gap of almost $28 billion now exists between \n     what LIHEAP pays and total energy costs facing the eligible \n     LIHEAP population.\n\n  So we are very appreciative that AARP is supporting this legislation. \nLet me mention a letter that I received yesterday from the National \nGovernors Association. The National Governors Association, representing \nall 50 Governors in this country, is also supporting this legislation. \nLet me read briefly from this letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SANDERS. The letter states:\n\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of the \n     Nation's governors, we write to express our support for \n     increased funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Program for fiscal year 2008.\n       Bipartisan efforts, such as the ``Warm in Winter and Cool \n     in Summer Act'' (S. 3186), which would add $2.53 billion in \n     LIHEAP funding for FY 2008 and split this funding equitably \n     between the LIHEAP base formula grant and the contingency \n     fund, are a step in the right direction. This approach will \n     help ensure that States receive an equitable share of the \n     energy assistance.\n\n  I thank the National Governors Association. The letter was signed by \nGovernor Granholm and Governor Rell of Connecticut. We appreciate their \nsupport.\n  I come from a State where the weather gets 20 below zero. In a \nmoment, I will be talking about what some of my constituents \nexperienced last winter and the fears they have for the coming winter \nand why it is absolutely imperative that we substantially increase \nLIHEAP funding.\n  What I want to do right now is read about what is going on in America \ntoday, in July and in June of 2008, in terms of the impact that high \ntemperatures are having on some of our most vulnerable citizens, \nprimarily the elderly.\n  We gathered some headlines and brief articles about events and \ntragedies that are occurring right now.\n  From the Mississippi Daily Journal:\n\n       An autopsy report confirmed a Monroe County, Mississippi, \n     man died as a result of heat stroke Sunday.\n\n  Later on in the article it states:\n\n       When the temperatures hit the high 90s, North Mississippi \n     Medical Center emergency department starts seeing more heat-\n     related\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\n     illnesses, particularly heat exhaustion [hospital officials \n     said.]\n\n  Then there is an article, which I am sure you are familiar with, \nwhich comes from the Philadelphia Inquirer. This was June 14, 2008. \nThis was rather astounding because Philadelphia is not in the middle of \nthe South. This is the way the article reads. It says:\n\n       The National Weather Service warned last week that the \n     four-day hot spell that began June 7 could be deadly--and the \n     projection proved all too true. As of yesterday----\n\n  This is the article on June 14--\n\n       As of yesterday, the deaths of 17 people in Philadelphia \n     has been linked to the heat during those four days. Most lack \n     air conditioning in their homes. In several cases fans and \n     open windows proved insufficient.\n\n  That is from the Philadelphia Inquirer. I know that is one of the \nreasons you are such a strong supporter and why Senator Specter is also \na strong supporter.\n  That was in Philadelphia. In Modesto, CA, ``Heat Claims Life of \nElderly Modesto, California Woman.''\n  In Woodland, CA, ``4 Deaths Blamed on NorCal Heat Wave.''\n\n       Last week's Northern California heat wave is being blamed \n     for killing at least four people.\n\n  June 12, 2008, The Capital, the newspaper in Annapolis. It reads:\n\n       An elderly man was found dead inside his stifling Orchard \n     Beach, Maryland home early this week, marking the first heat-\n     related fatality in Anne Arundel County, Maryland in three \n     years.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Maryland recorded 21 heat-related deaths in 2007, 43 in \n     2006 and 47 in 2005, according to the Maryland Emergency \n     Management Agency. The county Health Department said Anne \n     Arundel had three heat-related fatalities in 2005.\n       ``Every summer, we see an increase in call volume related \n     to heat-related emergencies,'' Chief Tobia said. And \n     tragically, this death highlights the absolute importance of \n     staying cool, staying hydrated and checking in on your \n     neighbors.''\n\n  Arizona Republic, Phoenix, AZ, June 9, 2008. Headline: ``69 Valley \nFacilities Give Water, Aid to Homeless.''\n\n       Blue Swadener, a spokesman for St. Joseph the Worker, said \n     there were 50 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County, AZ \n     between May and September 2007.\n\n  On and on it goes. This is only a sampling of headlines dealing with \nheat-related deaths. Let me talk a little bit about what is going on in \nsome of the northern States, especially in Vermont. A couple of months \nago, I asked Vermonters to write to me telling me about their \nexperience with high energy costs and a very tough economy. These are \nsome of the letters I received from Vermont. A moment ago we talked \nabout what is going on in warm weather States, when the weather becomes \nvery hot. This is from Vermont. The first letter comes from a mother \nwho lives in rural Vermont:\n\n       We have two small children (a baby and a toddler) and felt \n     fortunate to own our own house and land but due to the \n     increasing fuel prices we have at times had to choose between \n     baby food [and] diapers and heating fuel. We've run out of \n     heating fuel three times so far and the baby has ended up in \n     the hospital with pneumonia two of the times. We try to keep \n     the kids warm with an electric space heater on those nights, \n     but that just doesn't do the trick . . . Please help.\n\n  That is what we are talking about. That is why we need to increase \nLIHEAP so that children do not get cold and end up in the hospital or \nthat elderly people in the southern part of this country die or end up \nin the hospital because of heat exhaustion.\n  Another letter I received from a small city in Vermont:\n\n       I am a single mother with a 9 year old boy. We lived this \n     past winter without any heat at all. . . . To stay warm at \n     night my son and I would pull off all the pillows from the \n     couch and pile them on the kitchen floor. I'd hang a blanket \n     from the kitchen doorway and we'd sleep right there on the \n     floor. By February we ran out of wood and I burned my \n     mother's dining room furniture. I have no oil for hot water. \n     We boil our water on the stove and pour it in the tub.\n\n  I know there are a lot of reasons to vote against anything. Please do \nnot hold these people hostage to the ongoing energy debate we face in \nthis country. Yes, of course, we need an energy policy. Yes, of course, \nwhat we are doing today is absurd. But there are people who will die. \nThere are people who will end up in the hospital. There are people who \nget sick. There will be people who have to take money out of their \nmedicine budget, out of their food budget to pay for heat in the winter \nor air-conditioning in the summer. Let us not punish those people. I \nknow all the excuses, all of the reasons that people can give for \nvoting no. Hold them. Don't use them tomorrow. Let the people back home \nknow you are going to stand up for some of the most vulnerable people \nin this country while we work on a national energy policy.\n  At a time when home energy bills are soaring, what this legislation \ndoes is basically double the amount of LIHEAP funding. It fulfills what \nthe authorization level was. That is what it does, not more than that. \nWhat it understands, as I mentioned earlier, is that while millions of \npeople today are receiving LIHEAP funds, millions more who are eligible \nfor the program simply are not getting into it because there is not \nenough funding available. What happens is, as home heating prices soar, \neither fewer people will be able to receive benefits or else the \nbenefits people receive will be simply inadequate because States have \nto cut back. That is why the National Governors Association is \nsupporting this legislation.\n  I made this point the other day, but it is worth repeating: When \nthere is a flood, when there is a fire, and then there is a natural \ndisaster, CNN and the other TV cameras are there. They cover it. All of \nus are concerned about the enormous problems facing the Midwest in \nterms of the flooding there. We are concerned about the terrible forest \nfires taking place in California. As a nation, we have to address those \nproblems. But I ask my colleagues to understand that just because CNN \nis not in a house which has no heat when the weather gets 20 below \nzero, don't think that is not as important an issue. Do not think that \nsuffering is not as real. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease \nControl, over 1,000 Americans from across the country died from \nhypothermia in their own homes, not out on the street, from 1999 to \n2002, which are the latest figures we have available. They froze to \ndeath in the United States. That is why LIHEAP as a program was \ncreated, and that is why we have to expand the mission of LIHEAP to \naddress the reality of today, that while our economy is declining, \nenergy costs are soaring. More and more people are in need of LIHEAP.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this is not only a cold weather issue. Over \nthe past decade more than 400 people died of heat exposure in Arizona, \nincluding 31 in July of 2005 alone.\n  Let me wrap up my remarks by thanking all of the Members of the \nSenate--I think there are 52 or 53 cosponsors, including 13 \nRepublicans--for their support. I thank the AARP and the dozens and \ndozens of other organizations for their support. I thank the National \nGovernors Association for their support. Every person in the Senate is \na politician. We know how the system works. We know we can give any \nexcuse under God's sky for voting no on an issue. We can vote no any \ntime we want to. We can write a press release explaining why we are \nvoting no. I hope tomorrow Members of the Senate will not exercise that \noption. I hope tomorrow Senators will not force millions of the most \nvulnerable people--LIHEAP is primarily for the elderly; it is for \npeople with disabilities, for families with kids--please, do not punish \nthose people, do not force those people to go cold or get sick or die \nbecause of heat exhaustion because of the debate we are having here \nright now. There is widespread support that this legislation should be \npassed, that funding should be substantially increased. That is what we \nare doing.\n  I hope tomorrow we can have a very significant and good vote on this \nimportant piece of legislation so the American people can see that in \nthe midst of all of this partisanship, Members of the Senate have come \ntogether to say that no one in our country will freeze to death this \nwinter or die of heat exhaustion.\n  This is an important issue. The vote is tomorrow. I look forward to \nwidespread support from both sides of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry M. Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of the \n     nation's governors, we\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\n     write to express our support for increased funding for the \n     Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for fiscal \n     year (FY) 2008. Bipartisan efforts, such as the ``Warm in \n     Winter and Cool in Summer Act'' (S. 3186), which would add \n     $2.53 billion in LIHEAP funding for FY 2008 and split this \n     funding equitably between the LIHEAP base formula grant and \n     the contingency fund, are a step in the right direction. This \n     approach will help ensure that states receive an equitable \n     share of the energy assistance provided, which is what \n     Congress envisioned when it authorized the multi-tiered \n     formula. This kind of equity is an important goal.\n       Additional funding will support critically needed heating \n     and cooling assistance to millions of our most vulnerable \n     citizens, including the elderly, individuals with \n     disabilities and families that often have to choose between \n     paying their heating or cooling bills and buying food, \n     medicine and other essential needs. With greater financial \n     support, states will be better able to maintain and \n     potentially increase benefit levels, as well as potentially \n     increase outreach to eligible families in need of rising \n     energy cost assistance.\n       Governors applaud bipartisan efforts to increase funding \n     for heating and cooling assistance and fully support adding \n     $2.53 billion in LIHEAP funding for FY 2008 to help our \n     nation respond to existing home energy needs.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Jennifer Granholm,\n       Chair, Health and Human Services Committee.\n     Governor M. Jodi Rell,\n       Vice Chair, Health and Human Services Committee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I echo the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont. There is simply no sense for \npolitical games to be played with the lives of people, particularly the \nlives of the elderly--in his State having to do with the cold; in my \nState having to do with heat. It is extremely important. It is sad we \nhave to be delayed on a piece of legislation that should have been \npassed long ago. Here again, it is another example, as I was saying \nearlier this morning, having to do with the energy legislation, talking \nabout trying to do something about the supplies of energy as well as \nthe cost of it, of all these games that are being played out here, \nthese political games. Another example is right here with the program \nof assistance to the poor for the cost of heating and air-conditioning.\n  There is no sense in the world that we should be having to come back. \nI could care less about coming here on a Saturday, but the fact is, \nthis should have been passed several days ago, not being strung out as \nit is. Then we have a test that we have to meet the 60-vote threshold \nto get through cutting off debate in order to even proceed to the bill. \nThis is some of the monkey business that is going on around here, pure \npartisan political games. There is no sense for it.\n  I couldn't help but reflect on what the Senator from Vermont has \nsaid. I appreciate his leadership on it and certainly his coming from \nVermont, those cold winters and those senior citizens who are going to \nbe doing everything they can to stay alive. This is America in 2008. \nSenior citizens should not have to be making that decision. Senior \ncitizens also should not have to be making the decision of whether they \nare going to eat or take their medicine, which is another battle we \nhave had on this floor, as the Senator from Vermont has fought with us \non that as well.\n  I thank the very distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  (The remarks of Mr. NELSON of Florida pertaining to the introduction \nof S. Res. 627 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the pending \nlegislation, S. 3186, The Warm in Winter Cool in Summer Act. This \nlegislation would provide additional funding in fiscal year 2008 for \nthe Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP. An \nadditional $2.5 billion would be provided, and under this legislation, \nthese new funds carry an emergency designation that means it will be \nadded to our debt.\n  I would like to first commend Senator Sanders, the sponsor of the \nlegislation, on this well-intentioned bill. We all know that the price \nof oil has increased this year. We feel it at the gas pump every week \nwhen we fill up our tanks. And with winter just around the corner, \nSenator Sanders is trying to provide additional funding for a home \nenergy assistance program that is one component of our country's social \nsafety net.\n  But while the intent of this legislation is admirable, I cannot \nsupport this additional funding because it is not paid for. It is \nsimply another IOU dropped on top of the pile that our children and \ngrandchildren will be responsible for. It may be them who will have to \ngo without heat or air conditioning because of the debt these types of \nproposals make them responsible for.\n  If Congress wants to boost funding for LIHEAP, then we ought to pay \nfor it by cutting spending in a different program. This bill does not \ndo that. It passes the cost to future generations, by charging the \nexpense to the government credit card.\n  The debate we are having today also invites a discussion on budget \nprocess reform. We ought to have contingencies for emergency spending. \nLast month the Congress approved a supplemental spending bill that \nprovided funding for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as extend \nveterans' education benefits and unemployment insurance. This spending \nis in addition to the approximately $1 trillion in annual spending \nthrough the regular appropriations process. My understanding is that in \nSeptember the Appropriations Committee will mark up another \nsupplemental spending bill related to infrastructure and the economy. I \nhaven't seen the details of that proposal, but expect that it will be \nlarge in size and scope. Much of this new spending has merit and ought \nto be funded. I don't take issue with that. However, working outside of \nthe regular budget process allows for new spending that does not count \nagainst the regular budget caps.\n  So for these reasons, I oppose the LIHEAP funding bill we are \ndebating today. While I commend the supporters for bringing their \nproposal forward we ought to tighten the fiscal belt and pay for this \nnew spending. If this is a high priority then we need to eliminate some \nspending that is a lower priority to pay for it. Regretfully, this \nlegislation does not do that, and I intend to vote no on final passage.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on S. 3268, the Stop \nExcessive Energy Speculation Act. I thank the majority leader for his \nleadership on this issue, which addresses one of the most critical \nproblems facing our Nation today--the problem of high oil and gas \nprices. I am deeply disappointed that our Republican colleagues chose \nto block the Senate from taking action on this bill, despite including \nprovisions to address speculation in their own proposal.\n  Energy is an economic issue. As every American has been reminded over \nand over in recent weeks and months, virtually everything we do \nrequires energy--whether it is driving to work, cooking dinner for our \nfamilies--or cooling our homes in the hot summer months. And when the \ncost of that energy goes up, our quality of life goes down.\n  And feelings across the country are raw right now. Whether it is the \ncrisis in our housing markets, skyrocketing health care costs, rising \nunemployment, or soaring energy costs, people are hurting--people are \nangry and frustrated, as circumstances completely beyond their control \nprevent them from taking care of their families--and they want their \nelected leaders to do something to get this economy moving again.\n  But, we simply cannot drill our way to lower gas prices. President \nBush's Energy Information Administration has said that not a drop of \noil from the Outer Continental Shelf would be produced until 2017, and \nwe would not reach peak production until 2030. Even then, this \nincreased production will never be enough to lower world oil prices--we \nonly have 2-to-3 percent of the world's oil reserves.\n  President Bush and Republicans in Congress are demanding we open up \nmore areas--yet oil companies are sitting on 68 million acres that they \nhave already leased but refuse to explore. That is 3 out of every 4 \nacres these companies have under lease.\n  That is why Senators Feingold, Menendez, and I have introduced \nlegislation that denies new leases to companies that leave the areas \nthey lease unused. We have also introduced the Responsible Ownership of \nPublic Lands Act that forces companies to pay a penalty on areas they \nhave leased but not put into production. These fees\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\nwould be used to help bring clean, domestic, renewable sources of \nenergy online. We had hoped to offer both of these proposals as \namendments to the legislation before us; unfortunately, obstruction by \nthe Republicans will prevent us from doing so.\n  The message is simple: instead of continuing to pad the coffers of \noil executives while American families struggle, we are telling these \ncompanies they can either ``use it or lose it.'' I hope my colleagues \nwill join us in pursuing this legislation as an amendment to the \npending bill.\n  I also strongly support efforts to rein in excessive speculation in \nenergy markets. Over the last several months there have been numerous \ncongressional hearings and reports from experts across many fields--oil \nindustry executives, airline industry leaders, financial analysts, and \nothers. Jeroen van der Veer, the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, was quoted \nin the Washington Post on April 11 saying that ``the . . . fundamentals \nare no problem. They are the same as they were when oil was selling for \n$60 a barrel, which is in itself quite a unique phenomenon.'' \nRepresentatives of Exxon-Mobil, the Petroleum Marketers Association of \nAmerica, and others have all expressed similar views. Yet the price of \na barrel of oil has doubled in the last year.\n  Indeed, expert economists have estimated that speculators in energy \nmarkets are responsible for anywhere from 25 percent to 50 percent of \nthe price of a barrel of oil. Even the Japanese government's Ministry \nof Economy, Trade, and Industry has concluded that speculation has \nplayed a significant role in driving up oil prices.\n  This bill is supported by a broad coalition of airlines, trucking \nassociations, labor groups, and environmental groups because it takes \nimportant steps that will help eliminate the ``speculative premium'' on \neach barrel of oil. The dramatic increase in oil prices is hurting \nAmerican families and threatens to cripple countless American \nbusinesses.\n  This important legislation closes the ``London loophole'' by treating \noil traders using a foreign exchange as if they were trading in the \nU.S. for regulatory purposes, in order to stop traders from \nmanipulating prices and speculating excessively by routing oil trades \naway from U.S.-based exchanges. In addition, the bill requires the CFTC \nto convene a working group of international regulators to develop \nuniform reporting requirements, require the CFTC to collect data on \nindex traders to ensure they are not adversely impacting the price \ndiscovery process, and authorize the CFTC to hire at least 100 \nadditional full-time employees.\n  At the same time, I feel that some areas of the bill can be improved. \nIn particular, I am concerned that section 6 may cause unintended \ndisruptions for financial institutions with over-the-counter hedging \ntransactions and unnecessarily increase costs for operating companies \nthat are trying to manage their energy costs through hedging. In \naddition, it appears that some aspects of section 7 and other sections \nmay be unclear or have unintended consequences. I hope we have another \nopportunity to address the issue of speculation, and I look forward to \nworking with the majority leader on ways to address some of these \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that this bill will not have a \nchance to become law. I recognize that addressing the issue of \nspeculation will not solve our energy crisis. This crisis is too big of \nan issue with too many root causes. But speculation is part of the \nproblem, and curbing speculation must be part of the solution. This \nbill would have achieved that goal.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, high energy prices are having a \ndevastating impact on our economy and our people--particularly in \nlarge, rural States such as Maine. Eighty percent of Maine homes use \noil as their primary heating source, so thousands of families are \nworried about how they can afford to stay warm next winter.\n  The high cost of energy is also taking a toll on businesses, both \nlarge and small. Truckers, paper mills, fishermen, farmers, and \ncountless others are struggling with the high cost of oil, gasoline, \nand diesel.\n  Many factors affect energy prices, including the value of the dollar, \nglobal tensions, and demand in other countries, such as China and \nIndia. Supply concerns also enter the picture. Business Week has \nreported that data on Saudi production potential indicate that the \nkingdom may be unable to sustain their projected output of 12 million \nbarrels a day past 2010, while International Oil Daily reports that \nMexico's crude-oil exports are down 17 percent versus 2007, and ``could \nrepresent the start of a precipitous decline.'' Other supply concerns \nfor places like Iran and Nigeria also affect expectations, and prices.\n  These and other considerations have led many of us to advocate a \ncomprehensive energy policy that would promote more exploration and \nproduction, more conservation and efficiency, and more alternatives in \nthe energy sector. We need more American production to meet America's \nneeds, while protecting our environment. In short, we need to produce \nmore, use less, and pursue alternatives.\n  It is imperative for both economic and national-security reasons that \nwe reduce our dependence on imported oil and the supply shocks that our \ndependence entails, that we develop new resources here, and that we \npromote more efficient use. I have a 10-point energy plan that includes \nproposals to accomplish those objectives.\n  Those ideas deserve a full debate. I sincerely hope the current \nprocedural obstacles to considering a variety of amendments will be \nremoved. Holding a lengthy debate on our energy problems is a fruitless \nexercise if the ground rules choke off consideration of the many ways \nwe can tackle those problems by reducing our reliance on imports, by \npromoting more development of American conventional and alternative \nfuels, and by advancing efficiency and conservation initiatives.\n  There is, of course, another critical factor in the energy-price \ncrisis that demands careful attention and effective action. That is the \nrole of excessive speculation in energy markets, especially by \ninstitutional investors and index funds.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have heard persuasive and troubling evidence \nin three hearings of our Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs on this issue. We heard testimony from Federal \nofficials, from exchange officials, from academics, from institutional \ninvestors, and from a bakery owner and a farm representative.\n  The evidence that we found of greatest concern involves the impact of \nnoncommercial investors who do not produce or take delivery of oil or \nagricultural products--unlike commercial participants such as oil \nproducers and heating oil dealers, farmers and cereal companies. \nInstead, these noncommercial investors use futures contracts and \nrelated transactions solely for financial gain.\n  Speculation in commodity markets by noncommercial investors has grown \nenormously. In just the last 5 years, the total value of their futures-\ncontract and commodity index-fund investments has soared from $13 \nbillion to $260 billion.\n  Many experts have concluded that these massive new holdings of oil-\nfutures contracts by pension funds, university endowments, and other \ninstitutional investors have driven prices beyond levels that normal \nmarketplace factors would produce.\n  These investors' intentions may be simply to provide good returns, a \nhedge against inflation, and asset diversification, but the effect of \ntheir activity appears to be driving up prices for traditional users of \ncommodity markets, not to mention American families and businesses that \nare affected by the ultimate price increases.\n  I worked with Senator Lieberman to produce a comprehensive and \nbipartisan bill, the Commodity Speculation Reform Act of 2008, which we \nand Senator Cantwell introduced on July 10.\n  Our bill, S. 3248, takes some very strong steps toward countering \nexcessive speculation.\n  First, it would remedy staffing shortfalls at the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission by adding 100 staff to improve its market oversight \nand enforcement capabilities. This is a vital step. The CFTC tells us \nthat more than three billion futures and options contracts were traded \nlast year, up from 37 million in 1976. Yet the Commission is operating \nwith fewer employees than it had 30 years ago.\n\n[[Page S7468]]\n\n  Second, our bill closes the so-called ``swaps loophole,'' which \ncurrently allows financial institutions to evade position limits on \ncommodity contracts that regulators use to prevent unwarranted price \nswings or attempts at manipulation.\n  Third, our bill directs the CFTC to establish position limits that \nwill apply to an investor's total interest in a commodity, regardless \nof whether they originate on a regulated exchange, the over-the-counter \nmarket, or on foreign boards of trade that deal in U.S. commodities.\n\n  I would note that our bill instructs the CFTC to set and administer \nthese position limits. That task is currently delegated to the \nexchanges, subject to Commission review. The regulated commodity \nexchanges have good reputations as self-policing operations, but we \nbelieve as a matter of principle that regulators should be setting \nspeculative position limits.\n  Fourth, our bills instructs the CFTC to permit no foreign boards of \ntrade to deal in U.S.-linked commodity contracts unless they agree to \nreporting and data-accessibility standards at least equivalent to that \nrequired of U.S.-regulated exchanges. This is not a matter of telling \nother countries what to do: foreign boards of trade request ``no-\naction'' letters from the CFTC so they can maintain trading terminals \nhere while remaining regulated by their own authorities. The CFTC has \nrecently taken positive steps to require comparable reporting, and our \nbill codifies those improvements.\n  These are powerful measures, but they are also carefully designed. We \nrecognize that producers, handlers, and purchasers of commodities who \nuse those markets to lock in prices, hedge risks, and see clues for \nprice trends require some level of participation by non-commercial, \nfinancial investors.\n  Thus, our bill does not prevent financial investors from \nparticipating in commodity markets. It simply places some limits on \ntheir activity by directing the CFTC to set position limits across \ntrading venues at a level no higher than that needed to ensure that \ncommercial participants can always find counter-parties for their \ncontract needs.\n  The bill pending before the Senate parallels key provisions of the \nbill that Senators Lieberman and Cantwell and I introduced.\n  The majority leader's bill has some additional features, such as the \nworking groups to study the regulatory framework for commodity-market \nregulation and to consult on internationally agreed standards, that \ndeserve support.\n  Two aspects of the majority leader's bill, however, raise some \nconcerns, and I have filed two amendments to address them. Senator \nLieberman has joined me as an original cosponsor of the amendments.\n  The first simply extends the reach of S. 3268 to include agricultural \nas well as energy commodities, mirroring our bill's approach. We \nbelieve this is important because high energy prices affect the costs \nof fertilizing, producing, harvesting, transporting, processing, and \ndistributing commodities. Consumers know this is a real problem, and \nprice data prove it: the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the \nannualized rate of food-price inflation in the second quarter of 2008 \nwas 8.5 percent. Meanwhile, the Bureau's energy price index for the \nsecond quarter was climbing at an amazing annualized rate of nearly 54 \npercent.\n  Energy and food commodities are linked, and both have been subject to \nlarge-scale, noncommercial speculation. When we note that the BLS rate \nof price increase for nonfood, nonenergy items was only 2.5 percent, it \nis clear that both agricultural and energy future markets need \nprotection against excessive speculation.\n  My second amendment replaces the definition of commercially related \nhedging in the majority leader's bill with the language from our bill. \nThis will not impair the CFTC's ability to monitor and police hedging \nactivity across trading venues, but it will reduce an apparent \npotential for unintended consequences. We have heard concerns that the \nbill's restrictive language about hedge-trade proximity and equivalence \nto the initial commercial transaction could make bona fide hedging \nimpossible or more difficult and expensive for the intermediaries who \nprovide that service. My amendment is fully consistent with the \nintentions of the pending bill, but mitigates the risk that we might \nunintentionally impede hedging that has a genuine commercial basis.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will consider a full range of \namendments to the majority leader's bill. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my amendments--and then to support the underlying bill. We can \nall agree that excessive speculation is not the only factor affecting \nenergy and food prices. But it is one that we can influence, and action \nis already long overdue.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in a recent column for the Arizona Republic, \n``Rescuing Fannie Mae or Freddie is Nonsense,'' Bob Robb exposed some \nof the flaws in H.R. 3221, the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure \nPrevention Act of 2008, specifically, the bailout for Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac.\n  Mr. Robb argues, ``This plan isn't about mitigating today's housing \ndifficulties. Nothing in the plan gets a mortgage paid that wouldn't \notherwise be paid. Nor is the rescue really about today's credit \ncrunch, except for the minor effect a doubt about the reliability of \nFannie and Freddie guarantees might have on the capital of other \nfinancial institutions. Instead, it's about enabling Fannie and Freddie \nto continue to do even more of the same in the future, and that's a bad \nidea.'' Mr. Robb calls this plan for what it is--an overreaction to \nFannie and Freddie's self-inflicted financial wounds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his column be reprinted in the Record, \nand I urge my colleagues to consider his thoughtful views.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, July 23, 2008]\n\n               Rescuing Fannie Mae or Freddie is Nonsense\n\n                             (By Bob Robb)\n\n       The proposed rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac makes no \n     sense.\n       Both companies are mortgage bundlers and investors.\n       They buy mortgages from other lenders and securitize them. \n     They hold some for investment and sell some to others. They \n     guarantee payments on the mortgage-backed securities they \n     sell to others. And they buy mortgage-backed securities from \n     other bundlers for investment.\n       Recently, the stock prices for Fannie and Freddie fell \n     precipitously, to roughly a quarter of their previous peak. \n     That represents a sharply revised judgment by investors about \n     the value of Fannie and Freddie's business model and \n     activities.\n       That's too bad for holders of Fannie and Freddie stock. But \n     in and of itself, it doesn't represent a systemic economic \n     threat warranting the intervention of the federal government.\n       Other financial institutions do hold mortgage-backed \n     securities guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. If Fannie's and \n     Freddie's financial conditions deteriorates to the point of \n     raising questions about their ability to make good on their \n     guarantees, that would reduce the value of securities they \n     have sold to others. And that could reduce the capital of \n     other financial institutions.\n       But the effect should be minor. The mortgage-backed \n     securities guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie are the good \n     stuff. The mortgagors are all credit-worthy and made healthy \n     down payments. The securities are ultimately backed by the \n     properties mortgaged. Even without Fannie or Freddie's \n     guarantee, losses should be minimal.\n       After all, even including the bad stuff, 92 percent of all \n     mortgages in the United States remain current. Losses in \n     Fannie and Freddie securities are currently running at just a \n     fraction of a percent.\n       Nevertheless, the Bush administration has proposed that \n     Fannie and Freddie be given an unlimited line of credit from \n     the federal government and that the federal government be \n     permitted to contribute equity if Fannie and Freddie have \n     capital problems. Congress appears likely to go along.\n       In the meantime, the Fed has agreed to lend to Fannie and \n     Freddie as well.\n       Instead, Congress should phase out the existing $2.25 \n     billion line of credit each enterprise has with the federal \n     government over a period of, say, five years, and declare \n     that Fannie and Freddie from that point on are on their own.\n       When Fannie Mae was formed in 1938, there was arguably a \n     role for government to play in creating a secondary market \n     for mortgages. Lending capital was scarce and fewer than half \n     of all Americans lived in their own homes.\n       Fannie Mae was initially a government agency. It was sold \n     to private investors in 1968, but retained a favored \n     relationship with the federal government. Freddie Mac was \n     formed in 1970, with the same favored relationship, to offer \n     competition ahd choice.\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\n       Such government-sponsored entities are an anachronism \n     today. Over two-thirds of Americans live in their own homes \n     and, in a world of international finance, there is plenty of \n     private-sector interest in providing a secondary market for \n     mortgages.\n       This rescue plan isn't about mitigating today's housing \n     difficulties. Nothing in the plan gets a mortgage paid that \n     wouldn't otherwise be paid.\n       Nor is the rescue really about today's credit crunch, \n     except for the minor effect a doubt about the reliability of \n     Fannie and Freddie guarantees might have on the capital of \n     other financial institutions.\n       Instead, it's about enabling Fannie and Freddie to continue \n     to do even more of the same in the future, and that's a bad \n     idea. The rescue plan makes an implicit federal guarantee for \n     Fannie and Freddie explicit. This would give them an even \n     greater competitive advantage, enlarging their already \n     dangerously overlarge presence in the secondary-mortgage \n     market.\n       The Bush administration and Congress are moving toward a \n     much larger federal role in the housing market. Congressional \n     Democrats propose that the federal government refinance some \n     $300 billion in mortgages, while the Bush administration \n     wants to open the federal checking account to Fannie and \n     Freddie and perhaps invest in them.\n       Meanwhile, the Fed's balance sheet is getting corrupted \n     with junk that others won't buy or lend against.\n       All this is to keep the housing market propped up at a time \n     in which the market is screaming, about as loudly as it can: \n     There's been an overinvestment in housing. What the \n     politicians propose to do about our economic problems has \n     been consistently more troubling than the problems \n     themselves.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, many homeowners in my State of Arizona and \nacross the Nation are having a hard time making their mortgage \npayments, but the legislation Congress is considering is not aimed at \nhelping them. Rather, it is designed to help mortgage lenders and the \ntwo big Government enterprises ``Freddie Mac'' and ``Fannie Mae.'' In \nfact, the bill we are considering will place an immense financial \nburden on every American taxpayer for a long time and waste billions of \ndollars in misguided efforts to help lenders deemed ``too big to \nfail.'' Therefore, I will vote against H.R. 3221, the American Housing \nRescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008.\n  One of the few provisions in the bill that I support is the much \nneeded reform of the government-sponsored enterprises, GSEs, that \nestablishes an independent regulator to ensure that Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac are properly managed and financially sound. The reason they \nare in trouble is that they have taken too many risks, something I have \nbeen warning about for 3 years. These two GSEs hold more than $5 \ntrillion in liabilities composed of mortgage-backed securities and \nother debt that enjoy an implicit guarantee by the Federal Government. \nThis legislation makes that guarantee explicit for the first time.\n  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's role is to promote liquidity in the \nmortgage industry, but due to the downturn in the housing market, poor \noversight, and reckless portfolios, Fannie and Freddie have incurred \nlosses of more than $5 billion in the past year, the first loss for \nthese two GSEs in 25 years. Fannie and Freddie have also seen their \nstocks sink more than 80 percent in value over the past year. Congress \nshould have passed this much needed reform years ago to avert the \nerosion of Fannie and Freddie's portfolios, and it should be stronger \nnow, given their resistance to reform.\n  Because Fannie and Freddie enjoy this Federal Government guarantee of \nits debts, both the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve \nrecently proposed various administrative and statutory actions to \nstabilize the GSEs. The actions included in this bill would allow the \nFederal Reserve to grant both Fannie and Freddie access to its discount \nwindow, temporarily remove the $2.25 billion cap on Fannie and \nFreddie's lines of credit at the Treasury Department, thereby allowing \nthem to borrow an unlimited amount of taxpayer money if needed, \ntemporarily permit Treasury to purchase equity in the institutions to \nensure that the two GSEs have access to sufficient capital, and provide \nthe Federal Reserve authority to gain access to information and perform \na consultative role in the new GSE regulator's process for setting \ncapital requirements and other prudential standards that this bill \nmandates. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates that the \nproposal could cost American taxpayers $25 billion over fiscal years \n2009 and 2010; however, there is a chance that a further deterioration \nof Fannie and Freddie's finances could require an infusion of $100 \nbillion or more. We simply do not know how much this proposal will \ncost--a gamble with taxpayers' money that I am not comfortable making.\n  In addition to the possible costs of the proposal to help Fannie and \nFreddie, the provisions of H.R. 3221 intended to deal with foreclosures \nwould cost taxpayers billions and do little to help struggling \nhomeowners. For instance, a key component of the bill is the HOPE for \nHomeowners Program, which would allow subprime mortgage holders to \nrefinance their mortgages into Federal Housing Administration backed \nloans if the lender agrees to write down the value of the mortgage. \nThis represents a huge risk to American taxpayers. The program would \nallow lenders to cherry pick up to $300 billion of their worst loans \nand refinance them into FHA guaranteed loans. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that a third of the mortgages refinanced under the \nHOPE for Homeowners Program will enter into default.\n  But even more troubling to me is the burden this program will place \non the FHA considering its current financial woes. The New York Times \nreported in April that the FHA will face a deficit for the first time \nin its 74-year history; the deficit is largely blamed on the risky \nmortgages that the FHA already holds in its mortgage portfolio. I don't \nsee the rationale for expanding FHA's liability with this $300 billion \nprogram when the agency cannot sustain its current portfolio and when \nAmerican taxpayers will bear any losses that the FHA incurs because of \nthe HOPE for Homeowners Program.\n  This bill also includes a new tax on the GSEs--estimates range up to \n$600 million a year--to pay for the HOPE for Homeowners Program for 3 \nyears, and thereafter, for a new affordable housing trust fund. It \nsimply does not make sense for Congress to impose a new tax on Fannie \nand Freddie at the same time that the Federal Government thinks it must \nbail them out by infusing cash and equity into the institutions. It is \nalso likely that Fannie and Freddie will simply pass along the cost of \nthis new tax to consumers, which obviously would not help lure buyers \nback into the housing market.\n  Not only do I oppose taxing the GSEs' profits, but I also question \nthe efficacy of the affordable housing trust fund that would be funded \nby the GSEs. The bill would direct 65 percent of the money it taps from \nthe GSEs to the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, HUD. Under vague guidelines in the bill, the Secretary of \nHUD would then have the discretion to establish grant criteria that \ncould favor certain States. Once the money is allocated by the \nSecretary, State and local politicians would be able to disburse the \nmoney to favored organizations and for-profit groups that share their \npolitical agendas. The remaining 35 percent of the money that the bill \ntakes from the GSEs would be distributed to nonprofit groups selected \nby the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury. This, too, could \nallow the politicians in power to divert Federal dollars to their \nfavorite housing causes. I cannot support a bill that essentially \ncreates a slush fund for politicians.\n  I also oppose the nearly $4 billion in funding the bill allocates to \nthe Community Development Block Grant, CDBG Program because the funding \nwould go to local officials to buy foreclosed property from the lender \nthat is holding the property. Not only does this create a scenario ripe \nfor political favoritism, it would also bail out the very lenders who \noffered mortgages their customers couldn't afford. And, again, it does \nnothing to help the former homeowner. Moreover, the CDBG Program is \nfraught with inefficiencies and mismanagement. According to a February \n2008 report from the White House budget office, the CDBG Program was \nlabeled as ``ineffective,'' and only received a score of 27 out of 100-\npoint scale of achieving results. I cannot vote for a bill that has \nsuch a poorly run program as one of its centerpieces.\n  Finally, I disagree with certain parts of the tax title contained in \nthis bill.\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\nWhen the tax title was initially drafted, I successfully added a \nprovision designed to protect taxpayers from having property tax relief \nprovided in the bill completely offset by rising taxes at the State and \nlocal levels of government. However, when the legislation reached the \nHouse of Representatives my language protecting taxpayers from tax \nincreases was dropped. Homeowners and average Americans are struggling \nto pay their mortgages, higher gas prices, and more expensive grocery \nbills. State and local governments should not add to these burdens by \nraising their own taxes and certainly should not try to divert Federal \ntax reductions intended to help individuals contending with today's \neconomic challenges into their own coffers.\n  One must understand that the Federal Government already provides a \ntremendous amount of financial assistance to State and local \ngovernments. According to the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, the \nFederal Government will provide $476.1 billion to State and local \ngovernments in 2009, an increase of roughly $10 billion from 2008 and \n67 percent more than in 2000. Almost 50 percent of Federal financial \nassistance is spent on health care. Spending on income security, \neducation, and transportation roughly accounts for the remainder.\n  In determining the total amount of assistance the Federal Government \nprovides to State and local governments, one must also factor in the \nforegone revenue that results from tax expenditures which benefit State \nand local governments. The two largest tax expenditures are the \ndeduction for State and local tax payments and the interest exclusion \non public purpose State and local government debt. Combined, these \nprovisions reduce Federal revenue by nearly $60 billion in 2009.\n  Interestingly, if the Federal Government did not provide State and \nlocal governments with assistance, the budget would run persistent \nsurpluses. There would have only been 16 budget deficits over the last \n50 years. U.S. debt would have been substantially lower.\n  I also oppose the $16.8 billion of tax increases included in the bill \nused to offset the cost of the new spending. In particular, one \nprovision would require the payment card industry to design and build a \nnew computer system so that it can collect merchants' transaction \ninformation and provide it to the IRS. It would also require payment \ncard companies to withhold 28 percent of a merchant's reimbursement if \nit cannot verify the company's taxpayer identification number, TIN.\n  No hearings have been held on this proposal and now Congress is \nrushing through an incomplete payment card reporting proposal that has \nnot been adequately vetted. Once implemented, the provision would \nrequire the industry to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to \nredesign their information systems to comply with the new information \nreporting regime. The payment card industry's current computer records \ndo not contain merchant TINs and other information that the proposal \nwould require to be reported.\n  If payment card companies do not currently have a system in place to \nensure valid TIN information on all existing merchants, errors in TIN \nmatching will subject merchants to withholding, even where merchants \nhave provided TIN information. Withholding 28 percent of a merchant's \ngross reimbursements would severely disrupt a business's operations and \nimpair its cash flows.\n  There are programs currently operating that provide responsible \nrelief to struggling homeowners at no cost to American taxpayers. HUD \nhas organized an assistance program, called HOPE NOW, for homeowners in \ndistress to rework their mortgages if both the borrower and lender \ndecide that renegotiation of their mortgages is in their mutual \ninterest. This voluntary program has helped over a million Americans \nhaving trouble paying their mortgages, and I fully support these \nefforts. In less than a year, HOPE NOW has assisted nearly 17,000 \nArizonans negotiate repayment plans with their lenders. Additionally, \nover 6,000 Arizonans have received loan modifications. The HOPE NOW \nProgram was just recently expanded to help even more struggling \nhomeowners in Arizona and nationwide.\n  I oppose H.R. 3221 because I do not think the benefits of the bill \noutweigh the numerous liabilities that could be passed to American \ntaxpayers. Congress should not pass a bill just to show it is ``doing \nsomething'' to help homeowners who cannot make their mortgage payments \nor write a blank check to Fannie and Freddie. This bill passes more \nburden to American taxpayers.\n\n\n                payment card and third party networking\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nChairman Baucus and Senator Snowe about the payment card and third \nparty networking information reporting provision. I am concerned about \nthe impact this proposal will have on small businesses. It is my \nunderstanding that the proposal included in the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act of 2008 is a modified version of the administration's \nproposal that was included in administration's budget for fiscal year \n2009. I ask the Chairman, can you explain who bears the reporting \nrequirement and how the provision was modified?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The provision requires the bank, third party network, or \nthird party processor that settles credit card payments with the \nmerchant to report annually to the IRS and to the merchant the gross \namount paid to the merchant during the calendar year. These reports may \nbe made electronically. The effective day of the proposal was modified \nto apply to information returns for calendar years beginning after \nDecember 31, 2010. Back-up withholding provisions apply to amounts paid \nafter December 31, 2011. Back-up withholding is required only if the \npaying institution does not have a valid taxpayer identification number \non file for the merchant. In addition, for third party networks, there \nis an exception for transactions of $20,000 or less or 200 transactions \nor less.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am also concerned of the impact of this proposal on \nsmall businesses. Senator Kerry and I both want to make sure the \nadditional tax compliance burden on small businesses will be minimal \nand the new information that will be collected will be protected. Can \nthe chairman expand upon how this information will be used by the IRS?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The IRS indicates that it intends to implement the \ninformation reports in a graduated way that will give the agency time \nto use the amounts on a 1099 in a manner to accurately and efficiently \nidentify cases with higher likelihood of noncompliance, potentially \nsparing compliant businesses from unnecessary audits. Existing privacy \nrules will apply to the information reports required under this \nproposal.\n  Mr. KERRY. The provision requires reporting to be made on a calendar \nyear basis. It my understanding that many retailers operate on a fiscal \nyear basis and I want to make sure that this provision will not create \nan unnecessary burden on sm all retailers because they will be required \nto reconcile differences.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The provision provides the Secretary of Treasury with the \nauthority to prescribe regulations or other guidance to implement this \nprovision and prevent the reporting of the same transaction more than \nonce.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I want to make sure that the benefit of improved \ncompliance from information reporting is outweighed by the cost of \ncompliance. Can the Chairman expand on the benefits of the proposal \nversus the burden?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The benefits of this proposal are substantial. IRS \nresearch shows that there is 46 percent compliance rate when there is \nno information reporting and over 90 percent compliance when there is \ninformation reporting. There will be upfront programming costs which \nwill be spread over a number of merchants and a period of years, which \nshould help to minimize the costs to individual merchants.\n  Mr. KERRY. I commend the Senator's efforts on trying to reduce the \ntax gap and improving the underreporting of income. I would like to \ncontinue to work with the Senator on this issue to ensure that the \nprovision is implemented in a manner that is not burdensome to small \nbusinesses.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I concur with Senator Kerry, and appreciate the Senator's \nefforts on addressing the tax gap. While small businesses should not be \nexcused from meeting their tax obligations, I also want to ensure that \ntax gap proposals such as this one meet a delicate balance of improving \ncompliance in the\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\nleast burdensome manner possible for the majority of small businesses \nwho are already in compliance. I look forward to working with the \nSenator on the implementation of this provision in a manner that does \nnot negatively impact small businesses.\n\n\n                              Section 2203\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nChairman Dodd to clarify the intent of section 2203 of the Housing and \nEconomic Recovery Act of 2008. This provision amends section 207 of the \nServicemembers Civil Relief Act, SCRA, 50 U.S.C. App. 527, to limit the \nmaximum interest rate for mortgages that servicemembers obtain before \ntheir military service, during the period of their service and one year \nthereafter. It has come to my attention that there is a drafting error \nin this section that does not reflect the intent of the Congress.\n  In subsection (b), paragraph (1), the phrase, ``in excess of 6 \npercent'' should have included the words, ``per year.'' This would \nreflect the intent to limit the maximum rate of interest for \nservicemember obligations to 6 percent per year during the period of \nmilitary service, and in the case of mortgages, for an additional year \nafter service. Does the Chairman agree that the words ``per year'' were \ninadvertently omitted?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. It is my intent that section 2203(b)(1) should read \n'in excess of 6 percent per year `` before subparagraph (A). This would \ntrack the existing language in section 207(a)(1) of the SCRA that \nrefers to preexisting obligations or liabilities bearing an interest \nrate in excess of 6 percent per year. It is not my intent to modify \nthis aspect of section 207(a)(1).\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chairman for addressing this issue. It is the \nlongstanding understanding of both military servicemembers and lenders \nthat the reduction in interest under this section would be to ``6 \npercent per year,'' which has been existing law for many years. The \nprovision in section 2203 was not intended to change existing law, \nother than to extend the interest cap of 6 percent for servicemembers' \nmortgages for an additional year beyond military service.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity \nto share this issue with the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                              food safety\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue which has \ngotten some attention in our country, but with so many economic \nproblems that face the American people and our families, it probably \nhas not gotten enough attention in Washington. That is the issue of the \noutbreak of foodborne illnesses and other problems that have arisen in \nthe last couple weeks and months with regard to our food supply.\n  As of July 21, 1,256 people in 43 States, the District of Columbia, \nand Canada have been affected since April with the very same strain of \na rare foodborne bacteria, Salmonella Saintpaul.\n  At least 231 individuals have been hospitalized for treatment. Sadly, \nthe deaths of two individuals in Texas have also been connected to the \noutbreak.\n  But many people who get sick from food do not even seek medical \nattention. So many illnesses linked to this outbreak have gone \nundiagnosed.\n  The Centers for Disease Control estimates that for every one illness \ndiagnosed and attributed to Salmonella, 38 more cases actually occur. \nThat means the number of illnesses caused by this outbreak could \nactually number in the tens of thousands.\n  According to the CDC, this is the largest ongoing outbreak of \nfoodborne illness in the United States in at least a decade. It has now \nbeen more than 7 weeks since the FDA first warned consumers against \neating certain types of tomatoes. But since June 2, the numbers of \nindividuals sickened by this outbreak steadily have continued to rise.\n  Many of these subsequent illness reports were due to delays in \ntesting and reporting by States. But a shocking 600-plus people have \nhad illnesses that began after--after--the FDA announced that tomatoes \nwere linked to the outbreak.\n  As a result of the FDA's warning, the U.S. tomato industry has likely \nsustained well over $100 million in collateral damages. Many tomato \ngrowers and wholesalers fear that, like spinach, demand for the \nproducts may be affected for years to come.\n  And now, more than 7 weeks and many tens of millions of dollars later \nin losses, FDA says it is ``highly unlikely'' tomatoes were even \ninvolved in the outbreak.\n  Instead, new test results have lead FDA to now conclude that jalapeno \npeppers are to blame for this multi-State outbreak. But even this \nlinkage has not given us the answers needed to put an end to this \noutbreak.\n  FDA has issued a recall for jalapenos grown in Mexico and distributed \nthrough a company in Texas. But it is unlikely that jalapenos from this \nsmall company can account for more than 1,200 illnesses.\n  While FDA has continued to investigate other parts of the \ndistribution chain, they still do not know where the contamination \nhappened.\n  The FDA and the CDC have candidly stated that there is a very real \npossibility that we may never determine--never determine--the root \ncause of this outbreak. As unsettling as that is, what we have \nuncovered is equally unsettling.\n  Our Government has no way to trace food products from the farm to our \ndinner plates, no way to trace food products. In an era where we can \ninstantly detect and report stolen credit identities, where we have the \ntechnology to instantly pinpoint a person's location, where we can \ntrack an online shopping order from the production process all the way \nthrough delivery to our doorstep, we have no way to trace and determine \nwhere our food came from.\n  There are currently no laws or regulations requiring a national \nsystem for traceability of U.S. foods. While many in the food industry \ndo employ voluntary record-keeping systems, there is no consistency \nfrom one system to the next.\n  Instead, members of the U.S. food industry--from the farmers to the \nprocessors to the distributors to the vendors--use differing systems to \ncapture differing types of data regarding their products. Because this \ndata lacks consistency, it becomes difficult to link or share this data \namong the various partners in the U.S. food industry.\n  Much of this data trail is not even computerized. Instead, it remains \nin antiquated paper files, and it makes FDA's and CDC's job of tracing \nthe cause of this outbreak even more difficult and time-consuming.\n  Compounding these difficulties, many produce items are mixed with \nproducts from various other sources, and then they are repackaged. Some \nfood products even leave the country before being returned for sale in \nthis country, and along the way, these types of products lose any type \nof information that might help us identify their source.\n  This lack of traceability of information about our food is \nunacceptable in this day and age and in this country. Implementing a \nnatural system of food traceability would allow us to more quickly \nidentify the source of contamination in an outbreak of food-borne \nillnesses, and it would allow us to more quickly act in the interests \nof public health to notify consumers about unsafe products they may \nhave in their kitchens. In a recent AP poll, 86 percent of the people \nin the United States said produce should be labeled so it can be better \ntracked to its origin. It is time for industry and the Government to \ntake action to give consumers this information.\n\n  However, implementation of a national traceability system is only \nhalf the battle. There are still 76 million cases of food-borne \nillnesses in this country every year. Those illnesses send an estimated \n300,000 Americans to the hospital each year, and they kill--they kill--\nan estimated 5,000 individuals yearly. Many of these deaths occur in \nyoung children, the elderly, and those with chronic illnesses.\n  I believe the Senate must begin looking at ways to modernize the U.S. \nsystem of food inspection. We must provide the agencies that regulate \nfood safety with additional authority to ensure the safety of our \nNation's food supply, and we must increase resources to the Federal \nFood and Drug Administration so they can hire more personnel and so \nthey can invest in improvements to their systems of inspecting domestic \nand imported food products. We must mandate science-based\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\nregulations to ensure the safety of food products that carry the most \nrisk, and we must improve coordination between the USDA, the Department \nof Agriculture, the FDA, and the various other Federal and State \nagencies charged with regulating food safety.\n  Americans have every right to expect a safe food supply, and we in \nthe Senate owe it to them to make needed improvements to this system \nbefore another outbreak sickens thousands more of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Housing\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I believe Democrats are committed to \nstrengthening our weakening economy by addressing record-high home \nforeclosures and record-high energy prices. The good news is that we \nwill pass--I certainly hope, tomorrow--the housing bill.\n  Even though President Bush originally opposed the essence of what we \nare trying to do in the housing foreclosure prevention bill, he has \nfinally dropped his rather stubborn opposition to an important bill. He \nfinally realizes, as Democrats have for quite some time, that we have \nto act immediately to address the housing crisis. We have to act \nimmediately, not only for the 2 million American homes that could be \nlost and the American dream gets turned into the American nightmare but \nbecause of what that means to us collectively as a nation in terms of \nour economy and what it means to all of us.\n  We have seen our economy continue to go in all of the wrong \ndirections, and we have seen rising inflation costs of essential goods \nthat people and families need. We have seen rising costs of energy, \nwhich I will talk about in a moment, and we have seen decreasing values \nof homes as a result of foreclosed properties within neighborhoods. As \nthis takes place, the value of everyone else's home in that community \ngoes down $10,000 or $15,000. If there are multiple foreclosures, there \nare even greater amounts of home values that are lowered, and those \nvalues which are in their homes, which for the average American is the \nsingle biggest part of their savings and investment and opportunity to \ndraw from, when that value goes down, the opportunity to educate their \nchildren, put them through college, to borrow against it, goes down. \nFor having a medical emergency, the opportunity gets diminished. For \nhaving retirement savings, the opportunity gets diminished. So the \nhousing package has so many dimensions to it that it is critical to the \ncountry.\n  We appreciate that the President has finally dropped his veto threat \nand will sign the bill. It will help Americans keep their homes and \ntheir home equity. We are restoring stability to the housing market and \nhelping businesses and communities hurt by this crisis not only recover \nbut also create new jobs. The bill will help prevent another crisis of \nthis magnitude, stop foreclosures before they begin, and preserve for \nfuture generations the American dream of home ownership.\n  The nearly 8,500 new families filing for foreclosure each day can no \nlonger wait for help. That is why it is my expectation, in a special \nsession we will have tomorrow, Saturday, that we will get the votes \nnecessary, this will pass, and it will go on to the President. It has \nalready passed the House.\n\n\n                                 LIHEAP\n\n  As we talk about saving people's homes, there is another great \nchallenge for many--not only those who face foreclosure but those who \nare working very hard every day to meet their obligations and, in fact, \nsome who have worked a lifetime and find their home mortgages paid off \nbut find themselves with the challenge, as we look forward in the next \nseveral months to the winter season, of the consequences of not being \nable to afford to heat their homes. Yes, there are many Americans in \nthis country who face that challenge. So there will be another critical \nvote tomorrow, and I certainly hope it is a vote that a majority of \nthis body will support; that is, the Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer \nAct that provides an additional $2.5 billion in LIHEAP funding.\n  There is no doubt that the pain at the pump has been devastating to \nmillions of American families, but we cannot forget also that the \nskyrocketing price of home heating oil, propane, kerosene, natural gas, \nand electricity is also breaking family budgets right now. That pain \nwill only get worse as the cold weather approaches.\n  I am particularly concerned about this winter when people will be \nfaced with the prospect of paying $1,000 or more up front to pay for \nthe heating oil they need in the winter. For seniors, for low-income \nfamilies, for people on fixed incomes, and those struggling with a poor \neconomy, these enormous upfront costs are simply out of reach.\n  High energy costs this winter will be severely compounded by our \nstruggling economy. We lost 62,000 jobs in June--the sixth straight \nmonth of job losses. Real wages have fallen rapidly. Housing \nforeclosures are up while home values are plummeting, and we have also \nseen shrinking credit markets, troubled banks, and a volatile stock \nmarket.\n  However, despite all of these problems, it seems we have some \ndifficulty getting some of our colleagues here to understand the \nnecessity of now--the ability to legislate now and to get this resource \navailable and ready to go so people will not go cold in the winter.\n\n  Despite apparent bipartisan agreement on a whole host of issues in an \neffort to clamp down on oil speculation, the minority party said no, \neven though they put that as part of their overall energy package. They \njust said no. We saw that in a vote earlier. Despite agreement on \npursuing conservation, Republicans have said no to pursuing that. \nDespite the fact that the majority leader has even offered them a vote \non the floor of the Senate on their singular issue that we have heard \nfor a week and a half talking about drilling off the Outer Continental \nShelf--even though it won't do anything about gas prices, which was \nrecognized by the Bush administration as such; even though, in fact, it \nrisks the coastal economies worth $200 billion on the east and west \ncoasts; even though it doesn't do anything about breaking our addiction \nto foreign oil or even domestic oil; even though any production would \ntake a decade before we saw a drop and 2030 before we would see full \nproduction; even though full production would be a fraction of what we \nhave seen in reduced demand and increased supply by the Saudis--despite \nall of that, the majority leader said yes, you can have a vote on it, \nand they couldn't take yes for an answer.\n  So if we are going to avert a disaster this winter, it is time for \nour Republican colleagues to say yes. LIHEAP is a program we have to \nhelp the most vulnerable people in this country stay warm in the \nwinter, and for far too long this essential program has been \nunderfunded. Due to this insufficient funding, the average LIHEAP grant \nonly pays for 18 percent of the total cost of heating a home with \nheating oil in the winter, 21 percent of residential propane costs, 41 \npercent of natural gas costs, and 43 percent of our electricity costs. \nIt is only expected to get worse because this is what it covers in \nterms of what it has covered. As prices rise for oil and gas and other \nrelated products, the reality is that it will cover less and less of a \npercentage of the costs necessary to be able to keep families warm.\n  In this poor economy, with a crashing housing market, banks reporting \nrecord losses, joblessness creeping up, and the specter of inflation \nlooming, too many people simply cannot make up the difference out of \ntheir own pockets. With home heating oil now at $4.50 a gallon, if we \ndon't pass this bill, we can face potential tragedy of an unimaginable \nscale this winter.\n  These are individuals who work every day, work at some of the \ntoughest jobs in America, important to us collectively in our economy \nand in our society, yet they struggle to make ends meet. They are not \nsitting at home depending upon the public largesse; they work hard \nevery day. Many of them are working two jobs just to try to make ends \nmeet. But they cannot heat their homes this winter without some help.\n  What does it say to us about our values as a nation? I know the \nCapitol will be warm. I know the leadership offices here have \nfireplaces that will be blazing away. No one is going to go cold in\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\nthe Senate. The question before the Senate tomorrow will be, Will we \nlet Americans in this country go cold and have to choose between being \nable to heat their homes or put food on the table? Will those who have \nworked a lifetime to help build families and communities and now find \nthemselves on fixed incomes be told: Oh, sorry, you can freeze. These \nare not dramatic spectacles of something that will not happen; these \nare the realities of the challenges if we do not act.\n  So we ask our colleagues, especially those on the other side, to join \nus in averting this looming disaster and to vote for the Warm in Winter \nand Cool in Summer Act. It is finally time to say yes to help those who \nare struggling the most in this economy.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Finally, I wish to turn to a third item. We talked about the housing \nbill so critical to our collective economy and to millions of families \nwho need heat and who are in the process of losing their homes or who \nare on the verge of that challenge. We talked about the need to keep \npeople in their homes, those who have struggled to not have to be in a \nforeclosure but still cannot meet the challenges of heating their homes \nfor their families this winter, and what we need to do.\n  Finally, I wish to talk about, once again, the question of energy, \nthe question of gas prices and what we can do.\n  We as Democrats have been working at this for some time. We want to \nincrease domestic production of the oil supply now--not more than a \ndecade from now, not in the year 2030 from now. That won't do anything \nto give anybody relief at the pump tomorrow.\n  It is time to put the American people ahead of the big oil companies; \nthat is the bottom line. They have record profits. We saw that parade \nstart this week with ConocoPhillips, with record profits in their \nquarter. I cannot wait to see the next set of record profits we are \ngoing to hear from the other oil companies.\n  Yet all we hear from many of our colleagues is that we need to give \nthem more--more Federal money, more Federal land, and more of every \nbreak. They are responsible for nothing, and they are the only entity \nthat can solve our energy future.\n  It is such a shame because that is what you overwhelmingly hear. We \nbelieve it is time to put the American people ahead of big oil. We can \nfast-track domestic production. We have 68 million acres that, in fact, \nare already on lease, doubling the lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, \naccelerating leases in Alaska--where all of the infrastructure is, to a \nlarge degree, already. When we talk about drilling off the east and \nwest coasts, there isn't any drilling infrastructure there. The \npresident of the American Petroleum Institute said we don't have the \ninfrastructure, the drilling rigs, the pipelines, the tanker ports that \nare all necessary to do that. So we are talking about a very long time, \nand people need relief in the short term.\n  That is why we have said a couple of things. One, let's end excessive \nspeculation. People sometimes wonder, what does that mean? It means we \nhave traders buying huge quantities of oil online, intentionally \ninflating prices. They turn it around and sell it to other traders at \neven higher prices. These traders never intend to use the oil. It is \nnot that they are going to end up selling it to an entity that will \nactually disperse that oil. The purpose is to bid up the price and cash \nin. The problem with that deal is it might be good for the traders and \nspeculators, but it is terrible news for families who have to pay at \nthe pump.\n  What is it, in fact, that those who say speculation is not that \nimportant don't get about this issue? Yesterday we saw that the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission--the regulatory agency responsible \nto make sure this area of the marketplace is appropriately regulated--\naccused a company of making a million dollars in illegal profits over \nthe course of 11 days. How did they do it? Well, in audio tapes \nuncovered in the investigation, the regulators said one of the \ndefendants described the scheme as an effort to ``bully the market'' by \nmaking a large number of trades at or near the end of the trading day \nto move closing prices. Moreover, unlike many other manipulation cases, \nthis one accuses the defendant of actually succeeding in moving prices \nthat were used as benchmarks for consumer markets--a remarkable claim. \nSo, in essence, they are saying they did bully the market and they did \nmanipulate the market. They made a million dollars in 11 days.\n  But the worst part of it is it resulted in higher prices during a \nperiod of time for gasoline and crude oil. Guess who paid for that. The \nconsumers of this country. Notwithstanding even this latest evidence, \nour friends on the other side have said no to us on pursuing ending \nmarket speculation, having more transparency in the marketplace, and \nhaving the regulators pursue a course that will ensure what oil company \nexecutives testifying before Congress have said--that speculation can \naccount for up to $50 per barrel of oil. Well, I would like to take \nthat $50 out of the cost of oil and end the speculation and the type of \nmanipulative trading that is going on that yesterday the CFTC accused a \ncompany of performing, and succeeding at increasing oil and gasoline \nprices. That is what we have before the Senate. But our Republican \ncolleagues said no.\n  We also believe that releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve is incredibly important. This is a huge reserve we have \nunderground. We buy oil as a country collectively, for all of the \ntaxpayers, and we put it underground. What is the problem? It is a good \nidea except that we have 97 percent of it filled. We have an excess of \na certain type of oil. We are even told by the Congressional Budget \nOffice if we swapped that out and sold a significant element of that, \nwe could do various things. No. 1, taxpayers would make money on it. \nNo. 2, we could bring that oil on the marketplace to help burst the \nspeculative bubble and try to bring down gas prices. No. 3, we would \nchange the type of oil we have for a different quantity that we need of \na different type of oil. So on all counts it would be good. Yet we \ncannot seem to get that done.\n  Finally, we have tried to pursue several times on the Senate floor \nrenewing the tax credits that are critical for us to get out of this \ndilemma, not just in the short term but in the long term. We consume 25 \npercent of all of the world's oil. So even if we opened all of our \ncoasts and everything to drilling, we are not going to create more than \n2 or 3 percent of the world's oil. Bottom line: We are always going to \nbe, if we continue down this road, in a deficit. We are always going to \nbe more of a consumer than a producer. That means to me that, for our \neconomy, our security, and our environment we need to break this \naddiction to oil, whether it be foreign or domestic, and be able to \nseek renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, biomass, and \ncellulosic ethanol.\n  Even T. Boone Pickens, the gentleman who made a fortune in oil, is on \nTV telling us all that we cannot drill our way into the type of energy \nindependence we need. The bottom line is the renewable energy tax \ncredits are what, in my mind, is the most critical element to get these \ndifferent renewable energy sources into the commercialized aspect, with \nthe tax credits necessary to bring them to scale, so we can break our \naddiction. Yet we continue to hear no.\n  It is past time to pursue a strategy of having legislative failure as \na way toward political victory. It is fundamentally wrong to have a \nstrategy of saying no so this body cannot move forward on the critical \nissues Americans face, so that then you can blame the majority party in \nthis body, even though the rules permit the minority to stop the \nmajority from moving forward, and most Americans have been taught there \nis the fundamental lesson of majority rule. In the Senate, because of \nits procedures, when a single minority Member, or a group of minority \nMembers, don't want to allow us to move forward, they threaten \nfilibusters and/or invoke them, and 60 votes are needed. Since the \nmajority has only 51 votes here of Democrats, we need Republicans to \njoin us. When they fail to do that, the Nation's business doesn't move \nforward. That is a great strategy for a political exercise, if you \nthink that exercise is going to bring you victory in November, by \nsaying this body in the Congress cannot proceed on the critical issues \nthat face Americans, but it is a horrid exercise as it relates to the \nNation's major challenges.\n\n  Fortunately, we have been able to break through this several times. \nWe say we want to protect and honor the\n\n[[Page S7474]]\n\nmen and women who serve the country in uniform. It was because of \nDemocrats leading, with Senators Webb, Lautenberg, and others to move \nthat GI bill. Even though the President said: No way, too expensive, \nand it is a fraction of the cost of 1 month in Iraq, he said he was \ngoing to veto it. We said: No way, we are going to honor the men and \nwomen who honor the uniform and take care of them when they come back. \nThat is how a grateful nation honors those who serve. Because of our \npersistence and communicating with the American people, today he signed \ninto law the greatest GI bill investment since the first one--a major \naccomplishment.\n  Tomorrow we will pass this housing bill over the objections of the \nPresident, who said, ``I am not going to sign it''--a major commitment \nto our economy, to restoring the American dream in terms of home \nownership, and making sure we move in a different direction. It is time \nto say yes to the American people, and stop filibustering. It is time \nto stop using the powers of the minority in an abusive way. I respect \nthe powers of the minority, but not to be used in an abusive way that \nundermines the fundamental principle of majority rule.\n  The people of the United States elected a new majority a year and a \nhalf ago to move the country in a different direction. The fact that \nthe minority wants to simply show that, in fact, the Congress cannot \nmove in that direction as a tool of political expediency and a tool of \npolitical success is totally inappropriate and, most important, \ndamaging to the Nation's interest. I hope that starting tomorrow, when \nwe consider the critical issues on housing and LIHEAP, to keep people \nin their homes, and to warm those homes, we can move forward in a way \nthat speaks to the true values of our Nation and the integrity of this \ninstitution.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/25/senate-section/article/S7474-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7474-S7475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JOHN Y. SIMON\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in 1887, 2 years after the death of \nUlysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman wrote in a letter to his old \nArmy Chief of Staff, ``Grant's whole character was a mystery, even to \nhimself.''\n  Today, more than 120 years later, the world has a far better \nunderstanding of Ulysses Grant than did General Sherman, or maybe even \nGeneral Grant himself. And for that, we are indebted to one man more \nthan any other.\n  John Y. Simon, a leading Civil War scholar and the preeminent \nauthority on Ulysses Grant, died on July 8 in Carbondale, IL. Mr. \nSimon, an award-winning historian, spent more than four decades at \nSouthern Illinois University, where he taught courses on the Civil War, \nReconstruction and the history of Illinois. He also served as executive \ndirector of the Ulysses S. Grant Association, based at SIU, since 1962.\n  But his passion and his true vocation was the Ulysses Grant papers \nproject. Mr. Simon collected, edited, and organized hundreds of \nthousands of documents connected with America's 18th President--then \nassembled them to form a vast and astounding collection, which he \ncalled the ``Papers of Ulysses S. Grant.''\n  He began the Grant papers project in 1962 and was close to completing \nit when he died. The 31st and final volume of the collection is in its \nfinal stages. The entire collection is published by Southern Illinois \nUniversity Press.\n  Harriet Simon, Mr. Simon's wife of 51 years, told the New York Times \nthat working on the Grant papers consumed her husband.\n  ``It was daily,'' she said. ``It was weekends and it was most \nholidays. Some holidays, not all day.''\n  John Younker Simon was born in Highland Park, IL, in 1933. He \ngraduated from Swarthmore College and received an M.A. and a Ph.D., \nboth in history, from Harvard, where he met his future wife. He taught \nat Ohio State before finding his place at S.I.U. in 1964.\n  Just as President Grant's own autobiography raised the standard for \nPresidential memoirs, Mr. Simon's work raised the standard for \nPresidential papers collections.\n  Harold Holzer is senior vice president of the Metropolitan Museum of \nArt in New York. He is also a renowned Lincoln scholar and a \ncochairman, along with Representative Ray LaHood and me, of the Abraham \nLincoln Bicentennial Committee. As he told the New York Times, Mr. \nSimon approached his work on the Grant papers as a biographer rather \nthan simply a cataloger.\n  Mr. Holzer said:\n\n       He changed the whole ethos of presidential papers. He \n     matched incoming correspondence with outgoing, so researchers \n     would have a complete episode. He included editorial \n     commentary that was more substantial than footnotes. He wrote \n     introductions to each volume. . . . He is the father of this \n     whole discipline.\n\n  In 2004, Mr. Simon received a Lincoln Prize for outstanding \nachievement for the Grant papers. The awards jury wrote, ``It is \ninconceivable that any historian would write on the Civil War without \nhaving these volumes at hand.''\n  In 2005, John Simon was honored with a lifetime achievement award \nfrom the Lincoln Forum. Frank J. Williams, chairman of the Lincoln \nForum and president of the Ulysses S. Grant Association, praised him as \n``a brilliant scholar, a dazzling writer and an original, irreplaceable \npersonality [who] has enriched the world of Civil War studies and \nenriched the lives of those who know him.''\n  Upon receiving the Lincoln Prize, Mr. Simon said of his life's work:\n\n       I have enjoyed it. It has been an opportunity for me to \n     spend time with a spectacular figure in American history. \n     Grant was a complex character--an unmilitary soldier, an \n     unpolitical president and an unliterary author.\n\n  And Ulysses Grant was often misunderstood.\n  Alexander Stephens, the Vice President of the Confederacy, met \nGeneral Grant toward the end of the Civil War. Years later, he wrote of \ntheir meeting:\n\n       We all form our preconceived ideas of men of whom we have \n     heard a great deal . . . but I was never so completely \n     surprised in all my life as when I met him and found him a \n     different person, so entirely different from my idea of him. \n     . . . He is one of the most remarkable men I have ever met.\n\n  He was an unlikely war hero. At the start of the Civil War, Grant was \nseveral years out of the Army and utterly broke. At one point, he had \nbeen reduced to selling firewood on the street in St. Louis.\n  But the cause of preserving the Union gave Grant a new purpose. He \nreentered the military in 1861, and rose quickly through the ranks, \nthanks to his fearlessness and brilliance as a military commander.\n  In 1864, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General of the \nArmed Forces, a position only ever held by George Washington, and given \noverall command of all Union Forces.\n  The following year, he accepted the surrender of the Army of Northern \nVirginia from General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Courthouse. His \ngenerous terms of surrender and his magnanimity stunned Lee and his men \nand helped a bloodied nation begin to heal.\n  As President during the Reconstruction era, Grant's policies moved \nAmerica further toward reconciliation.\n  Near the end of his life, broke again after being swindled in a \nbusiness venture and in constant pain from throat cancer, Grant agreed \nto write his memoirs to earn money for his family. He wrote feverishly, \nracing against death, and died 5 days after putting down his pen.\n  His friend, Mark Twain, called ``The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. \nGrant'' ``a great, unique and unapproachable literary masterpiece.'' It \nis widely regarded as the finest U.S. Presidential memoir ever written.\n  Understanding the real Grant and helping others to understand this \npivotal figure in our history was John Simon's life's work, and he did \nit with uncommon distinction.\n  In addition to the Grant papers, he wrote and edited a number of \nother books dealing with Grant, Lincoln and the Civil War and produced \nhundreds of journal articles. Along with the Lincoln Prize and the \nLincoln Forum award, he received an Award of Merit from the Illinois \nState Historical Society and many other honors.\n  After the Union victory at Vicksburg, President Lincoln wrote to \nGeneral Grant:\n\n       My Dear General: I write this now as a grateful \n     acknowledgement for the almost inestimable service you have \n     done the country.\n\n  By spending his entire career to give us a clearer picture of ``The \nHero of Appomattox,'' John Y. Simon also performed a great service for \nour country.\n\n[[Page S7475]]\n\nHe brought honor to my State and a deeper understanding to us all. I \noffer my sincere condolences to his wife Harriet, his daughter Ellen, \nhis grandchildren, friends and colleagues, and the many students he \ninspired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/25/senate-section/article/S7475-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about former Senator \nJesse Helms, who passed away on July 4, 2008, at the age of 86. I knew \nSenator Helms well, and I am sure I am joined by many of my colleagues \nin saying that he will be missed.\n  Senator Helms was born in Monroe, NC, in 1921. His first full-time \njob was as a sportswriter for the Raleigh Times. After serving as a \nrecruiter for the U.S. Navy during World War II, Senator Helms became \nthe city news editor for the Times before moving on to do journalistic \nwork in both radio and television. In 1960, he began working at the \nCapitol Broadcasting Company in Raleigh as the executive vice \npresident, vice chairman of the board, and assistant CEO. He became \nfamous in his home State for his daily CBC editorials, which featured \nhis now-famous southern anecdotes occasionally laced with his sometimes \nprovocative political views.\n  Prior to coming to the Senate, Senator Helms' only political \nexperience consisted of two terms on the Raleigh City Council. However, \nin 1972, Senator Helms became the first Republican Senator elected from \nNorth Carolina in the 20th century, replacing the retiring Senator B. \nEverett Jordan.\n  During his three-decade tenure in the Senate, Jesse became known as \none of the Chamber's staunchest conservatives. His refusal to \ncompromise on his beliefs was the source of both his greatest strength \nas a legislator and, as I am sure some would argue, his greatest \nweakness. Indeed, I don't think there are any of us who served \nalongside Senator Helms who did not, at one time or another, find \nthemselves in a disagreement with him.\n  However, while I didn't always agree with Jesse, I do have a number \nof fond personal memories of him.\n  For example, when I first came to the Senate in 1977, Senator Helms \nwas nearing the end of his first term. About 3 months into that first \nsession, still becoming acclimated to life in the Senate, I took a few \nmoments to write down some of my early impressions of my fellow \nSenators. About Jesse, I wrote that he was ``one of the dearest people \nin the Senate,'' and that he had always treated me with kindness and \nrespect. I also noticed that, despite having a reputation for being an \nunmovable conservative, he had a knowledge of parliamentary procedure \nand tactics that was virtually unmatched.\n  A couple years later, I witnessed this knowledge first-hand when \nSenator Helms and I found ourselves on the same side of the debate over \nwhat was being called a ``labor reform'' bill. Sadly, as I was working \nwith a number of my colleagues to sustain a filibuster against this \nunabashedly radically liberal pro-union legislation, our friend Senator \nJames Allen passed away. While we were all saddened by the loss of our \ndear friend, at the back of our minds we were worried that, without \nSenator Allen's mastery of Senate procedure, our efforts might fail. \nHowever, Senator Helms stepped up and provided much needed insight, \nhelping us to block this harmful legislation. At one point during this \ndebate, while many of us were worried about the strength of the \nfilibuster, Senator Helms assured us, saying that we would keep the \nnecessary Senators on the floor ``if they have to wear their pajamas \nand bedroom slippers.''\n  I believe we were all surprised during the latter part of Senator \nHelms' tenure when he coauthored the landmark 2002 legislation \nauthorizing funds that were, at that time, unparalleled for \ninternational AIDS relief. Many of his colleagues, including myself, \nhad sparred with Jesse over providing support for AIDS relief and \nresearch. But, in those last few months of his Senate career, I believe \nhe showed the world that, while he wasn't always the most agreeable of \npoliticians, he was a compassionate man who was committed to doing what \nhe thought was right.\n  Mr. President, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to the Helms \nfamily. As I said, Jesse and I did not always agree on the issues \nbefore the Senate, but I can say, without reservation, that he was a \ndedicated public servant and dear friend to those of us who knew him \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/25/senate-section/article/S7475-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7475-S7476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO GEN ALEXANDER ``SANDY'' PATCH AND THE 65TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n                           OPERATION DRAGOON\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I say to Mayor Bruno, residents of \nRamatuelle, France, and especially to all the French and American \nveterans gathered for this important event, I am honored to lend my \nvoice from afar to the chorus of those who celebrate the past, present, \nand future of the extraordinary bond between our two great nations.\n  At watershed moments in history, France and America have always \nlooked across the sea to each other in friendship and fidelity.\n  When the British colonies reached their moment of truth, our Founding \nFathers stood shoulder to shoulder with Marquis de Lafayette, Comte de \nRochambeau, and countless other Frenchmen who never made it home. Many \nFrench were, as we would later say, ``present at the creation'' of the \nUnited States. And our great experiment, in turn, helped inspire the \nFrench to not just dream of, but actually take to the streets and \ndemand, ``liberty, equality, and brotherhood'' for all of their own \npeople and all of mankind.\n  So when our military leaders came together to liberate France from \nNazi Germany, we weren't inventing a new story from whole cloth. We \nwere reaffirming a centuries-old friendship, giving new life to the \ntimeless ideals we share and the recurrent sense on both sides of the \nocean that the fates of our nations are forever linked.\n  GEN Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, commander of the French forces in \nOperation Dragoon, used to tell a powerful story about a meeting with \nhis American counterpart, GEN Alexander ``Sandy'' Patch. Unlike Sandy \nPatch, General de Lattre lived long enough after the war to reflect on \nhis experiences.\n  When Patch granted him the support he needed to take the fight to the \nNazis, de Lattre wrote that, ``I suddenly saw the clear, grave eyes of \nthe American commander soften. With hesitation that was full of \nshyness, he brought out his pocket-book and from it he took a flower \nwith two stems, which was beginning to fade. `Look,' he said, breaking \nit into two and handing me one of the stems, `a young girl gave me it \non the slopes of Vesuvius on the day before we embarked. She said it \nwould bring me luck. Let us each keep half and it will take our two \narmies side by side on the road to victory.' '' As the French General \nsaid, it was ``a touching wish which was answered by heaven.''\n  General Patch's gift was the personal gesture of a man who was both \ngreat and gracious. It is also a fitting metaphor for the friendship of \nour two countries. Each helped freedom to flower in the other, and we \nare bound together by the enduring fact that we each carry a part of \nthe same idea forward with us.\n  GEN ``Sandy'' Patch--hero at Guadalcanal, liberator of southern \nFrance, whose troops would later cross the Rhine as victors--was a \ngreat American and a great admirer of the French people. Hailing from a \nsmall mining town in the western United States near the Mexican border, \nPatch described General de Lattre in a letter to his wife as ``a \ntypical, intelligent, broadly educated, volatile and attractive \nFrenchman.'' But when the French emerged from their homes in the \nliberated town of Saint Raphael and began to sing their national \nanthem, which had been forbidden just days before, General Patch \nlistened to ``La Marseillaise'' with tears streaming down his face.\n  Although Patch was famously pugnacious as a young man, he grew into a \nman of remarkable personal discipline who remained unafraid of battle \nbut who, as his biographer wrote, ``had a remarkable and brooding \nconcern about the human cost'' of war.\n  He was a man who shunned the spotlight. It is said that when General \nPatch saw himself hailed on the cover of Time magazine as ``Patch de \nProvence,'' he never even read the article.\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\nHis own sense of humility inspired his subordinates to live up to the \nconfidence he placed in them. He was not just respected by his fellow \nsoldiers--he was loved. Smoking his rolled up ``Bull Durham'' \ncigarettes, he remained to his last days an American original and, as \nGEN Dwight Eisenhower memorialized him, ``a soldier's soldier.'' That \nis what he lived to be, and that is what he was.\n  For a soldier's soldier who died of pneumonia just 2 days short of \nhis 56th birthday, the landing here in southern France represented the \nculmination of his life's work.\n  And what an accomplishment it was: Dragoon was a remarkable \nundertaking, and a great success. Coming as it did 6 weeks after Allied \ntroops landed on the beaches of Normandy, operation Dragoon was one of \nthe war's most poorly kept secrets. And yet it arrived with such \noverwhelming force that the Nazis could not resist it. 9,000 men \narrived the first day by air, 77,000 by sea. By the third day, Hitler \nhad instructed a few units to guard the ports and sent the rest of \nFrance's occupiers into retreat. He is said to have called August 15, \nthe first day of Operation Dragoon, ``the worst day of my life.''\n  By August 28, the port cities of Toulon and Marseilles had fallen, \nand within just one month our armies had covered almost 500 miles and \ncaptured nearly 100,000 German soldiers.\n  Of course, none of this came easy. Many suffered for the great dream \nof a France that was once again free--of a Europe and a world free from \nfascism.\n  Women like Marie-Madeleine Fourcade and Helene Vagliano who faced \ntorture from the Germans for their role in the French resistance--but \nrefused to reveal any information that would endanger those who shared \ntheir cause.\n  Men like the French commandoes who landed miles away from the main \ninvasion force and found themselves trapped in a minefield bravely \nresisting German fire.\n  Men like French Sgt Noel Texier, who landed a rubber dinghy and began \nclimbing the 100-meter high flat face of Cap Negre, only to fall to his \ndeath and become, as far as we can tell, the first casualty of \nOperation Dragoon.\n  Young men like ``Mac'' Patch--General Patch's only son, who was \nchristened Alexander Patch III but known to everyone as ``Mac.'' Mac \nPatch took a direct hit from a tank gun and died fighting for a free \nFrance.\n  Tragically, while General de Lattre's only son, Bernard, would \nsurvive World War Two, he too died just 6 years later on the \nbattlefields of Indochina. Both generals outlived their sons, but \nneither by very much. Neither man outlived the crush of grief that came \nafter. With their sons in battle, I can assure you that General Patch \nand General de Lattre never forgot the cost of war--the price of \nfreedom. And neither should we.\n  And so with enormous pride for what these men accomplished and a \nheavy heart for all that they lost, we come together today to mark the \nanniversary of the signature achievement of a great generation of men \nand women. We come together to commemorate a high point of French-\nAmerican friendship, and to celebrate all that we won: the right to \ngather here today, the chance to raise our families in peace, and the \nright to walk as free people down free streets in a free France.\n  On behalf of all Americans, I want to express my gratitude to the \ncitizens of Ramatuelle for their commitment to honor this monument of \nliberation and for the bond forever cemented between us by the brave \nsoldiers and citizens who stood together to make an eternal difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/25/senate-section/article/S7476-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7476-S7477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate.gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The cost of gasoline has made my bi-weekly trip to my \n     folks' home 100 miles away a lot costlier. My dad has been in \n     a physical rehab/residential center since his back surgery in \n     January. My mom has had to learn how to drive and handle \n     finances again after years of my dad doing it. My mom drives \n     almost daily the 35 miles round trip to visit my Dad. \n     Thankfully, I purchased a Toyota Prius last September and my \n     mom is buying a Toyota Corolla for the fabulous gas mileage \n     each of them get.\n       I think the number 1 priority for Congress to be looking at \n     was not one of your choices. The oil speculation on the \n     commodities market has pushed the price far more than the \n     original selling price for a barrel of oil. Take away the \n     speculation additives and we would probably see $3 a gallon \n     for gas. The next option is conservation. Our vehicle (car, \n     truck, etc.) manufacturers need to look up and see what is \n     happening. The emissions and gas mileage laws that are to \n     take effect in approximate 20 years are here today and if \n     they want to stay in business they will have to meet the \n     growing desire for more fuel efficiency and greater mileage \n     of the Japanese. Why are we always too far behind when we are \n     supposed to be the innovators? Looking into alternate fuels, \n     such as hydro would be another good start. Look into these \n     other types of fuel where we are not producing as much \n     harmful waste as we are trying to get rid of our dependence \n     on oil.\n       Please take oil out of the commodities market, for the \n     county's benefit.\n     Rhosan.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband got a whopping 3 percent raise this year. I sure \n     wish I could put a 3 percent cap on the increase in my \n     expenses. As many other Idahoans, we live in the country. He \n     carpools to town (with 2 other guys), where he gets on a \n     large van carpool. The carpool rates just keep going up as \n     the gas keeps going up, soon all of his raise will be in the \n     gas tank and gone. We no longer have any leftover for \n     recreation, which only increases the tension. Why live in \n     Idaho if you cannot afford the gas to go fishing, hiking, \n     scouting, hunting, golfing, and all the other things we love \n     to do?\n\n     Debby, Preston.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Why did you chicken out and sell us out to the gas \n     companies? Instead of grilling the presidents of the gas \n     companies who said they could make a profit even if gas WAS \n     HALF THE PRICE they were selling it at, you did nothing!!! No \n     legislation was passed to control the gas prices consumers \n     pay. This is an old shell game that legislators and gas men \n     have been playing for years. [Now is the time for action!]\n     Steven.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would like to thank you for the e-mail you send out about \n     energy cost increases. It has affected my family because that \n     extra $200 a month I would have been spending on eating out, \n     backpacking, or just purchasing items for the family now \n     means I stay at home. You know this is a growing a vibrant \n     country and I proposed we do all the things you said. Drill \n     offshore, in the continental U.S. and Alaska. We should \n     pursue nuclear power and drill for natural gas as well, \n     pursue coal gasification, synthetic oil through coal. We \n     should not be beholden to environmental extremists. Drill, \n     Drill, Drill\n     Matt, Kuna.\n                                  ____\n\n       First, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to be \n     able to speak out about what I consider a crisis in our \n     country. My wife is an R.N. at Kootenai Medical Center and \n     the high gas prices have really hurt our budget. I am \n     disabled and have to be taken for doctor visits as well as \n     many trips for medications. My mother is 78 years old and \n     lives in Dalton whereas we live in Post Falls.\n       We have to take her to her doctor and shopping, etc. She \n     lives on a fixed income and cannot afford to drive nor can \n     she afford the high energy bills that most low income \n     families have to pay. For those people it is either pay for \n     gas and take the money from food they need or even \n     medications they cannot afford due to these unreasonable \n     costs. It is ridiculous to expect people who, like my sister, \n     get $35.00 a month in food stamps and barely enough to live \n     off to pay these prices. I, for one, do not like to rely on \n     imported oil to get from one place to another. We need our \n     government to find a better way to provide us citizens with \n     fair and reasonable prices for gas and other energy such as \n     natural gas and electricity. There has to be a way not to \n     rely on others for our needs and succumb to their ridiculous \n     prices without destroying our public lands. I feel, for \n     starters, vouchers should be given to the folks who need the \n     help the most and possibly for those who provide a service to \n     their community such as health professionals, police, etc. We \n     need to help each other but with my family, my wife and I \n     foot the bill for family due to their inability to afford \n     even the small things that are needed for everyday living.\n       Thank you for your time.\n           God Bless,\n                                                          Duwayne.\n\n[[Page S7477]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       Your letter indicates your priorities are all screwed up. \n     Your statements that ``. . . I support legislation to fully \n     utilize proven American oil and natural gas reserves in a way \n     that preserves the environment . . . enhanced domestic \n     production, expanded refinery capacity, renewable and \n     alternative energy sources, nuclear power, conservation . . \n     .'' are just plain silly.\n       Unless you and everyone else takes the responsibility of \n     cleaning up and protecting our environment before worrying \n     about the cost of gasoline, Mother Earth will certainly \n     become uninhabitable about the time of Armageddon, which some \n     people say is supposed to happen in this century.\n       We need real leadership from servants like you.\n       The environment is the number one issue. Consider:\n       Carbon fuels:\n       The use of carbon fuels must be drastically reduced. This \n     cannot be done by:\n       Increasing exploration for and production of fossil fuels.\n       Allowing excess profits for the oil industries.\n       Manufacturing ethanol, and other hair-brained boondoggles.\n       Failing to set high mileage standards for motor vehicles.\n       Allowing patent protections to become barriers to energy \n     efficiency.\n       A ho-hum attitude toward developing renewable alternative \n     energy sources.\n       A similar attitude about developing alternate forms of \n     transportation (mass transit).\n       Allowing more urban sprawl.\n       Making war. Manufacturing and fueling war machines uses \n     huge amounts of energy.\n       Recreational toys--dirt bikes, auto racing, off-road \n     vehicles, speed boating, etc.\n       Nuclear Energy:\n       Absolutely not, unless and until the problem of the \n     disposal of nuclear garbage is fully resolved so that our \n     descendants for many generations to come will not have to \n     contend with our stupidity.\n       These are sticky questions. Are you going to lead?\n     Joseph, Sandpoint.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to voice my opinion about the \n     high energy prices. The high gas prices have caused our \n     family to plan our trips better, combine trips, and limit use \n     of one of our vehicles which gets very poor gas mileage. \n     While these are not necessarily bad things, the amount of our \n     income which is spent on fuel continues to rise. I am also a \n     small business owner here in Twin Falls. My business requires \n     my employees and me to travel to various cities in the \n     southern Idaho area to perform computer and network \n     maintenance and support. Our business expenditures for fuel \n     will probably force us to have to raise our service rates.\n       One of the biggest gripes that I have with our Congress is \n     the lack of will to do anything constructive about this \n     energy problem. Legislation is preventing the United States \n     from drilling for oil in our country. Many members of \n     Congress talk a lot about purchasing more fuel efficient cars \n     or using public transportation. While I would love to be \n     driving a fuel efficient hybrid auto, as the father of a \n     family of six, I cannot afford to purchase such a vehicle. I \n     also do not have the financial resources at my company to \n     purchase new autos, either. As you are aware, public \n     transportation in Idaho would not be a profitable enterprise. \n     Our cities are, for the most part, not densely populated \n     enough to justify mass transportation. Besides, I need a \n     vehicle for my job, so taking a bus or train to work would \n     not really be something I could do anyway.\n       I am sure that you will receive many e-mails similar to \n     mine. I hope that you are able to make a difference in \n     solving this problem.\n           Thanks,\n     Scott, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       You have fought hard for us here in Idaho and hope you can \n     do something about the escalating costs of energy. We do not \n     live in a state with subways, rail service and we have \n     limited bus service only in major cities. What is Congress \n     thinking? Please have them change their ways and let us tap \n     into our own reserves. Stop exporting to other countries and \n     help other fellow Americans.\n       The average person in Idaho only makes $7 to $8 an hour and \n     has to travel over 45 minutes to get to work. Adding the \n     extra burden of gasoline, more and more will not be able to \n     go to work. [They will lose] their jobs and then sign up for \n     assistance. Does that make sense?\n       Do something positive for this country.\n     Pamela, Riggins.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for this opportunity to give feedback. All of us do \n     not like paying $4 per gallon. The important thing is that \n     all Americans would be willing to make the sacrifice, just as \n     we did in WWII. We can car pool, change our habits, etc. The \n     difference is that in those days, Congress actually \n     represented the people. Americans would be willing to help \n     out with the energy problems if there was real leadership.\n       When Americans see Congress refusing to give tax credits to \n     those of us who would love to install alternate energy or use \n     solar (as has been done big time in Germany) it leads to \n     massive frustration and then Americans get whiney and \n     complain. But if we had real leadership that said, ``Look, \n     times are tough, but we'll get through it together, and what \n     our country is going to invest in is . . . And we are going \n     to do it like this . . .,'' Americans would willingly pay \n     more at the pump. But right now it all seems so futile. The \n     public pays out big bucks, and Congress will not act to fix \n     the problem.\n       Idaho doesn't even give tax credits for those of us who \n     would very willingly go solar. Or how about tax breaks for \n     citizens who promise to car pool to work or buy cars with \n     high fuel mileage?\n       There is no real leadership, and I do not even expect this \n     note to help, to be honest. But, I guess hope blooms \n     eternally!\n     Foster.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I are both 78 years old . . . I am retired, \n     but my husband works part-time to help make ends meet. The \n     cost of electricity has gone up, the cost of water has gone \n     up, the cost of natural gas to heat our home has gone up, the \n     price of food has gone up, and the price of gasoline at the \n     pump is ridiculous.\n       Why is China allowed to pump crude oil off our shores when \n     American cannot? It seems that there are too many times that \n     Congress has forgotten who they represent--the people, not \n     the lobbyists. What roles are the International Monetary Fund \n     and the World Bank playing in our price of gasoline? We have \n     all the natural resources we need right here in the U.S. but \n     Congress will not let us touch them. Why? It is time to look \n     out for America--that is what you are there to do.\n       Will Rogers once said ``We could slow down the aging \n     process a great deal if it had to make its way through \n     Congress.''\n       Stop bickering and get something done!!! Both parties!!!\n     Dick and Betty, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I live in an RV. I use space heaters in the winter because \n     electricity is cheaper than propane; that is changing. I do \n     not run either of my rooftop A/C units; I run a fan. I live \n     in Nampa and work variable hours in Boise; [public \n     transportation] will not work for me. When gasoline was $3.57 \n     a gallon, it cost me $75 to $80 a week to drive my 1987 Dodge \n     conversion van [which I dearly loved]. I could not afford \n     this. I was forced to buy a 1991 Chevy Astro from my \n     neighbor; he is carrying the contract [the only way I could \n     manage it]. I do not like this vehicle. It has body damage, \n     is impossible to camp in, and is quite unnattractive. Last \n     week, with fuel at $4.07 a gallon, it cost me $47 for one \n     week. It is quite an improvement, but quite a sacrifice. I \n     have long heard stories of highly fuel-efficient engines, \n     rights of which were bought up by The Big Three and the oil \n     conglomerates and put on the shelf, never to see production. \n     What is up with that? When I left Boeing and went into the \n     Navy in 1968, I had a 1961 Olds F-85 that got 26 miles per \n     gallon when fuel was cheap and plentiful. What happened? I \n     have no objection to properly safe-guarded nuclear power \n     sources. I fully believe in sustainable [solar, wind-farm, \n     etc.] resources. I do not care at all for the axe that the \n     Mid-East nations hold at our neck for energy sources. I do \n     not care at all for the oil conglomerates posting record \n     profits while I pay through the nose. We sure need to do \n     something.\n     Edward, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked about my energy costs; well, this is my \n     situation. Back in 1990, I suffered a major heart attack. I \n     was 49 years old. The hospital bills wiped out any savings I \n     had, but all were paid off in full! I received my first \n     Social Security check in December 1990. In 1991, on a Social \n     Security check of $460 monthly, I was making space rent on my \n     trailer, as well as payment on a trailer, and had money left \n     over to get all my other bills paid off, plus put a small \n     amount ($10 or $15) in savings. Now, with a Social Security \n     check of $872 monthly, after paying space rent, I am left \n     with $650 monthly. I allow myself only $60.00 a month for \n     gas. That does not even fill the tank and because of the \n     inflation rate, when you gross out that figure, that is not \n     enough income for banks to even talk to you about a loan to \n     purchase a fuel-efficient vehicle. Sorry to complain, but \n     things were a lot better in the early nineties than they are \n     today. And this ethanol is a joke! What are people going to \n     do later this year when there is a shortage of corn and soy \n     beans? Will the oil companies, who seem to have no regard for \n     us humans, outbid the food processors so they can make more? \n     And my 23-year-old car, it won't run on it anyway. Nor will \n     anybody else's that I know. When I hear of these CEOs \n     ``earning'' 12 million dollars a year, I just want to be \n     sick. Here is an idea. It will not work, I can hear the CEOs \n     screaming bloody murder already. But here goes: 1) \n     Nationalize the oil companies, 2) Set a nationwide price of \n     no more than $1.50. Eliminate all state sales and road taxes \n     off the price. Set a federal sales and road tax of no more \n     than $.75 cents per gallon. Since diesel fuel is a by-product \n     of gasoline, set a price of no more than $.75 cents per \n     gallon, and allow no oil company CEO to earn more than $2 \n     million a year. Like I said, it will never get past Congress \n     (I believe there are too many with their hands out), but \n     would it be nice to be able to bring prices back down, help \n     the little farmer and trucker and all of us old folks.

(IEEPA), I hereby report that I have \nissued an Executive Order (the ``order'') that expands the scope of the \nnational emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, \nwhich was relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order \n13391 of November 22, 2005, and takes additional steps with respect to \nthat national emergency.\n  In Executive Order 13288, I found that the actions and policies of \ncertain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to \nundermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions constituted \nan unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United \nStates and declared a national emergency to deal with that threat. \nExecutive Order 13288 blocks the property and interests in property of \nthe persons listed in its Annex and permits the designation of any \nperson or entity owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act \ndirectly or indirectly for or on behalf of, any person listed in that \nAnnex.\n  Executive Order 13391 took additional steps to address the national \nemergency declared in Executive Order 13288 and amended the provisions \nof that earlier order. Executive Order 13391 blocks the property of the \npersons and entities listed in its Annex and permits the designation of \nany person or entity determined: to have engaged in actions or policies \nto undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions; to have \nmaterially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or \ntechnological support for, or goods or services in support of, such \nactions or policies or any person whose property and interests in \nproperty are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13288, as amended; to \nbe or have been an immediate family member of any person whose property \nand interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order \n13288, as amended; or to be owned or controlled by, or acting or \npurporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any \nperson whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to \nExecutive Order 13288, as amended.\n\n  I have now determined that the continued actions and policies of the \nGovernment of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's \ndemocratic processes or institutions, manifested most recently in the \nfundamentally undemocratic election held on June 27, 2008, to commit \nacts of violence and other human rights abuses against political \nopponents, and to engage in public corruption, including the misuse of \npublic authority, warrant an expansion of the existing national \nemergency and the existing sanctions with respect to Zimbabwe. The \norder supplements the designation criteria set forth in Executive Order \n13288, as amended by Executive Order 13391, and provides additional \ncriteria for designation of any person determined by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State: to be a \nsenior official of the Government of Zimbabwe; to be owned or \ncontrolled by, directly or indirectly, the Government of Zimbabwe or an \nofficial or officials of the Government of Zimbabwe; to be responsible \nfor, or to have participated in, human rights abuses related to \npolitical repression in Zimbabwe; to be engaged in, or to have engaged \nin, activities facilitating public corruption by senior officials of \nthe Government of Zimbabwe; or to have materially assisted, sponsored, \nor provided financial, material, logistical, or technical support for, \nor goods or services in support of, the Government of Zimbabwe, any \nsenior official thereof, or any person whose property and interests in \nproperty are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13288, Executive Order \n13391, or the order.\n  The order also restates existing designation authority to block the \nproperty and interests in property of persons determined to have \nengaged in actions or policies to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic \nprocesses or institutions. Finally, the order restates existing \nderivative designation authority and adds derivative designation \nauthority to block the property and interests in property of persons \ndetermined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with \nthe Secretary of State, to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted \nor purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, or to \nbe a spouse or dependant child of, any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13288, \nExecutive Order 13391, or the order.\n  In the order, I delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, after \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, the authority to take such \nactions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, as may be \nnecessary to carry out the purposes of the order.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n                                                      George W.

Res. 624\n\n       Whereas public schools in the United States are facing a \n     dropout crisis, with approximately 1,200,000 students not \n     graduating from high school on time and only 70 percent of \n     students earning high school diplomas;\n       Whereas truancy has been shown to be the first and best \n     indicator that a child will drop out of school, use marijuana \n     for the first time, and commit juvenile crimes by the age of \n     15;\n       Whereas the incidence of truancy in a recent national \n     survey found that 11 percent of eighth grade students, 16 \n     percent of tenth grade students, and 35 percent of twelfth \n     grade students reported skipping 1 or more days of school \n     during the previous 30 days;\n       Whereas chronic truants often miss more days of school than \n     they attend;\n       Whereas absentee rates relate directly to graduation rates \n     and are highest in public schools in urban areas;\n       Whereas truant eighth graders are more likely to say they \n     do not believe they will graduate from high school or attend \n     college than their peers who attend regularly;\n       Whereas truancy has been found to be a risk factor for \n     substance abuse, teen pregnancy, and school dropout;\n       Whereas the average annual income for a high school dropout \n     in 2005 was $17,299, compared to $26,933 for a high school \n     graduate;\n       Whereas it has been demonstrated that when truancy is \n     addressed, there is a reduction in the rates of daytime \n     crime, juvenile crime, drug use, and delinquency;\n\n[[Page S7481]]\n\n       Whereas effective truancy reduction programs can take many \n     forms and can be implemented in many different settings, \n     including in schools, courts, and through community programs;\n       Whereas truancy prevention programs focused on middle grade \n     students are key to preventing future dropouts; and\n       Whereas truancy reduction programs are highly cost \n     effective, reduce juvenile and adult crime, and save taxpayer \n     money: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 2008 as ``National Truancy Prevention \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the significant harm of chronic truancy to \n     the youth of the United States;\n       (3) acknowledges the work being done by truancy prevention \n     programs throughout the United States to help at-risk youth; \n     and\n       (4) encourages law enforcement, school officials, the \n     judiciary, community leaders, and the business community to \n     work together to address truancy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/25/senate-section/article/S7481-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 625--DESIGNATING AUGUST 16, 2006, AS NATIONAL \n                              AIRBORNE DAY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Ms. \nSnowe, and Mr. Stevens) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 625\n\n       Whereas the airborne forces of the Armed Forces have a long \n     and honorable history as units of adventuresome, hardy, and \n     fierce warriors who, for the national security of the United \n     States and the defense of freedom and peace, project the \n     effective ground combat power of the United States by Air \n     Force air transport to the far reaches of the battle area \n     and, indeed, to the far corners of the world;\n       Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940, an event \n     that validated the innovative concept of inserting United \n     States ground combat forces behind the battle line by means \n     of a parachute;\n       Whereas the United States experiment of airborne infantry \n     attack began on June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test \n     Platoon was first authorized by the Department of War, and \n     was launched when 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon in the \n     days immediately preceding the entry of the United States \n     into World War II led to the formation of a formidable force \n     of airborne units that have served with distinction and have \n     had repeated success in armed hostilities;\n       Whereas among those airborne units are the former 11th, \n     13th, and 17th Airborne Divisions, the venerable 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the versatile 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), and the airborne regiments and battalions (some as \n     components of those divisions, some as separate units) that \n     achieved distinction as the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, the \n     173rd Airborne Brigade, the 187th Infantry (Airborne) \n     Regiment, the 503rd, 507th, 508th, 517th, 541st, and 542nd \n     Parachute Infantry Regiments, the 88th Glider Infantry \n     Regiment, the 509th, 551st, and 555th Parachute Infantry \n     Battalions, the 325th and 327th Glider Infantry, and the \n     550th Airborne Infantry Battalion;\n       Whereas the achievements of the airborne forces during \n     World War II prompted the evolution of those forces into a \n     diversified force of parachute and air assault units that, \n     over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, \n     Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have \n     engaged in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai \n     Peninsula, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force that has evolved from \n     those World War II beginnings is an agile, powerful force \n     that, in large part, is composed of the 82nd Airborne \n     Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and the \n     75th Ranger Regiment;\n       Whereas the modern-day airborne force also includes other \n     elite forces composed entirely of airborne trained and \n     qualified special operations warriors, including Army Special \n     Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and \n     Air Force combat control teams, all or most of which comprise \n     the forces of the United States Special Operations Command;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the \n     United States on September 11, 2001, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the 101st Airborne Division (Air \n     Assault), together with other units of the Armed Forces, have \n     been prosecuting the war against terrorism by carrying out \n     combat operations in Afghanistan, training operations in the \n     Philippines, and other operations elsewhere;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the President's announcement of \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003, the 75th Ranger \n     Regiment, special forces units, and units of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), \n     the 173rd Airborne Brigade, and the 4th Brigade Combat Team \n     (Airborne) of the 25th Infantry Division, together with other \n     units of the Armed Forces, have been prosecuting the war \n     against terrorism, carrying out combat operations, conducting \n     civil affairs missions, and assisting in establishing \n     democracy in Iraq;\n       Whereas the airborne forces are and will continue to be at \n     the ready and the forefront until the Global War on Terrorism \n     is concluded;\n       Whereas of the members and former members of the United \n     States airborne forces, all have achieved distinction by \n     earning the right to wear the airborne's ``Silver Wings of \n     Courage'', thousands have achieved the distinction of making \n     combat jumps, 69 have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds \n     have earned the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, or \n     other decorations and awards for displays of such traits as \n     heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;\n       Whereas the members and former members of the United States \n     airborne forces are members of a proud and honorable \n     fraternity of the profession of arms that is made exclusive \n     by those distinctions which, together with their special \n     skills and achievements, distinguish them as intrepid combat \n     parachutists, special operation forces, and (in former days) \n     glider troops;\n       Whereas the history and achievements of the members and \n     former members of the airborne forces of the United States \n     Armed Forces warrant special expressions of the gratitude of \n     the American people; and\n       Whereas, since the airborne community celebrates August 16 \n     as the anniversary of the first official jump by the Army \n     Parachute Test Platoon, August 16 would be an appropriate day \n     to recognize as National Airborne Day: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 2008, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Airborne Day'' with appropriate programs, \n     ceremonies, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url":

Res. 626\n\n       Whereas 1 out of 3 sexual assault victims is under 12 years \n     of age;\n       Whereas raping a child is a particularly depraved, \n     perverted, and heinous act;\n       Whereas child rape is among the most morally reprehensible \n     crimes;\n       Whereas child rape is a gross defilement of innocence that \n     should be severely punished;\n       Whereas a raped child suffers immeasurable physical, \n     psychological, and emotional harm from which the child may \n     never recover;\n       Whereas the Federal Government and State governments have a \n     right and a duty to combat, prevent, and punish child rape;\n       Whereas the popularly elected representatives of Louisiana \n     modified the rape laws of the State in 1995, making the \n     aggravated rape of a child 11 years of age or younger \n     punishable by death, life imprisonment without parole, \n     probation, or suspension of sentence, as determined by a \n     jury;\n       Whereas on March 2, 1998, Patrick Kennedy, a resident of \n     Louisiana, brutally raped his 8-year-old stepdaughter;\n       Whereas the injuries inflicted on the child victim by her \n     stepfather were described by an expert in pediatric forensic \n     medicine as ``the most severe he had seen from a sexual \n     assault'';\n       Whereas the cataclysmic injuries to her 8-year-old body \n     required emergency surgery;\n       Whereas a jury of 12 Louisiana citizens convicted Patrick \n     Kennedy of this depraved crime, and unanimously sentenced him \n     to death;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court of Louisiana upheld this \n     sentence, holding that the death penalty was not an excessive \n     punishment for Kennedy's crime;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court of Louisiana relied on precedent \n     interpreting the eighth amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas on June 25, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United \n     States held in Kennedy v. Louisiana, No. 07-343 (2008), that \n     executing Patrick Kennedy for the rape of his stepdaughter \n     would be ``cruel and unusual punishment'';\n       Whereas the Supreme Court, in the 5-4 decision, overturned \n     the judgment of Louisiana's elected officials, the citizens \n     who sat on the jury, and the Louisiana Supreme Court;\n       Whereas this decision marked the first time that the \n     Supreme Court held that the death penalty for child rape was \n     unconstitutional;\n       Whereas, as Justice Alito observed in his dissent, the \n     opinion of the majority was so broad that it precludes the \n     Federal Government and State governments from authorizing the \n     death penalty for child rape ``no matter how young the child, \n     no matter how many times the child is raped, no matter\n\n[[Page S7482]]\n\n     how many children the perpetrator rapes, no matter how \n     sadistic the crime, no matter how much physical or \n     psychological trauma is inflicted, and no matter how heinous \n     the perpetrator's prior criminal record may be'';\n       Whereas, in the United States, the people, not the \n     Government, are sovereign;\n       Whereas the Constitution of the United States is supreme \n     and deserving of the people's allegiance;\n       Whereas the framers of the eighth amendment did not intend \n     to prohibit the death penalty for child rape;\n       Whereas the imposition of the death penalty for child rape \n     has never been within the plain and ordinary meaning of \n     ``cruel and unusual punishment'', neither now nor at the \n     adoption of the eighth amendment;\n       Whereas instead of construing the eighth amendment's \n     prohibition of ``cruel and unusual punishment'' according to \n     its original meaning or its plain and ordinary meaning, the \n     Court followed a two-step approach of first attempting to \n     discern a national consensus regarding the appropriateness of \n     the death penalty for child rape and then applying the \n     Justices' own independent judgment in light of their \n     interpretation of a national consensus and evolving standards \n     of decency;\n       Whereas, to the extent that a national consensus is \n     relevant to the meaning of the eighth amendment, there is \n     national consensus in favor of the death penalty for child \n     rape, as evidenced by the adoption of that penalty by the \n     elected branches of the Federal Government only 2 years ago, \n     and by the swift denunciations of the Kennedy v. Louisiana \n     decision by the presumptive nominees for President of both \n     major political parties;\n       Whereas the evolving standards of decency is an arbitrary \n     construct without foundation in the Constitution of the \n     United States and should have no bearing on Justices who are \n     bound to interpret the laws of the United States;\n       Whereas the standards of decency in the United States have \n     evolved toward approval of the death penalty for child rape, \n     as evidenced by 6 States and the Federal Government adopting \n     that penalty in the past 13 years;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court rendered its opinion without \n     knowledge of a Federal law authorizing the death penalty for \n     child rapists;\n       Whereas the Federal law authorizing the death penalty for \n     child rapists was passed by Congress and signed by the \n     President 2 years before the Supreme Court released the \n     decision; and\n       Whereas the Court presumably would have deferred to the \n     elected branches of government in determining a national \n     consensus regarding evolving standards of decency had it been \n     aware of the Federal law authorizing the death penalty for \n     child rapists at the time that it made the decision: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the depraved conduct of the worst child rapists merits \n     the death penalty;\n       (2) standards of decency allow, and sometimes compel, the \n     death penalty for child rape;\n       (3) the eighth amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States allows the death penalty for the rape of a child where \n     the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in \n     death of the victim;\n       (4) the Louisiana statute making child rape punishable by \n     death is constitutional;\n       (5) the Supreme Court of the United States should grant any \n     petition for rehearing of Kennedy v.

Res. \n     53) condemned the kidnapping and hostage-taking of three \n     citizens of the United States, Keith Stansell, Thomas Howes, \n     and Marc Gonsalves for over four years by the FARC, and \n     demanded their immediate and unconditional release;\n       Whereas the Senate expresses sorrow at the murder of Tom \n     Janis by the FARC, another citizen of the United States that \n     was on the downed aircraft, and Luis Alcedes Cruz, a member \n     of the Colombian military, as well as citizens of the United \n     States who died during a hostage search mission in 2003;\n       Whereas the Government of Colombia carried out a historic \n     rescue mission on July 2, 2008, freeing 15 hostages who the \n     FARC had kidnapped and held in captivity, including these \n     three citizens of the United States, Ingrid Betancourt, and \n     military and police personnel of Colombia;\n       Whereas the armed forces of Colombia planned, led, and \n     executed the rescue operation without a single gunshot;\n       Whereas the United States Government played a key \n     supportive role in the rescue mission by the armed forces of \n     Colombia;\n       Whereas the FARC is designated as a foreign terrorist \n     organization by the Department of State and the European \n     Union;\n       Whereas the FARC utilizes kidnappings for ransom, \n     extortion, and the drug trade to finance its activities;\n       Whereas the FARC committed atrocities against citizens of \n     both Colombia and the United States;\n       Whereas the FARC has kidnapped at least 36 citizens of the \n     United States since 1980, and killed 10 citizens of the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the FARC currently holds an estimated 700 people as \n     hostages; and\n       Whereas over 50 FARC leaders have been indicted in the \n     United States for drug trafficking: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes Keith Stansell, Thomas Howes, and Marc \n     Gonsalves home to the United States after being held for over \n     five years by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia \n     (FARC);\n       (2) celebrates with the families and relatives of the \n     hostages who kept faith despite being unsure of the fates of \n     their family members for more than five years;\n       (3) expresses gratitude to the Government of Colombia and \n     the armed forces of Colombia for successfully rescuing the \n     hostages, and applauds the effective contribution of the \n     United States Government to this effort;\n       (4) calls for the immediate release of all hostages held by \n     the FARC and other armed terrorist groups in Colombia; and\n       (5) urges the FARC to lay down their weapons and reject \n     terrorism.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I come here on a happy note. I \nam filing a resolution and I hope this is the kind of thing the Senate \ncan come together to celebrate, the fact that three Americans that were \nheld hostage over 4 years in the jungle by the FARC contraband \nguerillas, a drug-running crowd, murderers who put chains around these \ncaptives' necks just like an animal, a wild animal, and they had to \ncarry these collars, these steel collars with these steel chains, \nheavy, so that was another way of keeping them from escaping. But if \nthey escaped, where were they going to go? They were out in the middle \nof the jungle. This resolution which I am introducing with Senator \nIsakson, because there is a connection of one of the hostages to \nGeorgia, and my colleagues Senators Martinez, Dodd, Coleman, Lieberman, \nCardin, Craig, Bond, Domenici, Hatch, and Chambliss, I would like to \nsee move like greased lightning through the Senate so we can recognize \nthis significant achievement of the Colombian military, assisted by the \nU.S. Government in a miraculous hostage rescue of 15 people, including \nIngrid Betancort, the celebrated and quite well known former senator in \nColombia who also had dual citizenship with France.\n  In this miraculous rescue operation there was not one bullet fired \nand not one drop of blood spilled.\n\n  Our three Americans, all of whom live in Florida--Keith Stansell, \nThomas Howes, and Marc Gonsalves--were held hostage for over 5 years by \nthe Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, after \ntheir plane had crashed on February 13, 2003.\n  The pilot was hurt, and he was executed. There was another Colombian \nwith them at the time who was executed. These three--Keith, Tom, and \nMarc--were taken hostage and, in the words of Keith Stansell, whom I \nhave spoken to today, they were human currency. They were the trading, \nthe barter for the FARC to get whatever they wanted.\n  They kept them over 5 years. They would still have them if they did \nnot have this miraculous rescue operation. This is one of the few times \nyou have seen in the entire world where the world came together and \nfocused and said: That is a job well done; for it was reported how \nmiraculous this was,\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\nthrough deception, through interception of communications, through \ncreating a story line that this was an operation to come in and move \nthese hostages from one part of the jungle to another.\n  By creating such a good ruse, they were actually--with all these 15 \nhostages in 3 different places, 50 miles apart from each other in the \njungle--they were able to get their FARC captors to bring them together \nin one location, and to load on a helicopter that they thought was \ngoing to be taking them to the No. 1 commander of the FARC in another \npart of the jungle.\n  It is a miraculous story: the fact that it was pulled off by a \nhostage rescue team--all volunteers, playing their roles--but knowing \nthat if it went awry, they, too, would become hostages of the FARC.\n  We want to send our congratulations to the Colombian Government, the \nColombian military, and especially to that hostage rescue team that \nperformed so flawlessly but that knew the risk they were taking.\n  This resolution I have submitted honors our three Americans and \nrecognizes their families and their relatives who kept faith all these \nyears--all those years, over 5--without even knowing the fate of their \nloved ones.\n  Finally, on July 2 of this year, Colombian forces carried out this \ndramatic rescue mission, freeing those 15 hostages, including Keith \nStansell, Thomas Howes, and Marc Gonsalves.\n  In this Colombian rescue operation, not a gun was fired; the \nplayacting, the ruse, the deception was so good, not a drop of blood. \nIt is going to go down in history as a model for these kinds of \noperations.\n  We in America are very grateful to President Uribe; to Defense \nMinister Santos, whom I had the pleasure, a couple days ago, of \nhosting; and the Colombian military for the execution of this historic \noperation and for bringing our men and their folks home to freedom.\n  I wish to recognize our commander of the U.S. Southern Command, \nAdmiral Stavridis, and I wish to recognize our U.S. Ambassador to \nColombia, Bill Brownfield, for the exceptional work they have done to \nstrengthen the United States-Colombian relations which laid the \nfoundation and the close coordination that was demonstrated by this \nsuccessful operation.\n  I believe this dramatic hostage rescue and the competence and \nprofessionalism that was demonstrated by the Colombian military have \nnot only put the FARC on notice, it has put them on their heels. They \nare in disarray. They are demoralized. There are defections from FARC \nevery day.\n  The FARC is designated by our Government as a foreign terrorist \norganization because it has committed atrocities against the citizens \nof Colombia and the United States.\n  The FARC still holds 700 people as hostages. When I talked to Keith \nStansell today, he said what we have to do is to keep remembering them. \nBecause of the rescue of the 15 hostages, he said they have now put \nheavier chains around their necks and they are making them constantly \nmove. You can imagine: 700 people. He told me about individual hostages \nand how brave they have been. He said: Let's don't forget them. And \nlet's keep talking about this until they are able to bring all those \npeople safely home.\n  So I wish to echo what has already been said by the Government of \nColombia, that we call on the FARC to lay down their arms. They are not \ngoing to win. They can see it now. They are demoralized. They are \nhaving defections every day.\n  Come to your senses, revolutionary guerrillas whom you think you are. \nCome to your senses and work out a plan with the Colombian Government \nand President Uribe to release the remaining hostages you have--\nhundreds of them.\n  We say to Mr. Cano, the leader of the FARC, your numbers are \ndwindling. Today you have only about 8,000. This is less than half the \nforce you had just a few years ago. And you are losing your rank-and-\nfile soldiers because they see it is a lost cause. And you have \nsuffered losses in your secretariat and in the mid-level ranks by death \nand desertion.\n  These are significant losses. The U.S. people have stood with the \nColombian people as they fight this violence, this impunity, this \nnarcotrafficking in this little country of Colombia.\n  It is a happy occasion for us but a sobering reflection upon those \nwho are still held similar to animals in cages. It is a happy occasion, \nand we are overjoyed at the return of Keith and Tom and Marc. But \nColombia's war against the narcotraffickers is not over.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/25/senate-section/article/S7483-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 628--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF \nDISABILITY PRIDE DAY AND RECOGNIZING THAT ALL PEOPLE, INCLUDING PEOPLE \n LIVING WITH DISABILITIES, HAVE THE RIGHT, RESPONSIBILITY, AND ABILITY \n  TO BE ACTIVE, CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF SOCIETY AND FULLY ENGAGED AS \n                     CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for Mr. Obama (for himself and Mr. Durbin)) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.
