May each of them be enlightened with Your wisdom and \nsustained with Your love.\n  We pray, too, for those who serve us in harm's way: sailors, \nsoldiers, marines, airmen, and coastguardsmen who willingly sacrifice \nthe protection and comfort of home and family to defend our safety and \nour security. We pray also for their loved ones left at home, family \nand friends whose daily vigil is the worry for their warrior's well-\nbeing. Eternal God, we pray for warrior and worrier alike. Keep them \nunder the protecting shadow of Your wing.\n  Dear God, make each of us more worthy messengers of Your will, that \ntogether we might make real the ancient dream that justice shall flow \ndown like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream and our world \nbe perfected under Your unchallenged rule.\n  Eternal God, bless us and protect us.

They have come such a long way in the time since they were \ncreated. Their workers serve in extremely tough and very dangerous \nsituations and conditions. John McCain has been chairman of the \nInternational Republican Institute, and Madeleine Albright chairs the \nNational Democratic Institute for International Affairs. We appreciate \nso much the work and service both these institutes perform throughout \nthe world in developing and creating democracies.\n  I am so sad to report that yesterday in Baghdad a convoy carrying a \nteam of NDI employees was attacked and four NDI employees were killed, \nincluding one American. This tragedy is a reminder that we have \nsacrifices of all kinds being made on behalf of democracy across the \nworld. The Nation mourns the losses that occur in Iraq on\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\na daily basis. Yesterday, 170 Iraqis were killed that we know of, 4 \nAmericans. I haven't received the reports this morning on what happened \nlast night. We also mourn for people like these gallant individuals, \nwho were there trying to make the world a better place. Our thoughts go \nout to the families of these four individuals. Later today, their names \nwill be spread across the Record of the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S710-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, just days before the start of the 110th \nCongress, I had the great honor of traveling to Bolivia, Peru, and \nEcuador in South America with our majority leader, Harry Reid, as well \nas four of my other colleagues: Senator Judd Gregg from New Hampshire, \nSenator Bob Bennett from Utah, Senator Kent Conrad from North Dakota, \nand Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. It was a great and wonderful trip \nfor me for a number of reasons.\n  First, my own view is that over the last decade, and perhaps even \nmore, this country has not paid enough attention to our relationship \nwith Latin America and South America. For me, there is a special bond \nand relationship because of my own history in the Southwest of the \nUnited States. My family founded the city of Santa Fe, NM, now 409 \nyears or four centuries ago. So before Plymouth Rock was founded or \nJamestown was founded, my family was already living in what is now the \nnorthern part of the State of New Mexico.\n  The place I come from still bears the same names that were put on \nthose places by the Spaniards who settled northern New Mexico and \nsouthern Colorado. There is our ranch in the San Luis Valley. When you \nlook around to the mountains to the east, those mountain ranges are \ncalled the Sangre de Cristo Mountains or the Blood of Christ range. The \nmountain ranges in the west at 14,000 feet are named after John the \nBaptist, the San Juan Mountains, and the river that runs through our \nranch is called the Rio San Antonio, the Saint Anthony River. That \nhistory has always created a very special bond with our neighbors to \nthe south in Mexico and Central America and Latin America.\n  When Senator Reid and the delegation of six Senators went to South \nAmerica, it was important for me because what we were doing as a \ncollective group was making a strong statement to Latin America that \nthey are our friends and that we will be working closely with Latin \nAmerica to make sure that the bond and the relationship between the \nUnited States of America and those countries to the south is a bond \nthat is strong and one that will continue.\n  I also was very pleased with the fact that it was a bipartisan \ndelegation. As we met in those countries with the Presidents of Bolivia \nand Ecuador, it was important that we were one voice, telling the \nleaders of those countries that we would find ways in which we would \nstrengthen the relationship between the United States and those \ncountries. That signalled a friendship and mutual interest on the part \nof the U.S. Government to those countries, and it was very important.\n  I believe we need to recommit ourselves to strengthening our \nrelationships with Latin America. I also believe our failure to do so \nwill imperil the U.S. strategic interests in fighting terrorism, \ncombating drugs, and helping democratic governments throughout Latin \nAmerica.\n  Over 45 years ago, there was another Senator taking on a new role in \nour Nation's history in this city, and at that time he reached out to \nLatin America with a program that he called the Alliance for Progress. \nOn March 13, 1961, as the Cold War was beginning to mushroom, President \nJohn Kennedy launched the Alliance for Progress--known in Spanish \nthroughout Latin America as la Alianza del Progreso--with a vision to \ncreate a strong and united Western Hemisphere of nations. On that \nmomentous day, President Kennedy spoke with remarkable clarity about \nour country's connection with Latin America. He said:\n\n       We meet together as firm and ancient friends, united by \n     history and experience and by our determination to advance \n     the values of American civilization. This world of ours is \n     not merely an accident of geography. Our continents are bound \n     together by a common history. And our people share a common \n     heritage--the quest for the dignity and the freedom of man.\n\n  The effort of the Alliance for Progress was not as successful as \nPresident Kennedy wished. Indeed, over the next half century, we \nwitnessed political upheaval in many of the Latin American countries, \nand we saw strained relationships between the United States and some of \nthese nations. But the Alliance for Progress did work to establish good \nwill among the people of the Americas, and we can learn from its \nshortcomings as we continue to move forward.\n  As we enter 2007, I hope our six Senators have begun to shine a \nspotlight on our strategic alliance with Latin America. Under that \nspotlight, you will find the difficult and complex issues of \ninternational trade, immigration, and the battles we wage together \nagainst the awful scourge of drugs which affects the populations of \nthose countries as well as ours. We also face the challenge of \nincreasing economic opportunity and eliminating poverty in that part of \nthe world.\n  Our first stop in South America was in Bolivia, which is one of the \npoorest countries in this hemisphere, with one of the largest \nindigenous populations in Latin America. We met with Bolivia's \nPresident, Evo Morales, who was sworn in in 2006 as the country's first \nindigenous President in its history. We spoke with President Morales \nabout his concerns relating to coca production and our concerns about \ncoca production in Bolivia. We also spoke to him about the interest of \nBolivia in extending the Andean trade preferences agreement. I believe \nit was a productive dialog, but we must continue the dialog if we are \nto build a stronger relationship with the country of Bolivia and keep \nBolivia from going down a path which ultimately will end up in \nopposition to the interests of the United States.\n  We also there met with the U.S. Agency for International Development \nand learned about the scope and impact of their projects in Bolivia. \nUSAID is working to create economic opportunities and alleviate \npoverty, which is so important to improving the lives of the Bolivian \npopulation.\n  In Ecuador, we met with President Correa, who was busy preparing for \nhis January 15 inauguration. He took time to meet with us, assembling \nhis Cabinet and talking about the importance of the relationship \nbetween Ecuador and the United States. President Correa pledged to shut \ndown the drug trafficking that is occurring in and around Ecuador and \nalso raised the need to extend the Andean trade preferences program.\n  When we visited the LatinFlor flower farm, we saw firsthand the \nimpact of this trade program. It is creating thousands upon thousands \nof jobs for the people of Ecuador and keeping people\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\nthere from being recruited by drug traffickers or from having to flee \npoverty through illegal immigration into the United States.\n  In Peru, we met with President Alan Garcia. The United States and \nPeru have long had a strong and lasting relationship.\n  In fact, during World War II, as Senator Reid reminded the President \nof Peru, Peru provided our country with the strategic materials that \nwere necessary to carry on the war and allowed the United States to set \nup military bases in Peru and take the fight on in the South Pacific.\n  President Garcia is very interested in seeing the U.S.-Peru free \ntrade agreement approved by the U.S. Congress. While questions have \nbeen raised about this agreement, I am hopeful and confident that we \nwill work through those issues. I look forward to learning more about \nthis agreement and some of the issues that have been raised by some \nMembers about the labor and environmental provisions of the agreement. \nI admire President Garcia's interest in formulating fundamental and \nlong-lasting change for the poor people of Peru, to improve education, \nnutrition, and basic health services.\n  I hope Democrats and Republicans can work together to lift all of the \npeoples of the Western Hemisphere to a place of hope and opportunity, \nincluding those who live in the margins to the south of us. So now it \nis time for the United States of America to meet the eyes of our Latin \nAmerican neighbors and to ensure that the many countries sharing our \nhemisphere will bequeath to our children a common land and future for \nthe people of all the Americas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I also rise to discuss the recent \nmeetings we held in South America. The nature of the meetings has been \noutlined by the Senator from Colorado and, obviously, the majority \nleader.\n  I think I should start by saying that I admire the majority leader \nfor putting together the delegation--and I appreciate having \nparticipated in it--which was bipartisan. More importantly, the \nmajority leader chose as his first outreach in the area of foreign \npolicy, in the sense of his taking the status of majority leader of the \nSenate, which is a significant status, to go to these countries in \nSouth America--countries which, regrettably, we probably haven't put as \nmuch energy and effort into as we should have over the years, and \ncountries that are important to us in a variety of ways. So I think his \nchoice of these three nations--important nations that are major players \nin our neighborhood--was significant and appropriate. I appreciated the \nchance to participate in it.\n  In all three of these nations we are seeing significant change--\nchange which I sort of sense is in a historical context of repeating, \nin many instances, past actions. South America has, unfortunately, had \na history of going from democracy to military leadership to populace \nleadership and then back to democracy. These three nations have all \nrecently held very democratic elections, and they have elected very \noutspoken leaders, some of whose views I agree with and some of whose I \ndefinitely do not agree with. But they are in the vortex of a movement \nin Central and South America involving the question of populace \nsocialism as presented by, in part, obviously, Fidel Castro and, more \nrecently, President Chavez of Venezuela. We have seen in that sort of a \npopulist, socialist movement, a distinct antagonism toward democracy. \nIn fact, Cuba hasn't had an election in 40 years. I don't know whether \nwe will see a real election in Venezuela again in the foreseeable \nfuture. So I think it was important for us to show the American spirit, \nwhich is committed democracy, liberty, and individual rights, and \nhaving an electoral process that works--to show that spirit by coming \nto these three nations that recently held elections and elected new \nleadership.\n  There are a lot of issues involving these nations. Bolivia and \nEcuador and Peru have significant questions relative to poverty. But \nthere are three issues which dominate our relationship with them, which \nhave been discussed already, and which we discussed with their \nleadership extensively at different levels, starting with the \nPresidency of those three countries. Of course, the first is the \nquestion of illegal drugs such as cocaine.\n  I think it is rather difficult for us as a nation to go to a country \nsuch as Bolivia, which is exporting cocaine products mostly to Europe, \nor Ecuador and Peru, which export it here--it is hard to go to those \ncountries because we don't come with clean hands. Basically, we are the \ndemand. As long as we have the demand in this Nation, which is so \noverwhelming, somebody is going to supply that demand. So we have put \nthese nations at risk by us having our demand for the use of these \nillegal drugs, especially cocaine. I feel compassion for these nations \nin that we have undermined them by our Nation putting so much pressure \non them regarding illegal trafficking. You have to admire their \nleaders.\n  It was great to travel with the Senator from Colorado and his wife. \nIt was nice to have an American face that spoke pure Spanish. It gave \nus a presentation that immediately gave us identity with those nations. \nSo it was wonderful to have the Senator and his wife there, especially \nfor those of us who allegedly spoke Spanish when we were in college but \nnever really did. Each one of these Presidents was totally committed to \nfighting illegal drugs. They recognize the harm it is doing to their \nnations. So we want to support them in that effort.\n  Secondly is the issue of immigration, which again, to some degree, \nyou can understand their problem, which is that they have people who \nwant to support their families and they come to America to do that, and \na fair number come illegally. How we deal with that as a country is a \nbig issue for us and for those nations. Money coming back into those \ncountries as a result of Ecuadorians or Peruvians working in America \nand sending money back significantly contributes to their economy. They \nwant to have the ability for their people to come here legally. We want \nto structure a system to help them.\n  The reason people are leaving those countries goes to the third \nissue, which is trade. They need good jobs in their country. There are \nproducts that they can provide in their countries which, in the classic \ncontext of comparative advantage, they can do better than we can. The \nsame is true vice versa. In fact, we can do a lot of things better than \nthey can. So open and free trade is something they want. Every one of \nthose leaders wants open and free trade with the U.S, which is a very \npositive attitude on their part because we can produce more products \nthat they need, with value added, and they can produce products we \nneed. I suspect we will be in a surplus fairly quickly with each one of \nthese countries if we go to a true free market. That will raise the \nstandard of living down there, which will relieve, to some degree, the \npressure for illegal immigration to the U.S.\n\n  So it works to our benefit, and not only from the standpoint of \ntrade. One of the interesting statistics I saw in Peru was that trade \nfrom New Hampshire increased 880 percent over the last 2 years--that \nincrease of New Hampshire-produced goods going into Peru. We started at \na very low base, but a couple of corporations I am familiar with have \nsignificantly expanded economic activity in Peru and, as a result, the \nopportunity. So there are two pending agreements, one of which we \nextended, the Indian Free Trade Agreement and Drug Enforcement Act, and \nthe other the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement. I especially think we need \nto address the second one.\n  Peru has a government that is more market oriented, that is not \npursuing nationalization or quasi-nationalization of any foreign \ninvestors there, as has happened in Ecuador and Bolivia. Therefore, we \nshould be sympathetic to that government. This agreement is not going \nto significantly expand issues that are international in the sense of \nthe free trade bite, and we have those issues with China, obviously, \nand Southeast Asia. To the extent there are environmental and labor \nissues with other countries, that is not in play relative to Peru. That \nis not that big an economy. The Peruvian agreement has been caught up, \nunfortunately, in this bigger contest in the Congress, and in the \npopular opinion of\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\nAmerican political culture, on the issue of the bigger issue of free \ntrade. We should try to separate it and move the Peruvian Free Trade \nAgreement forward promptly, if we can, recognizing that it will \nsignificantly improve our relationship with Peru and, more importantly, \nbe a statement in the part of the world that we need to have a \nstatement that we are committed to market forces in the face of what is \nclearly not occurring in Venezuela, which is where you are seeing \nmassive nationalization and a compression and flattening of market \nforces and a flattening of democratic forces, and that is an issue \nabout which we need to be concerned.\n  If we can assist Peru and Bolivia and Ecuador in being more \neconomically successful in using a market-oriented model, that is going \nto undermine the capacity of Venezuela to export their form of populace \nsocialism, which in the end is going to lead, if they are successful, \nto undermining the quality of life throughout South and Central \nAmerica.\n  So it was, in my opinion, a very worthwhile trip. I learned a great \ndeal and met a lot of interesting people. We had the opportunity to \nmeet extraordinary people who worked in our State Department. Each one \nis a very talented and dedicated person. The people in the Peace Corps \nare extraordinary. The people working in the AID and microlending \nprojects are doing good work and, of course, the government officials \nof each country, including the incoming Presidents. It was very \nvaluable. I congratulate the majority leader for pursuing it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I join with my colleagues who were part \nof the delegation to Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. I also salute the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, for making as his first trip as majority \nleader one to these countries in our hemisphere. I think it sent a very \nimportant signal to those countries that America is interested in them, \nthat America cares about them, and that we want to improve relations \nwith them. It did make an impression.\n  In country after country, people told us they could not remember the \nlast time a Senate delegation from the United States had come. They \ncould not recall a delegation of this size and this significance \ncoming. You could tell it made an impression.\n  Now, why was it important to go? I believe it was important to go \nbecause, first, we see Mr. Chavez, the head of Venezuela, attempting to \nput together an anti-American bloc in our Southern Hemisphere. Even a \ncasual observer can see that is being attempted.\n\n  After going to these countries and meeting with the Presidents of \neach--President Morales, President Correa, President Garcia, and their \ncabinets--meeting with our Ambassadors in each of the countries--our \noutstanding Ambassador to Bolivia, Philip Goldberg, our Ambassador to \nEcuador, Linda Jewell, who impressed us all with her professionalism, \nand our Ambassador to Peru, James Struble, deeply knowledgeable, \nsomeone who has had wide-ranging experience all around the world--I can \ntell my colleagues that one of my impressions from this trip was the \nabsolute excellence of our Foreign Service people in each of these \ncountries. They were superb.\n  But I was also deeply impressed by how serious Mr. Chavez is about \nputting together an anti-American block. In one country, he is buying \n30 radio stations, putting up 30 radio stations to influence public \nopinion. In other countries, he had interceded in the elections--some \ndirectly, others indirectly--in order to try to achieve a result. In \nfact, in Peru, he went so far as to openly endorse the candidate who \nlost to Mr. Garcia.\n  It is very clear, if one goes country to country--Bolivia, Peru, and \nEcuador--that Mr. Chavez is working actively and, I might say, hand in \nglove with the Cubans, to try to influence outcomes there. We see, and \nhave seen in recent weeks, Mr. Chavez take a series of steps, in terms \nof expropriation, that I think ought to send a message about his \nintentions.\n  This delegation consisted of the majority leader, Senator Reid, \nSenator Durbin, the majority whip, Senator Bennett, at the time of the \ntrip the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, Senator Gregg, at \nthe time of the trip chairman of the Budget Committee, and Senator \nSalazar, who really did light up the faces of people in these countries \nas he speaks such perfect Spanish. One could tell what a difference \nthat makes. My wife speaks some Spanish as well. Of course, Senator \nSalazar's wife is very fluent in Spanish. One could see how it lit up \npeople's faces when those three members of our delegation spoke \nSpanish.\n  In addition to the question of Mr. Chavez and his plans to create an \nanti-American bloc there were other important reasons for this trip. On \ntrade, we have the Andean Trade Preferences Act that will expire. It \nwas only extended for 6 months in the last Congress. Make no mistake, \nthat Trade Preferences Act is critically important to the economies of \nthese three countries. Literally, hundreds of thousands of jobs in \nthose countries are at stake if the Andean Trade Preferences Act is not \nextended.\n  I know there is some controversy attached to it, but if one sees the \npotential outcomes of a failure to extend the Andean Trade Preferences \nAct, one can see that the pressure for more people to come to this \ncountry will intensify and intensify dramatically. That is not in our \ninterest. We already have millions of people from these three countries \nwho are in our country, many of them illegally. That is a fact. If we \nwant millions more to come, one way to assure that is to turn a blind \neye to what is needed for those countries to have a chance to suceed.\n  In country after country--these three countries--we learned that half \nthe people are living on less than $2 a day. We are talking millions of \npeople living on less than $2 a day. We saw poverty that was akin to \nwalking back into time. People are living at a level of subsistence \nthat is almost unimaginable, certainly unimaginable in our country. We \nhave areas of great poverty, but to see people living literally in \nhovels and huts without electricity, without a clean water supply, \nother than a river flowing by, without sewage, without anything other \nthan the most meager subsistence kind of life is jolting. A dramatic \nproportion of their populations being in that condition sends a very \nsobering signal about the challenge facing this hemisphere. So I think \nit was very important that Senator Reid chose as his first trip to go \nto countries such as Bolivia. Bolivia is the second poorest country in \nour hemisphere. Only Haiti is poorer.\n  One of the reasons we learned that delegations are not necessarily \neager to go to these countries is because they are at 13,000 feet, \n11,000 feet, and it takes a little adjustment to get used to it. One \nspends part of the time walking around with a headache. These are not \nplaces that are the first on most people's list of where they want to \ngo. The fact that Senator Reid chose this as the first place that he \nwould take a delegation sent an important message.\n  Not only do we have this challenge of Mr. Chavez in Venezuela and the \nquestion of the Andean Trade Preferences Act that runs out because it \nwas only extended 6 months in the last Congress, we also have the free-\ntrade agreement with Peru pending. That is a controversial matter. We \nunderstand that. In the House and the Senate, that is a controversial \nmatter. We have been assured by the trade ambassador's office that they \nwill seek to negotiate some of the labor provisions of that agreement \nin order to make it more acceptable and have a greater chance of \npassage. I welcome that indication from the trade ambassador's office, \nand I hope they pursue it aggressively.\n  Still another important reason for this delegation going to Bolivia, \nEcuador, and Peru is, of course, most of the illicit drug traffic comes \nout of the Andean region. Bolivia is increasingly a factor. Most of \ntheir product has not come to the United States, as Senator Gregg \nindicated, but we all know that the drug trade, once it rears its ugly \nhead, has spillover effects everywhere.\n  Peru, obviously, is an important drug-trafficking location, and \nPresident Garcia assured us of his absolute commitment to fight the \ndrug trade. In fact, they told us of a commitment they had made in \ntheir budget to spend their money combating illicit drug trade in their \ncountry because they recognize the toxic and corrosive effect it will \nhave in their society.\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\n  We should salute President Garcia for stepping to the plate and \ncommitting funds in a place that is very hard pressed for money, as we \nare in a different way, that they are committing their own money to \ncombating the illicit drug trade and at some substantial risk to \nthemselves. Let's be clear, those drug cartels are vicious, they are \nmurderous, and they are not averse to taking lives from those who \noppose them.\n  I want to indicate one exchange we had that I believe gives an \nexample of why it is important to do this kind of outreach.\n  In Bolivia, we heard rumors, discussions that the Government there \nbelieved there was a plot by the United States to destabilize the \nMorales Government. When we met with President Morales, I raised that \nissue with him. I said: We have heard repeatedly you have concerns that \nthere is a move by our Government to destabilize yours. I was able to \ntell him that our delegation had quizzed all aspects of our Government \nvery closely on that question before we went into the meeting with him, \nand we were assured in significant detail that there is no such plan by \nour Government to destabilize the Morales Government, that, in fact, \nthere has been no discussion of any move to destabilize his Government.\n\n  He became very animated at that point and went through a series of \nexamples of events that told him or at least that gave him concern that \nperhaps there is a plot by our Government to destabilize them. He was \nvery specific. He talked about an American who went into the country \nand set off bombs in La Paz last year. He gave as a second example of \nAmerican students who had taken his picture when he was with President \nHugo Chavez of Venezuela. He believed that was perhaps part of an \nAmerican Government enterprise to spy on him. He cited the example of \nhis Vice President being denied boarding rights to an American \nairliner.\n  He felt all of these events were indicators--at least indicators to \nhim--that perhaps the United States was seeking to destabilize his \nGovernment.\n  Ambassador Goldberg was able to go through each of these examples \nwith him and give him answers as to why these events had nothing to do \nwith the United States. In the case of the American who set off bombs \nin La Paz, this is somebody traveling on a world federalist passport, \nillegal documents, had nothing to do with the United States--in fact, \nwas an unstable person and recognized as such by our Government.\n  On the question of the pictures being taken of President Chavez and \nPresident Morales, our Ambassador indicated that these were people who \nwere fans of the two and were simply tourists taking pictures.\n  On the question of boarding being denied the Vice President on an \nAmerican airline, the Ambassador was able to point out that our \nGovernment then moved to make it right by providing our aircraft so \nthat the Vice President of Bolivia could make the trip to the United \nStates.\n  I believe this trip was important in sending a signal. It was an \nimportant chance to communicate clearly and directly our interest in \nthe region and our desire to improve relations. I am not naive. I don't \nthink one trip is going to change the course of history. We know that \nthere are serious challenges on our Southern border, but reaching out, \ntalking with people, indicating that we have an interest in improving \nrelations, sending a signal that the majority leader of the Senate, in \nhis first foreign trip, is coming to these countries--impoverished \ncountries, countries that are not exactly on the list of countries that \npeople might visit--I think was important and productive.\n  I thank the majority leader for leading this delegation. I thank the \nother Members. My wife and I found it an exceptional group of people. \nThe people who were on this delegation--Senator Reid, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Bennett, Senator Gregg, and Senator Salazar--did an exceptional \njob of representing this country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, as we have a debate around here about \nethics and congressional perks and all of the rest of those issues, I \nam interested to find some Members of my own party, at least in the \nother body, boasting that they do not even have a passport, that they \nare so focused on their jobs that they don't do any foreign travel at \nall. When I was a newly elected Senator, the then-Republican leader, \nBob Dole, took me and a number of other freshmen up to New Jersey to \nspend a day with former President Richard Nixon. Whatever you might \nthink of Richard Nixon, I think you might confess he had a grasp of \nforeign affairs that was perhaps unparalleled. And he will be \nremembered, along with his other problems, for his opening to China, \nfor his level of detente with Russia, and the other things he did in \nthe foreign affairs field.\n\n  As we sat with him, one of the first things he said to us was: You \ncannot do your jobs as Senators if you do not travel. You need to be \noverseas. You need to be in these other countries. He said: I know the \npress will criticize you for it, but it is essential that you do it.\n  I have taken his advice. I have discovered he was right. The press \ndoes criticize us for it. There were articles in the Washington Post \nsaying: What are these people doing viewing Inca ruins on a holiday at \ntaxpayer expense, as if the whole purpose was some kind of \ncongressional junket. And there would sit some of my friends in the \nHouse, smug in their assurance they didn't even have a passport and \nthey were never going to be criticized for doing this.\n  The fact is, Nixon was right--not only for the things we learn when \nwe travel but also for the messages we send when we travel. The \nmajority leader had to go over the holiday period because his schedule \nwas so full with other demands that this was the only time he could get \naway. I was honored and very much pleased when he asked me to come \nalong. The fact that he made it a bipartisan delegation demonstrates \nhis determination to make these trips have an impact both at home and \nabroad. It did have an impact on the six of us who were there. We have \nnow come back with an understanding of trade issues in ways that you \ncould not get reading a newspaper or, as one paper said: Why couldn't \nhe find out these facts by getting on the telephone? Well, we went to a \nflower farm where it was pointed out to us, and we saw specific \nevidence, that the efforts to raise potatoes in Ecuador or corn or \nwheat may sound good in a political situation, as some Ecuadorian \npoliticians are saying, but the climate and the altitude say they \nshould be raising flowers. It gave a flavor to the whole question of \nfree trade around the world when we realized the most efficient place \nto raise corn is in the Great Plains of the United States, and the most \nefficient place to raise baby's breath or roses is in the high \naltitudes and sunshine of Ecuador.\n  The fellow who was running the plant said to us: All we are doing is \nharvesting the sunshine and sending it abroad, and these people have \njobs which they would not otherwise have. And this soil and this \naltitude means raising corn would be crazy. So let the Americans raise \ncorn and ship it to Ecuador, and let the Ecuadorians raise roses and \nship them to us.\n  Being there, seeing the plant, seeing the people at work, seeing the \nconditions they were under is worth 10,000 phone calls to have somebody \ntry to explain it to us. But perhaps more importantly, on the political \nlevel, what Senator Conrad was talking about, showing up in three \ncountries that have not seen a significant congressional delegation in \nanybody's memory was a big deal. The press was everywhere. We were on \nthe front page of the newspapers. We were on all of the television \nstations. The Ecuadorians gave us each a Panama hat. The Panama hat is \nmisnamed. It has always been produced in Ecuador, but for some reason \nit got labeled the Panama hat. I wore mine. I was not an important \nmember of the delegation as far as title is concerned, but I got on \ntelevision because I was wearing a Panama hat. The Ecuadorians took \nsufficient pride in that I found the cameras following me around, just \nto say here is a U.S. Senator who is wearing one of our local products. \nI don't know how much good that did, but it can't have done any harm.\n  Senator Reid handled himself with his usual good taste and aplomb in \nall of the exchanges and all of the press\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\nopportunities he had. No matter how much the Presidents of some of \nthese countries who have an anti-American background might resent the \nAmericans, they could not, in the presence of six American Senators, \nincluding the Senate majority leader, not be impressed. They could not \nnot be tempered in their attitudes toward the United States. And some \nof these Presidents who have the reputation of anti-Americanism in the \nmeetings with others in addition to us were very gracious, and then \nultimately in the presence of these Senators, outgoing in their praise \nof the United States and their delight at having this kind of \ndelegation. Every single Ambassador made it clear to us that by our \nbeing there, we made their jobs easier. We made their jobs better. We \ndemonstrated an American interest.\n  I was reminded when I was there on a congressional delegation of a \nstatement I heard from the leader of a European country who opened the \nconversation by chiding us and saying: It has been too long since a \nSenator has been here. What is the matter? Aren't we important enough \nfor you to come?\n  Well, if a European country that sees Senators come through about \nevery 6 months had that reaction when it had been over a year since a \nSenator came, how about a South American country that had never seen a \nSenator in the lifetime of that particular administration.\n  So, again, we who were on the trip were well served by the things we \nlearned. I have just given one quick example. My colleagues will give \nothers. But just as importantly, the United States was well served in \nterms of the impact this kind of travel made on those countries that \nhad not seen senatorial delegations.\n  So I intend for the rest of my Senate career to follow Richard \nNixon's advice when he said: You cannot do your job if you don't \ntravel. And I would urge those who somehow think they can get a little \ncheap publicity in the United States by saying: I am above that, I \ndon't accept all of that travel--you are being derelict in your duty.\n  Nixon made one other comment. He said: Yes, I know the press will \ncriticize you, but it makes great speech material when you get home. I \nhope that has been the case for those of us here today from whom the \nSenate has heard.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let me thank my colleague from Utah for \nhis remarks and for joining us on this trip, this official trip which \nSenator Reid, our majority leader, put together. Senator Bennett is \ncorrect. Members of Congress have to make a decision early in their \ncareer: Are they going to travel? I think it has been one of the most \nvaluable experiences of my public life. I have made a point of always \nannouncing in advance where I am going and why I am going, giving full \ndisclosure so that people know. I can say without exception that every \ntime I have taken a trip, carefully planned, I have come back with a \nbetter knowledge of the world and a better appreciation of our home.\n  I have learned things on these trips I just could not appreciate \nreading in a book. I have met people on these trips who have changed my \nlife. I don't say that loosely; I mean it.\n  Over 15 years ago, I met a man in Bangladesh named Muhammad Yunus. We \nhad gone to Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries on Earth. This \neconomics professor took us out to show us that he was testing a \nconcept from his economics class called micro credit. He believed--this \nprofessor believed--that if you loan a small amount of money to the \npoorest people on Earth, they would pay it back, and that that small \namount of money would change their lives. A simple concept, but he was \nout to prove it would work, and he proved it over and over again until \nthat concept reached 100 million people on the face of the Earth. That \nman was recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. I met Muhammad Yunus on \nan official trip. I have fought for micro credit ever since, and I \nconsider him a real inspiration to my public life.\n  The same is true about Africa. When I finally was able to go to \nAfrica, looking at micro credit food programs, I was hit smack dab \nbetween the eyes by the global AIDS crisis. It changed my public \nservice. I came back and established the first bipartisan global AIDS \ncaucus on Capitol Hill and have fought every single year to fight for \nmore money to fight this scourge, this epidemic of AIDS. We have now \nput together an additional $1 billion in money added to budgets, $1 \nbillion to be spent around the world saving lives. It has made a real \ndifference, and it was the result of an official trip where I saw \nfirsthand what AIDS was doing to that great continent of Africa.\n  So I would say to my colleagues and my critics, I believe that \nMembers of Congress should be compelled and required to travel overseas \nevery single year and should account for their travel and account for \ntheir refusal to travel. We have to understand that these trips help us \nin public service, help to project the image of our country, and help \nus to reach a new level of understanding with leaders around the world. \nThis trip was no exception.\n  Why would we go to Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru? Of all places on \nEarth, why would we go there? The first trip by the majority leader, \nHarry Reid, was scheduled to this region of the world, and I know that \nmany of the leaders down there were surprised, as well, to see us. It \nis one of the poorest places on Earth. Bolivia is the second poorest \nnation in our hemisphere next to Haiti. The people there struggle to \nsurvive, the majority of them on fewer than $2 a day.\n  We met with indigenous Bolivian Evo Morales, now President of that \ncountry, elected in a free election. We fear that he will lean toward \nthe Chavez model of government, and we hope he will be more open \nminded. This trip helped us to deliver a message. As Senator Conrad \nmentioned earlier, he has misgivings about his relationship with the \nUnited States. I think what we had to say to him in our meeting with \nhim, and Senator Harry Reid's insistence that we respect the \nsovereignty of his nation, was important, a very important thing for \nhim to see.\n  Bolivia itself is a fascinating country in many respects--very \nentrepreneurial, with a sense of street justice which you don't find in \nmany poor countries around the world. But I left there with a better \nunderstanding of the challenges facing them.\n  Going on to Ecuador, there was a special meeting with the President-\nelect, now President Rafael Correa. I felt a special attachment to \nPresident-elect Correa because in the year 2001 he received a Ph.D. in \neconomics from the University of Illinois at Champagne-Urbana. We joked \nabout it, and we joked about his experience living in the United \nStates. That evening I got to meet his wife born in Belgium. She served \nas a special education teacher in Champagne, IL. I say that because \nthose linkages between the United States and the new leadership of \nEcuador are valuable. He saw America firsthand. He said to his friends \nin Ecuador: What I like about America is they don't ask you your \nmother's lineage. They just want to know who you are, not whether you \ncome from some aristocratic stock.\n  That is a good lesson to learn in America. It is a good lesson to \napply around the world. It says a lot about us and our values.\n  We went on to Peru as well. There aren't a lot of delegations that \nvisit Peru. I am glad we did. President Garcia is a real friend. In \nWorld War II Peru was one of our earliest allies, and they are proud of \nit. Our standing with Peru as a nation couldn't be better, and it gets \nbetter by the year. It tells us, though, that we have critics around \nthe world.\n  First, let me say if someone stopped me on the streets of Chicago and \nsaid: Senator Durbin, why in the world did you go to Bolivia and \nEcuador and Peru, I would ask them one question: Do you think narcotics \nare a problem in America? I know the answer. The answer is obvious: a \nbig problem. Not just a problem for law enforcement but for families \nand children, a great expense and a great danger caused by these \nnarcotics, and the Andean region of the world that we visited supplies \n100 percent of the cocaine that comes to the United States.\n  When Senator Reid and Senator Bennett and others and I went to these \ncountries, we sat down with our Ambassadors, we sat down with the Drug \nEnforcement Agency, we sat through classified briefings and talked \nabout our cooperative efforts with these nations to stop this flow of \nnarcotics.\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\nThat is a priority for this Senator, and I am sure it is a priority for \nmany others. By meeting and encouraging these leaders to continue to \ncooperate with the United States, I think it is going to help to make \nour Nation safer. When we hear firsthand from the President of Bolivia \nthat he believes he is being shortchanged in bilateral assistance from \nthe United States compared to other countries, it is a legitimate point \nand one that we brought home and one on which we will follow through. \nWe want to make sure the flow of narcotics is reduced. We want to make \nAmerica safer, reduce drug crime, and it starts with an understanding \nbetween Senators and leaders in these countries that we have the same \ngoals.\n  Let me say one thing before I turn it over to our majority leader. \nHow do we project the image of the United States? We believe that five \nor six Senators bringing that message is an important part of it but a \ntiny part of it. When we visited Bolivia, Senator Reid, I believe, \nasked the question: What is the presence of Cuba in Bolivia? The answer \nis an important one for us to reflect on. Today, out of about 20,000 \nmedical doctors in Bolivia, 1,500 come from Cuba, another 5,000 \nclassroom teachers come from Cuba. When we asked, in Bolivia, our \nAmbassador what are we doing, he said the United States is making \nsubstantial investments in infrastructure. Stop for a moment and think \nabout it. Which version of the world, which message, will have more \nimpact: A message delivered to a person in Bolivia in a clinic or a \nclassroom or a message delivered on a sign next to a stretch of \nconcrete? Not to diminish the importance of infrastructure, but the \nfact is those Ambassadors of Mr. Castro's view of the world are going \nto have an impact on the people they help far beyond what impact we \nwill have by building this infrastructure.\n  Senator Reid makes it a point on his trips and I make it a point on \nmine to meet with Peace Corps volunteers. We had great meetings in \nEcuador. Some of these great American kids--I shouldn't call them kids; \nyoung men and women, some not so young--who are Peace Corps volunteers \nliterally spent over 12 hours on an overnight bus to make it to a \nluncheon. We had a great time. We talked. I had a chance to meet a \ncouple of them from the State of Illinois. Andrew Wiemers from \nGalesburg was one of them. We talked about the challenges we faced, and \nwe talked about how proud we were that they were, for little or no \nmoney, giving 2 years of their lives to tell the American story by \ngiving, by helping. They are making a difference. But around the world, \nthere are only 7,000 Peace Corps volunteers. I think we can do more, \nand I think we need to do better. We can stretch ourselves and stretch \nour message out to parts of the world that have the wrong message of \nthe United States.\n  When John Kennedy was President, he took a hard look at Central and \nSouth America for the first time, understanding that in the history of \nthat region, many times our Government and private interests in the \nUnited States have exploited it. He created a new opportunity. He \ncalled it the Alliance For Progress. And President Kennedy's name is \nsacred now in this part of the world because of his recognition that \nthey were not just our neighbors but our friends and potential allies.\n  We have to renew that conversation. It starts with official trips \nsuch as these. It starts when we bring our message back to the \nSecretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. But it can't end there. We have \nto make sure the legislation we consider, the policies of this country, \nand our relationships continue to grow.\n  I will say to those who criticize the official trips by Members of \nCongress, they don't understand the world in which we live. We have a \nspecial responsibility to learn about this world, to tell our message \nto people around the world and come back with our knowledge and share \nit with our colleagues. It is important for us as Members of Congress \nto spend time together in these settings. It builds friendships and \nalliances and relationships that on the floor of the Senate I have \nalready seen in a few short weeks have paid off. That level of comity, \nthat level of dialog, leads to a more civilized Senate and a better \nwork product at the end of the day.\n  I thank Senator Reid for inviting me to be part of this trip, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, how much time does the majority leader \nhave in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask that the time of the minority be \nextended. I will complete my remarks, if not in 5 minutes, shortly \nthereafter. But whatever time I expend, I ask that time be given to \nRepublicans so they have a matching amount of time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I so appreciate the statements of my \ncolleagues who traveled with me to South America. As has been \nindicated, Bolivia, if not the poorest country in this hemisphere, is \nthe second poorest. You land in an airport, the highest airport in the \nworld--13,400 feet. As my distinguished friend, the Senator from Utah, \nsaid, President Nixon said that people should travel, Members of \nCongress. I use as an example Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan was an anti-\nCommunist, and that is an understatement, but Ronald Reagan always \nspoke to his enemies. But for Ronald Reagan's insistence that there be \nbilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union on a constant, frequent \nbasis, I am not sure the Cold War would have ended. Not only did he \npersonally meet with the Soviet leaders time after time, people working \nin his State Department were in constant contact with the Soviet Union.\n  Members of Congress should travel. There is no better example than \nthese three countries to which we traveled. They are begging for the \nattention of the United States, and they are getting no attention. They \nare not begging for the attention of Venezuela and Cuba, but they are \ngetting lots of attention. As a result of that, they have a significant \namount of influence where the United States should be the one exerting \nthe influence.\n  They want us to be involved. We should be involved. Ninety percent of \nthe cocaine in the world comes from the Andean region. Shouldn't we be \ninvolved? But we are not. We set up programs to help them fight the \nillicit growing and production and transmission of illegal narcotics--\nand we are cutting back on those moneys. They are limited amounts, \nanyway. These little democracies cannot afford to do this on their own. \nIt is unpopular for them to do that. The President of Bolivia was the \nhead of a union of coca farmers. He wants to fight the illicit drug \ntrafficking, but he needs our help, as does the President of Ecuador. \nThe most biodiverse nation in the world is Ecuador.\n\n  The President of Peru loves America. He was effusive in his praise \nfor America. Why can't we help more?\n  I wish to mention a couple of things. First of all, the hidden heroes \nof our Government are our Foreign Service officers. I have been in \nCongress now going on 25 years. My first tour of duty was in the House \nof Representatives. I was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and \nlearned to travel at that time, and rightfully so. I traveled with \ngreat chairmen, such as Clem Zablocki from Wisconsin and Dante Fascell \nfrom Florida.\n  I have come to learn that our diplomats, our Foreign Service \nofficers, are the cream of the crop. To become a Foreign Service \nofficer, you have to be very smart and very interested in what goes on \nin the world. They are the best. They are wonderful people. Every place \nI go when I travel, I tell these Foreign Service officers something \nthey don't hear very often: They are the difference between America \nhaving relations with these countries and not having them.\n  Ambassadors to these three countries are great human beings. Philip \nGoldberg in Bolivia--what a tremendous job he is doing, working day and \nnight to improve relations between our country and Bolivia. In Ecuador \nis a distinguished woman who has a great diplomatic career. She has a \nsmile that is contagious--Linda Jewell. She is doing great work for us \nin Ecuador; and in Peru, James Curtis Struble, a real professional. I \nhave so much warmth for the work these people do. They go to the remote \nparts of the world. Every time I meet an ambassador, I say: Where have \nyou been? And you should hear where they have been--the most\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\nremote places in the world, starting off as a political officer, \neconomic officer, places where they handle visas, and they work their \nway up through the ranks. These Ambassadors are similar to a four-star \ngeneral. I think we only have 140 Ambassadors, and they are the best, \nthe cream of the crop. If you see a person who has been appointed \nAmbassador through the career State Department offices, they are the \nbest. They are all Americans. They are generals; they are admirals. I \nso admire the work they do.\n  Then, as Senator Durbin mentioned, every place I go, I talk to the \nPeace Corps volunteers. We only have, in the world, a little over 7,000 \nof them. We should have 70,000 Peace Corps volunteers. A woman from \nReno, NV, traveled 20 hours to meet me in Ecuador, to have lunch with \nme in Ecuador. This is her tour of duty as a Peace Corps volunteer. One \nPeace Corps volunteer from Nevada has a master's degree in biology. She \nworks in public health. Another Foreign Service officer from Nevada \nworks with troubled youth. She showed me her pictures. Her father came \nto visit her. He lives in New York. He came to see her and where she \nlives, and when he saw her, he started crying. He said: I expected more \nthan this for my daughter. After he left, after visiting his daughter, \nhe cried with joy, recognizing what this woman does for mankind. That \nis what Peace Corps volunteers do.\n  This was a wonderful trip. We need to compete with Cuba and Venezuela \nin this part of the world and other parts of the world or we are going \nto lose these democracies.\n  I have to be very candid with you, Madam President. The snide \nremarks, the cute little things people write in newspapers about trips \ntaken by Members of Congress, I resent them, and I think it does the \nAmerican public a disservice. I am going to continue to travel in spite \nof what the newspapers say because I believe I am serving my country by \ndoing that.\n  With America's attention focused on the Middle East, South America \ndoes not get the attention that it deserves, particularly the three \ncountries we visited--Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru.\n  And when the world does focus on South America, it is with increased \nconcern over the region's leftward turn, and the inflammatory rhetoric \nissued by several of the region's leaders criticizing our Government.\n  There is no doubt that there are serious problems in the region. \nThere is also no question that the Bush administration has neglected \nthe region, and its lack of a comprehensive policy has contributed to \nthis current trend.\n  Venezuela and Cuba have been filling a vacuum, attempting to pull the \nregion to the left.\n  But I do not think we should be deterred by this trend. We have much \nto gain through increased engagement with South America--and much to \nlose if we retreat from our obligations to the region. We can and must \ndo more.\n  On our trip, we had productive meetings with the leaders of Bolivia, \nEcuador, and Peru. Most importantly, we came away from our visit with \nan appreciation for the people of these three important nations, and an \nawareness of the key issues confronting them.\n  Our first stop was Bolivia, where we had an amicable discussion with \nPresident Evo Morales. Much has been said about the somewhat difficult \nrelationship the United States has encountered with President Morales, \nbut we were able to set forth our concerns about increased coca \nproduction, the rule of law, and the periodic expressions of anti-\nAmericanism. President Morales also laid out each of his grievances \nabout the U.S. We did not always agree, but we had a very honest and \nopen exchange, and that is what close relationships require.\n  I was also pleased to see the devoted engagement of our Ambassador \nPhilip Goldberg and his diplomatic team in La Paz. Their insight will \nbe particularly crucial in monitoring the current Bolivian \nconstitutional crisis. We will have to watch these developments \nclosely. We truly hope that whatever happens, Bolivian democracy and \nBolivian democratic institutions are strengthened, not weakened. That \nwould be the right result for Bolivia, for the region, and for the \nrelationship with the United States.\n  Then it was on to Ecuador, the most bio-diverse country in the world. \nFrom its snow capped peaks, to the Galapagos Islands, to the Amazon \nRain Forest--Ecuador is an environmental treasure. My son spent 2 years \nthere years ago, and to this day, still speaks of his days in Ecuador. \nAfter being there, I can understand why Ecuador made such an impact on \nhim.\n  We were pleased that, although he had not even been sworn in yet, \nPresident Correa assembled his new cabinet to meet with our delegation. \nHe seemed quite aware that Ecuador risks becoming a transit hub for \nnarco-trafficking in the region, and vowed to take swift action to shut \ndown the trafficking in and around Ecuador.\n  Ecuador is the home of the U.S. Forward Operating Location at Manta, \nwhich plays a key role in the multilateral approach to fighting the war \non drugs. The mission at Manta advances the joint interest that the \nUnited States and Ecuador have in curbing the illegal flow of drugs. \nThe American presence at Manta also contributes around $6.5 million a \nyear to the local economy. We hope that this can be the start of a \nconstructive dialogue on this issue, through which the Ecuadorian \nGovernment will come to realize the benefits yielded from the Forward \nOperating Location at Manta.\n  Peru, our final stop, must also contend with the problem of drug \ntrafficking. But Peru's President, Alan Garcia, is a leader committed \nto meeting this challenge. We had such a good meeting with President \nGarcia, a pro-democracy, pro-capitalist and pro-American leader. I am \nvery grateful for the graciousness he showed to our delegation.\n  President Garcia possesses a keen understanding of the dynamic of the \nregion today, and desires to work together to combat the leftist \nideology being promoted by Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Cuba's Fidel \nCastro. He noted that, with Castro's possible passing, the U.S. has an \nopportunity to reengage in the region, and reach out to a new \ngeneration looking at the United States as a model for freedom, \ndemocracy and opportunity.\n  Going forward, we must remember that the U.S. and South America will \ncontinue to have its ups and downs. But all relationships do. The six \nof us took this trip because we know that existing relationships must \nbe cultivated and tended to in order to keep them healthy and strong.\n  There is so much more we can do here at home. Our delegation intends \nto meet with the Secretary of State in the coming weeks to relay to her \nthe small things the U.S. Government do to improve our position in the \nregion. For example, I believe: we should be doing more with IMET \nassistance, which in addition to the training program, proves so \nvaluable to developing longstanding relationships between military \nofficers the United States and the IMET beneficiary; we need to \nincrease the USAID budgets for these nations. We learned that Ecuador's \naid budget will be cut considerably, from $35 million to under $20 \nmillion, and I believe that is a mistake. One thing we learned is how \nfar a few U.S. dollars can go; and we also need to do more to support \nmicro-lending and the counter-drug efforts of the Andean region, in \norder to keep cocaine off the streets of the United States. I was \ndisturbed to learn that the State Department is contemplating \nsignificant cuts to the Andean Counter-drug Program. That, too, would \nbe a serious mistake, and I plan on raising the issue with the \nSecretary of State.\n  Finally, I think it is important to extend the trade preferences for \nEcuador and Bolivia. I also know that Peru is eager to get its Free \nTrade Agreement finalized, and this is something that Congress needs to \naddress in the coming year.\n  Through increased trade, more robust aid and exchange programs, and \nstronger diplomacy to this region, the United States can help lift many \npeople out of poverty, improve economic conditions, which would have a \nsignificant impact on illegal immigration to the United States. We \nwould also help counteract the region's shift to the left. In short, \nthe people of this region want stronger ties with the United States, \nand that is what we should aim to deliver.\n  The Andean region is not lost to us; its challenges provide us with \nan opportunity which we must seize. With more sustained engagement, we \ncan win it back again.\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me on the floor to talk about this \nimportant issue today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The minority has 62 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S717-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S717-S721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I come to the Chamber today to speak \nabout efforts that are now underway in the 110th Congress to deal with \nan issue the American people have become tremendously sensitized to \nover the last couple of years--the issue of energy, the availability of \nenergy, and the cost of energy. I believe it is important, as we look \nat cost and America's reaction to it, to recognize that while Americans \nare paying a higher price for energy today, there has never yet been a \nquestion about the availability of energy and the supply itself. I \nthink we forget that when we paid, in midsummer, $3 at the gas pump for \ngas and substantially more for diesel, it was always there, it was \nalways available, and that never became the issue.\n  What I believe is important for us today, in the new Congress, under \nnew leadership in the House and the Senate, is to not only focus on the \navailability of energy but also move ourselves toward being a nation \nthat becomes independent in its ability to produce its own energy--all \nkinds, in all ways--for the American consumer.\n  I find it fascinating that somehow, in the midst of all of this, we \nhave forgotten that while the energy is still at the pump, the lights \nstill come on when we throw the switch in our house in the morning, and \nAmerica is awash in the use of energy, we have become increasingly \ndependent on foreign sources for a substantial portion of the very \nenergy that moves this country. Here is a chart which I think \ndemonstrates that. Today, arguably, we have become 60 percent dependent \nupon someone else producing our hydrocarbons--our oil to produce our \ngas and our diesel and, of course, the plastics our country uses as a \nderivative of that.\n  In this new Congress, we should focus as aggressively as we did in \nthe last Congress in the creation of the National Energy Policy Act of \n2005. We ought to now move a major step forward toward energy \nindependence by not only encouraging the increased production of all \nforms of energy but looking to see if Government stands in the way of \nthat. Is Government promoting it or are we inhibiting it and forcing \nthose who supply our energy to progressively seek offshore sources of \nthat supply?\n\n  The new Committee on Energy and Natural Resources that I serve on, \nunder the guidance of Jeff Bingaman, recently held a hearing on who \nsupplies the oil for the world. Is it ExxonMobil? No. Is it Conoco? No. \nIs it Phillips? No, even though we think it is because that is where we \nget our fuel when we go to the gas pump. What we found out and what \nmany have known is that 80 percent of the world's oil supplies are \ncontrolled by governments. And they are not our Government. They are \ncontrolled by government or government-owned companies.\n  I recently gave a speech to a group of oil producers. I talked about \npetro nationalism and a growing concern in this country that the world \nthat supplies this portion of our oil can use their political muscle \nbut, more importantly, the valve on the pipeline of the oil supply, to \ndetermine the kind of politics and international relations they want to \nhave with us, knowing how we have become so dependent upon that supply.\n  I hope we continue to focus on supply and availability instead of \ndoing what some are saying we are going to do. We are going to punish \nthe oil companies because they are making too much money. We are going \nto tax them, and we are going to tax the consumer because somehow that \nwill produce more oil? No, no, no. That is politics, folks. That is, \nplain and simply, big-time politics, to show the consumer you are \nmacho, that somehow you will knock down the big boys who supply the \noil.\n  Ask the questions, if you are a consumer: Will that keep oil at the \npump? Will that keep gas available to me? Will that produce more gas to \nbring down the price? Those are the legitimate questions that ought to \nbe answered when the leadership of the new Senate says: No, we will \nmuscle up to the big boys and knock 'em down because somehow they may \nbe price gouging. Yet investigation after investigation after \ninvestigation suggests that is quite the opposite. That simply is not \nhappening.\n  Nowhere are they going to tell you in all of this political rhetoric \nthat I would hope would take us toward energy independence and a \ngreater sense of energy security in our country that the new deep wells \nwe are drilling in the gulf that produce or new oil supply could cost \nupward of $1 billion a well in actual expenses before the oil begins to \nflow out of that well and into the ships or into the pipelines that \ntake it to the refineries that ultimately put it in the pipeline that \nget it to the consumers' pumps. And the issue goes on and on.\n  I hope that in this Congress, while some will want to play politics, \na good many will focus on the reality not only of what we have done, \nwhich has been very successful in the last few years--and that is the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005--but go on with the business of setting goals \nand driving incentives that move us to energy independence. It is \nphenomenally important we do that as a country. Long-term investment, \nnew technologies, clean sources of energy are going to become \nincreasingly important.\n  But more important is that we can stand as a Nation and say we are \nindependent of the political pressures of the Middle East or the \npolitical pressures of Venezuela or the political pressures of Central \nEurope and Russia, that now control the world's supply of oil. That is \nwhat Americans ought to be asking our Congress at this time. Are you \ngoing to ensure an increased supply? Are you going to ensure a greater \nsense of independence by the reality of where our oil comes from?\n  This is not just an issue of oil. We know it is an issue of new \ntechnology. It is an issue of cleanness. It is an issue of nonemitting \ngreenhouse gas sources of energy because today we are all about clean \nenergy. And we ought to be. Yet we understand the agenda for climate \nchange is going to be a punitive one, one that would obviously distort \na market's growth toward cleaner supplies. It is called cap and trade \nor command and control instead of saying, yes, that is the old \ntechnology. Now let's invest in new technologies. Instead of \npenalizing, let's create the incentives that move toward new \ntechnologies and let us then lay down the old. That is how we cause \nAmerica to become increasingly energy independent. I am talking climate \nchange.\n  The Speaker of the House yesterday did something very fascinating. \nShe couldn't get the climate change she wanted out of her own committee \nso she has created a new select committee on climate change to be \nheaded up by Representative Ed Markey. I remember Representative Markey \nover the years: All antinuclear, day after day, year after year. He \nlost that battle. Americans said: You are not going to go there \nanymore. You are going to start producing energy because it is clean. \nNow he has been assigned a select committee on climate change.\n  Congressman Dingell, who chairs the appropriate committee, said \nselect committees are about as useful as feathers on a fish. \nCongressman Dingell gets it right.\n  What is useful, what is important in the argument of climate change, \nis new technology, it is incentives, it is producing energy in today's \nmarket that is, by any dimension, cleaner than what we produced in the \npast. You do not penalize the producer, you incentivize the producer to \nmake sure that they move in the direction of clean energy. When you do \nthat, you also say, as we said in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and as \nwe sought to say again and again and again to the consumer, we are \ngoing to provide you with the tools to conserve, to become more \nefficient in your use of energy.\n  All of those things, in combination over the next 10 to 15 years, \nclearly ought to allow this country to stand up and say we have \nnarrowed this gap; we are more independent as a Nation today in our \nsupply of energy than we were in 2007, and we are more independent \nbecause our Government stood up, got out of the way, incentivized,\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\ncreated those kinds of tools that the private sector could effectively \nuse for an ever-increasing supply of clean energy and that we, as \nconsumers, were given the tools to become more efficient in the use of \nthose clean supplies of energy.\n  I hope that ought to be and will become the mission of this new \nCongress, not to play games with the politics they thought brought them \nto power but to realize that the American consumer still is going to \nask that the gas pump be full of energy, that the light switch supplies \nelectricity in the morning and that, hopefully, it will come in a \ncleaner form and it won't cost any more than it has cost in the past in \nrelation to cost of living and inflation.\n  Those are the realities of a marketplace that we ought to help, not \npenalize. Is that politically wise to do? In the long run, it is very \npolitically wise to do because then America can stand on its own two \nfeet. It will not have to bow to the suppliers, such as Russia and the \nMiddle East, and to let a dictator in Venezuela jerk us around because \nhe has a major supply of oil. We can say: No, we supply our own. We are \nindependent. We have been responsible in doing so, and we did it in a \nclean and diverse way.\n\n  It is a phenomenal challenge for us but a challenge that is important \nto meet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Isakson and Mr. Alexander pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 330 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about energy, and I start \nby reminding people, as well as my fellow Senators, that in August \n2005, the President signed an energy bill that was very comprehensive--\nprobably tilted toward renewable fuels, such as ethanol, and toward \nconservation, such as fuel cell cars, but also a small part of it was \nsome incentives for domestic fuel, petroleum production, for refining \nand for distribution and for things of that nature.\n  It was a very comprehensive bill because we were concerned about the \nprice of gasoline. We were concerned about what working men and women \nof America were having to pay. We were concerned about national \nsecurity. There were a lot of reasons for passing that bill.\n  But then you get into an election year, 2006, and the impression you \nget from the election rhetoric is that we never had an energy policy, \nnever passed a bill, or what we did pass was only for the big oil \ncompanies, and that there was no concern whatsoever about national \nsecurity, there was no concern on the part of the Senate, when we \npassed that Energy Policy Act in 2005, about what many working men and \nwomen were paying for gasoline and things of that nature.\n  And all of this rhetoric against it--or what was said about it, if \nanybody wanted to admit we had an energy policy passed by Congress--was \nthat it was all for big oil. I wish to remind people that bill was \noverwhelmingly bipartisan. But yet during the last campaign, one \npolitical party talked all about giveaways to big oil, never talked \nabout ethanol, never talked about conservation, that it was an energy \nbill that was just for big oil and for big corporations, making the \nother political party out to be nothing but for big corporations, as \nopposed to what our incentive was: to drive down the price of gasoline \nand to have an adequate supply of gasoline and not be dependent so much \nupon foreign sources of oil, which was our motivation.\n  So I am here, now that the House of Representatives is working on a \nbill that deals with energy policy, and particularly to repeal what was \nreferred to in the last election as ``sweetheart tax deals for big \noil'' that were included in that Energy Policy Act of 2005, to say this \nbill that we passed was very well balanced for ethanol, alternative \nenergy, conservation, with a small part of it for domestic oil \nproduction, and how intellectually dishonest it is to refer to this \nbill as a giveaway to big oil.\n  I will use some statistics to back up what I am referring to. At the \ntime we considered the Energy Policy Act of 2005, I was chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee because my party was in the majority. So I \nplayed a central role in developing the tax title, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Baucus. So, in fact, it was a very bipartisan bill. \nIn fact, Senator Baucus and I produced, on a bipartisan basis, this \ncomprehensive tax package that included provisions to increase domestic \nenergy production, increase energy efficiency, and increase the \ndevelopment of alternative and renewable energies.\n  On the whole, I think the effort was a success. All you have to do to \nknow it was a success is to look at the explosion in the building of \nethanol plants throughout the country--most of them in the Midwest but \nthroughout the country--as people are going to alternative energies, \nrenewable fuels now because ethanol is made from crops that are growing \nfrom year to year. So I think the effort was very much a success, and \nthat is one small part of it being a success.\n  The Senate tax title was supported unanimously--I wish to emphasize \nunanimously--because there, at that time, were 11 Republicans and 9 \nDemocrats on the committee. It came out of our committee unanimously. \nThis bill, which during the last election was talked about as a \ngiveaway to big oil, came out of our committee unanimously and \neventually passed the Senate 85 to 15. And the conference agreement, \nironing out the differences between the House and the Senate, passed by \na margin of 74 to 26.\n  So throughout the whole process it was bipartisan, that this was the \nanswer to the energy problems facing the Nation--not that it was the \nend-all and be-all, but it was a very comprehensive effort and a \nsuccessful effort to solve the energy problems of our Nation.\n  The entire tax package that was in this bill, the Energy Policy Act \nof 2005, had a budget score of $11.1 billion over 10 years.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, $2.6 \nbillion or 18 percent of the package was for oil and gas production, \nrefining, and distribution. Distribution isn't always by the big oil \ncompanies. So 18 percent--that is why I said our bill, passed in 2005, \nsigned by the President, was overwhelmingly tilted toward renewable \nfuels and toward conservation, not toward domestic petroleum \nproduction. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the tax title \nof the Energy Policy Act actually raised taxes on oil and gas companies \nby at least $224 million.\n  Understand, this was described in the last election as a giveaway to \nbig oil. Yet nonpartisan staff said that oil and gas companies ended up \npaying $224 million in new taxes. In the last election, the tax title \nwas characterized as tax giveaways to big oil, anywhere from $9 billion \nto $14 billion. How do you get $14 billion, if you want to say it was \n100 percent for big oil instead of 18 percent? How can you say a bill \nthat was scored at $11.1 billion could end up being a giveaway of $14 \nbillion? It doesn't add up. And figures don't lie.\n  At a time of record high gas prices last year, the other side accused \nthe Republican majority of failure of leadership. They said it was time \nto rewrite the Energy bill and stop the billion dollar tax giveaways \nfor big oil, the same kind of misleading insinuations I have been \nreferring to on another issue they had in the last campaign, about the \nfact that we ought to negotiate with drug companies to get prescription \ndrug prices down, when we are already doing that, as I pointed out in \nsome speeches last week. For the 24 most-used drugs by seniors, the \nplans that are negotiating with the drug companies have negotiated \nprices down an average of 35 percent.\n  Getting back to energy, during the same campaign cycle, Members on \nthe other side sold the taxpayers a bill of goods. They committed to \nrepealing all the tax giveaways to big oil that the Republican Congress \nincluded in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which ended up with $224 \nmillion more coming in from oil and gas. With the results of the \nNovember election, I presume they believe they were given a mandate \nfrom the voters to take away all of those ``tax giveaways''--the words \nthey used--in that bill. We heard the arguments over and over, both \nhere on the Senate floor and across the country on the campaign trail. \nBut now that the debt has come due, it is time for the new Democratic \nmajority to deliver on\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\ntheir promises to the American people. So what have they come up with \nto repeal? How much money are they going to take back from big oil to \nalleviate consumer pain at the pump? Just one provision--that is right, \none provision.\n  After all the demagoguery against our party and the Energy bill that \npassed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority, supposedly because of \nties to big oil, are they accusing the Democrats who voted for it of \nties to big oil as well? And they are going to repeal what? One single \ntax provision enacted in the Energy Policy Act signed by the President \nin August of 2005. Of course, that is only half the story. It turns out \nthis outrageous ``tax giveaway'' to big oil is scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office to save the U.S. Treasury $104 million over \n10 years, not the $14 billion that was the outside figure used during \nthe campaign, not $1.4 billion but $104 million.\n  I am a family farmer from New Hartford, IA. I know $104 million is \nstill a lot of money. But it turns out to be less than 1 percent of the \nentire package of the energy tax incentives included in that Energy \nPolicy Act that came out of my committee on a unanimous vote, all \nRepublicans and all Democrats, and passed the Senate in an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan manner. So in a desperate attempt to increase \nthe size of the tax penalty on domestic oil and gas producers, they \nhave also included the repeal of the oil and gas industry's eligibility \nfor the manufacturing income tax deduction. That is not just for oil \nand gas; that is for all manufacturing in America. This was another \nbill, in 2004, that passed overwhelmingly with a bipartisan majority. \nThe American JOBS Creation Act of 2004 was a new law supported by 69 \nSenators--that is bipartisan--that contained far-reaching measures to \nrevive the manufacturing base in America because of outsourcing.\n  We did that by cutting taxes so that the cost of capital is \ncompetitive with the cost of capital overseas, so we don't lose jobs \noverseas. We also created incentives for people to invest in the United \nStates instead of investing overseas. It devoted tax benefits to \nAmerican manufacturers in the form of a 3-percentage-point rate cut \nsubject to the payment of wages to their employees. If they didn't hire \nmore people, they didn't get the benefit. Remember, it was called the \nAmericans JOBS Creation Act. This manufacturing tax cut goes to large \nand small corporations, family-held S corporations, partnerships, sole \nproprietors, family farmers, and cooperatives. If you manufacture here, \nyou get the tax cut here. If you manufacture overseas, you don't get \nthe tax cut. It was only for manufacturing in the United States, and it \nwas only for U.S. manufacturers that paid employees' wages. It was not \nfor manufacturing offshore and it was not for folks who only \nmanufacture and hire overseas.\n  In defining U.S. domestic manufacturing, Congress included in the \ndefinition all things that are extracted or grown, including what the \nfamily farmers grow. That means that all domestic minerals and the \npeople who produce domestic minerals receive benefits. And that would \ninclude extraction of domestic--meaning here in America--oil and gas \nand the production of products made out of our own oil and gas.\n  It seems very strange to me that if you want to become less dependent \nupon foreign oil, the first thing you would do, in your first 100 days \nbeing in the majority for the first time in 12 years, is to increase \nthe taxes by 3 percentage points on domestic production of oil and gas, \nwhich was part of the American JOBS Creation Act of 2004, which passed \nin a bipartisan majority in the Senate.\n  In addition, the House proposal also increases the taxes on all \nrefinery products. That means your home heating oil and your farmer's \ndiesel used to run the machines that harvest the crops. In addition, \nfertilizer is a primary product of natural gas, so midwestern family \nfarmers are going to be hurt and not helped by any of this proposal. \nThat is what is coming out of the other body to this body to consider. \nMaybe because it is represented by so many people from the big cities \nof America, they don't realize food grows on farms. It doesn't grow in \na supermarket. Maybe they don't realize what they are doing to the \nAmerican farmer. But we don't need the cost of our anhydrous ammonia, \nwhich last summer was $550 a ton compared to about $250 a ton 2 years \nago--so we have fertilizer to grow our crops--to be driven up still \nmore.\n\n  In the 100 days of the new majority, this is what they are doing to \nthe American consumer, the American farmer. All of this in the new \nHouse majority so they can rewrite and adopt a campaign promise to cut \ntax benefits to big oil. It is an example of a problem they made up \nthat now they have to deliver on. In the process, they are going to \nhurt the family farmers, hurt the consumers, and cut out one of the \nthings this body adopted in the JOBS Creation Act of 2004, to create \nmanufacturing jobs in America, incentives to invest in America so that \nwe don't have outsourcing.\n  If they wanted to get back at Exxon--that is big oil, if there ever \nwas big oil--they missed the mark. The people who produce here in the \nUnited States are the same people you go to church with and your kids \nsee in school. If you want to become more dependent upon foreign oil, \nthen you should be happy with this proposal coming out of the first 100 \ndays of the new majority in the new House of Representatives. If you \nwant to create incentives for the production of U.S. lower 48 domestic \noil and gas, then this quite obviously is the wrong policy, all for a \ncampaign gimmick, all for campaign pandering. That is not right, to \nteach the family farmers and the consumers of America, who are already \npaying enough for their prices and are suffering from high energy \ncosts, to do more by taking away this 3-percent point tax incentive we \ngave for investment in America to create jobs in America. If it is made \nin America, you get the benefit of it. If it is made overseas, you \ndon't get the benefit.\n  Granted, there were also three provisions relating to royalty relief \nthat were included in their bill. Two were included in the bipartisan \nEnergy Policy Act, and one seeks to remedy an error caused by the \nClinton administration bureaucrats in the Interior Department of 10 \nyears ago. I will leave those discussions to the people who are best \nprepared to answer those, my colleagues on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, who have jurisdiction and expertise in this area.\n  I also point out to my colleagues and constituents that I am not \nbeholden to big oil or the energy industry. In the years I have been in \nthe Senate, I have battled big oil, because they hate renewable fuels \nthat we call ethanol. They don't want you burning anything in your gas \ntank that doesn't come out of their oil wells. They don't want you \nburning in your gas tank those things that come off the farmers' fields \nin the way of corn from which we make ethanol, also for all of the \nsorts of things that they don't like, what we call energy conservation \nand forcing electric utilities to use renewable portfolio standards \nwithin the industry. I have supported biodiesel. I have supported \nethanol. I have supported renewable portfolio standards--all things \nthat big corporations in America don't like. But we have been \nsuccessful in doing it.\n  I have relentlessly chased the bad players in the petroleum industry \nat all levels, both legal and illegal. As chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, we closed over $10 billion in tax provisions that \nthe President signed into law, shutting down fuel fraud and folks \nstealing fuel excise taxes from the Highway Trust Fund. These are real \nprovisions, collecting $10 billion of taxes that were evaded that will \nno longer be evaded.\n  So what are the facts concerning the track record of the previous \nCongress and the President of the United States on energy policy and \npromoting renewable and alternative energy, and what is wrong with the \nrhetoric of the last campaign that led people to believe it was \nsomething different than we ended up passing? We extended and expanded \nthe production tax credit for electricity produced from renewable \nsources such as wind, biomass, geothermal, and landfill gas. We enacted \ntax credits for the purchase of hybrid fuel cells and advanced lean \nburn diesel vehicles. We enacted incentives for the production and use \nof ethanol and biodiesel and the infrastructure to dispense that fuel.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer contributed the idea behind doing \nthat, so we would set up more biodiesel pumps at stations through the \n30-percent tax credit that the Senator from\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\nIllinois thought of. I thank him for that idea. I was very happy to \nwork with him on that. That is the distinguished Presiding Officer. We \nenacted the first ever renewable fuel standard for ethanol and \nbiodiesel that has led to fantastic growth in the industry.\n  With regard to energy efficiency, we enacted incentives for \nefficiency improvement for new and existing homes and commercial \nbuildings and for energy-efficient home appliances.\n  According to the clock in the other body, we are still somewhere \nwithin the first 100 days of the new Democratic majority, and again we \nsee another example of legislative action not living up to campaign \nrhetoric. A word of caution to voters across America: Beware of the \ngoods that you might be sold during an election. That applies to both \nRepublicans and Democrats as far as I am concerned. In the case of \nrepealing the ``big oil tax giveaways''--those are words used in the \nlast election--from the Energy Policy Act, it turns out in fact to be a \npig in a poke.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we are debating an important piece of \nlegislation. The American people are rightly frustrated with the \nprocess Congress uses to consider. That is to say, it is not done in \nthe light of day and with full transparency. They believe lobbyists \nhave too much influence on this institution. Last year, we tried to \npass a lobbying reform bill to help clean up some of the ways that we \ndo legislation around here. We were not able to come to an agreement \nbetween the House and Senate, so there is another effort underway this \nyear.\n  I think this legislation is very important. Republicans support \nreform. We have been offering relative amendments to make Congress more \naccountable to the American people. More transparent. These amendments \nwill address the problems that have existed for some time. The \nmajority, however, is trying to end the debate on this bill. They are \nnot willing to let the Senate consider some very important amendments \nthat will improve how Congress handles the people's business. I will \nmention a couple of my own amendments to this legislation in just a \nmoment. I would say that the majority would be right to cut off debate, \nif Republicans were strictly trying to obstruct passage of this bill. \nThen their parliamentary move would, I agree, be appropriate. But the \nminority is not being obstructionist. We have legitimate amendments \nthat deserve to be debated and voted on. Senators deserve to be heard. \nIt is not right for the majority to try to railroad this piece of \nlegislation through this body without giving Members their right to \nhave amendments debated. Particularly when those amendments are not \nbeing used as a delaying tactic. I simply do not believe that is the \nway this institution should be run. That is why, last night, 45 \nSenators voted against what is called cloture. That would have brought \ndebate to a close and would have brought any attempt to improve this \nlegislation to a close.\n  Let me give you two examples of legitimate amendments that have been \noffered and why they are important to be debated and voted on.\n  The first amendment I want to talk about addresses provisions where \nthis bill falls short, particularly with respect to transparency and to \nallow the American people to observe how this Congress operates. \nSection 102 of this bill is an example of where the bill falls short. I \ncommend the authors of the legislation for including this section. The \nintent is to stop the conferees from putting unrelated pieces of \nlegislation in a conference report. Too often in the past conferees \nhave inserted provisions in the conference that were completely \nunrelated to the bill. This simply is not the way the Congress should \nbe legislating. The Senate should not bypass the regular legislative \nprocess. When we do, it means we are passing legislation, in some \ncases, without even holding a hearing. This process also denies \nSenators the opportunity to debate and offer amendments to improve \nunrelated provisions. But the most offensive part of this is that it is \ndone outside of the public's view.\n  In a democracy such as ours, Congress should do its business in the \nfull light of day. The entire Senate should consider, debate, and amend \nlegislation in full view of the American public. I often hear from \nconstituents who have concerns about legislation we are debating on the \nSenate floor. That feedback has always been important to me. I have \nalways appreciated Nevadans who have taken the time to participate in \nthe legislative process. So when we insert unrelated matters into a \nconference report, we deny the American people the chance to observe \nwhat we are doing, to participate in that process, and to be heard. \nThat is why I fully support the intent of section 102 of the bill \nbecause the intent is to fix that which is broken.\n  In my review of this section, and after consulting with the Senate \nParliamentarian's Office, I don't believe that the current language in \nthis bill will work. This section will not change what we are saying \nneeds to be changed. What do I mean? First and foremost, section 102 \nstates that a Senator may object to a conference report that contains \nprovisions that were not considered by the House or the Senate. That \nsounds good. As written, this sentence reads how rule XXVIII actually \noperates; that is to say that the point of order is raised against the \nentire conference report and not the offending provision or \nobjectionable item in a conference report.\n\n  While the intent of section 102 is to allow a Senator to object to a \nsingle provision that is added into the bill, the bill is not written \nto allow that. My amendment makes it clear that the point of order is \nto be raised against an individual item that is in the conference \nreport and not the conference report itself. In other words, this \nsmall, simple change is absolutely critical to the process because if \nyou want to strip something out of the bill, without my amendment you \ncannot strip a single provision out of the bill. You raise a point of \norder and it brings the entire conference report down. Why is that \nimportant? Well, let me tell you why it is important.\n  For instance, we had a port security bill last year. There was an \nunrelated item put into the port security bill. There may have been \nobjections to that item, but if one had raised the point of order, it \nwould have brought the whole port security bill down. Nobody wanted to \ndo that. It was an important piece of legislation. Without my \namendment, that is the way we would continue to operate.\n  But that is not what section 102 in this bill states. Its intent is \nto be able to surgically go in and cut out a piece that is added in the \ndead of night, behind closed doors, in a conference report--the types \nof things that, frankly, most Americans find objectionable. So this is \none of the reasons that we should not be passing this legislation until \nthe Senate has carefully considered each provision of this bill. We \nshould allow for amendments to go forward, to be debated. We should \nmake sure that we get things in this bill right before it leaves the \nSenate, so that when it is joined with the House's bill, we have done \nthe best possible job to ensure that we cleaned up the way we do our \nbusiness.\n  I have another amendment that I want to talk about. This illustrates \nthe other important point of why it is important to allow Senators to \nhave their time with amendments.\n  The minority--the Republicans in the Senate--want legitimate \namendments to improve this legislation. I believe we should have the \nright to offer those amendments.\n  The second amendment I want to talk about is to ensure that our men \nand women in the military, those serving in harm's way, remain our top \nbudget priority. I want to speak about protecting defense spending from \nbeing raided and used for nondefense purposes.\n  Over the past several years, there have been several congressional \nscandals that have undermined public confidence in government. It is my \nsincere hope that this legislation before us will be the first of many \nsteps to restore that confidence. The message to both parties last \nNovember was that Congress has to change the way we operate. The \nAmerican people will no longer accept some of the practices of the \npast, nor should they. It is up to this body to change our practices, \nto reform how Congress does the people's business. We should ensure \nthat our dealings are transparent, that we are accountable, and that we \nare honest with the American people.\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\n  The tradition of America is that we rise to the occasion. Americans \nhave a history of meeting the challenges that we face together. Each \ngeneration has met obstacles and overcome them. For Congress's part, we \nmust be honest and straightforward with the American people about the \nnature of the challenges facing our Nation.\n  Unfortunately, in some respects, Congress has not lived up to its end \nof the bargain. We have been using sleight of hand and budget gimmicks \nto mask our out-of-control spending habits. Over the past 5 years, \nCongress has been underfunding defense in the regular appropriations \nprocess in order to shift some of those funds into what are called \nother discretionary programs that are nondefense items.\n  The game being played, with a wink and a nod, is that if we underfund \ndefense in the regular appropriations process, we will then make \ndefense whole with what are called emergency supplemental bills. In \nsome instances, Congress has shifted as much as $11.5 billion from \ndefense to nondefense spending in just 1 single year. We know that \nemergency spending has increased substantially in each of the last 5 \nyears.\n  I have a chart to illustrate this. In the years 1990 to 1993, under \nthe first President Bush, we had a total of $115 billion in emergency \nsupplementals. During the Clinton administration, the total was just \nabout the same, $115 billion. Since President Bush has been in office, \nthere have been a total of $585 billion in emergency supplementals. \nNow, we have had 9/11, Katrina, and we have had the war against Islamic \nextremists around the world, including the wars in Afghanistan and \nIraq, that account for most of that spending but not for all of it.\n  This increased reliance on supplementals coincides exactly with the \nsame time period in which defense has been underfunded. The effects of \nthis gimmick are not felt just in 1 year either. Because of the way we \ndo budgeting, called baseline budgeting, money that is shifted from \ndefense in 1 year is really a permanent shift in funding. And, as a \nresult, a $1 billion shift represents not only a shift of $1 billion \nthis year, but that is put in the baseline next year and adds up \ncumulatively in perpetuity.\n  Let me point out exactly how this works and illustrate it. In 2002, \n$1.9 billion in new spending was shifted from the Department of \nDefense. That new spending is built into the baseline in the next year. \nThe green part of the graph is from the previous year. The red part on \ntop of that is the amount that defense was underfunded and shifted into \nother programs that year. Take that and shift it into the next year, \nand on and on, where we have a total of 4 years later built into the \nbaseline the $29 billion that we have shifted from defense into other \nprograms. That is one of the reasons spending is out of control in \nWashington, DC. What was labeled as defense spending is not spent on \ndefense and is then being made up in supplemental appropriations bills. \nWhich is a clever way to disguise increased spending in other places. \nPeople in Washington have talked about spending around here. They say \nwe have held the line on spending, except for defense-related items. \nThat is not true. We have actually been playing a smoke and mirrors \ngame, and this chart illustrates that.\n  I believe what we are doing is not honest with the American people, \nand we have the annual budget deficits as a result of that. I mentioned \nbefore that it is important for us to be able to offer amendments. I \nwould not be able to offer an amendment if cloture is invoked on this \nbill, and we should not cut off debate. This would be considered a \nnongermane amendment. It would not survive cloture, even though the \npoint of this bill is to require legislative transparency. We are \ntrying to make Congress' actions transparent and to clean up the budget \nprocess, however, the majority is trying to cut off debate on these \ncritical reforms.\n\n  I am going to have one last chart to demonstrate the effect of this \nbudget gimmick. The total effect of underfunding defense and playing \nthis game has cost the American people. This last chart, when one \ntotals the cost of this gimmick up, is $84 billion. We have shifted $84 \nbillion by using these budget gimmicks. $84 billion that was shifted \nfrom defense to nondefense programs. Then we backfill the defense \naccounts with supplemental appropriations.\n  We need to have honest budgeting around this place. We need to be \nhonest with the American people. If we are going to appropriate money \nfor defense, let's do it for defense. If it has to be for some other \nprogram, let's be honest with the American people and stop playing \nthese budget gimmick games.\n  If we are going to have transparency in Government, we should have \ntransparency in Government. Accountability in government. That is what \nthis bill is supposed to be about. It is what we are telling the \nAmerican people that we intend to do. This amendment, along with the \none I discussed earlier, are very important to ensure that we end the \ngames and that we end the gimmicks. This amendment ensures that we tell \nthe truth to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night the Senate voted not to invoke \ncloture on the ethics and lobbying reform legislation we have been \nconsidering for the past couple of weeks. I come to the floor this \nmorning to explain why I voted to continue debate on this bill to \nwhich, as the Presiding Officer knows, I am very committed and have \nworked very hard on in the past Congress.\n  First, then, let me emphasize that I remain committed to passing a \nstrong lobbying reform and ethics bill. I have said before and I will \nrepeat that before we can conduct the business of the people of this \ncountry, it is important that we reform our practices.\n  We need to strengthen the lobbying rules and the ethics rules to \nincrease disclosure and to ban practices that might call into question \nthe integrity of the decisions we make.\n  We need to assure the American people that the decisions we make are \nin their interests, that they are not tainted by undue influence or \ninfluence by special interests.\n  The underlying bill, S. 1, is the same bill that last year was the \nbipartisan product of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs, which I was privileged to chair. It is a good \nbill and it remains a good bill.\n  Over the past week and a half, we have debated and voted on \namendments that have further improved the legislation before us, and \nthe Senate is making good progress. However, as much progress as we \nhave made, this bill has not reached the point where we should invoke \ncloture and cut off debate.\n  Some observers of the Senate may not understand that invoking cloture \nmeans that all amendments to this bill that are not germane can no \nlonger be considered. The term and test for germaneness severely limits \nthe types of amendments that can be considered, and many of these \namendments--although they are not technically germane to the bill--are \nnevertheless very relevant to the bill. And perhaps the most important \nof these amendments is the Collins-Lieberman amendment that would \ncreate an Office of Public Integrity.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has been a strong supporter of an Office \nof Public Integrity as well, as has the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain. The four of us have worked very hard on that concept.\n  I strongly believe we will have failed our test of producing a truly \nstrong and complete ethics bill if we leave out the enforcement angle, \nif we do not create an Office of Public Integrity to conduct impartial, \nindependent investigations of allegations against Members of Congress.\n  The other provisions of this bill are very important and very good, \nbut we cannot ignore the enforcement piece. We need an Office of Public \nIntegrity.\n\n  I realize that leaders on both sides of the aisle disagree with me on \nthis\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\nissue. I realize I am not likely to prevail. But surely we deserve a \nvote. But if we invoke cloture before there is a vote on the amendment \nthat Senator Lieberman, the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nArizona and I have offered, our amendment will fall. It will not pass \nthe strict germaneness test, even though it clearly is relevant to the \nunderlying bill. I think that is wrong. I think we deserve a vote on \nthe Office of Public Integrity. People feel strongly on both sides \nabout this issue. It doesn't break down along party lines. As I said, \nthe two leaders of the Senate are both opposed to the concept. But \nsurely they ought to give us a vote. That is all I am asking. Let's \nhave the Senate go on record on whether this independent office should \nbe included in this bill.\n  I wish to make sure, since there was a lot of debate about this last \nyear, that everyone understands the key role that the Ethics Committee \nwould continue to play. All the Office of Public Integrity would do is \nto handle the investigative stage. It would still be up to the Ethics \nCommittee to make critical decisions on whether to proceed with the \ncase. The Ethics Committee would decide what is reported publicly. The \nEthics Committee would decide whether action to penalize a Member \nshould be taken. It would be the Ethics Committee that would still have \ntremendous authority in this whole process, but it would be combined \nwith this independent Office of Public Integrity that would ensure an \nimpartial investigation of allegations and, thus, would help restore \npublic confidence in our ethics system. Isn't that what this debate is \nall about? It is about restoring public confidence that the decisions \nwe are making are made in the best interests of the American people. I \nbelieve that an ethics bill without the Office of Public Integrity is \nan incomplete response to the concerns so clearly expressed by the \nAmerican people in the elections last fall.\n  Again, the underlying bill is a good bill. It is essentially the bill \nthat was reported by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee last year. We have made it even better with some of the \namendments we have adopted. Let's complete the task. Let's go the rest \nof the way down the road. Let's create an Office of Public Integrity. \nBut if it is the will of this body not to create an Office of Public \nIntegrity, the American people deserve to know that also.\n  So I want a vote. I am not going to vote to cut off debate on this \nbill until we get a vote on the Office of Public Integrity. The \nAmerican people deserve to know where every Member of this body stands \non this important issue. There are different views. There are \nlegitimate views both for and against the office, but we deserve a vote \non this issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA.

Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on what is a \nroiling debate not only in the Senate but across the country and that \nis the President's policy with respect to Iraq. There are countless \nreasons the American people have lost confidence in the President's \nIraq policy, but chief among them has been the administration's \ninsistence on making promises and assurances about progress and victory \nthat do not appear to be grounded in the reality of the facts. We have \nbeen told we would be greeted as liberators. We have been promised the \ninsurgency was in its last throes. We have been assured again and again \nthat we are making progress and that the Iraqis would soon stand up so \nwe could stand down and our brave sons and daughters could start coming \nhome. We have been asked to wait, we have been asked to be patient, and \nwe have been asked to give the President and the new Iraqi Government 6 \nmore months and then 6 more months after that and then 6 more months \nafter that.\n  Now, after the loss of more than 3,000 American lives, after spending \nalmost $400 billion after Iraq has descended into civil war, we have \nbeen promised, once again, that the President's plan to escalate the \nwar in Iraq will, this time, be well planned, well coordinated, and \nwell supported by the Iraqi Government. This time, we didn't have to \nwait to find out that none of this seems to be the case. Already, \nAmerican military officials have told the New York Times that there is \nno clear chain of command between Iraqis and U.S. commanders and no \nreal indication that the Iraqis even want such a partnership. \nYesterday, Prime Minister al-Maliki, the person whom the President said \nhad brought this plan to us, the man who is supposed to be our partner \nin chief for this new plan, told foreign journalists that if the United \nStates would only give his Army better weapons and equipment, our \nsoldiers could go home.\n  The President's decision to move forward with this escalation anyway, \ndespite all evidence and military advice to the contrary, is the \nterrible consequence of the decision to give him the broad, open-ended \nauthority to wage this war back in 2002. Over 4 years later, we can't \nrevisit that decision or reverse some of the tragic outcomes, but what \nwe can do is make sure we provide the kind of oversight and constraints \non the President this time that we failed to do the last time.\n  I cannot in good conscience support this escalation. It is a policy \nwhich has already been tried and a policy which has failed. Just this \nmorning, I had veterans of the Iraq war visit my office to explain to \nme that this surge concept is, in fact, no different from what we have \nrepeatedly tried, but with 20,000 troops we will not in any imaginable \nway be able to accomplish any new progress.\n  The fact is that we have tried this road before. In the end, no \namount of American forces can solve the political differences that lie \nat the heart of somebody else's civil war. As the President's own \nmilitary commanders have said, escalation only prevents the Iraqis from \ntaking more responsibility for their own future. It is even eroding our \nefforts in the wider war on terror as some of the extra soldiers will \ncome directly from Afghanistan where the Taliban has become resurgent.\n  The President has offered no evidence that more U.S. troops will be \nable to pressure Shias, Sunnis, and Kurds toward the necessary \npolitical settlement, and he has attached no consequences to his plan \nshould the Iraqis fail to make progress. In fact, just last week, when \nI repeatedly asked Secretary Rice what would happen if the Iraqi \nGovernment failed to meet the benchmarks the President has called for \nand says are an integral part of their rationale for escalation, she \ncouldn't give me an answer. When I asked her if there were any \ncircumstances whatsoever in which we would tell the Iraqis that their \nfailure to make progress means the end of our military commitment, she \ncould not give me an answer. This is simply not good enough. When you \nask how many more months and how many more dollars and how many more \nlives it will take to end the policy that everyone now knows has not \nsucceeded, ``I don't know'' isn't good enough.\n  Over the past 4 years, we have given this administration every chance \nto get this right, and they have disappointed us many times. But \nultimately it is our brave men and women in uniform and their families \nwho bear the greatest burden for these mistakes. They have performed in \nan exemplary fashion. At no stage have they faltered in the mission \nthat has been presented to them.\n  Unfortunately, the strategy, the tactics, and the mission itself have \nbeen flawed. That is why Congress now has the duty to prevent even more \nmistakes and bring this war to a responsible end. That is why I plan to \nintroduce legislation which I believe will stop the escalation of this \nwar by placing a cap on the number of soldiers in Iraq. I wish to \nemphasize that I am not unique in taking this approach. I know Senator \nDodd has crafted similar legislation. Senator Clinton, I believe, \nyesterday indicated she shared similar views. The cap would not affect \nthe\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\nmoney spent on the war or on our troops, but it would write into law \nthat the number of U.S. forces in Iraq should not exceed the number \nthat were there on January 10, 2007, the day the President announced \nhis escalation policy.\n  This measure would stop the escalation of the war in Iraq, but it is \nmy belief that simply opposing the surge is not good enough. If we \ntruly believe the only solution in Iraq is a political one--and I \nfervently believe that--if we believe a phased redeployment of U.S. \nforces in Iraq is the best--perhaps only--leverage we have to force a \nsettlement between the country's warring factions, then we should act \non that. That is why the second part of my legislation is a plan for \nphased redeployment that I called for in a speech in Chicago 2 months \nago. It is a responsible plan that protects American troops without \ncausing Iraq to suddenly descend into chaos. The President must \nannounce to the Iraqi people that, within 2 to 4 months, under this \nplan, U.S. policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in \nU.S. forces. The President should then work with our military \ncommanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and \ndetermine precise levels and dates.\n  Drawing down our troops in Iraq will put pressure on Iraqis to arrive \nat the political settlement that is needed and allow us to redeploy \nadditional troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region, as well \nas bring some back home. The forces redeployed elsewhere in the region \ncould then help to prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider \nwar, something that every international observer is beginning to worry \nabout. It will also reassure our allies in the gulf. It will allow our \ntroops to strike directly at al-Qaida wherever it may exist and \ndemonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not \ndriven us from the region.\n  My plan would couple this phased redeployment with an enhanced effort \nto train Iraqi security forces and would expand the number of our \npersonnel--especially special forces--who are deployed with Iraqis as \nunit advisers and would finally link continued economic aid in Iraq \nwith the existence of tangible progress toward reducing sectarian \nviolence and reaching a political settlement.\n  One final aspect of this plan that I believe is critical is it would \ncall for the engagement by the United States of a regional conference \nwith other countries that are involved in the Middle East--particularly \nour allies but including Syria and Iran--to find a solution to the war \nin Iraq. We have to realize that neither Iran nor Syria wants to see \nthe security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and \nviolence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire \nregion and within their own countries. So as odious as the behavior of \nthose regimes may be at times, it is important that we include them in \na broader conversation about how we can stabilize Iraq.\n\n  In closing, let me say this: I have been a consistent and strong \nopponent of this war. I have also tried to act responsibly in that \nopposition to ensure that, having made the decision to go into Iraq, we \nprovide our troops, who perform valiantly, the support they need to \ncomplete their mission. I have also stated publicly that I think we \nhave both strategic interests and humanitarian responsibilities in \nensuring that Iraqi is as stable as possible under the circumstances.\n  Finally, I said publicly that it is my preference not to micromanage \nthe Commander in Chief in the prosecution of war. Ultimately, I do not \nbelieve that is the ideal role for Congress to play. But at a certain \npoint, we have to draw a line. At a certain point, the American people \nhave to have some confidence that we are not simply going down this \nblind alley in perpetuity.\n  When it comes to the war in Iraq, the time for promises and \nassurances, for waiting and patience is over. Too many lives have been \nlost and too many billions have been spent for us to trust the \nPresident on another tried-and-failed policy, opposed by generals and \nexperts, opposed by Democrats and Republicans, opposed by Americans and \neven the Iraqis themselves.

Mr. President, we all understand there has been an awful \nlot of heated rhetoric about this issue of Medicare and negotiating \ndrug prices and how much savings will come about for the consumer.\n  I and the distinguished senior Senator from Maine have been working \nfor well over 3 years, in a bipartisan way, on this issue. I and \nSenator Snowe have been able to come up with an approach for dealing \nwith this issue, helping the seniors of this country, helping the \ntaxpayers of this country, and lowering the temperature of the debate \nabout prescription drugs by showing how Medicare can be a smart shopper \nwithout setting up some kind of big Government price control regime.\n  Throughout this discussion over the last 3 years, Senator Snowe and I \nhave repeatedly put into the legislation that we have brought to the \nSenate a strict prohibition on establishing any kind of price control \nregime or any kind of uniform formulary, which is essentially a list of \ndrugs that restricts the choices for those involved--seniors or anyone \nelse.\n  What Senator Snowe and I have tried to do is lower the temperature on \nthis issue, to try to zero in, in a bipartisan way, on the areas where \nit is important for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be in \na position of trying to have some negotiations to get a break for the \nseniors and for the taxpayers. I will use those words specifically. We \nare talking about what could be a negotiation--not going in with some \narbitrary price and throwing around figures of $1.20 a pill or \nsomething like that. We are talking about the opportunity for our \nGovernment to be a smart shopper, while steering clear of any price \ncontrol regime. By the way, I know this was an important issue for the \nPresiding Officer as he campaigned to come here.\n  Senator Snowe and I voted for the Medicare prescription drug program. \nI still have the welts on my back to show for it. But what Senator \nSnowe and I said from the very outset, from the very time of the \noriginal Senate debate, is we were going to go to work on a bipartisan \nbasis to try to fix those areas, such as the one identified by the \nPresiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. We have \nset out to do just that. And in 2004, the Congressional Budget Office \nsent us a letter saying we were heading in the right direction.\n  Senator Snowe and I said from the beginning we have to make sure that \nseniors and taxpayers get a good deal when we have what are called \nsingle-source drugs, monopoly drugs. These are drugs where there isn't \nany ability to have the kind of leverage and clout we would like to \nhave in the marketplace.\n  In 2004, the Congressional Budget Office sent me a letter that there \ncould be savings if negotiations were permitted on single-source drugs \nfor which there is no therapeutic equivalent. It is common sense, it \nseems to me, when the Congressional Budget Office says there could be \nsavings in one kind of area, we would want to add that. The \ndistinguished chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator Baucus, \nputs it pretty well. Senator Baucus says: Why don't you add that to \nyour cost containment tool box? Senator Baucus has said what we need is \na variety of ways to hold down the cost--he calls it, in my view \ncorrectly, a kind of tool-box approach to making sure seniors and \ntaxpayers get a good deal. What Senator Snowe and I have said is let's \nmake sure that tool box that Senator Baucus has been talking about\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\nzero in on this question of single-source drugs, where we do need some \nbargaining power.\n  There are some who have said the only possible way to have \nnegotiations is if you set up some kind of one-size-fits-all national \nformulary. They say: The VA has one. Gosh, you all in the Senate would \nnot want to limit the drugs available to our country's seniors.\n  Let me make it clear what Senator Snowe and I are doing rejects that \napproach. We are not talking about a nationwide formulary or some kind \nof list of drugs that restricts seniors' choices.\n  By the way, when the former Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nTommy Thompson, felt it was important to do the kind of thing Senator \nSnowe and I are talking about on the drug Cipro, Secretary Thompson did \nnot go out and set up a nationwide formulary. He didn't say: We are \ngoing to say the price of the pill is $1.27. He did not set up some \nkind of arbitrary price-control regime. Secretary Thompson, in his last \nmeeting with the press when he was leaving the Department, said he \nwished he had the power to bargain under Medicare.\n  Secretary Thompson did exactly the kind of thing that I and Senator \nSnowe have been talking about. He said we have to make sure that the \nconsumer and the taxpayers get a good deal for Cipro. Secretary \nThompson did not set up a nationwide formulary. Secretary Thompson did \nnot set up some price-control regime. Secretary Thompson did not say: \nIt is going to be $1.27 per pill. He said: Let's negotiate, let's talk, \nlet's go back and forth as everyone does in the marketplace in Rhode \nIsland, Oregon and everywhere else across the country. Let's ask: What \nare we going to do to make sure that everyone gets a fair shake?\n  That situation, of course, was an emergency, because we had anthrax. \nBut as the Senator from Rhode Island has pointed out a number of times \nover the last few months, for a lot of seniors, trying to afford \nprescription medicine is kind of like having a new emergency every day.\n  Secretary Thompson said: Yes, we have a big emergency on this anthrax \nsituation. I think the Senator from Rhode Island knows exactly what I \nsee when I am home in Coos Bay, John Day, Pendleton, or Gresham, \nOregon, and everywhere else. For a lot of seniors in this country, \nevery day is an emergency with respect to being able to afford their \nmedicine. Those seniors ought to know that their Government, in the \ncase of the single-source drug, for example, where there is monopoly \npower, can bargain in those kind of instances without price controls, \nwithout a nationwide formulary. That is what Senator Snowe and I and \nothers, on a bipartisan basis, wish to stand up for--to help those \nseniors and those taxpayers.\n\n  Now, some have argued that as seniors get a better deal for Medicare, \nthat means higher prices for everyone else. They, also, argue that \nnegotiations would not do anything. I don't know how one can make both \narguments at the same time and make sense. Those two do not connect.\n  What Senator Snowe and I wish to do is have a Medicare program that \nis a smart, savvy shopper. By being a better shopper, seniors and \ntaxpayers are going to save. We know that no one goes to Costco and \nbuys toilet paper one roll at a time. They shop smart. We ought to do \nthat with Medicare.\n  I was pleased with last week's Committee on Finance hearing. Chairman \nBaucus and others said it is valuable to have additional information to \nknow whether markets for drugs are achieving the best price possible. I \nand Senator Snowe have been interested in that approach as well. We \nknow there are a variety of pharmacies out there that can offer cheaper \nmedicines to seniors without limiting the drugs available, and we find \nit hard to believe that Medicare cannot do exactly the same thing. Let \nus give Medicare the opportunity to do exactly the same thing that \npeople do in New Hampshire, Texas, and Rhode Island; that is, to shop \nsmart, look for a bargain, and don't set up nationwide price controls \nand don't set up a nationwide formulary that restricts the kind of \ndrugs our seniors can get.\n  If we work in a bipartisan way, which is what Senator Snowe and I \nhave been trying to do on this issue for 3\\1/2\\ years, we can draw a \nline that promotes smart shopping in Medicare without going over the \nline to price controls and restrictive formularies. Let us try to lower \nthe temperature on this particular debate by looking at ways to shop \nsmart without price controls.\n  In 2004, the Congressional Budget Office said it would make a \ndifference in at least one key area I have been talking about today. I \nbelieve it would make a difference in other key areas. I am looking \nforward, as a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, to working \nunder the leadership of Chairman Baucus, on a bipartisan basis, to get \nthis issue resolved because, as the Presiding Officer of the Senate has \nnoted over these many months, this is not an abstract issue for the \npeople most involved. Those are seniors walking on an economic \ntightrope. We don't know what will happen to medical costs this year, \nbut we can make sure we use every possible opportunity without price \ncontrols to make the Medicare Program a smart shopper.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about the \nsituation in Iraq and how we are trying to deal with this as a nation. \nWe need to start with, when we are discussing Iraq, what are our \nnational interests and why are we engaged there.\n  Our basic national interest in Iraq is the protection of America, our \ndesire to make sure that we are projecting our purposes in a way that \nreduces the ability of those who would wish to do us harm in this war \nagainst us, which was declared in the late 1990s, when it was obviously \nbrought to our shores on September 11, that in that war we are best \npostured to make sure terrorists, specifically Islamic fundamentalists \nwho wish to do us harm, are not successful. That is the first purpose \nof our engagement in Iraq.\n\n  The second purpose, of course, is to make sure our troops, who are \nengaged in pursuing this war on the ground in Iraq, are adequately \nfunded and given the support they need in order to do their job and not \nbe exposed to risks which would occur were they not adequately funded \nand supported.\n  It has been 5 years since we were attacked. That is the good news, \nthat we have not been attacked for 5 years. Obviously, some of that is \ngood fortune and luck, I suspect. But a lot of that is the result of a \npolicy which has essentially said we are going to find the terrorists \nbefore they can find us, and we are going to bring them to justice. And \nwe are going to also try to initiate a process where we establish, in \nthe Middle East, an attitude that respects democracy, respects \nindividual rights, respects the rights of women, and respects the \napproach of a marketplace economy.\n  In Iraq, we have attempted to accomplish that, and much has occurred \nin Iraq that has been good, although, obviously, there is a lot there \nthat has occurred that has been unfortunate, and there have been \nmistakes made. But the fact is, they have gone through major election \nprocesses. They have elected a government. They have had a number of \nelections, where a large percentage of the population participated. \nWomen have been allowed out of the household and are participating in \nsociety.\n  It remains, however, a nation which is torn by religious strife and \ncultural and deep ethnic differences. We have not been successful in \nbeing able to resolve that and nor have the Iraqi people been able to \ndo that through their democratic process.\n  But the question becomes for us--in light of the President's request \nthat there be an increase of troops, called the surge, of potentially \n20,000 troops, especially concentrated in the Baghdad area, to try to \nbring more stability to that region--how do we approach this as we move \ndown the road?\n  Well, I think we have to, as we approach this, keep in context what \nis our goal. Our goal is to protect us--America--from attacks by \nradical fundamental Islamic movements and individuals, terrorists \nspecifically, and to\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\nmake sure our troops, who are in the field, are adequately protected \nand have the support they need in order to do their job correctly.\n  A precipitous, immediate pullout, which is the proposal that has come \nfrom the other side in a number of different scenarios, would, I \nsuspect, lead to a number of results which would not be acceptable to \nus and would undermine our basic purpose, which is to protect America \nfrom further attack and to protect our soldiers who are in the field \nprotecting us.\n  How do you manage a precipitous pullout that does not immediately \nlead to chaos in Iraq, where the sectarian and religious violence has \nescalated dramatically, where the potential that a client state of Iran \nwill be set up, at least over a portion of Iraq, where safe havens will \noccur and result for al-Qaida in other portions of Iraq, and where even \ngreater numbers of people--even though that may seem hard to \nunderstand--but where even greater numbers of people may die in Iraq, \nwhere a massive civil war, potentially in catastrophic proportions in \nrelation to the population there, will precipitate?\n  I do not see how you avoid those occurrences if you immediately \nwithdraw. An immediate withdrawal also leads to the issue of what \nhappens to the troops who are left behind. You cannot get 130,000 \ntroops out of Iraq overnight. It is going to take, even under the \nscenario laid out here by the Democratic leadership, 8 to 12 months to \naccomplish that. And if you are doing that in a compressed time--as is \nproposed by the recent language that has been put forward by some of \nour colleagues--if you compress that time, you are going to leave some \ntroops behind at significant risk, much more significant risk than if \nthey have the support mechanisms they need in order to do the job \nright.\n  Is the surge the right approach? Is this concept of 20,000 troops \ngoing to resolve this? Is that going to lead us to an Iraq that is more \nstable? I do not know the answer to that question. I have deep \nreservations that that is going to accomplish that goal. I have to \nadmit, I suspect if we are able to stabilize certain sections of \nBaghdad, divided into nine districts, as is proposed--stabilize them in \nsequence or in parallel--that as you stabilize one district, you are \ngoing to push the people who are causing the problems into another \nplace. It is not as if they are going to disappear or even probably be, \nfor the most part, corralled. They are simply going to move.\n  So I am not sure it is going to accomplish its goal. But I do know \nthis: It is the proposal put forward by the people who are on the \nground and to whom we have given the responsibility of trying to \naddress this issue of how you deal with an Iraq in the context of the \nproblems which it has. To take the other option is to lead inevitably \nto a dramatic problem that will be immediate, both for us as a nation, \nbecause it will give potentially safe haven to al-Qaida and create an \nIran client state, and it will also lead to what I suspect would be a \nhuge explosion in the area of civil war.\n\n  So although I have reservations, I, also, am not about to vote to cut \noff the support for the troops who are in the field. Now, I do not \ncommand those troops. I am a Senator. I am not the commander of the \ntroops. The President is Commander in Chief. He has literally the \nunilateral authority to pursue this course of action, unless we vote as \na Senate to cut off funding. And the practical implications of us doing \nthat would mean that troops in the field would not have the money they \nneed in order to undertake their own protection. That would be the \nresult of us cutting off funds.\n  That is a vote I am never going to take or support because the first \nobligation we have is to those soldiers who are in the field. You may \ndisagree with the Commander in Chief's position, but I do not think \nthat as people who are charged with the responsibility of funding the \ntroops in the field, that you take that disagreement to the point of \nputting them at risk. So that would not be a vote that I think would be \na good vote for us, as a Congress, to take.\n  But it appears to me--listening to the debate as it has evolved \nhere--there are some who wish to have it sort of both ways. They want \nto be able to say one thing but not do what they say. I almost am of \nthe view that we should engage this at the level of substance, and we \nshould have that vote. I am not going to vote for it, but we should \nhave that vote. We should say: OK, if it is the position of the \nDemocratic Party that they want to cut off funds to the troops in the \nfield, if they feel that should be the course of action, so be it.\n  I happen to be attracted, more appropriately, or more positively, to \nthe proposals of the Iraq Study Group. I think they have laid out a \nblueprint for us to pursue. I am not sure that is going to lead to \nanything that fundamentally resolves the problem in Iraq, as the \nproblem in Iraq is religious and it is ethnic and it is cultural and it \ngoes back a long way. But at least they have laid out a roadmap. I will \nnot use that word because that word, obviously, has other implications. \nThey have laid out a blueprint we can pursue and I believe we should \npursue.\n  I, for example, think we should engage both Iran and Syria in \ndiplomacy. I agree with former Secretary of State Baker on that point. \nThe way you engage them--of course, that does not instantaneously give \nthem credibility, but there are ways to engage governments that are so \nantithetical to us, as has been shown over the years, without giving \nthem inordinate credibility as a result of that engagement. And I think \nthat is appropriate.\n  So there are processes we could follow. But we have to, under any \ncircumstances, get back to what is our basic purpose, I believe, as \ngovernors--and I use that term in the generic sense--and it is, A, No. \n1, to protect this Nation from another attack. And that means finding \nthe terrorists before they find us and bringing them to justice. And \nthe effort in Iraq was a legitimate and appropriate effort to try to \nsupport the construction of a state in the middle of the Middle East \nwhich would subscribe to democratic values, which would give its people \nthe opportunity to have a pluralistic society, where individuals are \nrespected, especially women, and as a result to build a center from \nwhich we would have the capacity to undermine the Islamic \nfundamentalist movement's philosophy that Western values are \nfundamentally at variance with the Muslim religion and the Muslim way \nof life. And I believe that is still a legitimate and valued purpose.\n  But it all comes back to how it protects us. And it protects us by \ncreating an atmosphere where we can go to the Muslim world and say we \nare not your enemy, but we are actually an opportunity for you to have \na better lifestyle, if you follow the course of action of liberty, \nfreedom, individual rights, rights for women, and a market-oriented \napproach. That protects us. And that should be our first goal: the \nprotection of America from further attack.\n  We should respect the fact that this administration has succeeded for \n5 years in protecting us. Some of that is good fortune, as I said, but \na lot of it is the fact that we have reached beyond our borders to find \nthem before they could find those who wish to do us harm.\n  The second purpose must be to make sure the troops who are in the \nfield have the support they need, not only financial and technical and \nlogistical support but the moral support they need, so they know they \nare fighting for what is an American cause and is going to keep America \nsafe--which they are. And we need to respect them. They are \nextraordinary young men and women who are on the frontlines of this war \nagainst terrorism and who are doing exceptional service for us.\n  So that is a brief outline of my thoughts on this matter. I notice, \nin the concurrent resolution which was submitted by some of our \ncolleagues, they stated that the primary objective of the strategy of \nthe United States in Iraq should be to have the Iraq political leaders \nmake political compromise necessary to end the violence in Iraq. That \nis an objective, but that is not our primary objective. To make \ncompromise? Whom are they going to compromise with, al-Qaida? Are they \ngoing to compromise with Iran?\n  That is not our objective. Our objective is to, hopefully, have an \nIraq that is democratic, is pluralistic, and that is reasonably stable, \nthat is not a client state of Iran, that is not a safe haven for al-\nQaida.\n  Our primary purpose in Iraq is to create an atmosphere in the Middle \nEast\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\nwhere people will look at democracy, at liberty and say: It works. Even \nthough I am Muslim, that works for me as a Muslim--where women have a \nchance to pursue their options, where market forces work.\n  Our other primary purpose in Iraq must be to make sure our soldiers, \nwho are fighting for us and protecting us and who are engaged there, \nare properly supported as long as they are there. Our Commander in \nChief has made a decision to move additional troops in there; and that \nthose troops are equally supported.\n  It is, obviously, a difficult and torturous issue for us as a nation \nbecause we are a good nation. We do believe genuinely--I ask unanimous \nconsent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Hampshire yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I could complete a quick thought and \nthen turn to the Senator for his question, my thought was this: This is \nobviously a torturous issue for us as a nation, because we are \nbasically a very good people. And our history shows that when we use \nforce, we use it for the purposes of trying to free people, of giving \npeople more options and a better lifestyle. We did it during World War \nI and World War II, and we did it throughout the Cold War. Our success \nis extraordinary. We have never sought territorial gain, and we do not. \nWe seek to give people the opportunity to pursue the liberties and \nfreedoms which were defined so brilliantly by our Founding Fathers. \nWhen we see something such as Iraq, where there seems to be such an \ninability of the culture to grasp these concepts, even though we are \ntrying as hard as we can to give them that option, it is difficult.\n  But we still can't take our eye off the ball, which is to basically \nrecognize that we are doing this for our national defense, as we try to \nstabilize a region that represents an immediate threat to us and has \nalready damaged us more than any other event in our history has damaged \nus, other than potentially Pearl Harbor, and that we have troops in the \nfield who need to be supported.\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas for a question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I agree with the argument the Senator from New Hampshire \nhas made about the importance of our prosecuting the war against terror \nand particularly what has been called by the terrorists themselves \n``the central front in the war on terror'' in Iraq.\n  Some of our colleagues have introduced a resolution, which the \nSenator has spoken to, which is a nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. I heard others this morning talk about imposing caps on the \nnumber of troops we might deploy there.\n  I ask the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, if it is so \nimportant that we not fail in Iraq and that the region not descend into \neither a failed state or a launching pad for future terrorist attacks \nor a regional conflict ensue, does he not believe it would be important \nfor those who criticize the President's announced plan to offer a \nconstructive alternative of their own, if they believe that the \nPresident's chosen plan is not the best course of action?\n  Mr. GREGG. Answering the Senator through the Chair, that seems to me \nto be the logical approach. As I mentioned earlier, there are some who \nseem to want the language of opposition but don't want the \nresponsibility of opposition. If the case is that some believe we \nshould have immediate withdrawal, then that ought to be put on the \ntable in a context which would have the force of law and effect, and \nlet us vote on that. I would vote against it, but let us vote on it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator will yield for one final question.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Notwithstanding the fact that we have a number of our \ncolleagues running for President of the United States in 2008, and \nnotwithstanding the fact that obviously we have Senators of different \nparty affiliation, Republican and Democrat, isn't a matter of national \nsecurity exactly the kind of issue that should rise above partisan \ndivisions and upon which we should work to find common ground so we can \nprotect the national security of the United States? I ask the Senator \nwhether he believes that perhaps we have let our guard down and let \nthis discourse become too political in nature rather than solution \noriented?\n  Mr. GREGG. Responding to the Senator through the Chair, the Senator \nmakes a good point. My big concern goes to the morale of the troops in \nthe field. What are they thinking? What are they thinking as a young \n19-, 20-, 22-year-old soldier in Iraq today when they hear this \ndiscourse going forward and they are asked to go out on patrol, and \nthey are told that maybe the troops their military leadership says it \nneeds to support them is an issue? It is a legitimate issue as to how \nlong we should allow this to hang out there. Let's have the debate. \nLet's resolve our national position as to what it is going to be, at \nleast for the next year, if we get that far, and resolve it so that we \nknow where we are; otherwise, we do harm to our national policy, \nbecause it is so disruptive to have this many voices at the same time \nclaiming legitimacy and, more importantly, it does harm to our troops \nin the field, which is my primary concern.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for his questions and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nto speak for up to 10 minutes, followed by the Senator from Michigan \nfor 10 minutes, followed by the Senator from Colorado for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, with regard to his concerns \nabout the public debate in this body on the progress of the war against \nterrorism and, specifically, the role of the conflict in Iraq. I have \nto express some deep concern that on an issue so important to our \nnational security, on the type of matter where we have historically \nsaid partisan differences should not extend beyond our shorelines, that \nwe ought to try to work harder to find some solution to this problem \nfor our country. I couldn't agree more with the Senator from New \nHampshire: This is a matter of America's national interest and \nAmerica's national security. That is our No. 1 responsibility. That \nought to be our focus. We ought to focus on that like a laser and not \nbe distracted by anything else.\n  I have heard, in addition to nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions being offered, expressing disapproval of the President's \nproposed plan, suggestions this morning by the Senator from Illinois \nthat he wants to put a cap on the number of troops that can be deployed \nin the battlefield. Perhaps there will be other efforts that come \nforward to try to one-up the other proposal, to micromanage the conduct \nof this very grave and serious matter which so directly affects our \nnational security. While I disagree fundamentally that we ought to have \nany suggestion to our troops and to those who are in harm's way that we \nare going to undermine their efforts by cutting off funds to support \nour troops during a time of war or whether we are going to send \nnonbinding sense-of-the-Senate resolutions in a way that will only \nencourage our enemies and undermine our war effort, or whether we are \ngoing to try to micromanage the conduct of the war rather than to rely \nupon the senior military leadership who has advised the President and \nbeen so much a part of the proposal that the President has made, I \nthink this is all extraordinarily premature.\n\n  I hope if there is one thing we can all agree on, it is that we have \na chance to be successful in Iraq. I know there are those who differ on \nwhat success would mean. The President has talked in impressive terms \nabout his vision of establishing a democratic beachhead in Iraq in an \narea with too few democracies, because the fact is, democracies don't \nwage war against other democracies. It would be helpful to the long-\nterm stability of the Middle East if that were successful. But I hear \npeople giving up on that vision and saying: Well, the most we can hope \nfor is what the Iraq Study Group said, which is to provide an Iraq that \ncan be sustained, governed, and defended by the Iraqi people.\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\n  I would be satisfied at this time if we were able to accomplish that \ngoal. I would hope that would be a goal we could all embrace. But I \nknow there are two ways to fail in achieving that goal. One would be to \ngive up and to have a precipitous withdrawal of our troops or to cut \noff funds to support our troops now or to try to micromanage from \nWashington, DC, how many troops are in the field or under what \ncircumstances, what the rules of engagement might be. The other way is \nto actually try to see whether the President's proposal demonstrates \nany improvement or progress in Iraq, which I would think we would all \nwelcome, if, in fact, that happens. But of course, we can't guarantee \nthat. No one knows whether that plan will be successful for sure. I do \nbelieve the President has attempted to get advice from the very best \nmilitary minds available--people such as GEN David Petraeus, who \nhopefully will be confirmed here shortly to serve as the head of \ncoalition forces in Iraq; people such as Admiral Fallon, who will take \nover as CENTCOM commander--while continuing to rely on the advice of \npeople such as GEN George Casey and GEN John Abizaid, whom those two \ngentlemen will be succeeding.\n  It strikes me as odd to say we are going to give up on this new plan, \nwhich many have clamored for months and maybe even years, before we \nhave even had a chance to implement it. Indeed, the fact is we have had \nas many as 160,000 troops in Iraq at any given time, where now we have \napproximately 130,000. And even this so-called surge will not bring us \nup to the maximum number of troops we have had in Iraq at any given \nperiod of time.\n  I think we ought to take a moment and think about what is being \nproposed here in terms of nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, \nattempts to micromanage the conduct of the war and the battlefield, \nbecause I truly believe if we are to allow Iraq to descend into a \nfailed state, that it will, like Afghanistan did after the Soviet Union \nleft, serve as a launching pad for terrorist organizations to train, \nrecruit, and launch terrorist attacks to other parts of the world, \nincluding the United States, and that more American civilians will die \nas a result.\n  Of course, there is also the issue of a regional conflict. We have \nalready heard from people such as the Saudis that if, in fact, the \nIranians take advantage of the Shiites' momentum in Iraq in that there \nis ethnic cleansing of Sunnis in Iraq, that likely the Saudis will come \nin in an effort to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Sunnis, and there \nwill certainly be other countries drawn into what will be a regional \nconflict.\n  It is not only responsible for the critics of the President's plan to \nsay what they would do differently, but also to explain how they are \ngoing to deal with the consequences of a regional conflict in Iraq, \nshould that happen. I do believe that is likely to happen unless we try \nto see whether the President's plan, in consultation with bipartisan \ngroups such as the Iraq Study Group and in consultation with the very \nbest military minds in the world, has a chance of success.\n  I don't know of any American who would not support an effort to win \nand to stabilize Iraq, to provide a means for it to govern itself and \ndefend itself if, in fact, that is in the best interest of the United \nStates, which I believe it is.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator allow me to interrupt for a request and \nI will ask unanimous consent that the interruption not show in his \ncomments?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I don't know what the interruption is for.\n  Mr. KERRY. I want to make request to get into the order, if I could.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would prefer if the Senator wait until after I am \nthrough talking rather than interrupt my comments. I have no objection \nif he would like to be added to the end of the current unanimous \nconsent request to be recognized after the Senator from Colorado. I ask \nunanimous consent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S727-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me mention one other subject while I \nam up, and that has to do with the comments of the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon about Medicare prescription drugs and the success \nof the Part D Medicare prescription drug program. I don't know of many \ngovernmental programs that have met with more success than this \nprescription drug program, in terms of the acceptance of America's \nseniors and the way it has allowed them to get access to prescription \ndrugs at a reasonable cost that they were never able to access before. \nBut I do have grave concerns about those who would attempt to basically \ninterfere with that successful program by imposing Federal controls on \nthe price for which these pharmaceuticals may be charged under the \nguise of some negotiation. When the Federal Government negotiates with \na private entity, there is no real negotiation; it is a take-it-or-\nleave-it proposition.\n  I pose as exhibit A to support that the current VA health care \nsystem, which is held out as a model by which this kind of negotiation \ncould go forward. The fact is, the VA system is pointed to as a model \nby which this Government negotiation could occur, and today that system \ndoes not supply nearly the variety of pharmaceuticals to its \nbeneficiaries the Medicare system does.\n  I have read in various places that the number ranges from 19 \npercent--I have heard as high as 30 percent--of the drugs that are \navailable to Medicare beneficiaries are available to veterans under the \nVA system because of this feature. So when you impose price controls, \nwhich is what is being advocated by those who want to change the \ncurrent successful system of Medicare prescription drugs, basically, \nwhat we are going to find is a rationing effect. I would think that \nwould be the last thing any of us would want to do--to ration the \nprescription drugs available to our seniors under the enormously \nsuccessful Medicare Part D reform we passed in 2003.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. I have a different view, and the Michigan \nseniors and people with disabilities who are trying to access this \nprogram have a different experience and view than my friend from Texas.\n  As I said yesterday, I think it is incredibly important that we join \nwith the House of Representatives to do the first step, which is to \nrequire negotiation for the best price on prescription drugs through \nMedicare. I also know there is incredible confusion, that seniors have \nbeen offered a variety of private choices but not the one that most \nseniors asked for, which is to be able to go through Medicare and sign \nup as they do for Part B and the rest of Medicare and get a good price. \nI also know there is great concern from seniors who find themselves in \nthis gap, somehow being called a doughnut hole, but the gap in coverage \nwhere you continue to pay a premium but don't receive any help. There \nare a number of concerns I hope we are going to address.\n  Number 1 needs to be to say clearly that we want the Secretary to \nnegotiate the best price for people. Right now, as we know, the law \nactually prohibits, actually stops the Secretary from using the \nbargaining power of all of the seniors and the people with disabilities \non Medicare to be able to get the best price. Why in the world does \nthat make sense? In fact, it doesn't make sense--particularly for \nsomething that is lifesaving; it is the major way we provide health \ncare today from a preventive and maintenance standpoint, as well as in \na crisis.\n\n  There are huge differences between the way the Veterans' \nAdministration successfully serves our veterans and what is being done \nthrough, unfortunately, inflated prices through the Medicare system \nthat not only seniors are paying, disabled are paying, but taxpayers \nare paying as well.\n  Yesterday, I talked about a report--and I want to talk to that \ntoday--from Families U.S.A. released last week, which looked at 20 \nprescription drugs commonly used by seniors. The results are startling. \nThe report compares the prices the private Medicare Part D plans charge \nand the prices obtained by the VA, which negotiates for low drug prices \non behalf of America's veterans.\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\nIt showed, again, what we have been seeing over the past year: For each \nof the top 20 drugs prescribed to seniors, the lowest prices charged by \nany of the top private Part D providers are higher than the price \nsecured by the VA. It is not just a little bit higher, but in many \ncases it is astoundingly higher.\n  Let's look at some examples. I am mentioning specific drugs, not to \npick on particular drugs, but we talked about the fact in the committee \nthat transparency, the ability to compare price, and the ability for \npeople to know what they are purchasing is very important. This is \nsomething we want the Secretary, on behalf of the people of America, to \nbe doing--looking at the differences in these prices, and the \nparticular points where there is a wide disparity, using their \nnegotiating power to be able to step in on behalf of seniors and the \ndisabled.\n  When we look at Zocor, which I mentioned yesterday--the drug many \nseniors use to control their cholesterol levels--the lowest VA price \nfor a year is just over $127. The lowest price under a private plan is \n$1,485.96--over a 1,066-percent difference. That is astounding. I argue \nthat you could still continue to work with the Federal Government and \npartner to do research and bring that price down.\n  Why should seniors pay $1,359 more in a year for this particular \nprescription drug than veterans do? It is exactly the same drug.\n  Now, I also mentioned Protonix yesterday. It is the same thing. We \nare looking at $214.52 for a year, the VA price, negotiating the best \nprice, and $1,148.40 with the lowest Part D plan, a difference of 435 \npercent.\n  It is the same thing as we go through the next one, which is Fosamax, \nwhich is a 205-percent difference, and on down.\n  We are talking about substantial differences in price--some smaller \nthan others. But the reality is negotiation works. All we have to do is \nlook at the fact that, on average, we are seeing a price difference of \n58 percent between the Veterans' Administration and what is happening \nfrom the lowest possible plan with the top 20 most prescribed drugs for \nour seniors. In other words, for half of the drugs our seniors need \nmost, the lowest price charged is almost 60 percent higher, and it is \nnot demagoguery to say people are choosing between food and medicine. \nIt is not. It is not an exaggeration to say that right now somebody is \nsitting down and deciding: am I going to pay the heating bill or get \nthe medicine I need? That is the reality for people. We need to have a \nsense of urgency about fixing this.\n  I also want to speak to the fact that we have heard a lot about the \nVA. Unfortunately, we have heard things that are not true, according to \ninformation from the Veterans' Administration. Yesterday, I was asked \nif I knew there were well over 1 million veterans who moved to Medicare \nPart D. The assertion was made that veterans were leaving the VA \nbecause the VA could not give them the drugs they wanted. I knew there \nwere veterans who were adding Medicare Part D coverage. We went back to \nlook and see what that was all about after I received that question. In \nfact, approximately 280,000 veterans have signed up for Medicare. They \nare not leaving the VA. In fact, it is not even clear that they are \ngetting any drugs through Medicare at this point. They may have done it \nto add extra coverage. We are not sure what that mix is, but we are not \ntalking about a million veterans or more running to leave VA because it \nis such a bad program.\n  Moreover, according to both the Government Accountability Office and \nthe Institute of Medicine, the VA system is working well. According to \nthe GAO, an overwhelming majority of VA physicians report that the \nformulary, the grouping of drugs that are available, allows them to \nprescribe drugs that meet their patients' needs.\n  The Institute of Medicine has reported that veterans believe their \nneeds are being met. Access to drugs is an issue in less than one-half \nof 1 percent of the complaints about the VA health system. One-half of \n1 percent relate an inability to be able to get the medicine they need.\n  I also need to point out that at our Finance Committee hearing last \nweek it was mentioned that there are fewer drugs available to our \nveterans. In fact, we have heard it today on the floor. That is exactly \nthe opposite of what is true. The VA actually has more drugs on its \nformulary, its list of available drugs. I have not heard anybody say, \nfirst of all, that we should take the VA system and impose it on \nMedicare. But there is a lot of misinformation about what is happening \nin the VA and what is happening for our veterans, and there is a lot we \nneed to do to focus on the reality and the facts of the huge \ndisparities, an average of 58 percent, and the highest is over 1,000 \npercent.\n  I find it very interesting that, on the one hand, we hear two \ndifferent kinds of arguments occurring. One is that negotiation will \nmake no difference in price. On the other hand, we hear we will lose \nlifesaving research because of negotiation. Those two arguments don't \nfit together, even though they are being made by the same people. We \ndon't have to worry about research and development if, in fact, \nnegotiation doesn't lower prices. I argue--and I think common sense \ndictates--that when you are looking at a 1,000-percent difference in \nprice, at the fact that the American taxpayer is contributing, on \naverage, at least as many dollars for research as the brandname \nindustry is--overall, at least contributing that, because we want the \nlifesaving drugs--when you look at all of the facts, it doesn't add up; \nit doesn't add up for anybody but the industry itself to be able to \nargue that they want to keep the prices this high. I appreciate that. \nAny industry that has such a significant advantage certainly wants to \nfight to keep it. But I am very hopeful we will join with the House in \nsaying this is lifesaving medicine, it is not an optional product, and \nwe have to get the best price for our seniors and for the disabled in \nAmerica.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today because our dependence on \nforeign oil is dangerously out of control and it is putting our Nation \nat risk. It is weakening our defenses and undermining our power around \nthe world.\n  From my point of view, as I look at the defining issues of the 21st \ncentury, there is no doubt in my mind that our energy security is at \nthe very top of those issues which we must address. We must address it \nbecause of national security implications, because of our economic \nsecurity, and because of the environmental security of the United \nStates of America.\n  First, with respect to the national security of our country, it is \nincredible to me that in this year, 2007, we are importing 60 percent \nof our oil from foreign countries, and 22 percent of the world's oil \nreserves are official sponsors of terrorism that are under some kind of \nU.N. sanction. When we look at the conflict underway in the Middle \nEast, when we look at the tensions with Venezuela, we in the United \nStates of America are putting our very national security at risk simply \nbecause of our overdependence on foreign oil.\n  Second, the economic security of the United States of America is very \nmuch at risk as well. We need to have a new energy economy that will \nproduce jobs in the United States of America and give us stability with \nrespect to the costs that go into our energy economy.\n  Third, the environmental security of our Nation is also very much at \nrisk.\n  As we move forward to try to address issues such as global warming, \nit is important for us to address this issue from a national security \npoint of view, an economic security point of view, and environmental \nsecurity point of view. Therefore, I believe the Congress and President \nBush, Secretary Bodman, and others who are involved in this effort have \nto get very serious about our energy security. It is time for us to put \nrhetoric behind us.\n  As we heard last week in the Senate Energy Committee, we have a pre-\n9/11 energy policy that is failing us in a post-9/11 world. We have an \nenergy policy which is still a pre-9/11 energy policy, and it is \nfailing us in this post-9/11 world. We must take dramatic steps to \nreduce our dependence on fossil fuels,\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nconserve energy with new energy-efficient technologies, and expedite \nthe development of renewable energy resources. We must build a clean \nenergy economy that restores our independence and our competitive \nadvantage around the world.\n  For much of the last century, the United States has been the single \nmost powerful Nation on this globe. We have been a clarion voice for \nfreedom, democracy, and justice for all people. My father and 16 \nmillion young Americans served their country in World War II, defeating \nthe Nazis and the fascists around the world, earning us our role on \nthis globe of the most powerful Nation of the last century. Many died \nto achieve that legacy for the United States of America. My uncle was \none of those 400,000 Americans who died in that conflict of World War \nII, leaving his life, his blood, and his spirit on the soils of Europe.\n  Today, our dependence on foreign oil is sapping the strength that the \nWorld War II generation built for us. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, \nRussia, and Iran are playing their oil holdings like chess pieces on a \nchessboard, applying pressure here, threatening there, and eroding U.S. \ninfluence around the world. Since 2001, China and Russia have partnered \nto lock up oil in central Asia, rolling us out of the region. Venezuela \nhas wielded its resources to bully its neighbors and to oppose our \ninterests in South America. And Iran has used its oil resources to \ncourt Russia and China, convincing them to oppose our diplomatic effort \nto stop Iran from building nuclear weapons. We ought not put our \nforeign policy in the hands of Iran or Venezuela or the sheiks and \nkings of the Middle East.\n  Countries that wish us harm know full well of our addiction to their \noil. They know that any disruption in supply sends gas prices through \nthe roof and slows our economy. And they are happy to profit from our \naddiction. Oil money lines the pockets of the terrorists, the \nextremists, and unfriendly governments. It helps the Syrians buy \nrockets, such as those the Hezbollah has in Lebanon today. It reaches \nbin Laden and al-Qaida. It funds the militants in Nigeria who capture \nand terrorize westerners. The sad truth is that we are funding both \nsides of the war on terror. We spent over $100 billion last year to \nfight the extremists in Iraq and Afghanistan--extremists armed with \nweapons purchased from our oil revenues. It is crazy.\n  We are importing more oil today than we ever have. Over 60 percent of \nour oil--more than 12 million barrels a day--comes from abroad. The \nvast majority of this oil comes from state-owned oil companies in \nunfriendly countries. This is only going to get worse in the coming \nyears. Take a look at who controls the world's oil reserves. If we look \nat the chart, the countries of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Iraq--and \nthe list goes on--control most of the world's oil reserves, and many of \nthese countries are either unfriendly to the United States or have a \nshaky government around them. But we know one thing for sure: It is not \nthe best interests of the United States they have at heart.\n  If our oil dependence continues, we will be relying on companies such \nas Petrovesa, Saudi Aramco, and Gazprom for our oil. What does this \nmean? It means that Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela will hold \nour very energy security in their hands, which means they hold our very \nnational security in their hands.\n  We have to change course, and we have to change course now. We are no \nlonger a world where oil costs $12 a barrel. We no longer carry the \nillusion that others wish us no harm. We live in a complex and \ndangerous time. Yet we continue to depend on this pre-9/11 energy \npolicy that simply is not working for us in this 21st century.\n  The good news is that the future of our Nation's energy security lies \nright here at home. It lies in our farms and in our fields and with the \ningenuity of American workers and American technologies.\n  There are two things we can do immediately to improve our energy \nsecurity. First, we can dramatically increase our energy efficiency. \nImproved efficiency is the cheapest and largest source of energy. The \ntechnologies that will save us energy and money are already in place, \nbut Government policies often discourage consumers from using them. We \nhave to be much smarter as a country about energy efficiency.\n  Second, we need to expand our domestic energy production from \nrenewable energy sources. We have taken aggressive steps over the past \nfew years to open new sources of oil and natural gas in this country. \nWe see the effects of these policies throughout our country, especially \nin my State of Colorado where natural gas production has jumped over 50 \npercent over 2000, and we see it in the Gulf of Mexico where just a few \nmonths ago we in Congress opened millions of new acres for leasing.\n  But we have fallen woefully short on the renewable energy front. We \nhave fallen woefully short. In last year's State of the Union Address, \nPresident Bush touted the virtues of cellulosic ethanol and solar \npower. He told the American people:\n\n       . . . We have a serious problem, we are addicted to oil.\n\n  And he indicated that he would make a serious commitment to renewable \nenergy. That is what the President said a year ago in his State of the \nUnion Address. Yet, in fact, that hasn't happened. The proof is that it \nsimply is not in the budget, and the proof is that if you look at what \nhas happened with renewable energy and energy efficiency, we are \ninvesting less in these initiatives than at the time President Bush \nbecame President. If you look at our renewable energy investments from \n2001 to 2006, you see this line, this thin line. We have actually been \ninvesting less in renewable energy resources from 2001 until 2006. For \nus to have declined by almost $100 million during that time period in \nterms of what we are investing in renewable energy means we are not \nwalking the talk about what we can do with respect to renewable energy.\n\n  I also want to briefly demonstrate the reductions that have been made \nwith respect to our investments in energy efficiency. Again, in 2001, \nwe were investing about $900 million to make this a more energy-\nefficient country. In the time that has passed in the last 5 years, \nnow, in 2006, we are investing $200 million less. So when people talk \nabout getting energy efficient or investing in renewable energy, the \nfact is America simply is not walking the talk. We need to start \nwalking the talk if we are going to get to energy independence.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry, for being patient.\n  We need to move forward to start walking the talk, and the first step \nis for President Bush, when he comes before the Congress for the State \nof the Union Address, to talk about energy independence, but to make \nsure the budget that is put on the table for Congress to consider is a \nreal budget that is robust in terms of how it will move us forward with \nrespect to renewable energy, with respect to alternative technologies, \nand with respect to investments in a greater energy-efficient economy. \nThis is an imperative for the United States of America, and unless we \nmove forward aggressively in a bipartisan fashion, bringing \nconservatives and progressives, Democrats and Republicans, together on \nthis initiative, we will be compromising the national security of the \nUnited States in a manner that is absolutely inexcusable.\n  I look forward in the days ahead to working with my colleagues as we \nmove forward with a robust energy package that will get us to energy \nindependence.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first, let me begin by congratulating my \ncolleague from Colorado on his comments, which are important. As I \nthink the Chair knows, during the course of the 2004 cycle, I made \nenergy independence one of the centerpieces of the campaign. In fact, I \nam proud that I was the first Presidential candidate to ever advertise \nin a campaign on that topic. We tried to lay out why and how it is\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\nso critical to the security of our country, the health of our country, \nthe economy of our country, and the jobs that would be created. Of \ncourse, in terms of environmental protection, it is common sense. There \nare huge gains to be made with respect to efficiency. Efficiency, in \nfact, is the largest place available to grab CO2 out of the \natmosphere, which is the biggest problem with global warming, global \nclimate change. So there is an enormous agenda here. In fact, this \nadministration isn't even in the game. It is sad when you measure it \nagainst the demands of the country.\n  So I appreciate what the Senator has said. This is something that has \nto become a priority over the course of the next days here, and we are \ngoing to do everything in our power to help make it so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S730-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S730-S731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL TSONGAS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, 10 years ago today, this country lost a \nleader and this Chamber lost a colleague, and Massachusetts lost a \nfavorite son. Ten years ago today, cancer took Paul Tsongas from us \nprematurely at 55 years of age. He left three wonderful daughters: \nAshley, Katina, and Molly, and his special and extraordinary wife Niki, \nand he left an enormous number of friends and people whom he touched \nand affected across the country, those who joined him to help reform \nour politics.\n  Paul was a very different kind of public person. He walked his own \npath. He walked to his own tune. Today we remember him and we join the \npeople in Merrimack Valley and across Massachusetts and so many others \nwho came to appreciate and respect him and learned a lot about him \nthrough his Presidential campaign. We honor a life that elevated those \nwhom he knew, and the countless people he never met, but whose lives he \naffected through the things he fought for and believed in.\n  Paul Tsongas inspired with his optimism and his drive, his disarming \nhumor, and his love of causes both distant and local. He was proud of \nhis Greek heritage, proud of his roots as the son of a drycleaner, \nproud of Lowell, and he became a champion of environmental protection \nand expanding opportunity so the full measure of the American dream \nthat he came to see as a young person himself was accessible to \neverybody else.\n  He set a high standard for public service which he continued even \nafter he left the Senate. He continued out of office to work across the \naisle proving, with former Senator Warren Rudman and their Concord \nCoalition, that balancing the budget was not a partisan agenda item and \nthat fiscal discipline could, in fact, invigorate and not stifle the \nAmerican economy. Paul Tsongas was a Democratic deficit hawk before it \nwas popular and, I might add, together with Senator Gary Hart, was part \nof that new vanguard that helped to define the defense issues of our \nNation in a modern context.\n  He understood also that being a Democrat did not mean being \nantibusiness. In Lowell, Paul served as a city councilor and then later \nas a reformed county commissioner. He loved Lowell. He loved that old \nmill town where he was born. Even at the end of his life, he knew every \nsingle person there, from Main Street through the largest businesses, \nand he could still see where he had grown up from the house where he \nlived in his last days.\n  Paul came to Washington, where he worked with Tip O'Neill, Joe \nMoakley, Republican Sil Conte, and Ed Brooke in a bipartisan, golden \nage for the Massachusetts delegation. Paul's love of ideas and his love \nof Lowell helped trigger one of the earliest sparks of high-tech \ninnovation in Massachusetts. Through his championing of early computer \ncompanies such as Wang and others, he helped to fuel the whole era of \nsuch stunning ingenuity that it changed the face of America and \nenhanced our technological leadership in the world. Paul helped Lowell \nreinvent itself after years of decline, and in 1978, he was elected to \nthe Senate. After one term only in the Senate, he gave up his seat in \norder to be with his family and fight cancer. He was sustained by the \nloving support of his sister, his wife, and his daughters, whom he \ntreasured. Paul at age 7, had lost his own mother to tuberculosis, so \nthis idea of being with family during that kind of crucial time was \nparticularly poignant to him.\n\n  As a friend of Paul's famously told him: No man ever died wishing he \nhad spent more time with his business. Paul was first diagnosed with \ncancer in 1983 and he fought it courageously from that day forward. \nRight to the end of his life, he was tenacious in his support for the \ncauses he believed in, in his fight against the devastating disease \nthat eventually took him but never stole his spirit. Instead, he \nbrought to the fight the same optimism and determination that made him \nso successful in the Peace Corps. In 1992, when in remission, Paul ran \nfor the Presidency, and he ran one of the most bracingly honest and \npolitically courageous Presidential campaigns of our time. His was a \ncampaign defined by common sense and by that wry sense of humor more \nthan it was defined by fiery oratory. He managed to win Democratic \nprimaries in New Hampshire and three other primaries and four State \ncaucuses before the man from Lowell finally ceded the nomination to the \nman from Hope.\n  Paul reached across the country to the distant shores of the Pacific \nas coauthor of the Alaska Lands Act, which protected millions of acres \nof pristine wilderness. He made an admirable contribution to our \nenvironment. His aggressive policies to protect our natural resources \nwere truly an investment in our future. He made life-long friends in \nEthiopia as a result of his Peace Corps service in the early 1960s, \nproving even as a young man that his sense of the world reached beyond \nthe horizon and to cultures far from his roots.\n  Today, in Lowell, the name Tsongas graces a museum of industrial \nhistory, part of the National Park Service, where the full story, both \ngood and bad, of the industrial revolution and the textile industry in \nMassachusetts is presented for thousands of visitors, young and old, \nevery year. Today, the name Tsongas graces an arena where athletic \nexcellence, a passion dear to Paul's heart, is practiced along with \npolitical conventions and trade shows.\n  So I rise today not only as the Senator who inherited his seat; I \nrise as an admirer and a friend. To know Paul Tsongas was to see up \nclose what this business we work in means in people's lives, and the \nfull arch of his time on Earth illuminates the larger impact each of us \ncan have on our communities, on our State, and on our Nation.\n  That is why this day is special for this Chamber, a sad, proud memory \nfor Lowell and for Massachusetts, and a moment to reflect on Paul's \nlife and his contributions. It is hard to believe Senator Tsongas has \nbeen gone for 10 years. If he were with us today, Paul would be a \nstrong voice full of insight, humor, and wisdom, all in that inimitable \nstyle, once modest, but incredibly forceful, the style we came to know \nand appreciate so much. Lowell, MA will miss Paul Tsongas, America \nmisses him, but we remember him today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to join my \ncolleague, the junior Senator from Massachusetts, to mark a significant \nand sad anniversary. Ten years ago today, America lost a great patriot, \nMassachusetts lost a great advocate, and John Kerry and I lost a great \nfriend when Paul Tsongas passed away after a valiant and courageous \nfight with cancer.\n  Paul Tsongas was the epitome of a public servant. From his time in \nthe Peace Corps in both Ethiopia and the West Indies in the 1960s \nthrough his spirited campaign for the Presidency in 1992, Paul lived by \nthe words my brother Jack believed so strongly, that each of us can \nmake a difference and all of us should try.\n  Paul Tsongas tried his best to do so, all his life, and he made a \nlarge and continuing difference. To the people of his beloved Lowell, \nhe proved that our great industrial cities can be reborn and renewed, \nwith a creative emphasis on reshaping their great history to meet the \nneeds of our current high tech economy. In the 1970s and 1980s, when \nAmerica was moving inexorably to the suburbs and so many of our great \nurban centers were being hollowed out, many of our people found it \nincreasingly difficult to see a bright future for urban areas decimated \nby the decline of manufacturing.\n  But today, across the country, a new movement has been born to \nencourage creative investment in our cities, and\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\none of the first models for how such efforts can succeed is the vision \nPaul Tsongas had for Lowell, MA.\n  F. Scott Fitzgerald may have said there are no second acts in \nAmerican life, but Paul Tsongas could have responded, ``Let him come to \nLowell.''\n  Paul served in the House and joined me in the Senate in 1978. He was \nsomeone I knew I could always count on to fight hard for the people of \nMassachusetts, and the Nation. He was tireless, determined, and always \nwell prepared. Sometimes we would disagree on policy matters, here and \nthere, but if you were going to challenge Paul, you had better have \nyour facts straight because he knew what he was talking about.\n  He also was an outstanding campaigner. The conventional wisdom in \npolitics has always been--at least as long as I can remember--that \ncandidates with difficult to pronounce names have a small additional \nhurdle.\n  Paul had a silent ``t'' at the beginning of his name, and I will \nnever forget how brilliantly he turned that small disadvantage into a \nmajor asset in his victorious campaigns for elective office.\n  He ran hilarious ads that had all these people struggling to \npronounce his name, and none of them could do it. But by the end of the \ncampaign, every voter could do the silent ``t'' and everyone loved the \ncandidate who made fun of himself on TV.\n  Its is a lesson that Paul would carry on throughout his courageous \nbattle against cancer. Everyone faces obstacles--some great and some \nsmall. It's how we choose to deal with them that makes us who we are.\n  Paul Tsongas was an inspiration to all who knew him. The son of a \nGreek immigrant father and a mother who died of tuberculosis, he \ndemonstrated again and again that through hard work, commitment, and a \npassion for doing what is right, all things are possible in our \nAmerica.\n  He charted a new course for the city he loved. He authored the Alaska \nLands Act to protect millions of acres of American wilderness, and he \nfounded, with our former colleague, Warren Rudman, the Concord \nCoalition, which has become a highly respected force for fiscal \nresponsibility since its creation in the early 1990s.\n  When the diagnosis of cancer was made, he left the Senate to spend \nmore time with his wonderful wife Niki, his loving sister Thaleia, and \nhis three daughters, Ashley, Katina, and Molly.\n  After completing his rigorous treatment, he threw his hat in the \nPresidential ring in the 1992 primaries and his candidacy helped fuel \nthe movement to make Government accountable for its fiscal policies. He \nleft an immense and enduring legacy.\n  We miss you, Paul. We miss your bravery and your commitment. We miss \nyour friendship and concern, but we know you are resting in peace today \nafter an extraordinary and well-lived life.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in the late hours last night, I took to the \nfloor to decry some Senators who wish, if I may put it in this \nlanguage, to sabotage the ethics reform legislation with a dangerous \nand unconstitutional line-item veto proposal. What is happening is \nlittle more than political blackmail, and the American people--those \npeople out there who are watching through the lenses above the \nPresident's chair, the American people--should be outraged. I have been \naround here a long time. I have spoken on this subject many times. This \nso-called line-item veto is an assault on the single most important \nprotection that the American people have against a President, any \nPresident, who wants to run roughshod over the liberties of the people \nprescribed in the Constitution. Today I am talking about the \ncongressional power over the purse. The congressional power that is \nright here, and over on the other side of the Capitol, the \ncongressional power over the purse.\n  Weaken the power of the purse and one weakens strong--the word \n``strong'' is too weak--one weakens oversight, for example, on this \nbloody nightmare of a war in Iraq. Get that? Weaken the power over the \npublic purse and we weaken the oversight over this bloody war in Iraq. \nThat is just one example. One weakens the power of the purse and one \nweakens the checks on a President who wants to tap into personal \ntelephone calls or pry into bank accounts or tear open the mail. \nWithout congressional power over the purse--money--there is no \neffective way to stop an out-of-control President who is bent on his \nway, no matter the price, no matter the repercussion. Make no mistake--\nhear me, now. The Roman orator would say, ``Romans, lend me your \nears.'' Make no mistake, this line-item veto authority would grant \ntremendous--I say tremendous and dangerous--new power to the President.\n  There are new Members of this body. Perhaps we ought to have some \ndiscussions about the line-item veto. The President would have \nunchecked authority to imperil congressional power over the purse, a \npower that the constitutional Framers felt was absolutely vital to \nreining in an overzealous President.\n  Eight years ago, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the line-\nitem veto--hear me, Senators; you may be watching your boob tubes. Hear \nme. Eight years ago, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the \nline-item veto was unconstitutional. I said at the time that the \nSupreme Court saved the Congress from its own folly. But now, it seems, \nmemories in this Senate are short and wisdom may be even shorter in \nsupply. Here we are, on the heels of 6 years of assault on personal \nliberty, 6 years of a do-nothing Congress all too willing to turn its \neyes from the real problems of the Nation, 6 years of rubberstamps and \nrubber spines--here we are, all too ready to jettison the single most \nimportant protection of the people's liberties: the power of the purse.\n  Let's review the record. We have a President--I say this in all due \nrespect.\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\nI respect the President of the United States. I respect the Presidency; \nI respect the Chief Executive. We have a President who already has \nasserted too much power while refusing to answer questions:\n\n       I am the commander--see, I don't need to explain--I do not \n     need to explain why I say things. That's the interesting \n     thing about being the President. Maybe somebody needs to \n     explain to me why they say something, but I don't feel like I \n     owe anybody an explanation.\n\n  Those are the words of our President, the very President who some in \nthis body are all too willing to allow to dominate the people's branch, \nthis branch, your branch--the people's branch of Government.\n  This President claimed the unconstitutional authority to tap into the \ntelephone conversations of American citizens without a warrant, without \ncourt approval. This President claimed the unconstitutional authority \nto sneak and peek, to snoop and scoop into the private lives of you, \nthe American people. This President has taken the Nation to a failed \nwar--yes, to a failed war that we should have never entered into--based \non faulty evidence and an unconstitutional doctrine of preemptive \nstrikes, a doctrine that is absolutely unconstitutional on its face. \nMore than 3,000 American sons and daughters have died in Iraq in this \nfailed Presidential misadventure.\n  What is the response of the Senate? To give the President even more \nunfettered authority? Give him greater unchecked powers? It is \nastounding. We have seen the danger of the blank check. We have lived \nthrough the aftermath of a rubberstamp Congress. We should not continue \nto lie down for this or any other President.\n  Of course, this President wants to strip Congress of its strongest \nand most important power, the power of the purse. Congress has the \nability to shut down the administration's unconstitutional practices. \nCongress is asking tough questions and demanding honest answers. \nCongress is taking a hard look at finding ways to bring our troops home \nfrom the President's misadventure in Iraq that has already cost the \nlives of more than 3,000 of the American people's sons and daughters. \nOf course, the President wants to control the Congress. Some Presidents \nhave wanted to do this before--silence the critics, ignore, if you \nwill, the will of the people seriously cripple oversight.\n\n  Strip away the power of the Congress to control the purse strings, \nthen you strip away the power of the Congress to say ``No more, Mr. \nPresident;'' strip away the single most important power granted to the \npeople in this Constitution. That is the White House demand. I, for \none, will not kowtow to this President or to any President. I, for one, \nwill not stand quietly by while the people's liberties are placed in \njeopardy. No Senator should want to hand such power to the President. \nNo American should stand for it--not now, not today, not tomorrow, not \nthe day after tomorrow, not ever.\n  Just a few weeks ago, Members of the Senate took an oath, ``I do \nsolemnly swear that I will support and defend. . . .'' This is in our \noath, my oath, that I have taken several times.\n\n       I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the \n     Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \n     foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and \n     allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, \n     without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and \n     that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the \n     office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.\n\n  That is the oath I take: ``So help me God.''\n  If our Republican colleagues want to stop the Senate's efforts to end \nthe scandals that plagued the last Congress, that is their right. If \nour Republican colleagues want to stop the first increase in the \nminimum wage in the past decade, that is their right. But I, this \nmountain boy from the hills, will not stand with them. And the American \npeople will see through this transparent effort to gut ethics reform.\n\n  I, as one Senator with others, if they will stand with me, will do my \nvery best to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. \nYet I will bear true faith and allegiance to this Constitution and to \nthe people of this great Nation, defying an effort to weaken the power \nof the purse.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will speak briefly on the second look at \nwaste amendment which I have offered which has generated a fair amount \nof interest and discussion in this Senate. It is an amendment that \nessentially is an enhanced rescission amendment. It is not a line-item \nveto.\n  I am a great admirer of the Senator from West Virginia. I have \nenjoyed serving in the Senate and being educated by him on all sorts of \nissues. I respect his view on the importance of the power of the purse \nand identify with it. That is the essence of the legislative branch's \nsource of power. But I must respectfully disagree with his \ncharacterization of this amendment, and I believe I can defend that \nposition effectively and respond to the points he has made and make it \nclear to our colleagues that we are not voting on line-item veto.\n  Back in 1995, a line-item veto was given to the President. It was \nruled unconstitutional. This amendment is not that proposal or anything \nsimilar to that proposal.\n  I said earlier today, to compare this amendment to the line-item veto \namendment is akin to comparing the New England Patriots to the Buffalo \nBills. They may be in the same league, but they have no identity of \nability or purpose, as far as I could tell.\n  The enhanced rescission language which I have proposed--which is \nessentially second-look-at-waste language--the purpose of it is to give \nthe Congress another look at provisions that may have been buried in a \nbill and which the executive branch thinks need a second look.\n  The enhanced rescission language which I have proposed essentially \ntracks the proposal that was put forward by, at that time, Senator \nDaschle as their alternative to the line-item veto. It has the same \nessential purposes, except it is weaker, quite honestly, than what \nSenator Daschle proposed. It allows the President to send up a group of \nrescissions, in our case four. Under the Daschle proposal, he could \nhave sent up as many as 13 different packages.\n  Those rescissions, if a Member introduces them, must be voted on in a \ntimeframe; the same thing as the Daschle proposal was. Those \nrescissions, under the Daschle proposal, were not referred to committee \nbut under our proposal do go back to committees of authorization--a \nweaker proposal than the Daschle proposal.\n  Both Houses must act on the rescissions, not just one House, for the \nrescissions to survive, and they must be acted on with a majority--the \nsame thing as the Daschle proposal.\n  The President is limited in the amount of time that he can hold the \nmoney. The timeframe under the Daschle proposal was, I believe, longer \nthan under our proposal. I am not absolutely sure of that, but our \nproposal limits him to 45 days that he can hold that money, pending the \nSenate taking action.\n  There is some sunlight between the two because the Daschle proposal \nallowed motions to strike in specific instances, if there were 49 \nSenators agreeing to the motion to strike. I have said I am open to \nthat as a concept, were we to get into a process of amending the \nproposal I have proposed. But that is an element of difference.\n  But there is very little else that is different between what I am \nproposing and what Senator Daschle proposed as his rescission package. \nThis is not a line-item veto amendment. It reserves to the Congress the \nauthority to make the final call. All it gives to the President is the \nability to ask us to take another look at something. That is pretty \nreasonable in the context of what we see today because we see all these \nomnibus bills arrive at our doorstep, spending tens of millions, in \nsome instances hundreds of billions of dollars, and in those bills a \nlot of language works its way in that could be suspect, a lot of \nearmarks, a lot of things which maybe do not have majority support, but \nthe President gets this big bill. He\n\n[[Page S733]]\n\nhas to sign the whole thing or the Government shuts down or something \nelse heinous happens.\n  So it is reasonable to say: All right, let's take out those earmarks \nand send them back up and give Congress another look. It gives the \nPresident no unique authority--no unique authority--that could be \nidentified as a line-item veto. There is no supermajority which is the \nessence of a line-item veto, no capacity to go in and delete something \nfrom a bill which is the essence of a line-item veto. It simply gives \nhim the capacity to say to Congress, four times: Take a look. See if \nthese rescissions make sense.\n  The Daschle amendment was so far from a line-item veto that the most \neffective spokesperson in opposition to line-item veto in this Senate, \nin my lifetime, and probably in anybody else's lifetime, cosponsored \nthe Daschle amendment. That was Senator Byrd.\n  So I would ask Senator Byrd to take a serious look at what I have \noffered and say: Aren't we dealing with apples and oranges? Yes, I can \nunderstand his opposition to line-item veto. That is fine. That is his \nposition. It has been well said for years. The argument of the \nimportance of protecting the power of the purse is a good one. It is \ncritical--critical. But this rescission language does not affect that. \nIt does not affect the power of the purse. It is not a line-item veto \namendment and so far from it that it basically tracks the Daschle \namendment.\n  In fact, I ask unanimous consent that the Daschle amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n    daschle (and others) amendment no. 348 (senate--march 21, 1995)\n\n      SECTION 1.

As to this amendment, on March 23, Senator Byrd rose and \nsaid: `` . . . I am 100 percent behind the substitute by Mr. Daschle, \nand I ask unanimous consent that my name may be added as a cosponsor.''\n  This amendment is essentially what I have offered as the second-look-\nat-waste amendment. In fact, I will be honest, I would be willing to \nprobably modify my amendment to basically track the Daschle amendment \nexactly. I have some differences with the Daschle amendment. I do not \nthink in some places it is constructed as well as mine because it has \n13 shots from the President. I happen to think that is a mistake. And \nit is not referred to committees, which I think is a mistake. I would \nbe willing to offer it. If that is what it takes to mute the argument \nthat this is a line-item veto amendment, then I will do that because \nthis is not a line-item veto amendment.\n  So my immense respect for the Senator from West Virginia and my very \nhigh regard for his arguments as to why he opposes the line-item veto \nremain. I continue to have enthusiasm in both those accounts for him. \nBut I have to say I think for him to characterize this amendment as a \nline-item veto amendment is incorrect. This amendment is much better \ncharacterized as being close to, in fact, the child of, the Daschle \namendment of 1995, which had broad support on the other side of the \naisle, as I have already mentioned.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold his yielding the \nfloor? I would like to ask him a few questions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gregg for his work in this \narea and for the several speeches he has given on this matter over the \nlast few days. I have found it very informative. I hope we have \nsomething worked out where we can actually get a vote on this issue. It \nis still the Senate and, generally speaking, we try to accommodate \nMembers' wishes to discuss an issue and get a vote.\n  But a little bit of history: I worked very hard, as I pointed out \nyesterday, on line-item veto legislation, and we got it done. The first \ntime it was used I was very disappointed in the way that President \nClinton used it. I thought the veto list had some serious political \nimplications and was very disappointed in that and wondered if I had \ndone the right thing. Then, of course, the Supreme Court struck it \ndown. And now we are back here.\n  Now, tell me again--where a layman can understand--why is this so-\ncalled enhanced rescission?\n  Mr. GREGG. Second look at waste.\n  Mr. LOTT. Second look at waste. I like that. I like them taking \nanother look at waste. And I like putting it\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\nagainst the deficit. In fact, I remember back in the 1970s arguing that \na President should be able to rescind funding, not spend money that \nCongress said he should spend because they had been doing it back since \nthe time of Jefferson. That led to, in 1974, the Budget Empowerment \nAct, which stopped President Nixon and subsequent Presidents from doing \nthat.\n  There is no question that we sometimes adopt bills that spend funds \nthat should not be spent or events overtake spending. I think there \nshould be some process for a President to get a reconsideration. There \nmay be better ways to use that money. But I do think we have a \nconstitutional role in that too. Once we indicate this is where we \nthink it should be spent, the overwhelming burden should be to explain \nwhy not.\n  The question to you, I say to the Senator, is this: No. 1, why is \nthis different from the line-item veto that we passed that was stricken \ndown by the Supreme Court?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, the fundamental difference from the line-item veto \nis that it does not require a supermajority to reject the idea of the \nPresident. It requires a majority of both Houses--both Houses have to \nhave a majority vote in favor of the President's position. Therefore, \neither House can strike down the President's position. So you retain--\nwe, the Congress--the power of the purse.\n  Mr. LOTT. Was there language in the Supreme Court that indicated this \nsort of thing might solve their constitutional reservations?\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding, from the constitutional lawyers \nwhom we have had look at this, that this would solve the constitutional \nissues which were raised by a line-item veto because it is not a line-\nitem veto.\n  Mr. LOTT. Why do you think it is necessary to have four bites at this \napple? I am inclined to give Presidents a chance to send up a \nrescission list. I think it should have a vote. I think it should be an \nexpedited procedure. I like the fact that if we do not spend it, he \ncannot turn around and spend it somewhere else and it goes to reduce \nthe deficit. I can even see giving him a second bite later on in the \nyear as long as it is not some of the same things a second time. And \nyou took care of that concern I had last year.\n  But why four times? We will wind up spending half the year working on \nexpedited proceedings to get a vote on rescissions, possibly.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, Mr. President, the administration asked for 10 \ntimes. The Daschle amendment had 13 times. We reduced it to 4 times, \nfor the exact point that the assistant Republican leader made, which \nwas we did not think the Congress should be able to have these issues \nwrap up our schedule.\n  Under this schedule, each rescission would be subject to 10 days \nbefore it had to be voted on. I am perfectly agreeable, should we get \nthis into a process where we can amend it, as I said earlier, to \ninclude strike language or consider that and to also include language \nwhich would take it down to fewer times. That is not a problem, as far \nas I am concerned. We settled on four, arbitrarily, to say the least.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I hear a lot of talk \nin this Chamber on both sides of the aisle about how we do worry about \ndeficits and getting spending under control and getting some further \ndisclosure or limits on earmarks. Some of that I do not even agree \nwith. But there is a lot of positioning about how we need to get some \nbetter control on spending. Wouldn't this be one way to do that? ``It \nwould sort of help me before I do it again,'' sort of thing.\n  Mr. GREGG. To answer the Senator's question, absolutely, that is what \nit would do. It, essentially, would create another mechanism where \nCongress would have a light-of-day experience on things that tend to \nget buried in these omnibus bills and may have to make a clear call as \nto whether that spending was appropriate. So, yes, it is very much an \nissue of fiscal discipline. It is very much an issue of managing \nearmarks.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we gripe about this earmark or that earmark. \nUsually it is somebody else's earmark, not our earmark. So we do \nposition on that subject. But this is one last way to make sure those \nearmarks see the light of day and are reviewed, not in a way where the \nPresident can just summarily do it but where he can do it, and we have \nto face up and vote yes or no.\n  So I thank the Senator for what he has done. He has been a great \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I am looking forward to watching him \nand the Senator from North Dakota work together. I believe we might \nactually do some good things under yours and his leadership. I wish you \nthe very best in that effort. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, here we are, the Sun has set on Thursday. It is a \nquarter to 6. The Sun officially went down at 5:13. We are like bats. \nThe Senate will soon come out from wherever we have been. I am not \nblaming anybody on either side of the aisle, but I don't know what \nhappened today. Somewhere back, I guess, about 2 o'clock all the \ncombatants went to their respective corners, and there has not been a \nblow thrown since.\n  So some people might say: Do something about it. Well, I am trying to \ndo something about it by shedding a little light on what we are not \ndoing. We have been out here marking time all afternoon.\n  I know how it works. Papers are exchanged, amendments added and \nstruck, and agreements are made. Hello, it is a quarter to 6. I had \nhigh hopes and I have high hopes that the Senate is going to find a way \nto work together and do a better job and that we work at 11 o'clock on \nWednesday morning instead of 11 o'clock at night. I know a lot of \npeople don't agree with me on this, but I don't see why it is a good \nidea to be voting at 11 o'clock on Thursday night but not on Friday \nmorning. I still think it is a really good idea to work during the \ndaylight and go home and not have a meal with a lobbyist but have a \nmeal with your family.\n  I don't know what else to do. I have called everybody involved. I \nhave been to offices. I have been stirring around, scurrying around. Is \nthere an agenda here? I don't get it. But I know what is going to \nhappen. All of a sudden, we are going to come out of our cages and we \nare going to start a whole series of votes. Well, let's get started.\n  I notice the Presiding Officer is an old House Member. There was a \nclear rule in the House, an adage that was proven right every time, and \nthat has been one of the problems with the House. More and more, the \nHouse tried to cram a week's worth of work into 2\\1/2\\ days, and they \nwould have a series of votes at 11 o'clock--outrageous--at night. Any \ntime you are in session beyond 9 o'clock, the odds are pretty good you \nare going to mess up, do something wrong and embarrass yourself.\n  So I would say to our leaders: We have an opportunity here to do a \nbetter job and to work with each other. But the last 2 days? Again, you \nmight say: Well, it is because Senator Gregg had an amendment. Well, \nwhy don't we just vote and move on? People can say: Well, we are \nworking out an agreement where we won't have a lot of votes. Well, we \nmight just as well have a lot of votes. We are standing around giving \nspeeches on something we are not even going to vote on. This is the \nkind of thing that I think leads to problems and tarnishes our image. I \nwish we could find a way to do things in a more normal way. But maybe \nthe Senate can't do that. Maybe the Senator from Maryland will help us \nfind a better way to do things as a new Member of the institution. I \nhope so.\n  I thought maybe I could draw somebody out, but I guess I was too \ngeneral. Nobody has moved. The doors are still closed. I have half a \nmind to ask unanimous consent that we complete all votes on all \namendments and all time be expired effective in the morning at 9 \no'clock, and I will see you all tomorrow. Maybe I ought to do that. \nThat would be good. Of course, I have no authority to do that, but \nsomebody ought to do it to try to get this place to function normally.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope to speak at some length about the \nline-item veto at a later time. However, for the benefit of my \ncolleagues, I want to respond to the arguments put forward today about \ntwo measures I endorsed in 1995 and 1996.\n  The Daschle amendment that I cosponsored in 1995, and the amendment I \noffered to the motion to recommit the line-item veto conference report \nin 1996, are vastly different in regard to their Constitutional \nramifications from what has been offered by Senator Gregg to the ethics \nreform bill.\n  The Gregg proposal allows the President to submit rescission \nproposals up to 365 days after he signs a bill into law. Such latitude \nwould allow the President to unilaterally veto a one-year appropriation \nby delaying its expenditure, and then submitting it for rescission \nwithin 45 days of its expiration. In contrast, the proposals I endorsed \nin 1995 and 1996 would have limited a President to submitting \nrescission proposals within 20 days of a bill being signed into law. \nThe proposals I have endorsed would have prevented the President from \nunilaterally cancelling a one-year appropriations. The Gregg amendment \ncontains no such protection.\n  The Gregg proposal also prohibits amendments to the President's \nrescission requests. In contrast, the proposals I have endorsed would \nhave allowed motions to strike. Without the right to amend, Senators \nare vulnerable to threats by any President who would target a Member's \nspending and revenue priorities and force the Senate to vote on them at \na time and in the manner decided by the President.\n  I have the greatest respect for the Senator from New Hampshire, and \nthe knowledge and expertise he brings to the Congressional budget and \nappropriations process. He is a good Senator. But I cannot endorse his \nviews with regard to the line-item veto.\n\n\n                            AMENDMENT NO. 31\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to speak on amendment No. 31, \nwhich I have offered with Senator Obama, and which, unless agreement is \nreached otherwise, will be voted on when we return to the bill in an \nattempt to finish it. We have offered this amendment to try to give \nsome teeth to the so-called revolving door statute.\n  The shortcomings of the revolving door law have been known for some \ntime. This bill already corrects two of them, and I strongly support \nthose provisions.\n  First, it increases the so-called cooling off period--that is, the \nperiod during which restrictions on the activities of former Members of \nCongress apply--from 1 year to 2 years.\n  Second, it expands the prohibition that applies to senior staff \nmembers who become lobbyists. Rather than having to refrain from \nlobbying the former employing Senator or committee, staffers turned \nlobbyists may not lobby the entire Senate during this cooling-off \nperiod.\n  These are important changes, but there is an additional reform that I \nbelieve we must adopt if the revolving door statute is to be a serious \nimpediment to improper influence peddling.\n  My amendment would prohibit former Senators not only from personally \nlobbying their former colleagues during the 2-year cooling-off period, \nbut also from engaging in lobbying activities during that period.\n  Let me talk for a minute about revolving door restrictions generally, \nand then I will discuss the need for this particular amendment. The \nrevolving door is a problem for two basic reasons. First, because of \nthe revolving door, some interests have better access to the \nlegislative process than others. Former Members and staff, or former \nexecutive branch employees, know how to work the system and get results \nfor their clients. Those who have the money to hire them have a leg up.\n  The public perceives this as an unfair process, and I agree. \nDecisions in Congress on legislation, or in regulatory agencies on \nregulations or enforcement, or in the Defense Department on huge \nGovernment contracts, should be made, to the extent possible, on the \nmerits, not based on who has the best connected lobbyist.\n  The second problem of the revolving door is it creates the \nperception--perception--that public officials are cashing in on their \npublic service, trading on their connections and their knowledge for \npersonal profit. When you see former Members or staff becoming \nlobbyists and making three or four or five times what they made in \nGovernment service to work on the same issues they worked on here, that \nraises questions for a lot of people.\n  Both sides of this coin combine to further the cynicism about how \npolicy is made in this country and who is making it. That, ultimately, \nis the biggest problem here. The public loses confidence in elected \nofficials and public servants.\n  One of the worst things we can do here is say we are addressing a \nproblem, knowing we are not getting at the core of the problem. That is \nwhat has happened with the revolving door. We have a so-called cooling-\noff period, which basically has become a ``warming-up period.'' Former \nMembers leave office and they almost immediately join these lobbying \nfirms. Both they and their employers know they cannot lobby Congress \nfor a year, but it does not matter. They can do everything short of \npicking up the phone or coming to the meeting. They can strategize \nbehind the scenes. They can give advice on who to contact, what \narguments to use, what buttons to push. They can even direct others to \nmake the contacts, and say they are doing so at the suggestion of the \nex-Senator in question, who is supposedly in the middle of this 2-year \ncooling-off period.\n  Making it a 2-year warming-up period does not do enough. We have to \nchange what is allowed during that period. Only then will the public \nbelieve we have addressed the revolving door problem.\n  The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires lobbying firms and organizations \nthat lobby to report on how much they spend not on lobbying contacts \nbut on lobbying activities. ``Lobbying activities'' is a defined term, \ncovering ``lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts, \nincluding preparation and planning activities, research and other \nbackground work that is intended, at the time it is performed, for use \nin contacts, and coordination with the lobbying activities of others.'' \nThis term I just mentioned and defined has been in use for over a \ndecade without controversy.\n  So the Feingold-Obama amendment simply prohibits former Members of \nCongress from engaging in lobbying activities for the 2 years following \ntheir congressional service. If the money spent on what the former \nMember is doing would have to be reported under the LDA, then the \nformer Member cannot do it. Adopting this amendment will show the \npublic we are serious about addressing the revolving door problem. It \nwill make a real difference, which I fear simply lengthening the \ncooling-off period will not.\n  I have heard some complain that by doing this we are going after our \nformer colleagues' ability to make a living and support their families. \nI strongly disagree with that.\n  According to a study done by Public Citizen in 2005, it is only in \nthe last decade or so that lobbying has become the profession of choice \nfor former Members of Congress. In any event, we are not talking about \na lifetime ban, just a real cooling-off period for 2 years. Members of \nCongress are highly talented, highly employable people. Surely, their \nexperience and expertise is of interest to potential employers for \nsomething other than trying to influence legislation right after they \nleave the House or the Senate.\n  There are many other kinds of work, including some that may be just \nas fulfilling, though perhaps not as rewarding financially, as \nrepresenting private interests before their former colleagues. This is \nnot a question of punishing those who serve in Congress. It is a \nquestion of Members of Congress recognizing that we are here as public \nservants, and when that service ends, we should not be allowed to turn \naround and transform it into a huge personal financial benefit.\n  If after sitting out an entire Congress--2 full years--a former \nMember wishes to come to Washington and lobby, he or she can do that. \nBut some of the issues will have changed, and so will the membership of \nthe Congress. The former Member will not have quite the same advantages \nand connections after a true 2-year cooling-off period. So even if \nthese Members do become lobbyists at that point, I think we will be \nable to tell our constituents with a\n\n[[Page S737]]\n\nstraight face that we have addressed the revolving door problem in a \nmeaningful way.\n  Let me emphasize one thing about this amendment. It does not apply to \nformer staff. The reason is simple. We let, under this, former staffers \nleave this building and become lobbyists tomorrow. They are limited in \nwhat offices they can contact, but they are allowed to lobby. So \npreventing them from engaging in lobbying activities only with respect \nto certain offices would not make sense. But for former Members, who \nare prohibited from contacting anyone in the Congress, this additional \nprohibition actually makes a lot of sense and will have a real impact.\n  The American people are looking for real results in this legislation. \nWe cannot claim to be giving them that with respect to the revolving \ndoor without this amendment. So I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nFeingold-Obama amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest to my friend \nfrom Wisconsin. I have to repeat what I said on the floor before. I may \nbe the only one--I am not sure--who has had experience with the \nrevolving door, as one who went through it. I worked in the Nixon \nadministration. The day after I walked out, I had a number of clients \nwho wanted me to lobby them at my former department. I was at the \nDepartment of Transportation, and I was the chief lobbyist. We pretend \nthat executive departments don't have lobbyists. We call them \ncongressional relations specialists or congressional liaisons, but they \nare lobbyists. And I had been lobbying the Congress on behalf of the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  In that role I got access to the Secretary's inner circle. And the \nday after I left, I was hired by people who had interests before the \nDepartment. There was no prohibition for that at that time. So I went \nto the Department of Transportation and to my old friends with whom I \nhad been working very closely for that period of time. I discovered \nvery quickly that the fact that I no longer was at the Secretary's ear, \nthe fact that I no longer had any position of influence in the \nDepartment made me a whole lot less welcome in their offices than I had \nbeen the week before. They were happy to see me. They were polite. But \nthey had other things to do. And they were happy to get me out of their \noffices and out of their hair as quickly as they could.\n  Did I have an advantage? Yes, I had the advantage of knowing the \nDepartment well enough to know where to go and not waste my time. Did I \nhave any additional clout to get these people to do something that \nwould not have been in the public interest by virtue of the fact that I \nhad been there and worked with them and knew them? Not at all. These \nwere legitimate public servants who were not about to do something \nimproper just because a friend who had worked with them asked them to \ndo it. Of course, I was not about to ask them to do anything improper \nbecause that would be a violation of my responsibility to my clients. \nBut I learned quickly that this idea of the revolving door is vastly \noverrated and overstated by some of our friends in the media.\n  I suppose we will pass the Feingold amendment. I don't suppose it \nwill make any difference. But the idea that a former Member sitting in \na board room talking to other people who are engaged in lobbying \nactivity and saying to them: Don't talk to Senator so-and-so, talk to \nSenator so-and-so because the second Senator so-and-so is the one who \nreally understands this issue. Don't waste your time with the first \none. I know him well enough to know that he really won't get your \nargument--to criminalize that kind of a statement made in a law firm or \na lobbying firm, to me, is going much too far. But we will probably \npass it. We will go forward. We will see if it survives the scrutiny \nthat it will get in conference and in conversations with the House.\n  I, once again, say that we are doing a lot of things that are in \nresponse to the media and in response to special interest groups that \ncall themselves public interest groups but raise money and pay salaries \njust as thoroughly as the special interest groups. And they have to \nhave something to do to keep their members happy. They have to have \nsomething to do to keep those dues coming in, those contributions \ncoming in. So they scare them that a U.S. Senator, who leaves and goes \nto a law firm, cannot be in the room when anybody in that law firm is \ntalking about exercising their constitutional right to petition the \nGovernment for redress of their grievances because, if the Senator is \nin that room for a 2-year period, he is somehow corrupting the entire \nprocess. I think that is silly.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would just say, in response to my \nfriend from Utah, that I don't doubt for a minute that what he has said \nis true. But to generalize from his experience I don't think makes \nsense. Our former colleagues are making millions of dollars trading on \ntheir experience. I don't think these lobbying firms are throwing away \ntheir money for nothing. And I know the public doesn't believe that, \nwhich is a very good reason to adopt this amendment. It is not silly; \nit is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S737-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I apologize to everybody for \nhaving Senators wait around. I can remember when I was in the House, \nand in the interest of coming to the Senate, I turned on the TV set. \nJim Exon from Nebraska kept suggesting the absence of a quorum. I was \nso upset not knowing what the procedure was. But I came and served with \nJim Exon--first of all, he was as big as the Presiding Officer, and he \nwas a man who was very dedicated to the Senate. But after I got here, I \nunderstood more what was happening. So I apologize for all the quorum \ncalls. A lot of people think nothing is going on, but Democrats and \nRepublicans and staff have been working so hard from last night to \ntoday to get us to this point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all amendments to the \namendment No. 3 be withdrawn and that the following be the only \namendments remaining in order to the bill or substitute amendment; that \nthe votes in relation to the amendments begin at 8:10 this evening, \nwith 2 minutes for debate equally divided between each vote; that upon \ndisposition of the above-listed amendments, the substitute amendment \nNo. 3 be agreed to as amended, the bill be read the third time, and the \nSenate vote, without any intervening action or debate, on final passage \nof the bill.\n  The amendments that I have referred to are as follows: Bennett \namendment No. 20 on grassroots lobbying; Lieberman-Collins amendment \nNo. 30; Vitter amendment No. 9 on spouses; Coburn amendment No. 51 on \ngifts and travel disclosure; Ensign-DeMint amendment on scope of \nconference; Feingold amendment No. 31 on former members lobbying; \nFeingold amendment No. 33 on gym and parking; Durbin amendment No. 77 \non providing managers copies of amendments; Obama amendment No. 41 on \nbundling; Sanders amendment No. 57 on study; Coleman-Cardin amendment \nNo. 39, as modified, on travel Web site; managers' amendment to be \nagreed to by both managers; further, that the Senate begin \nconsideration of H.R. 2, the minimum wage bill on Monday, January 22, \nat 2 p.m. and that Senator Coburn be recognized to speak following \nfinal passage following the remarks of the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, would the leader add to \nthat, after the first vote that subsequent votes be 10-minute votes?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my \nunderstanding is that when the Senate turns to minimum wage, the \nmajority leader, or his designee, will offer a substitute amendment \nthat will be fully amendable; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. True.\n  Mr. GREGG. Further, I understand the majority leader is aware that I \nhave agreed to withdraw my amendment on this bill, the lobby reform \nbill, and I will be here Monday to offer my language to the minimum \nwage bill.\n  Mr. REID. That is my understanding. The Senator absolutely has that \nright.\n  Mr. GREGG. Further reserving the right to object, I understand that \nthe majority leader will be unable to reach consent for a time \nagreement to vote on my amendment; therefore, it is likely that a \ncloture motion will be filed on my language on Monday. I expect my \nlanguage to be the first amendment to the bill.\n  Mr. REID. It may not be the first, but we have an agreement that it \nwould be following my recognition, the offering of the substitute, and \nthe minority leader, who would be recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the two leaders for their assistance in this \nprocess. I believe this is a reasonable way to bring up the amendment \nthat I have offered and to move this bill at the same time.\n  I understand that on Monday it would be the expectation that nobody \nwill be complaining that I have it on the wrong vehicle.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Republican leader says anything, \nI will be brief. We have been able, if this agreement is reached, to \naccomplish what the distinguished Republican leader and I intended to \ndo this week. As a result of that and an agreement to go forward on the \nminimum wage, there will be no votes tomorrow or Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, to reiterate what the majority leader \nindicated, as a result of this agreement, which did take a while--and I \nknow some of our colleagues wondered if we were ever going to get \nthere--we will complete the bill tonight, and we will have no votes \ntomorrow or Monday.\n  This was a successful example of good negotiation--although it took a \nwhile--for a favorable result.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has the agreement been accepted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in that we are not voting until 8:10, I will \nsay a few words. Let me say this. This legislation has been extremely \ndifficult to deal with. It is difficult because it directly affects our \nlives, Members of the Senate. In the short term, this is going\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\nto be difficult because we are going to have to get used to the \nprovisions in this piece of legislation. But in the long term, we will \nall be thankful these steps have been taken. This legislation will \nremove even the appearance of impropriety from the work done in this \nChamber.\n  This is not a time for declaring victory. Legislation is the art of \ncompromise, the art of consensus building. There has been a victor in \nall of this when this matter is completed and that is the American \npeople. I am not a victor, I am not a loser. Senator McConnell is not a \nvictor or a loser. We have worked through this in the way that \nlegislators should work through difficult pieces of legislation. I \nbelieve last November Americans, through their votes, asked us to make \nGovernment honest. We have done that. We are going to give them what I \nbelieve is a Government they deserve.\n  I am satisfied that this debate has been good for this body. Now we \nare going to move forward, recognizing the last 24 hours has not been \neasy legislatively. As Senator Durbin said last night, it was a bump in \nthe road. It was a real bump and people should have had their seatbelts \non because it was a difficult bump. But I believe last night there were \npeople looking for an excuse to not move this bill forward. Let me say, \nunderlying and underscoring this, as I said last night--and I will say \nit again--Senator Judd Gregg, the senior Senator from New Hampshire, is \na person who has tremendously strong principles. He believes in this \nlegislation. I believe just as strongly that it is wrong. But he \nbelieves it is right. I admire and respect him for doing that, just as \nhis partner on the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, is a person of \nprinciple. They have worked on this issue and other issues together, as \nlegislators should work together. I so much respect the way they work \ntogether. They disagree on a number of different issues, but they do it \nin a way that I think brings dignity to this body.\n\n  I, also, wish to say one thing about my friend, Senator Russ \nFeingold. He has been a pioneer on a number of different legislative \nissues. He fought tooth and nail with my friend, the Republican leader, \non campaign finance reform. It was a debate that went on for a number \nof years in this body. Senator Feingold is a person who has talked \nabout ethics since he came to the Senate. There are a lot of people \nresponsible for this legislation, but there is no one more responsible \nthan the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  He has been a pioneer, and he has not let up from the time he came to \nthe Senate to today in moving forward on what he believes is good for \nthis body politic. With rare exception, I agree with him. He is my \nfriend. He is a person for whom I have great admiration based on his, \nif nothing else--and there is plenty more--being a Rhodes Scholar, a \nHarvard graduate with honors, a man who was a dignified and successful \nlawyer before he came to the Senate. He has shown he is a good \nlegislator. So I have great respect for him.\n  In the past, I called this legislation the toughest reform since \nWatergate. That is an understatement. This is the toughest reform bill \nin the history of this body as it relates to ethics and lawmaking. So \neveryone tonight, when they vote on this bill, should vote proudly. \nWhat is going to happen soon is historic: requiring new lobbying \ndisclosure, banning all gifts, reforming earmarks, requiring Senators \nto pay charter rates on corporate jets. We will restore the confidence \nof our citizenry in the Government.\n  I so appreciate the work that has been done on this legislation. I \nappreciate the work of my friend, the Republican leader. We have had \ndisagreements on this legislation, but we have an agreement in \nprinciple as to what this body is all about. I look forward to working \ntogether on more bipartisan legislation. This is bipartisan legislation \nsponsored by the Democratic leader and the Republican leader of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the majority \nleader, I couldn't agree more. This is a classic example of \nbipartisanship in the Senate at its very best. We had good bipartisan \nsupport last year when we passed a similar bill 90 to 8. This year, I \nthink we are going to finish the job.\n  I particularly wish to recognize, on this side of the aisle, the \nextraordinary work of Senator Gregg in achieving his goal on the next \nbill up to get an important vote that is important not only to him but \nto many Members on our side of the aisle.\n  I extend my congratulations to my good friend, Bob Bennett, the \nranking member on our side, who has been involved on this from \nbeginning to end and has done an extraordinary job of managing a very \ncomplex and difficult bill; to Senator Susan Collins, who has been a \nleader on the Collins-Lieberman amendment on which we will be voting \nshortly; to Senator Vitter, Senator Coburn, Senator DeMint, who have \nbeen extremely active on this bill, and each of them has an imprint on \nthis final passage measure that we will be dealing with shortly.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate all Senators for an extraordinary \naccomplishment, under very difficult circumstances on a broad, \nbipartisan basis. The patience that was exhibited to allow us to get to \nthis point, I remind everyone, is what produced an opportunity to have \nno votes tomorrow and no votes on Monday. I think this was worth the \nwait.\n  I congratulate the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I failed to acknowledge the managers of this \nbill. I apologize to both of them. They have been masterful in working \nthis bill the last 2 weeks. The two managers are going to be involved \nheavily in getting this through conference. I have so much respect for \nboth of them. They are outstanding Senators.\n  I repeat, I am so sorry I didn't acknowledge them. I should have done \nthat in the beginning because they have done more than anybody else in \nmoving this bill forward. They worked as partners moving this bill \nforward. It has been a difficult partnership because of the different \nthoughts on different sides of the aisle as to what is good and bad. \nThey have been able to be dignified in what they have done. I \nappreciate it.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Bennett amendment \nNo. 20.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. BENNETT. How is the time allocated between now and the scheduled \nvotes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time is allocated. The Senator may speak.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Do I understand, Mr. President, that the votes are not \nlocked in for 8:10 p.m.?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the voting begins at \n8:10 p.m.\n  Mr. BENNETT. So the time between now and 8:10 p.m. is not allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to be fair to whoever opposes my \namendment to allow time for them to do that, but I would like to speak \nbriefly in favor of my amendment.\n  My amendment is called the grassroots lobbying amendment. I have \ndiscussed it and its virtues at some length previously during the \nperiod of debate, but I remind everyone what this is all about.\n  This has to do with the regulations and reporting requirements placed \non organizations that stimulate people to contact their Members of \nCongress. These organizations can be, and many times are, outside of \nWashington, DC. They can, and many times do, carry on their work \nwithout ever contacting a Member of Congress directly or participating \nin any of the activities we normally think of as lobbying. And yet, if \nan organization or an individual were to stimulate neighbors, Members \nof a fraternal organization, their bowling club--whatever it is--to try \nto get them active in the process of petitioning the Government, they \nrun the risk of not registering properly because under the underlying \nbill, they are defined as lobbyists, and if they fail to fill out their \nforms properly, if they fail to register properly, they are subject to \na $200,000 fine.\n  The ACLU has said--in my opinion accurately--that this would have a\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\nchilling effect on all of these kinds of activities. People on the \nright side, the National Right to Life, have said this would have a \nchilling effect on everything we do.\n  I know there has been talk about astroturf lobbyists and astroturf \ncampaigns. I am certainly competent to know when an astroturf phony \ncampaign has been mounted. The letters and the postcards come into the \noffice, and it is very transparent they are not genuine and real. I do \nnot need to be protected from my constituents by the language in the \nunderlying bill.\n  My amendment is very simple. It simply strikes the grassroots \nprovision.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to support amendment No. 20 \noffered by my colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett. This amendment \nwould strike section 220, the grassroots reporting provision, from the \nbill.\n  Yesterday, during my statement on the need for comprehensive lobbying \nand ethics reform, I discussed the importance of an informed citizenry \nand how it is essential to a thriving democracy. A democratic \ngovernment operates best in the disinfecting light of the public eye. \nWith this bill, we have an opportunity to balance the right of the \npublic to know with its right to petition government; the ability of \nlobbyists' to advocate their clients' causes with the need for truthful \npublic discourse; and the ability of Members to legislate with the \nimperative that our government must be free from corrupting influences, \nboth real and perceived. We must act now to ensure that the erosion we \nsee today in the public's confidence in Congress does not become a \ncollapse of confidence.\n  We have an obligation to address this crisis of confidence, but we \nalso have an obligation to ensure that we do so in a thoughtful, \nreasoned, and constitutional manner. It is imperative that we be \nmindful of the rights of American citizens to freely contact their \npublic officials and take part in the political process. After careful \nconsideration, and much input from groups representing all parts of the \npolitical spectrum, it has become evident to me that section 220 of the \nunderlying bill could seriously impact legitimate communications \nbetween public interest organizations and their members. That is why I \nwill support the efforts of my colleague from Utah to strike section \n220 from the bill.\n  It is my understanding that, under this provision, small \norganizations--many with no representation in Washington--would have to \nregister as grassroots lobbying firms. These groups would then have to \ncomply with onerous quarterly reporting requirements or face fines and \ncriminal penalties. I do not think it was the intention of the \nproponents of this provision to restrict the ability of groups to \ncommunicate with their membership, but I have concluded that this could \nvery well be the outcome.\n  The approach taken in the underlying bill is one of greater \ndisclosure of and transparency into the interactions of lobbyists with \nour public officials. More transparency and disclosure of professional \nlobbyists' activities can only lead to better government. \nUnfortunately, section 220 simply goes too far, and I fear that the \nunintended consequences would negatively impact the legitimate, \nconstitutionally protected activities of small citizen groups and their \nmembers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nBennett which would strike the grassroots lobbying provision in S. 1.\n  Several years ago, I, along with several colleagues, undertook the \ntask of strengthening reporting requirements for lobbyists. This \nculminated in the passage of the Lobbying Disclosure Act which broke \nnew ground by allowing sunlight into the activities of lobbyists in \nWashington. It finally required meaningful disclosure of the billions \nof dollars spent on lobbying Members of Congress.\n  While great progress was made, there was a major loophole left open \nwhich needs to be closed. Under current law, lobbyists are permitted to \nexclude the cost of their efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying when \nthey report under the LDA. We recognized this problem in 1996 but were \nnot successful in efforts to address it. However, I continue to believe \nthat lobbyists who engage in this so-called ``Astroturf'' lobbying \nshould also be required to disclose their spending.\n  The Wall Street Journal examined this issue when we last reviewed \nthis and reported that an estimated $790 million was spent on this type \nof grassroots lobbying in a 2-year period alone. Accounting for the \ngrowth in the lobbying industry that we have seen over the last decade, \nthis number is surely over a billion by now.\n  What sort of activities does money spent on ``Astroturf'' lobbying \nefforts pay for? It is spent on phone banks, telephone patch-throughs \nto Members, and even professional campaign organizers who are paid to \ngo to key congressional districts to organize letter-writing campaigns. \nThese are coordinated efforts costing tens of thousands of dollars \nwhich on their face are part of professional lobbying efforts.\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Lieberman last year to craft a \nprovision during the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee's consideration of the lobbying bill that would close this \nloophole by requiring disclosure of ``paid efforts to stimulate \ngrassroots lobbying.'' It requires disclosure by paid lobbyists and \nlobbying firms who stimulate the grassroots to take action. We even \nwent so far as to define pure grassroots lobbying and exclude it from \nthis provision.\n  The Lieberman-Levin provision that was included in S. 1 simply \nrequires disclosure. This provision does not in any way ``restrain'' or \n``regulate'' paid efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying. All that it \ndoes is require paid lobbyists to disclose how much they are spending \non their grassroots lobbying efforts. This disclosure would be no more \nburdensome than the disclosure already required by the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act for direct lobbying: Amounts spent for efforts to \nstimulate grassroots lobbying, like amounts spent on direct lobbying, \nwould be disclosed only in the form of good-faith estimates, which \nwould be rounded to the nearest $20,000.\n  In addition, the provision, like the Lobbying Disclosure Act, \nrecognizes that certain organizations are already required to track \nlobbying expenses, and grassroots lobbying expenses, for IRS purposes. \nThe provision allows these organizations to use their IRS numbers for \ndisclosure purposes, ensuring that they do not have to account twice by \ndifferent rules.\n  This section was carefully crafted to exclude certain activities that \nare not part of this Astroturf lobbying industry. Efforts by an \norganization to communicate with its own members, employees, officers, \nor shareholders are expressly excluded. Organizations that exist solely \nto lobby Congress but do not employ paid lobbyists do not have to \nreport. Finally, any grassroots lobbying efforts targeted at less than \n500 people do not have to be reported.\n  I would also like to clarify just who is required to disclose as a \nlobbyist under this provision, as there seems to be confusion over this \npoint. Paragraph (b) of section 220 clearly states that individuals who \nare not registered lobbyists now would not have to register as a \nlobbyist under this provision so long as their expenditures are only \ndirected at grassroots lobbying. This provision is intended to shed \nlight on the dollars being spent by lobbyists. It in no way affects \nindividuals who want to call or write their Member of Congress.\n  For the past decade, we have allowed lobbyists to exclude the cost of \ntheir organized grassroots lobbying campaigns, even while they are \nreporting their other lobbying expenses. It is time to put an end to \nthis arbitrary exclusion because the public has a right to know who is \npaying how much to whom in an effort to influence our decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Bennett amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 8:10 p.m. having arrived, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the Bennett amendment No. 20.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, before I propound a unanimous consent \nrequest, I would very much like to\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\nthank both leaders. I know this has been a difficult day. I think it \nhas worked out, and I think that is to the good. I hope everyone else \nwho has waited hour after hour understands that the leadership was in \nnegotiations and there is a product of those negotiations.\n  I, also, thank the ranking member with whom it has been a great \npleasure for me to work. Members should know that we are new. Members \nshould know that our staffs are new to the committee and that this is \ntheir first bill on the floor. I believe they have done an excellent \njob, both on the Democratic side and on the Republican side. It is a \nkind of baptism of fire, if you will. I say thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nher kind words. I echo her laudatory comments about the staffs on both \nsides. This is a baptism of fire for all of us, for my staff and her \nstaff as well, and they have had enough background that they know how \nto swim.\n  We are very grateful for the cooperation we have received and the \nsupport that has come from the staff. I look forward to a productive \nCongress, working with Senator Feinstein on the Rules Committee on all \nof the other matters that will come before us.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 98\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, in a moment, the Senate will adopt the \nEnsign-McCain-DeMint amendment related to scope of conference. I want \nto thank Senator McCain and Senator DeMint for working with me on this \namendment.\n  I also want to explain why this amendment is such an important \nimprovement over the underlying bill. Under the Constitution, the \nlegislative branch controls the purse strings. That is a significant \nauthority given to Congress. Congress must use that authority wisely. \nAs I explained earlier today on the floor, too often conferees insert \nearmarks in conference reports that were not funded in either bill \npassed by the House or the Senate.\n  In a democracy such as ours, Congress should do its business in the \nfull light of day. The entire Senate should consider, debate, and amend \nlegislation in full view of the American public. We should scrutinize \nhow Federal dollars are spent. Each project Congress funds should be \ndebated and considered by Congress. We must do a better job of \noversight. We must ensure that the taxpayers' dollars are being spent \nwisely. But when we insert projects in a conference report, without \ndebate and without oversight, we fail to live up to our \nresponsibilities as Senators.\n  What the Ensign-McCain-DeMint amendment would do is fix what has \nbecome a broken process. My amendment makes clear that a point of order \ncan be raised against any funding, no matter how specific, for any \nprogram, project, or account that was not originally funded in either \nbill sent to conference. This is a simple but critical change. It will \nimprove how Congress operates, and it will make the Government more \naccountable to the American people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the underlying substitute does include two \nprovisions that are intended to address the out-of-control earmarking \nand porkbarrel spending of the past years. And, the adoption of the \nDeMint and Durbin amendments earlier this week have improved upon the \nunderlying bill to ensure that all earmarks are disclosed--including \nthose to Federal entities, as well as all that are included in \nstatements of managers and conference reports. A number of us supported \na similar proposal last year, and I am pleased that the effort was \nfinally successful.\n  I am now pleased that additional improvements will be adopted with \nrespect to section 1 of the underlying bill concerning out of scope \nmatters in conference reports. The amendment sponsored by Senators \nEnsign, DeMint, and myself, which I understand is agreeable on both \nsides, would ensure that points of order can be raised against specific \nitems in conference reports. It would add a definition of any matter so \nthat members are empowered to remove out of scope earmarks and policy \nriders from conference reports without taking down the entire \nconference report. And, importantly, it would ensure that funding \nassociated with any provision stricken from a conference report is \nreduced from the total amount appropriated--a critical requirement \nmissing from the underlying measure.\n  For example, if a conference report provides $10 million for bridge \nimprovements, but then adds a directive that $5 million of that funding \nshould be directed to a specific bridge in a specific place--a \ndirective that was not included in either the House or Senate bill, our \namendment would ensure the $5 million that accompanies that out of \nscope earmark is also removed from the total allocation of the bill. So \nthat the total appropriated would be $5 million, not $10 million. This \nis about fiscal restraint, Mr. President. It makes little sense to \nraise a point of order that is sustained against an out of scope \nearmark, but to appropriate the funding regardless.\n  While I support the improvements proposed and accepted so far, \nearmark reform still needs to go much further. We need to curtail \nearmarks, not just disclose them. The process is clearly broken when \neach year Congress continues to earmark billions and billions of \ntaxpayer dollars, sometimes with virtually no information about the \nspecifics of those earmarks. The scandal that came to light during the \nlast Congress that involved earmarking by a former House member--now in \nprison--is a pox not just on him, but on each of us and the process \nthat we have allowed to occur on our watch. The American public, Mr. \nPresident, deserves better. That is what this amendment is about.\n  The growth in earmarked funding in appropriations bills during the \npast 12 years has been staggering. According to data gathered by CRS, \nthere were 4,126 earmarks in 1994. In 2005, there were 15,877--an \nincrease of nearly 400 percent. There was a little good news in 2006, \nsolely due to the fact that the Labor-HHS appropriations bill was \napproved almost entirely free of earmarks--an amazing feat given that \nthere were over 3,000 earmarks the prior year for just that bill. \nDespite this first reduction in 12 years, it doesn't change the fact \nthat the largest number of earmarks in history have still occurred in \nthe last three years--2004, 2005, and 2006.\n  Now, let's consider the level of funding associated with those \nearmarks. The amount of earmarked funding increased from $23.2 billion \nin 1994 to $64 billion in fiscal year 2006. Remarkably, it rose by 34 \npercent from 2005 to 2006, even though the number of earmarks \ndecreased. Earmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000, and more \nthan tripled in the last 10 years. This is wrong and disgraceful and we \nurgently need to curtail this seemingly out of control pork barreling \npractice that has become the norm around here.\n  I filed an amendment designed to curtail earmarking. I was pleased to \nbe joined by Senators Feingold and Graham in introducing amendment No. \n29. Unfortunately, it is clear that we will not be given an opportunity \nto vote on that amendment and I find myself in the same position as I \nwas in last March during debate on lobbying reform when I was not \nallowed a vote on my amendment. But one day soon, I am confident we \nwill fundamentally change business as usual with respect to pork barrel \nspending. The American public has a powerful voice, and I would have \nthought more of us would have heard that voice last November. But I do \nwant to state my recognition that at least some improvements have been \nmade to require full disclosure of all earmarks and to prevent out of \nscope matters in conference. And, I believe the Ensign, McCain, DeMint \namendment makes further improvements.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 41\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss the \namendment I introduced with Senator Feingold to require that lobbyists \ndisclose the contributions that they bundle for campaigns. I am \ngrateful to the leadership for accepting the amendment and believe it \nstrengthens an already very strong bill.\n  Neither I nor any of my colleagues enjoy the amount of money that \nrunning for office requires us to raise and spend. And I realize that \nhaving influential people help a campaign by asking their friends for \ncontributions makes that task a little easier. And so I appreciate how \ndifficult it can be for us to legislate our own behavior in this area.\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\n  But lobbyists who bundle contributions have a personal stake in the \noutcome of specific legislation before Congress. And because of that \nnexus, lobbyists should have to report who they are raising money for \nand the amounts that they are raising--including the contributions that \nthey collect for campaigns from their networks of friends and \ncolleagues.\n  The legislation before us today is meant to shine a bright light on \nhow lobbyists influence the legislative process. Influence is not just \nabout free meals or gifts or travel but about the millions upon \nmillions of dollars raised to get us elected every few years. We should \nnot keep the biggest role lobbyists play in that process hidden.\n  We all know that with strict campaign contribution limits, an \nimportant sign of a lobbyist's influence is not only how much money he \ngives but also how much he raises from friends and associates. During \nthe last Presidential campaign, both candidates made great use of \nbundling.\n  For instance, the Bush Rangers each raised over $200,000; the Bush \nPioneers each raised over $100,000. The Kerry campaign also relied on \n``vice chairs'' who raised at least $100,000.\n  According to a USA Today story in 2003: ``Motives for becoming a \nbundler include the possibility of increased influence on government \npolicy and consideration for appointment to ambassadorships and other \ngovernment posts.''\n  And so if we believe that lobbyists should have to disclose campaign \ncontributions, then they should certainly have to disclose the bundling \nthey engage in so that the public knows the relationship between \nmembers, their views on policy, and the industries that support them.\n  Right now, this relationship is largely hidden from public view. So \nto correct this gap in the underlying bill, my amendment would require \nquarterly reporting of all contributions that a lobbyist collected or \narranged that total more than $200 in a calendar year. This includes \nnot only campaign contributions, but also contributions to Presidential \nlibraries, inaugural committees, and lawmakers' charities.\n  The amendment has the support of all the major reform advocacy \norganizations, as well as congressional scholar Norm Ornstein and \nThomas Susman, the chair of the Ethics Committee for the American \nLeague of Lobbyists.\n  According to Norm Ornstein: ``What is needed is disclosure here--who \nis doing the bundling, for whom, and how much. These are simple but \ncritical steps for openness in the lobbying and money relationship. The \npublic deserves to know--and this amendment gives them that \nopportunity.''\n  And in Professor Susman's words: ``Full disclosure of these \nactivities, including the `bundling' of campaign contributions for a \ncandidate, will not burden or inhibit lobbyists. Lobbyists are proud of \nthe role that we play in helping to finance federal campaigns, and we \nwill be just as effective if the public knows about that role as well. \nSenator Obama's amendment is a reasonable way to keep these activities \nout in the open.''\n  Under the amendment that Senator Feingold and I are offering, \ncontributions are considered to be collected by a lobbyist if they are \nreceived by the lobbyist and forwarded to the campaign. Contributions \nare considered to be arranged by a lobbyist if there is an arrangement \nor understanding between the lobbyist and a campaign that the lobbyist \nwill receive some kind of credit or recognition for having raised the \nmoney.\n  In discussing this proposal that I am offering, a Washington Post \neditorial this week said: ``No single change would add more to public \nunderstanding of how money really operates in Washington.''\n  This is an important addition to the bill we are considering, and I \nthank my colleagues for accepting it.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 9, 98, 51, 31, 33, 77, 41, 57, and 39, as Modified, En \n                                  Bloc\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, utilizing a moment in opposition to the \namendment of my friend from Utah, Mr. Bennett, if the section on \ngrassroots lobbying in the bill were as Senator Bennett described it \nand as other groups on the outside have described it, I would oppose \nit.\n  This provision was in the overall lobbying bill that passed the \nSenate 90 to 8 last year. It is a natural extension of what the entire \nbill is doing, which is asking for disclosure from professional \nlobbying.\n  Billions of dollars are spent on so-called grassroots lobbying. It is \ntotally legal, but let's get it out into the sunshine. The individual \ngroups writing to Members to lobby us do not have to disclose anything. \nThis only requires disclosure if a group retains a professional \nlobbyist and only if they pay that lobbyist more than $25,000 a \nquarter.\n  This is not amateur citizen lobbying. This is to find out who is \ngetting how much money to influence us. It is not, in any sense, a \nlimitation on the revered first amendment right to petition Congress \nfor a redress of grievances. It is an attempt for disclosure consistent \nwith the entire bill. So I ask my colleagues respectfully to leave this \ncritical provision in this progressive reform bill.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the amendment \noffered by Senator Bennett. This is a very rare instance where I \ndisagree with my colleague and good friend from Connecticut. I simply \ndon't want to discourage any effort to increase citizen participation \nin Government. Too many citizens are convinced that their voices don't \ncount. They become apathetic about their Government. They become \nconvinced they cannot influence our positions. I think activity that \nencourages citizens to contact us, to participate in the process, \nshould be encouraged, not discouraged, and I believe the language in \nthe bill could well discourage citizen contact with Members of \nCongress. So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 99\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

The pending amendment is the Lieberman-Collins \namendment.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 30\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there have been a variety of proposals \nfor what has been called an Office of Public Integrity. The Senate \nvoted 67 to 30 against one such proposal last year. Last time, Senators \nJohnson and Voinovich, the chairs of the Ethics Committee, stood in \nopposition. This time, the new chairs of the Ethics Committee, Senators \nBoxer and Cornyn, stand in opposition.\n  I recognize the strong interest in\nthis issue, especially by Senators\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\nLieberman, Collins, Obama, Feingold, McCain, and others. I have spoken \nwith Senator Obama about it. I have assured him that we would hold a \nhearing in the Rules Committee and that we would take a look at this \nproposal and what might or might not be done.\n  I will vote against this amendment, and I will see that the Rules \nCommittee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nhold these hearings. They will focus on these proposals and ways of \nstrengthening ethics enforcement in the Senate.\n  Let me say this now. I do believe we need to take great care in how \nwe do this. Yes, we need to reassure the public that those who run \nafoul of the Senate rules will be held accountable. But we must make \nsure this does not simply become a new tool used by political opponents \nwho would seek to manipulate the political process by filing false \nclaims. You can be sure that the minute a claim becomes public, without \nany verification as to its veracity, and is released to the public, \nthat claim will be a 30-second spot in someone's campaign. That is not \nwhat we are about.\n  We have to also ensure that we do not create an office--with a \nspecial prosecutor bound and determined to justify his or her existence \nby creating an atmosphere of ongoing investigation--that will cost \ntaxpayers millions of dollars. The Constitution provides:\n\n       Each House of Congress may determine the Rules of its \n     Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, \n     with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\n\n  Our Founders knew the importance of this and placed it in article I.\n  The challenge we face right now is how to do it right and ensure that \nthe tough ethics rules we are putting in place will be vigorously \noverseen and enforced.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \ncreate an Office of Public Integrity.\n  This underlying bill is a very good one. It will help to restore \npublic confidence in the integrity of our decisions. But we leave the \njob undone if we do not create an Office of Public Integrity. I thank \nthe leaders on both sides of the aisle for allowing the Senate to have \na vote on this important issue.\n  The problem is that the current system is inherently conflicted. We \nare our own advisers, we are our own investigators, we are our own \nprosecutors, we are our own judges, and we are our own jurors. This \namendment would take only the investigative part of the process and \ninvest it in an independent, impartial Office of Public Integrity that \nwould help restore the public's confidence in the integrity of our \nethics system.\n  I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, there is not much to add to my \ncolleague from Maine. I thank her for her statement.\n  Basically, we have a very strong reform of the rules by which we \ngovern our ethics and that of those who lobby before us. What is \nmissing is an equal reform of the process which would do that.\n  Nothing in this amendment alters the superior role of the Senate \nEthics Committee pursuant to the Constitution to make final decisions \non claims before it. This amendment simply sets up an independent \ninvestigative office. Incidentally, it is merely responding to what my \nfriend from California, Senator Feinstein, said. There is actually more \nprotection against abuse of this process with frivolous complaints than \nthere is in the current system.\n  I have a feeling this will not pass tonight, but our committee is \ngoing to take it up and hopefully report out a bill independently later \nthis session.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The substitute amendment, as amended, is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have been privileged to serve as a \nlegislator--first in the Maryland House of Delegates, then in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, and now in the Senate. I appreciate the trust \nthat the people of Maryland placed in me. And I appreciate how \nimportant it is that we adhere to the strictest ethical standards. The \nAmerican people need to believe their Government is on the up and up.\n  I served on the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct from \n1991 to 1997. I served as the ranking member of the adjudicative \nsubcommittee that investigated and ultimately recommended sanctions \nagainst former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In 1997, the House \nleadership appointed me to serve as the cochairman of the House Ethics \nReform Task Force, with my colleague Bob Livingston from Louisiana. Our \nbipartisan task force came up with a comprehensive set of reforms to \noverhaul the ethics process. We created a bipartisan package to change \nHouse and committee rules. This was the last bipartisan effort in the \nHouse to fix ethics procedures. Unfortunately, the ethics process in \nthe House broke down after that.\n  Here in the Senate, there has been more bipartisan cooperation when \nit comes to ethics reform. Last year, the Senate voted 90 to 8 to \napprove a reform bill. And we are getting off to a good start this \nyear, with both the Democratic leader and the Republican leader co-\nsponsoring both S. 1 and the substitute amendment. Members on both \nsides of the aisle have been given ample opportunity to offer \namendments and have them considered.\n  As amended, S. 1 represents a significant change in the way elected \nofficials, senior staff, and lobbyists would do business--change the \nAmerican people are demanding.\n  When it comes to how we treat ourselves, this legislation revokes the \npensions of Members convicted of bribing public officials and \nwitnesses, perjury, and other crimes. S. 1 bans gifts and meals from \nlobbyists. It slows down the revolving door by extending lobbying bans \nfor former Members and staff. It eliminates floor privileges for former \nMembers who become lobbyists. And it stops partisan attempts, such as \nthe K Street Project to influence private-sector hiring. The bill makes \nethics training mandatory for Members and staff.\n  When it comes to making how Congress works more transparent, this \nlegislation shines a spotlight on earmarks, targeted tax breaks, and \ntariff reduction bills, to make it clear who is\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\noffering them, and on whose behalf. S. 1 ensures that the minority will \nget to participate in conference committees, and that conference \nreports can't be changed after they're signed by a majority of the \nconferees. The bill requires that conference reports have to be posted \non the Internet 48 hours prior to consideration so that Members of \nCongress, staff, and the public can find out what's in them.\n  When it comes to how lobbyists are to act, this legislation puts an \nend to the lavish parties they throw in our honor at the national \nconventions. S. 1 quadruples the penalty for failure to comply with the \nrequirements of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. It requires \nlobbyists to file quarterly reports instead of semi-annually. And it \ndirects the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of \nRepresentatives to maintain on the Internet a publicly available \ndatabase of lobbying disclosure information.\n  I am pleased to report that the bill contains an amendment that \nSenator Coleman from Minnesota and I offered to require the Secretary \nof the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives to \nestablish a website freely available to the public that will contain \neasy-to-understand information on all officially related congressional \ntravel subject to disclosure under the gift rules.\n  During the debate on S. 1, we have heard over and over again former \nSupreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis' famous dictum, ``Sunlight is said \nto be the best of disinfectants,'' because it is so true. That is the \ndirection we are moving in by passing this bill. That is what the \nAmerican people want us to do, and that is what we need to do to regain \ntheir trust.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, as allegations of ethical abuses swirl \naround their government, the American people have understandably lost \nconfidence in the ability of their elected representatives to lead with \nintegrity. Their confidence has dwindled as the undue influence of \nlobbyists and special interests has permeated their government. They \nhave lost faith not only in their elected leaders, but also in the \ninstitutions that stand as the very pillars of our representative \ndemocracy. With their trust waning, Americans spoke at the ballot box \nlast November, admonishing their elected leaders and declaring that \nthey would no longer tolerate the exploitation of their government by \nthose who wield excessive influence.\n  For this reason, I was gratified to see the House of Representatives \nmove so quickly on ethics and lobby reform when the 110th Congress \nconvened, and I was pleased when Majority Leader Reid placed ethics and \nlobby reform at the top of the Senate agenda. Both the Legislative \nTransparency and Accountability Act of 2007 and the Lobbying \nTransparency and Accountability Act of 2007 enact long overdue ethics \nand lobbying reforms that will hold our elected officials to the \nhighest possible standards.\n  If we are going to restore the American public's trust in their \ngovernment, any reform we enact must squarely confront the undue \ninfluence that special interests and lobbyists exert on the legislative \nprocess. It must strengthen the rules that govern lobbying and close \nthe revolving door between the ``K Street'' lobby firms and the \nCapitol. It must shine a light on what has until now been a legislative \nprocess corrupted by backroom promises and deals struck in the dead of \nnight. It must promulgate new rules that curb wasteful spending by \ncreating greater transparency in the earmark process.\n  Earning back the confidence and trust of the American people will \nrequire greater transparency and stronger laws. The American public \ndeserves to be certain that their elected officials are not being \nswayed by lavish gifts offered as quid pro quo for promoting special \nagendas. To that end, gifts from registered lobbyists have no place in \nour legislative process. For that reason, I support the sweeping ban on \nlobbyist-paid gifts in the Senate bill. This ban includes not just \nmeals but also gifts of travel and lodging, areas that have been the \nsubject of notorious abuse.\n  Our commitment to a new era of openness must go hand in hand with a \nsimilar commitment on the part of lobbyists. We must demand more \ndisclosure from lobbyists about their practices and increase the \npenalties for their failure to disclose their activities. To be clear, \nour Constitution protects the right of Americans to petition their \ngovernment. However, what it does not do is protect their ability to \nhire lobbyists to buy influence by showering elected officials with \nexpensive gifts and vacations.\n  Reining in wasteful spending must also be a part of any ethical \nreform we enact. Specifically, we must bring reform and accountability \nto the process of earmarking. Although the term ``earmark'' has taken \non a negative connotation, the designation of funds for individual \nprojects or programs is not in and of itself devious. The practice of \nearmarking permits essential public projects that would otherwise go \nunfunded and ignored to receive critical funds that can sustain their \nimportant community work. However, the process by which earmarks are \ncurrently distributed is susceptible to corruption and abuse, and that \nmust be corrected by injecting both accountability and transparency \ninto the process.\n  In order to promote accountability, the Senate bill requires that the \nlegislator sponsoring the earmark identify him or herself and provide a \ndescription explaining the ``government purpose'' served by the \nsponsored project. Additionally, I believe we can improve \naccountability by mandating publication of the earmark for a minimum \nperiod of time prior to any vote on the underlying measure, ensuring \nthat both other elected officials and the general public have the \nopportunity to scrutinize the sponsored outlay. Taking these common \nsense steps would ensure that legislators are made to answer for the \nspending they sponsor.\n  The American people demand a more open and honest government, one \nthat strives to put their concerns ahead of those of special interest, \none that endeavors to hold its elected officials accountable to the \nelectorate, and one that inspires the confidence of its people. In \norder to achieve these goals, we must remove any semblance of \nimpropriety. The reforms contained in both the Legislative Transparency \nand Accountability Act of 2007 and the Lobbying Transparency and \nAccountability Act of 2007 enact much-needed and long-awaited reforms \nthat move us toward those goals.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor to \nthis Senate ethics reform legislation. The American people sent a clear \nmessage in the last election. No more scandals. No more bribes. No more \ndirty politics. They wanted real ethics reform. The American people \nwant to know that Congress is working in their interest--not for \nspecial interests. The American people deserve a government which is \nhonest and open. They want a government which will fight for their \nvalues not for corporate values. Democrats have made it our top \npriority to clean up Washington and clean up politics.\n  What does this bill do? This bill bans all gifts and travel from \nlobbyists. It closes the revolving door by extending the lobbying ban \nfor former Members of Congress from one to two years. It improves \nlobbying disclosure requirements and brings transparency to the Senate. \nFinally, it requires that all Senators and their staff attend ethics \ntraining.\n  The American people wanted to clean up Washington. They wanted real \nethics reform. They wanted to know that lawmakers are fighting for the \npeople they represent--not the special interest lobbyists. This bill \nholds lawmakers and lobbyists accountable by creating real penalties \nfor those who break the law--by punishing them with jail time not just \nfines. This bill sets the tone for this Congress--dirty politics will \nnot be tolerated.\n  The American people demanded change in the last election. They wanted \na government they could trust. They wanted a government that would \nprotect everyday, hardworking Americans. This bill is a step in the \nright direction. We are listening to what American people are telling \nus. We here in the U.S. Senate are taking their concerns seriously. We \nare making changes in Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The question is on the \nengrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the information of all Senators, we \nwill have a vote Tuesday morning--well, at least by noon Tuesday. No \nvotes Friday or Monday, but we will vote Tuesday at noon or \nthereabouts.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I had asked for this time to spend a few \nminutes talking about what has happened in the last few weeks. One of \nthe things that is going on in our country is that we have a little bit \nof a crisis of confidence in our legislative bodies. Some of it is well \ndeserved.\n  We have had a bill on the floor under the guise of ethics reform. The \nbill is a statute. It is not a rule. It is going to become law. But I \nthink the American people should be on guard. I was one of two people \nwho voted against this bill and for some very good reasons.\n  What the American people would like to see is transparency. They \nwould like to see clarity. They would like to see sunshine. Some of the \namendments to this bill made it much better; there is no question about \nthat. But some of the things that happened along the way did not allow \nthe American people to really know what is going on in terms of what \nneeds to change. A lot of the amendments tonight were accepted only on \nthe basis that they would preclude debate. Now it is Thursday night. \nThe Senate is not in session tomorrow. And the question people have to \nask is, why didn't we debate those amendments? Why didn't we want to \ndebate those amendments? The reason we didn't want to debate those \namendments is because they are going to be discarded as soon as we get \nto conference.\n  Let me talk about one of them because I believe it is important. We \nhave had hundreds of stories over the last 2 years of Members of \nCongress who have used the earmark process to enhance the well-being of \neither members of their office staff's families, personal family \nmembers, and even in the House a couple of occasions where they helped \nthemselves. I am thinking particularly about a $1.2 million road that \nwas built for properties owned by the Member of Congress. That fact is, \nthat should have been debated. The American people need to know what \nthe problems are, and there needs to be sunshine. There needs to be \ntransparency about what we do.\n  The question the American people ought to ask is: What is going to \nhappen when this bill goes to conference and what is going to come out? \nAnd is all the rhetoric we heard on the floor truly going to be \nreflected in an ethics bill that will change behavior?\n  A lot of effort has been concentrated on lobbyists. Lobbyists aren't \nthe problem. Members of Congress are the problem. And transparency \nsolves that problem. So we are not going to have transparency anymore. \nWe are going to say you can't take a meal from somebody, but you \ncertainly can deliver on a couple-million-dollar earmark. And we are \ngoing to create a situation where we say we are going to expose it, but \nyou shouldn't count on that happening until the final bill comes.\n  My faith and my hope is that we put everything we have done away and \ndon't do any of the things that have been accepted by the Senate \ntonight because of fear of political consequences, but that we do what \nthe American people want, and that is to be transparent in both our \nactions and our deeds. The way to clean up ethical problems in Congress \nis for the Members to be transparent about what they do. So if this \nbill were to come back and we pass it just as it is, we are going to go \nthrough all these hoops that will have been created, and we are going \nto make sure people don't come to the Senate to serve. We are going to \nhave a ``gotcha'' system. That is what we just passed. Good, honorable \npeople of integrity are going to make an innocent mistake, and they are \ngoing to be gotten. I am not talking about the things that were \nintentionally done that we have seen over the past 4 to 6 years from \nboth parties. I am talking about good, honest people making an innocent \nmistake, and it is going to ruin them. Consequently, people are not \ngoing to come here. Only those who are shielded and armored, who are \ncareerists and have enough money that no matter what happens, they can \ndefend themselves with the trial lawyers they are going to need to \ndefend themselves after we pass all these rules that are going to come.\n  I know this sounds a bit negative now that we have passed supposedly \nan ethics reform bill. But my warning to the American people and to \nthis body is, we should measure that when we see the final product. And \nwe should measure the final product against Senator DeMint's amendment \nfor true transparency on earmarks, my amendment on true lack of ethical \nbias in terms of monetary gain for staff members' families or Members' \nfamilies in terms of earmarks. My faith will be renewed if, in fact, we \ncome out with a great ethics bill. I wait and remain to be convinced \nthat that will be the case.\n  The final point I want to make is process. Why did we not want to \ndebate in front of the American people the idea that it is unethical \nfor somebody to gain monetarily, directly or indirectly, staff member \nor staff member's family, Member's family or Member, from an earmark? \nWhy did we not want to debate that? That is a question the press ought \nto be asking. That is a question we all ought to be asking, as the \nconference comes back.\n  The way we solve the problems with ethics in the Senate is through \ncomplete and total transparency about what we do. And if we are not \nashamed of what we are doing, we should not be ashamed of putting up \nwhat we are doing and how we are doing it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S747]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S737-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S737-S747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    LEGISLATIVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I apologize to everybody for \nhaving Senators wait around. I can remember when I was in the House, \nand in the interest of coming to the Senate, I turned on the TV set. \nJim Exon from Nebraska kept suggesting the absence of a quorum. I was \nso upset not knowing what the procedure was. But I came and served with \nJim Exon--first of all, he was as big as the Presiding Officer, and he \nwas a man who was very dedicated to the Senate. But after I got here, I \nunderstood more what was happening. So I apologize for all the quorum \ncalls. A lot of people think nothing is going on, but Democrats and \nRepublicans and staff have been working so hard from last night to \ntoday to get us to this point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all amendments to the \namendment No. 3 be withdrawn and that the following be the only \namendments remaining in order to the bill or substitute amendment; that \nthe votes in relation to the amendments begin at 8:10 this evening, \nwith 2 minutes for debate equally divided between each vote; that upon \ndisposition of the above-listed amendments, the substitute amendment \nNo. 3 be agreed to as amended, the bill be read the third time, and the \nSenate vote, without any intervening action or debate, on final passage \nof the bill.\n  The amendments that I have referred to are as follows: Bennett \namendment No. 20 on grassroots lobbying; Lieberman-Collins amendment \nNo. 30; Vitter amendment No. 9 on spouses; Coburn amendment No. 51 on \ngifts and travel disclosure; Ensign-DeMint amendment on scope of \nconference; Feingold amendment No. 31 on former members lobbying; \nFeingold amendment No. 33 on gym and parking; Durbin amendment No. 77 \non providing managers copies of amendments; Obama amendment No. 41 on \nbundling; Sanders amendment No. 57 on study; Coleman-Cardin amendment \nNo. 39, as modified, on travel Web site; managers' amendment to be \nagreed to by both managers; further, that the Senate begin \nconsideration of H.R. 2, the minimum wage bill on Monday, January 22, \nat 2 p.m. and that Senator Coburn be recognized to speak following \nfinal passage following the remarks of the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, would the leader add to \nthat, after the first vote that subsequent votes be 10-minute votes?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my \nunderstanding is that when the Senate turns to minimum wage, the \nmajority leader, or his designee, will offer a substitute amendment \nthat will be fully amendable; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. True.\n  Mr. GREGG. Further, I understand the majority leader is aware that I \nhave agreed to withdraw my amendment on this bill, the lobby reform \nbill, and I will be here Monday to offer my language to the minimum \nwage bill.\n  Mr. REID. That is my understanding. The Senator absolutely has that \nright.\n  Mr. GREGG. Further reserving the right to object, I understand that \nthe majority leader will be unable to reach consent for a time \nagreement to vote on my amendment; therefore, it is likely that a \ncloture motion will be filed on my language on Monday. I expect my \nlanguage to be the first amendment to the bill.\n  Mr. REID. It may not be the first, but we have an agreement that it \nwould be following my recognition, the offering of the substitute, and \nthe minority leader, who would be recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the two leaders for their assistance in this \nprocess. I believe this is a reasonable way to bring up the amendment \nthat I have offered and to move this bill at the same time.\n  I understand that on Monday it would be the expectation that nobody \nwill be complaining that I have it on the wrong vehicle.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Republican leader says anything, \nI will be brief. We have been able, if this agreement is reached, to \naccomplish what the distinguished Republican leader and I intended to \ndo this week. As a result of that and an agreement to go forward on the \nminimum wage, there will be no votes tomorrow or Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, to reiterate what the majority leader \nindicated, as a result of this agreement, which did take a while--and I \nknow some of our colleagues wondered if we were ever going to get \nthere--we will complete the bill tonight, and we will have no votes \ntomorrow or Monday.\n  This was a successful example of good negotiation--although it took a \nwhile--for a favorable result.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, has the agreement been accepted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in that we are not voting until 8:10, I will \nsay a few words. Let me say this. This legislation has been extremely \ndifficult to deal with. It is difficult because it directly affects our \nlives, Members of the Senate. In the short term, this is going\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\nto be difficult because we are going to have to get used to the \nprovisions in this piece of legislation. But in the long term, we will \nall be thankful these steps have been taken. This legislation will \nremove even the appearance of impropriety from the work done in this \nChamber.\n  This is not a time for declaring victory. Legislation is the art of \ncompromise, the art of consensus building. There has been a victor in \nall of this when this matter is completed and that is the American \npeople. I am not a victor, I am not a loser. Senator McConnell is not a \nvictor or a loser. We have worked through this in the way that \nlegislators should work through difficult pieces of legislation. I \nbelieve last November Americans, through their votes, asked us to make \nGovernment honest. We have done that. We are going to give them what I \nbelieve is a Government they deserve.\n  I am satisfied that this debate has been good for this body. Now we \nare going to move forward, recognizing the last 24 hours has not been \neasy legislatively. As Senator Durbin said last night, it was a bump in \nthe road. It was a real bump and people should have had their seatbelts \non because it was a difficult bump. But I believe last night there were \npeople looking for an excuse to not move this bill forward. Let me say, \nunderlying and underscoring this, as I said last night--and I will say \nit again--Senator Judd Gregg, the senior Senator from New Hampshire, is \na person who has tremendously strong principles. He believes in this \nlegislation. I believe just as strongly that it is wrong. But he \nbelieves it is right. I admire and respect him for doing that, just as \nhis partner on the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, is a person of \nprinciple. They have worked on this issue and other issues together, as \nlegislators should work together. I so much respect the way they work \ntogether. They disagree on a number of different issues, but they do it \nin a way that I think brings dignity to this body.\n\n  I, also, wish to say one thing about my friend, Senator Russ \nFeingold. He has been a pioneer on a number of different legislative \nissues. He fought tooth and nail with my friend, the Republican leader, \non campaign finance reform. It was a debate that went on for a number \nof years in this body. Senator Feingold is a person who has talked \nabout ethics since he came to the Senate. There are a lot of people \nresponsible for this legislation, but there is no one more responsible \nthan the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  He has been a pioneer, and he has not let up from the time he came to \nthe Senate to today in moving forward on what he believes is good for \nthis body politic. With rare exception, I agree with him. He is my \nfriend. He is a person for whom I have great admiration based on his, \nif nothing else--and there is plenty more--being a Rhodes Scholar, a \nHarvard graduate with honors, a man who was a dignified and successful \nlawyer before he came to the Senate. He has shown he is a good \nlegislator. So I have great respect for him.\n  In the past, I called this legislation the toughest reform since \nWatergate. That is an understatement. This is the toughest reform bill \nin the history of this body as it relates to ethics and lawmaking. So \neveryone tonight, when they vote on this bill, should vote proudly. \nWhat is going to happen soon is historic: requiring new lobbying \ndisclosure, banning all gifts, reforming earmarks, requiring Senators \nto pay charter rates on corporate jets. We will restore the confidence \nof our citizenry in the Government.\n  I so appreciate the work that has been done on this legislation. I \nappreciate the work of my friend, the Republican leader. We have had \ndisagreements on this legislation, but we have an agreement in \nprinciple as to what this body is all about. I look forward to working \ntogether on more bipartisan legislation. This is bipartisan legislation \nsponsored by the Democratic leader and the Republican leader of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the majority \nleader, I couldn't agree more. This is a classic example of \nbipartisanship in the Senate at its very best. We had good bipartisan \nsupport last year when we passed a similar bill 90 to 8. This year, I \nthink we are going to finish the job.\n  I particularly wish to recognize, on this side of the aisle, the \nextraordinary work of Senator Gregg in achieving his goal on the next \nbill up to get an important vote that is important not only to him but \nto many Members on our side of the aisle.\n  I extend my congratulations to my good friend, Bob Bennett, the \nranking member on our side, who has been involved on this from \nbeginning to end and has done an extraordinary job of managing a very \ncomplex and difficult bill; to Senator Susan Collins, who has been a \nleader on the Collins-Lieberman amendment on which we will be voting \nshortly; to Senator Vitter, Senator Coburn, Senator DeMint, who have \nbeen extremely active on this bill, and each of them has an imprint on \nthis final passage measure that we will be dealing with shortly.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate all Senators for an extraordinary \naccomplishment, under very difficult circumstances on a broad, \nbipartisan basis. The patience that was exhibited to allow us to get to \nthis point, I remind everyone, is what produced an opportunity to have \nno votes tomorrow and no votes on Monday. I think this was worth the \nwait.\n  I congratulate the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I failed to acknowledge the managers of this \nbill. I apologize to both of them. They have been masterful in working \nthis bill the last 2 weeks. The two managers are going to be involved \nheavily in getting this through conference. I have so much respect for \nboth of them. They are outstanding Senators.\n  I repeat, I am so sorry I didn't acknowledge them. I should have done \nthat in the beginning because they have done more than anybody else in \nmoving this bill forward. They worked as partners moving this bill \nforward. It has been a difficult partnership because of the different \nthoughts on different sides of the aisle as to what is good and bad. \nThey have been able to be dignified in what they have done. I \nappreciate it.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 20\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Bennett amendment \nNo. 20.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. BENNETT. How is the time allocated between now and the scheduled \nvotes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time is allocated. The Senator may speak.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Do I understand, Mr. President, that the votes are not \nlocked in for 8:10 p.m.?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the voting begins at \n8:10 p.m.\n  Mr. BENNETT. So the time between now and 8:10 p.m. is not allocated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to be fair to whoever opposes my \namendment to allow time for them to do that, but I would like to speak \nbriefly in favor of my amendment.\n  My amendment is called the grassroots lobbying amendment. I have \ndiscussed it and its virtues at some length previously during the \nperiod of debate, but I remind everyone what this is all about.\n  This has to do with the regulations and reporting requirements placed \non organizations that stimulate people to contact their Members of \nCongress. These organizations can be, and many times are, outside of \nWashington, DC. They can, and many times do, carry on their work \nwithout ever contacting a Member of Congress directly or participating \nin any of the activities we normally think of as lobbying. And yet, if \nan organization or an individual were to stimulate neighbors, Members \nof a fraternal organization, their bowling club--whatever it is--to try \nto get them active in the process of petitioning the Government, they \nrun the risk of not registering properly because under the underlying \nbill, they are defined as lobbyists, and if they fail to fill out their \nforms properly, if they fail to register properly, they are subject to \na $200,000 fine.\n  The ACLU has said--in my opinion accurately--that this would have a\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\nchilling effect on all of these kinds of activities. People on the \nright side, the National Right to Life, have said this would have a \nchilling effect on everything we do.\n  I know there has been talk about astroturf lobbyists and astroturf \ncampaigns. I am certainly competent to know when an astroturf phony \ncampaign has been mounted. The letters and the postcards come into the \noffice, and it is very transparent they are not genuine and real. I do \nnot need to be protected from my constituents by the language in the \nunderlying bill.\n  My amendment is very simple. It simply strikes the grassroots \nprovision.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to support amendment No. 20 \noffered by my colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett. This amendment \nwould strike section 220, the grassroots reporting provision, from the \nbill.\n  Yesterday, during my statement on the need for comprehensive lobbying \nand ethics reform, I discussed the importance of an informed citizenry \nand how it is essential to a thriving democracy. A democratic \ngovernment operates best in the disinfecting light of the public eye. \nWith this bill, we have an opportunity to balance the right of the \npublic to know with its right to petition government; the ability of \nlobbyists' to advocate their clients' causes with the need for truthful \npublic discourse; and the ability of Members to legislate with the \nimperative that our government must be free from corrupting influences, \nboth real and perceived. We must act now to ensure that the erosion we \nsee today in the public's confidence in Congress does not become a \ncollapse of confidence.\n  We have an obligation to address this crisis of confidence, but we \nalso have an obligation to ensure that we do so in a thoughtful, \nreasoned, and constitutional manner. It is imperative that we be \nmindful of the rights of American citizens to freely contact their \npublic officials and take part in the political process. After careful \nconsideration, and much input from groups representing all parts of the \npolitical spectrum, it has become evident to me that section 220 of the \nunderlying bill could seriously impact legitimate communications \nbetween public interest organizations and their members. That is why I \nwill support the efforts of my colleague from Utah to strike section \n220 from the bill.\n  It is my understanding that, under this provision, small \norganizations--many with no representation in Washington--would have to \nregister as grassroots lobbying firms. These groups would then have to \ncomply with onerous quarterly reporting requirements or face fines and \ncriminal penalties. I do not think it was the intention of the \nproponents of this provision to restrict the ability of groups to \ncommunicate with their membership, but I have concluded that this could \nvery well be the outcome.\n  The approach taken in the underlying bill is one of greater \ndisclosure of and transparency into the interactions of lobbyists with \nour public officials. More transparency and disclosure of professional \nlobbyists' activities can only lead to better government. \nUnfortunately, section 220 simply goes too far, and I fear that the \nunintended consequences would negatively impact the legitimate, \nconstitutionally protected activities of small citizen groups and their \nmembers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nBennett which would strike the grassroots lobbying provision in S. 1.\n  Several years ago, I, along with several colleagues, undertook the \ntask of strengthening reporting requirements for lobbyists. This \nculminated in the passage of the Lobbying Disclosure Act which broke \nnew ground by allowing sunlight into the activities of lobbyists in \nWashington. It finally required meaningful disclosure of the billions \nof dollars spent on lobbying Members of Congress.\n  While great progress was made, there was a major loophole left open \nwhich needs to be closed. Under current law, lobbyists are permitted to \nexclude the cost of their efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying when \nthey report under the LDA. We recognized this problem in 1996 but were \nnot successful in efforts to address it. However, I continue to believe \nthat lobbyists who engage in this so-called ``Astroturf'' lobbying \nshould also be required to disclose their spending.\n  The Wall Street Journal examined this issue when we last reviewed \nthis and reported that an estimated $790 million was spent on this type \nof grassroots lobbying in a 2-year period alone. Accounting for the \ngrowth in the lobbying industry that we have seen over the last decade, \nthis number is surely over a billion by now.\n  What sort of activities does money spent on ``Astroturf'' lobbying \nefforts pay for? It is spent on phone banks, telephone patch-throughs \nto Members, and even professional campaign organizers who are paid to \ngo to key congressional districts to organize letter-writing campaigns. \nThese are coordinated efforts costing tens of thousands of dollars \nwhich on their face are part of professional lobbying efforts.\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Lieberman last year to craft a \nprovision during the Homeland Security and Government Affairs \nCommittee's consideration of the lobbying bill that would close this \nloophole by requiring disclosure of ``paid efforts to stimulate \ngrassroots lobbying.'' It requires disclosure by paid lobbyists and \nlobbying firms who stimulate the grassroots to take action. We even \nwent so far as to define pure grassroots lobbying and exclude it from \nthis provision.\n  The Lieberman-Levin provision that was included in S. 1 simply \nrequires disclosure. This provision does not in any way ``restrain'' or \n``regulate'' paid efforts to stimulate grassroots lobbying. All that it \ndoes is require paid lobbyists to disclose how much they are spending \non their grassroots lobbying efforts. This disclosure would be no more \nburdensome than the disclosure already required by the Lobbying \nDisclosure Act for direct lobbying: Amounts spent for efforts to \nstimulate grassroots lobbying, like amounts spent on direct lobbying, \nwould be disclosed only in the form of good-faith estimates, which \nwould be rounded to the nearest $20,000.\n  In addition, the provision, like the Lobbying Disclosure Act, \nrecognizes that certain organizations are already required to track \nlobbying expenses, and grassroots lobbying expenses, for IRS purposes. \nThe provision allows these organizations to use their IRS numbers for \ndisclosure purposes, ensuring that they do not have to account twice by \ndifferent rules.\n  This section was carefully crafted to exclude certain activities that \nare not part of this Astroturf lobbying industry. Efforts by an \norganization to communicate with its own members, employees, officers, \nor shareholders are expressly excluded. Organizations that exist solely \nto lobby Congress but do not employ paid lobbyists do not have to \nreport. Finally, any grassroots lobbying efforts targeted at less than \n500 people do not have to be reported.\n  I would also like to clarify just who is required to disclose as a \nlobbyist under this provision, as there seems to be confusion over this \npoint. Paragraph (b) of section 220 clearly states that individuals who \nare not registered lobbyists now would not have to register as a \nlobbyist under this provision so long as their expenditures are only \ndirected at grassroots lobbying. This provision is intended to shed \nlight on the dollars being spent by lobbyists. It in no way affects \nindividuals who want to call or write their Member of Congress.\n  For the past decade, we have allowed lobbyists to exclude the cost of \ntheir organized grassroots lobbying campaigns, even while they are \nreporting their other lobbying expenses. It is time to put an end to \nthis arbitrary exclusion because the public has a right to know who is \npaying how much to whom in an effort to influence our decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Bennett amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 8:10 p.m. having arrived, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the Bennett amendment No. 20.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, before I propound a unanimous consent \nrequest, I would very much like to\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\nthank both leaders. I know this has been a difficult day. I think it \nhas worked out, and I think that is to the good. I hope everyone else \nwho has waited hour after hour understands that the leadership was in \nnegotiations and there is a product of those negotiations.\n  I, also, thank the ranking member with whom it has been a great \npleasure for me to work. Members should know that we are new. Members \nshould know that our staffs are new to the committee and that this is \ntheir first bill on the floor. I believe they have done an excellent \njob, both on the Democratic side and on the Republican side. It is a \nkind of baptism of fire, if you will. I say thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nher kind words. I echo her laudatory comments about the staffs on both \nsides. This is a baptism of fire for all of us, for my staff and her \nstaff as well, and they have had enough background that they know how \nto swim.\n  We are very grateful for the cooperation we have received and the \nsupport that has come from the staff. I look forward to a productive \nCongress, working with Senator Feinstein on the Rules Committee on all \nof the other matters that will come before us.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 98\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, in a moment, the Senate will adopt the \nEnsign-McCain-DeMint amendment related to scope of conference. I want \nto thank Senator McCain and Senator DeMint for working with me on this \namendment.\n  I also want to explain why this amendment is such an important \nimprovement over the underlying bill. Under the Constitution, the \nlegislative branch controls the purse strings. That is a significant \nauthority given to Congress. Congress must use that authority wisely. \nAs I explained earlier today on the floor, too often conferees insert \nearmarks in conference reports that were not funded in either bill \npassed by the House or the Senate.\n  In a democracy such as ours, Congress should do its business in the \nfull light of day. The entire Senate should consider, debate, and amend \nlegislation in full view of the American public. We should scrutinize \nhow Federal dollars are spent. Each project Congress funds should be \ndebated and considered by Congress. We must do a better job of \noversight. We must ensure that the taxpayers' dollars are being spent \nwisely. But when we insert projects in a conference report, without \ndebate and without oversight, we fail to live up to our \nresponsibilities as Senators.\n  What the Ensign-McCain-DeMint amendment would do is fix what has \nbecome a broken process. My amendment makes clear that a point of order \ncan be raised against any funding, no matter how specific, for any \nprogram, project, or account that was not originally funded in either \nbill sent to conference. This is a simple but critical change. It will \nimprove how Congress operates, and it will make the Government more \naccountable to the American people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the underlying substitute does include two \nprovisions that are intended to address the out-of-control earmarking \nand porkbarrel spending of the past years. And, the adoption of the \nDeMint and Durbin amendments earlier this week have improved upon the \nunderlying bill to ensure that all earmarks are disclosed--including \nthose to Federal entities, as well as all that are included in \nstatements of managers and conference reports. A number of us supported \na similar proposal last year, and I am pleased that the effort was \nfinally successful.\n  I am now pleased that additional improvements will be adopted with \nrespect to section 1 of the underlying bill concerning out of scope \nmatters in conference reports. The amendment sponsored by Senators \nEnsign, DeMint, and myself, which I understand is agreeable on both \nsides, would ensure that points of order can be raised against specific \nitems in conference reports. It would add a definition of any matter so \nthat members are empowered to remove out of scope earmarks and policy \nriders from conference reports without taking down the entire \nconference report. And, importantly, it would ensure that funding \nassociated with any provision stricken from a conference report is \nreduced from the total amount appropriated--a critical requirement \nmissing from the underlying measure.\n  For example, if a conference report provides $10 million for bridge \nimprovements, but then adds a directive that $5 million of that funding \nshould be directed to a specific bridge in a specific place--a \ndirective that was not included in either the House or Senate bill, our \namendment would ensure the $5 million that accompanies that out of \nscope earmark is also removed from the total allocation of the bill. So \nthat the total appropriated would be $5 million, not $10 million. This \nis about fiscal restraint, Mr. President. It makes little sense to \nraise a point of order that is sustained against an out of scope \nearmark, but to appropriate the funding regardless.\n  While I support the improvements proposed and accepted so far, \nearmark reform still needs to go much further. We need to curtail \nearmarks, not just disclose them. The process is clearly broken when \neach year Congress continues to earmark billions and billions of \ntaxpayer dollars, sometimes with virtually no information about the \nspecifics of those earmarks. The scandal that came to light during the \nlast Congress that involved earmarking by a former House member--now in \nprison--is a pox not just on him, but on each of us and the process \nthat we have allowed to occur on our watch. The American public, Mr. \nPresident, deserves better. That is what this amendment is about.\n  The growth in earmarked funding in appropriations bills during the \npast 12 years has been staggering. According to data gathered by CRS, \nthere were 4,126 earmarks in 1994. In 2005, there were 15,877--an \nincrease of nearly 400 percent. There was a little good news in 2006, \nsolely due to the fact that the Labor-HHS appropriations bill was \napproved almost entirely free of earmarks--an amazing feat given that \nthere were over 3,000 earmarks the prior year for just that bill. \nDespite this first reduction in 12 years, it doesn't change the fact \nthat the largest number of earmarks in history have still occurred in \nthe last three years--2004, 2005, and 2006.\n  Now, let's consider the level of funding associated with those \nearmarks. The amount of earmarked funding increased from $23.2 billion \nin 1994 to $64 billion in fiscal year 2006. Remarkably, it rose by 34 \npercent from 2005 to 2006, even though the number of earmarks \ndecreased. Earmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000, and more \nthan tripled in the last 10 years. This is wrong and disgraceful and we \nurgently need to curtail this seemingly out of control pork barreling \npractice that has become the norm around here.\n  I filed an amendment designed to curtail earmarking. I was pleased to \nbe joined by Senators Feingold and Graham in introducing amendment No. \n29. Unfortunately, it is clear that we will not be given an opportunity \nto vote on that amendment and I find myself in the same position as I \nwas in last March during debate on lobbying reform when I was not \nallowed a vote on my amendment. But one day soon, I am confident we \nwill fundamentally change business as usual with respect to pork barrel \nspending. The American public has a powerful voice, and I would have \nthought more of us would have heard that voice last November. But I do \nwant to state my recognition that at least some improvements have been \nmade to require full disclosure of all earmarks and to prevent out of \nscope matters in conference. And, I believe the Ensign, McCain, DeMint \namendment makes further improvements.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 41\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss the \namendment I introduced with Senator Feingold to require that lobbyists \ndisclose the contributions that they bundle for campaigns. I am \ngrateful to the leadership for accepting the amendment and believe it \nstrengthens an already very strong bill.\n  Neither I nor any of my colleagues enjoy the amount of money that \nrunning for office requires us to raise and spend. And I realize that \nhaving influential people help a campaign by asking their friends for \ncontributions makes that task a little easier. And so I appreciate how \ndifficult it can be for us to legislate our own behavior in this area.\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\n  But lobbyists who bundle contributions have a personal stake in the \noutcome of specific legislation before Congress. And because of that \nnexus, lobbyists should have to report who they are raising money for \nand the amounts that they are raising--including the contributions that \nthey collect for campaigns from their networks of friends and \ncolleagues.\n  The legislation before us today is meant to shine a bright light on \nhow lobbyists influence the legislative process. Influence is not just \nabout free meals or gifts or travel but about the millions upon \nmillions of dollars raised to get us elected every few years. We should \nnot keep the biggest role lobbyists play in that process hidden.\n  We all know that with strict campaign contribution limits, an \nimportant sign of a lobbyist's influence is not only how much money he \ngives but also how much he raises from friends and associates. During \nthe last Presidential campaign, both candidates made great use of \nbundling.\n  For instance, the Bush Rangers each raised over $200,000; the Bush \nPioneers each raised over $100,000. The Kerry campaign also relied on \n``vice chairs'' who raised at least $100,000.\n  According to a USA Today story in 2003: ``Motives for becoming a \nbundler include the possibility of increased influence on government \npolicy and consideration for appointment to ambassadorships and other \ngovernment posts.''\n  And so if we believe that lobbyists should have to disclose campaign \ncontributions, then they should certainly have to disclose the bundling \nthey engage in so that the public knows the relationship between \nmembers, their views on policy, and the industries that support them.\n  Right now, this relationship is largely hidden from public view. So \nto correct this gap in the underlying bill, my amendment would require \nquarterly reporting of all contributions that a lobbyist collected or \narranged that total more than $200 in a calendar year. This includes \nnot only campaign contributions, but also contributions to Presidential \nlibraries, inaugural committees, and lawmakers' charities.\n  The amendment has the support of all the major reform advocacy \norganizations, as well as congressional scholar Norm Ornstein and \nThomas Susman, the chair of the Ethics Committee for the American \nLeague of Lobbyists.\n  According to Norm Ornstein: ``What is needed is disclosure here--who \nis doing the bundling, for whom, and how much. These are simple but \ncritical steps for openness in the lobbying and money relationship. The \npublic deserves to know--and this amendment gives them that \nopportunity.''\n  And in Professor Susman's words: ``Full disclosure of these \nactivities, including the `bundling' of campaign contributions for a \ncandidate, will not burden or inhibit lobbyists. Lobbyists are proud of \nthe role that we play in helping to finance federal campaigns, and we \nwill be just as effective if the public knows about that role as well. \nSenator Obama's amendment is a reasonable way to keep these activities \nout in the open.''\n  Under the amendment that Senator Feingold and I are offering, \ncontributions are considered to be collected by a lobbyist if they are \nreceived by the lobbyist and forwarded to the campaign. Contributions \nare considered to be arranged by a lobbyist if there is an arrangement \nor understanding between the lobbyist and a campaign that the lobbyist \nwill receive some kind of credit or recognition for having raised the \nmoney.\n  In discussing this proposal that I am offering, a Washington Post \neditorial this week said: ``No single change would add more to public \nunderstanding of how money really operates in Washington.''\n  This is an important addition to the bill we are considering, and I \nthank my colleagues for accepting it.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 9, 98, 51, 31, 33, 77, 41, 57, and 39, as Modified, En \n                                  Bloc\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, utilizing a moment in opposition to the \namendment of my friend from Utah, Mr. Bennett, if the section on \ngrassroots lobbying in the bill were as Senator Bennett described it \nand as other groups on the outside have described it, I would oppose \nit.\n  This provision was in the overall lobbying bill that passed the \nSenate 90 to 8 last year. It is a natural extension of what the entire \nbill is doing, which is asking for disclosure from professional \nlobbying.\n  Billions of dollars are spent on so-called grassroots lobbying. It is \ntotally legal, but let's get it out into the sunshine. The individual \ngroups writing to Members to lobby us do not have to disclose anything. \nThis only requires disclosure if a group retains a professional \nlobbyist and only if they pay that lobbyist more than $25,000 a \nquarter.\n  This is not amateur citizen lobbying. This is to find out who is \ngetting how much money to influence us. It is not, in any sense, a \nlimitation on the revered first amendment right to petition Congress \nfor a redress of grievances. It is an attempt for disclosure consistent \nwith the entire bill. So I ask my colleagues respectfully to leave this \ncritical provision in this progressive reform bill.\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the amendment \noffered by Senator Bennett. This is a very rare instance where I \ndisagree with my colleague and good friend from Connecticut. I simply \ndon't want to discourage any effort to increase citizen participation \nin Government. Too many citizens are convinced that their voices don't \ncount. They become apathetic about their Government. They become \nconvinced they cannot influence our positions. I think activity that \nencourages citizens to contact us, to participate in the process, \nshould be encouraged, not discouraged, and I believe the language in \nthe bill could well discourage citizen contact with Members of \nCongress. So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Utah.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 99\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send a manager's package to the \ndesk.

The pending amendment is the Lieberman-Collins \namendment.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 30\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there have been a variety of proposals \nfor what has been called an Office of Public Integrity. The Senate \nvoted 67 to 30 against one such proposal last year. Last time, Senators \nJohnson and Voinovich, the chairs of the Ethics Committee, stood in \nopposition. This time, the new chairs of the Ethics Committee, Senators \nBoxer and Cornyn, stand in opposition.\n  I recognize the strong interest in\nthis issue, especially by Senators\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\nLieberman, Collins, Obama, Feingold, McCain, and others. I have spoken \nwith Senator Obama about it. I have assured him that we would hold a \nhearing in the Rules Committee and that we would take a look at this \nproposal and what might or might not be done.\n  I will vote against this amendment, and I will see that the Rules \nCommittee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nhold these hearings. They will focus on these proposals and ways of \nstrengthening ethics enforcement in the Senate.\n  Let me say this now. I do believe we need to take great care in how \nwe do this. Yes, we need to reassure the public that those who run \nafoul of the Senate rules will be held accountable. But we must make \nsure this does not simply become a new tool used by political opponents \nwho would seek to manipulate the political process by filing false \nclaims. You can be sure that the minute a claim becomes public, without \nany verification as to its veracity, and is released to the public, \nthat claim will be a 30-second spot in someone's campaign. That is not \nwhat we are about.\n  We have to also ensure that we do not create an office--with a \nspecial prosecutor bound and determined to justify his or her existence \nby creating an atmosphere of ongoing investigation--that will cost \ntaxpayers millions of dollars. The Constitution provides:\n\n       Each House of Congress may determine the Rules of its \n     Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, \n     with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.\n\n  Our Founders knew the importance of this and placed it in article I.\n  The challenge we face right now is how to do it right and ensure that \nthe tough ethics rules we are putting in place will be vigorously \noverseen and enforced.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \ncreate an Office of Public Integrity.\n  This underlying bill is a very good one. It will help to restore \npublic confidence in the integrity of our decisions. But we leave the \njob undone if we do not create an Office of Public Integrity. I thank \nthe leaders on both sides of the aisle for allowing the Senate to have \na vote on this important issue.\n  The problem is that the current system is inherently conflicted. We \nare our own advisers, we are our own investigators, we are our own \nprosecutors, we are our own judges, and we are our own jurors. This \namendment would take only the investigative part of the process and \ninvest it in an independent, impartial Office of Public Integrity that \nwould help restore the public's confidence in the integrity of our \nethics system.\n  I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, there is not much to add to my \ncolleague from Maine. I thank her for her statement.\n  Basically, we have a very strong reform of the rules by which we \ngovern our ethics and that of those who lobby before us. What is \nmissing is an equal reform of the process which would do that.\n  Nothing in this amendment alters the superior role of the Senate \nEthics Committee pursuant to the Constitution to make final decisions \non claims before it. This amendment simply sets up an independent \ninvestigative office. Incidentally, it is merely responding to what my \nfriend from California, Senator Feinstein, said. There is actually more \nprotection against abuse of this process with frivolous complaints than \nthere is in the current system.\n  I have a feeling this will not pass tonight, but our committee is \ngoing to take it up and hopefully report out a bill independently later \nthis session.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The substitute amendment, as amended, is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have been privileged to serve as a \nlegislator--first in the Maryland House of Delegates, then in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, and now in the Senate. I appreciate the trust \nthat the people of Maryland placed in me. And I appreciate how \nimportant it is that we adhere to the strictest ethical standards. The \nAmerican people need to believe their Government is on the up and up.\n  I served on the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct from \n1991 to 1997. I served as the ranking member of the adjudicative \nsubcommittee that investigated and ultimately recommended sanctions \nagainst former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. In 1997, the House \nleadership appointed me to serve as the cochairman of the House Ethics \nReform Task Force, with my colleague Bob Livingston from Louisiana. Our \nbipartisan task force came up with a comprehensive set of reforms to \noverhaul the ethics process. We created a bipartisan package to change \nHouse and committee rules. This was the last bipartisan effort in the \nHouse to fix ethics procedures. Unfortunately, the ethics process in \nthe House broke down after that.\n  Here in the Senate, there has been more bipartisan cooperation when \nit comes to ethics reform. Last year, the Senate voted 90 to 8 to \napprove a reform bill. And we are getting off to a good start this \nyear, with both the Democratic leader and the Republican leader co-\nsponsoring both S. 1 and the substitute amendment. Members on both \nsides of the aisle have been given ample opportunity to offer \namendments and have them considered.\n  As amended, S. 1 represents a significant change in the way elected \nofficials, senior staff, and lobbyists would do business--change the \nAmerican people are demanding.\n  When it comes to how we treat ourselves, this legislation revokes the \npensions of Members convicted of bribing public officials and \nwitnesses, perjury, and other crimes. S. 1 bans gifts and meals from \nlobbyists. It slows down the revolving door by extending lobbying bans \nfor former Members and staff. It eliminates floor privileges for former \nMembers who become lobbyists. And it stops partisan attempts, such as \nthe K Street Project to influence private-sector hiring. The bill makes \nethics training mandatory for Members and staff.\n  When it comes to making how Congress works more transparent, this \nlegislation shines a spotlight on earmarks, targeted tax breaks, and \ntariff reduction bills, to make it clear who is\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\noffering them, and on whose behalf. S. 1 ensures that the minority will \nget to participate in conference committees, and that conference \nreports can't be changed after they're signed by a majority of the \nconferees. The bill requires that conference reports have to be posted \non the Internet 48 hours prior to consideration so that Members of \nCongress, staff, and the public can find out what's in them.\n  When it comes to how lobbyists are to act, this legislation puts an \nend to the lavish parties they throw in our honor at the national \nconventions. S. 1 quadruples the penalty for failure to comply with the \nrequirements of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. It requires \nlobbyists to file quarterly reports instead of semi-annually. And it \ndirects the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of \nRepresentatives to maintain on the Internet a publicly available \ndatabase of lobbying disclosure information.\n  I am pleased to report that the bill contains an amendment that \nSenator Coleman from Minnesota and I offered to require the Secretary \nof the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives to \nestablish a website freely available to the public that will contain \neasy-to-understand information on all officially related congressional \ntravel subject to disclosure under the gift rules.\n  During the debate on S. 1, we have heard over and over again former \nSupreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis' famous dictum, ``Sunlight is said \nto be the best of disinfectants,'' because it is so true. That is the \ndirection we are moving in by passing this bill. That is what the \nAmerican people want us to do, and that is what we need to do to regain \ntheir trust.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, as allegations of ethical abuses swirl \naround their government, the American people have understandably lost \nconfidence in the ability of their elected representatives to lead with \nintegrity. Their confidence has dwindled as the undue influence of \nlobbyists and special interests has permeated their government. They \nhave lost faith not only in their elected leaders, but also in the \ninstitutions that stand as the very pillars of our representative \ndemocracy. With their trust waning, Americans spoke at the ballot box \nlast November, admonishing their elected leaders and declaring that \nthey would no longer tolerate the exploitation of their government by \nthose who wield excessive influence.\n  For this reason, I was gratified to see the House of Representatives \nmove so quickly on ethics and lobby reform when the 110th Congress \nconvened, and I was pleased when Majority Leader Reid placed ethics and \nlobby reform at the top of the Senate agenda. Both the Legislative \nTransparency and Accountability Act of 2007 and the Lobbying \nTransparency and Accountability Act of 2007 enact long overdue ethics \nand lobbying reforms that will hold our elected officials to the \nhighest possible standards.\n  If we are going to restore the American public's trust in their \ngovernment, any reform we enact must squarely confront the undue \ninfluence that special interests and lobbyists exert on the legislative \nprocess. It must strengthen the rules that govern lobbying and close \nthe revolving door between the ``K Street'' lobby firms and the \nCapitol. It must shine a light on what has until now been a legislative \nprocess corrupted by backroom promises and deals struck in the dead of \nnight. It must promulgate new rules that curb wasteful spending by \ncreating greater transparency in the earmark process.\n  Earning back the confidence and trust of the American people will \nrequire greater transparency and stronger laws. The American public \ndeserves to be certain that their elected officials are not being \nswayed by lavish gifts offered as quid pro quo for promoting special \nagendas. To that end, gifts from registered lobbyists have no place in \nour legislative process. For that reason, I support the sweeping ban on \nlobbyist-paid gifts in the Senate bill. This ban includes not just \nmeals but also gifts of travel and lodging, areas that have been the \nsubject of notorious abuse.\n  Our commitment to a new era of openness must go hand in hand with a \nsimilar commitment on the part of lobbyists. We must demand more \ndisclosure from lobbyists about their practices and increase the \npenalties for their failure to disclose their activities. To be clear, \nour Constitution protects the right of Americans to petition their \ngovernment. However, what it does not do is protect their ability to \nhire lobbyists to buy influence by showering elected officials with \nexpensive gifts and vacations.\n  Reining in wasteful spending must also be a part of any ethical \nreform we enact. Specifically, we must bring reform and accountability \nto the process of earmarking. Although the term ``earmark'' has taken \non a negative connotation, the designation of funds for individual \nprojects or programs is not in and of itself devious. The practice of \nearmarking permits essential public projects that would otherwise go \nunfunded and ignored to receive critical funds that can sustain their \nimportant community work. However, the process by which earmarks are \ncurrently distributed is susceptible to corruption and abuse, and that \nmust be corrected by injecting both accountability and transparency \ninto the process.\n  In order to promote accountability, the Senate bill requires that the \nlegislator sponsoring the earmark identify him or herself and provide a \ndescription explaining the ``government purpose'' served by the \nsponsored project. Additionally, I believe we can improve \naccountability by mandating publication of the earmark for a minimum \nperiod of time prior to any vote on the underlying measure, ensuring \nthat both other elected officials and the general public have the \nopportunity to scrutinize the sponsored outlay. Taking these common \nsense steps would ensure that legislators are made to answer for the \nspending they sponsor.\n  The American people demand a more open and honest government, one \nthat strives to put their concerns ahead of those of special interest, \none that endeavors to hold its elected officials accountable to the \nelectorate, and one that inspires the confidence of its people. In \norder to achieve these goals, we must remove any semblance of \nimpropriety. The reforms contained in both the Legislative Transparency \nand Accountability Act of 2007 and the Lobbying Transparency and \nAccountability Act of 2007 enact much-needed and long-awaited reforms \nthat move us toward those goals.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor to \nthis Senate ethics reform legislation. The American people sent a clear \nmessage in the last election. No more scandals. No more bribes. No more \ndirty politics. They wanted real ethics reform. The American people \nwant to know that Congress is working in their interest--not for \nspecial interests. The American people deserve a government which is \nhonest and open. They want a government which will fight for their \nvalues not for corporate values. Democrats have made it our top \npriority to clean up Washington and clean up politics.\n  What does this bill do? This bill bans all gifts and travel from \nlobbyists. It closes the revolving door by extending the lobbying ban \nfor former Members of Congress from one to two years. It improves \nlobbying disclosure requirements and brings transparency to the Senate. \nFinally, it requires that all Senators and their staff attend ethics \ntraining.\n  The American people wanted to clean up Washington. They wanted real \nethics reform. They wanted to know that lawmakers are fighting for the \npeople they represent--not the special interest lobbyists. This bill \nholds lawmakers and lobbyists accountable by creating real penalties \nfor those who break the law--by punishing them with jail time not just \nfines. This bill sets the tone for this Congress--dirty politics will \nnot be tolerated.\n  The American people demanded change in the last election. They wanted \na government they could trust. They wanted a government that would \nprotect everyday, hardworking Americans. This bill is a step in the \nright direction. We are listening to what American people are telling \nus. We here in the U.S. Senate are taking their concerns seriously. We \nare making changes in Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The question is on the \nengrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the information of all Senators, we \nwill have a vote Tuesday morning--well, at least by noon Tuesday. No \nvotes Friday or Monday, but we will vote Tuesday at noon or \nthereabouts.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I had asked for this time to spend a few \nminutes talking about what has happened in the last few weeks. One of \nthe things that is going on in our country is that we have a little bit \nof a crisis of confidence in our legislative bodies. Some of it is well \ndeserved.\n  We have had a bill on the floor under the guise of ethics reform. The \nbill is a statute. It is not a rule. It is going to become law. But I \nthink the American people should be on guard. I was one of two people \nwho voted against this bill and for some very good reasons.\n  What the American people would like to see is transparency. They \nwould like to see clarity. They would like to see sunshine. Some of the \namendments to this bill made it much better; there is no question about \nthat. But some of the things that happened along the way did not allow \nthe American people to really know what is going on in terms of what \nneeds to change. A lot of the amendments tonight were accepted only on \nthe basis that they would preclude debate. Now it is Thursday night. \nThe Senate is not in session tomorrow. And the question people have to \nask is, why didn't we debate those amendments? Why didn't we want to \ndebate those amendments? The reason we didn't want to debate those \namendments is because they are going to be discarded as soon as we get \nto conference.\n  Let me talk about one of them because I believe it is important. We \nhave had hundreds of stories over the last 2 years of Members of \nCongress who have used the earmark process to enhance the well-being of \neither members of their office staff's families, personal family \nmembers, and even in the House a couple of occasions where they helped \nthemselves. I am thinking particularly about a $1.2 million road that \nwas built for properties owned by the Member of Congress. That fact is, \nthat should have been debated. The American people need to know what \nthe problems are, and there needs to be sunshine. There needs to be \ntransparency about what we do.\n  The question the American people ought to ask is: What is going to \nhappen when this bill goes to conference and what is going to come out? \nAnd is all the rhetoric we heard on the floor truly going to be \nreflected in an ethics bill that will change behavior?\n  A lot of effort has been concentrated on lobbyists. Lobbyists aren't \nthe problem. Members of Congress are the problem. And transparency \nsolves that problem. So we are not going to have transparency anymore. \nWe are going to say you can't take a meal from somebody, but you \ncertainly can deliver on a couple-million-dollar earmark. And we are \ngoing to create a situation where we say we are going to expose it, but \nyou shouldn't count on that happening until the final bill comes.\n  My faith and my hope is that we put everything we have done away and \ndon't do any of the things that have been accepted by the Senate \ntonight because of fear of political consequences, but that we do what \nthe American people want, and that is to be transparent in both our \nactions and our deeds. The way to clean up ethical problems in Congress \nis for the Members to be transparent about what they do. So if this \nbill were to come back and we pass it just as it is, we are going to go \nthrough all these hoops that will have been created, and we are going \nto make sure people don't come to the Senate to serve. We are going to \nhave a ``gotcha'' system. That is what we just passed. Good, honorable \npeople of integrity are going to make an innocent mistake, and they are \ngoing to be gotten. I am not talking about the things that were \nintentionally done that we have seen over the past 4 to 6 years from \nboth parties. I am talking about good, honest people making an innocent \nmistake, and it is going to ruin them. Consequently, people are not \ngoing to come here. Only those who are shielded and armored, who are \ncareerists and have enough money that no matter what happens, they can \ndefend themselves with the trial lawyers they are going to need to \ndefend themselves after we pass all these rules that are going to come.\n  I know this sounds a bit negative now that we have passed supposedly \nan ethics reform bill. But my warning to the American people and to \nthis body is, we should measure that when we see the final product. And \nwe should measure the final product against Senator DeMint's amendment \nfor true transparency on earmarks, my amendment on true lack of ethical \nbias in terms of monetary gain for staff members' families or Members' \nfamilies in terms of earmarks. My faith will be renewed if, in fact, we \ncome out with a great ethics bill. I wait and remain to be convinced \nthat that will be the case.\n  The final point I want to make is process. Why did we not want to \ndebate in front of the American people the idea that it is unethical \nfor somebody to gain monetarily, directly or indirectly, staff member \nor staff member's family, Member's family or Member, from an earmark? \nWhy did we not want to debate that? That is a question the press ought \nto be asking. That is a question we all ought to be asking, as the \nconference comes back.\n  The way we solve the problems with ethics in the Senate is through \ncomplete and total transparency about what we do. And if we are not \nashamed of what we are doing, we should not be ashamed of putting up \nwhat we are doing and how we are doing it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S747]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S747-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

To the extent that a witness designated by a \n     member cannot be scheduled to testify during the time set \n     aside for the hearing, a special time will be set aside for \n     the witness to testify if the member designating that witness \n     is available at that time to chair the hearing.\n       Rule 15. Audiences.--Persons admitted into the audience for \n     open hearings of the committee shall conduct themselves with \n     the dignity, decorum, courtesy and propriety traditionally \n     observed by the Senate. Demonstrations of approval or \n     disapproval of any statement or act by any member or witness \n     are not allowed. Persons creating confusion or distractions \n     or otherwise disrupting the orderly proceeding of the hearing \n     shall be expelled from the hearing.\n       Rule 16. Broadcasting of Hearings.--\n       (a) Broadcasting of open hearings by television or radio \n     coverage shall be allowed upon approval by the chairman of a \n     request filed with the staff director not later than noon of \n     the day before the day on which such coverage is desired.\n       (b) If such approval is granted, broadcasting coverage of \n     the hearing shall be conducted unobtrusively and in \n     accordance with the standards of dignity, propriety, courtesy \n     and decorum traditionally observed by the Senate.\n       (c) Equipment necessary for coverage by television and \n     radio media shall not be installed in, or removed from, the \n     hearing room while the committee is in session.\n       (d) Additional lighting may be installed in the hearing \n     room by the media in order to raise the ambient lighting \n     level to the lowest level necessary to provide adequate \n     television coverage of the hearing at the then current state \n     of the art of television coverage.\n       (e) The additional lighting authorized by subsection (d) of \n     this rule shall not be directed into the eyes of any members \n     of the committee or of any witness, and at the request of any \n     such member or witness, offending lighting shall be \n     extinguished.\n       (f) No witness shall be required to be photographed at any \n     hearing or to give testimony while the broadcasting (or \n     coverage) of that hearing is being conducted. At the request \n     of any such witness who does not wish to be subjected to \n     radio or television coverage, all equipment used for coverage \n     shall be turned off.\n       Rule 17. Subcommittees.--(a) The chairman, subject to the \n     approval of the committee, shall appoint legislative \n     subcommittees. The ranking minority member shall recommend to \n     the chairman appointment of minority members to the \n     subcommittees. All legislation shall be kept on the full \n     committee calendar unless a majority of the members present \n     and voting agree to refer specific legislation to an \n     appropriate subcommittee.\n       (b) The chairman may limit the period during which House-\n     passed legislation referred\n\n[[Page S748]]\n\n     to a subcommittee under paragraph (a) will remain in that \n     subcommittee. At the end of that period, the legislation will \n     be restored to the full committee calendar. The period \n     referred to in the preceding sentences should be 6 weeks, but \n     may be extended in the event that adjournment or a long \n     recess is imminent.\n       (c) All decisions of the chairman are subject to approval \n     or modification by a majority vote of the committee.\n       (d) The full committee may at any time by majority vote of \n     those members present discharge a subcommittee from further \n     consideration of a specific piece of legislation.\n       (e) Because the Senate is constitutionally prohibited from \n     passing revenue legislation originating in the Senate, \n     subcommittees may mark up legislation originating in the \n     Senate and referred to them under Rule 16(a) to develop \n     specific proposals for full committee consideration but may \n     not report such legislation to the full committee. The \n     preceding sentence does not apply to nonrevenue legislation \n     originating in the Senate.\n       (f) The chairman and ranking minority members shall serve \n     as nonvoting ex officio members of the subcommittees on which \n     they do not serve as voting members.\n       (g) Any member of the committee may attend hearings held by \n     any subcommittee and question witnesses testifying before \n     that subcommittee.\n       (h) Subcommittee meeting times shall be coordinated by the \n     staff director to insure that--\n       (1) no subcommittee meeting will be held when the committee \n     is in executive session, except by unanimous consent;\n       (2) no more than one subcommittee will meet when the full \n     committee is holding hearings; and\n       (3) not more than two subcommittees will meet at the same \n     time.\n       Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a subcommittee may \n     meet when the full committee is holding hearings and two \n     subcommittees may meet at the same time only upon the \n     approval of the chairman and the ranking minority member of \n     the committee and subcommittees involved.\n       (i) All nominations shall be considered by the full \n     committee.\n       (j) The chairman will attempt to schedule reasonably \n     frequent meetings of the full committee to permit \n     consideration of legislation reported favorably to the \n     committee by the subcommittees.\n       Rule 18. Transcripts of Committee Meetings.--An accurate \n     record shall be kept of all markups of the committee, whether \n     they be open or closed to the public. This record, marked as \n     ``uncorrected,'' shall be available for inspection by Members \n     of the Senate, or members of the committee together with \n     their staffs, at any time. This record shall not be published \n     or made public in any way except:\n       (a) By majority vote of the committee after all members of \n     the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to correct \n     their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately reflect \n     statements made.\n       (b) Any member may release his own remarks made in any \n     markup of the committee provided that every member or witness \n     whose remarks are contained in the released portion is given \n     a reasonable opportunity before release to correct their \n     remarks.\n       Notwithstanding the above, in the case of the record of an \n     executive session of the committee that is closed to the \n     public pursuant to Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, the record shall not be published or made public in \n     any way except by majority vote of the committee after all \n     members of the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to \n     correct their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately \n     reflect statements made.\n       Rule 19. Amendment of Rules.--The foregoing rules may be \n     added to, modified, amended or suspended at any time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S748-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S748-S749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI requires each \ncommittee to adopt rules to govern the procedures of the Committee and \nto publish those rules in the Congressional Record not later than March \n1 of the first year of each Congress. Today, January 18, 2007, the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship held a business \nmeeting during which the members of the committee unanimously adopted \nrules to govern the procedures of the committee. Consistent with \nStanding Rule XXVI, I am submitting for printing in the Congressional \nRecord a copy of the Rules of the Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship for the 110th Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Rules for the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship--110th \n                                Congress\n\n\n                               1. general\n\n       All applicable provisions of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, the Senate Resolutions, and the Legislative \n     Reorganization Acts of 1946 and of 1970 (as amended), shall \n     govern the Committee.\n\n\n                              2. meetings\n\n       (a) The regular meeting day of the Committee shall be the \n     first Wednesday of each month unless otherwise directed by \n     the Chairman. All other meetings may be called by the \n     Chairman as he or she deems necessary, on 5 business days \n     notice where practicable. If at least three Members of the \n     Committee desire the Chairman to call a special meeting, they \n     may file in the office of the Committee a written request \n     therefore, addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, \n     the Clerk of the Committee shall notify the Chairman of such \n     request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, the Chairman fails to call the requested special \n     meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar days after the \n     filing of such request, a majority of the Committee Members \n     may file in the Office of the Committee their written notice \n     that a special Committee meeting will be held, specifying the \n     date, hour and place thereof, and the Committee shall meet at \n     that time and place. Immediately upon the filing of such \n     notice, the Clerk of the Committee shall notify all Committee \n     Members that such special meeting will be held and inform \n     them of its date, hour and place. If the Chairman is not \n     present at any regular, additional or special meeting, such \n     member of the Committee as the Chairman shall designate shall \n     preside.\n       (b) It shall not be in order for the Committee to consider \n     any amendment in the first degree proposed to any measure \n     under consideration by the Committee unless thirty written \n     copies of such amendment have been delivered to the Clerk of \n     the Committee at least 2 business days prior to the meeting. \n     This subsection may be waived by agreement of the Chairman \n     and Ranking Member or by a majority vote of the members of \n     the Committee.\n\n\n                               3. quorums\n\n       (a)(1) A majority of the Members of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum for reporting any legislative measure or \n     nomination.\n       (2) One-third of the Members of the Committee shall \n     constitute a quorum for the transaction of routine business, \n     provided that one Minority Member is present. The term \n     ``routine business'' includes, but is not limited to, the \n     consideration of legislation pending before the Committee and \n     any amendments thereto, and voting on such amendments.\n       (3) In hearings, whether in public or closed session, a \n     quorum for the asking of testimony, including sworn \n     testimony, shall consist of one Member of the Committee.\n       (b) Proxies will be permitted in voting upon the business \n     of the Committee by Members who are unable to be present. To \n     be valid, proxies must be signed and assign the right to vote \n     on the date of the meeting to one of the Members who will be \n     present. Proxies shall in no case be counted for establishing \n     a quorum.\n\n\n                             4. nominations\n\n       In considering a nomination, the Committee shall conduct an \n     investigation or review of the nominee's experience, \n     qualifications, suitability, and integrity to serve in the \n     position to which he or she has been nominated. In any \n     hearings on the nomination, the nominee shall be called to \n     testify under oath on all matters relating to his or her \n     nomination for office. To aid in such investigation or \n     review, each nominee may be required to submit a sworn \n     detailed statement including biographical, financial, policy, \n     and other information which the Committee may request. The \n     Committee may specify which items in such statement are to be \n     received on a confidential basis.\n\n\n               5. hearings, subpoenas, and legal counsel\n\n       (a)(1) The Chairman of the Committee may initiate a hearing \n     of the Committee on his or her authority or upon his or her \n     approval of a request by any Member of the Committee. If such \n     request is by the Ranking Member, a decision shall be \n     communicated to the Ranking Member within 7 business days. \n     Written notice of all hearings, including the title, a \n     description of the hearing, and a tentative witness list \n     shall be given at least 5 business days in advance, where \n     practicable, to all Members of the Committee.\n       (2) Hearings of the Committee shall not be scheduled \n     outside the District of Columbia unless specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member or \n     by consent of a majority of the Committee. Such consent may \n     be given informally, without a meeting, but must be in \n     writing.\n       (b)(1) Any Member of the Committee shall be empowered to \n     administer the oath to any witness testifying as to fact.\n       (2) The Chairman and Ranking Member shall be empowered to \n     call an equal number of witnesses to a Committee hearing. \n     Such number shall exclude any Administration witness unless \n     such witness would be the sole hearing witness, in which case \n     the Ranking Member shall be entitled to invite one witness. \n     The preceding two sentences shall not apply when a witness \n     appears as the nominee. Interrogation of witnesses at \n     hearings shall be conducted on behalf of the Committee by \n     Members of the Committee or such Committee staff as is \n     authorized by the Chairman or Ranking Minority Member.\n       (3) Witnesses appearing before the Committee shall file \n     with the Clerk of the Committee a written statement of the \n     prepared\n\n[[Page S749]]\n\n     testimony at least two business days in advance of \n     the hearing at which the witness is to appear unless this \n     requirement is waived by the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member.\n       (c) Any witness summoned to a public or closed hearing may \n     be accompanied by counsel of his own choosing, who shall be \n     permitted while the witness is testifying to advise him of \n     his legal rights. Failure to obtain counsel will not excuse \n     the witness from appearing and testifying.\n       (d) Subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, and other \n     materials may be issued by the Chairman with the consent of \n     the Ranking Minority Member or by the consent of a majority \n     of the Members of the Committee. Such consent may be given \n     informally, without a meeting, but must be in writing. The \n     Chairman may subpoena attendance or production without the \n     consent of the Ranking Minority Member when the Chairman has \n     not received notification from the Ranking Minority Member of \n     disapproval of the subpoena within 72 hours of being notified \n     of the intended subpoena, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and \n     holidays. Subpoenas shall be issued by the Chairman or by the \n     Member of the Committee designated by him or her. A subpoena \n     for the attendance of a witness shall state briefly the \n     purpose of the hearing and the matter or matters to which the \n     witness is expected to testify. A subpoena for the production \n     of memoranda, documents, records, and other materials shall \n     identify the papers or materials required to be produced with \n     as much particularity as is practicable.\n       (e) The Chairman shall rule on any objections or assertions \n     of privilege as to testimony or evidence in response to \n     subpoenas or questions of Committee Members and staff in \n     hearings.\n\n\n                      6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\n       (a) No confidential testimony taken by, or confidential \n     material presented to, the Committee in executive session, or \n     any report of the proceedings of a closed hearing, or \n     confidential testimony or material submitted pursuant to a \n     subpoena, shall be made public, either in whole or in part or \n     by way of summary, unless authorized by a majority of the \n     Members. Other confidential material or testimony submitted \n     to the Committee may be disclosed if authorized by the \n     Chairman with the consent of the Ranking Member.\n       (b) Persons asserting confidentiality of documents or \n     materials submitted to the Committee offices shall clearly \n     designate them as such on their face. Designation of \n     submissions as confidential does not prevent their use in \n     furtherance of Committee business.\n\n\n                       7. MEDIA AND BROADCASTING\n\n       (a) At the discretion of the Chairman, public meetings of \n     the Committee may be televised, broadcasted, or recorded in \n     whole or in part by a member of the Senate Press Gallery or \n     an employee of the Senate. Any such person wishing to \n     televise, broadcast, or record a Committee meeting must \n     request approval of the Chairman by submitting a written \n     request to the Committee Office by 5 p.m. the day before \n     the meeting. Notice of televised or broadcasted hearings \n     shall be provided to the Ranking Minority Member as soon \n     as practicable.\n       (b) During public meetings of the Committee, any person \n     using a camera, microphone, or other electronic equipment may \n     not position or use the equipment in a way that interferes \n     with the seating, vision, or hearing of Committee members or \n     staff on the dais, or with the orderly process of the \n     meeting.\n\n\n                            8. SUBCOMMITTEES\n\n       The Committee shall not have standing subcommittees.\n\n\n                         9. AMENDMENT OF RULES\n\n       The foregoing rules may be added to, modified or amended; \n     provided, however, that not less than a majority of the \n     entire Membership so determined at a regular meeting with due \n     notice, or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S749-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S749-S750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE USS ``CHEYENNE''\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to honor SSN 773, the USS \nCheyenne, for her 10 years of service in the U.S. Navy in defense of \nour freedom.\n  On July 6, 1992, the keel was laid for the USS Cheyenne in Newport \nNews, VA. She was launched on April 16, 1995. On September 13, 1996, \nMrs. Ann Simpson sponsored the USS Cheyenne. I am pleased to now occupy \nthe seat of Ann's husband, Senator Alan Simpson, in the U.S. Senate.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the USS Cheyenne has been engaged in \nimportant missions as part of the global war on terrorism. The USS \nCheyenne earned the distinction of the first to strike when she was the \nfirst ship to launch Tomahawk missiles in Operation Iraqi Freedom under \nthe command of Commander Charles Doty. She would go on to successfully \nlaunch her entire complement of Tomahawks, earning a clean sweep for \ncombat actions in the final three months of her nine month deployment. \nThat level of excellence continues today from her homeport in Pearl \nHarbor, HI.\n  The USS Cheyenne is the last Los Angeles class submarine built and \nthe third ship in our Nation's fleet named in honor of the city home to \nWyoming's State capital. The first USS Cheyenne, a tugboat, entered \nservice in 1898. The second USS Cheyenne, BM 10, was originally the \nmonitor class USS Wyoming. In 1909 it was renamed USS Cheyenne to make \nthe name available for the battleship BB 32, the new USS Wyoming. \nFiction writer Tom Clancy further cemented the legend of the USS \nCheyenne when he made the submarine a central player in a battle for \nthe Spratly Islands in his novel ``SSN.''\n  Cheyenne, Wyoming's motto is ``Live the Legend.'' The 145 submariners \nwho are aboard the USS Cheyenne have adopted the motto ``Ride the \nLegend.'' The city of Cheyenne has formed a special bond with the crew \nof her namesake. Each year the outstanding sailors of the USS Cheyenne \nare the guests of the city of Cheyenne for Cheyenne Frontier Days, the \nworld's largest outdoor rodeo, and the ``Daddy of them All''. Many of \nthe sailors have never been out West or been to a rodeo. For a week the \nsubmariners enjoy Wyoming hospitality and have a chance to live the \nlegend. It is a small chance for Wyoming and the people of Cheyenne to \nrepay a debt of gratitude to the crew of the USS Cheyenne.\n  Commander Michael Tesar assumed command of the USS Cheyenne on June \n4, 2006. I wish him well in his new command and thank Commander Richard \nTestyon Jr. for his time at the helm. Commander Tesar brings extensive \nexperience to the USS Cheyenne and will lead SSN 773 well.\n  The best skippers are complemented by outstanding crew; I would like \nto honor the crew of the USS Cheyenne.

Madam President, today I honor Richard H. Shapiro, who \nretired as executive director of the Congressional Management \nFoundation, CMF, in December after 18 years of service with the \nfoundation and 17 years as its executive director. During those 18 \nyears, Mr. Shapiro has worked tirelessly to help all member and \ncommittee offices operate more productively and efficiently.\n  Mr. Shapiro is a talented business consultant who has adapted many of \nthe best practice methods of the business world to the unique \ninstitution that is the congressional office, and taken the time to \ntrain thousands of congressional staffers in these methods. In \naddition, Mr. Shapiro and his staff at CMF have conducted \norganizational assessments for member, committee and leadership \noffices. Some years ago, he was kind enough to conduct a structure \nevaluation for my Senate office, and he made several useful suggestions \nregarding my office's mail operation, web site and internal \ncommunications. My office implemented them all, and both my office and \nconstituents are all better off for it.\n  He has also helped many new Members of Congress set up both their \nWashington and district offices, a task that can be very daunting for \nanyone new to Congress. He has also conducted individual assessments \nand coaching for senior managers and Members. Under his leadership, the \nCMF began offering management guidance to congressional officers \nresponsible for managing the House or Senate as a whole. Furthermore, \nMr. Shapiro has helped to coordinate bipartisan events for all the \nChiefs of Staff, which helps them get to know each other and work \ntogether better.\n  Mr. Shapiro was also a leader in promoting the use of the World Wide \nWeb and other digital forms of communications in Congress. Under his \nleadership, the CMF pushed for Members of Congress to establish Web \nsites that constituents could use to e-mail their representatives and \nget information on Congress. The CMF continues to encourage \ncongressional offices to improve their Web sites by giving out the \nannual Golden Mouse award to the office with the best and most \ninnovative Web site.\n  Considering all that CMF has done under Mr. Shapiro's leadership, one \nis very surprised to find out that CMF has a very small staff and \nbudget. But those who know Mr. Shapiro would tell you that, given his \ntalent and dedication, it is no big surprise that CMF was able to \nprovide so many quality services under his helm.\n  Madam President, it my sincerest pleasure to thank Richard Shapiro \nfor sharing his talent and dedication with us for so many years. \nCongress is a better place for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S750-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S750-S751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ART BUCHWALD--THE MARK TWAIN OF OUR TIME\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President it is with a heavy heart that I rise to \npay tribute to Art Buchwald. Art finally said good-bye to all of us \nlast night. It was far too soon.\n  Art is survived by his son Joel and his wife Tamara--who he lived \nwith for so many wonderful years--his daughters Jennifer and Connie, \nhis two sisters and five grandchildren. We are fortunate to have had \nhim for so long, and he will be missed very much.\n  Art was an incredible friend to my wife Vicki and me and to the \nentire Kennedy family. We all enjoyed Art's company and columns, and \nPresident Kennedy was known to read Art's column regularly while he was \nin the White House.\n  We enjoyed so many delightful times together. Whether here in \nWashington or on Martha's Vineyard, Art brought tons of laughter into \nour lives. We'll continue to remember him and his wife, Ann McGarry \nBuchwald, as they will now be laid to rest together on the Vineyard.\n  Art was the Mark Twain of our time. He will forever live on in our \nhearts and minds for his brilliant wit and observations. For decades \nthere was no better way to start the day than to open the morning paper \nto Art's column, laugh out loud and learn all over again to take the \nissues seriously in the world of politics, but not take yourself too \nseriously.\n  As Art said, ``Whether it's the best of times or the worst of times, \nit's the only time we've got.'' The special art of Art Buchwald was to \nmake even the worst of times better. We are fortunate to have had him \nfor so long, and I will miss him very much.\n  Art was born in 1925 in Mount Vernon, New York, and made his own way \nin the world becoming a renowned political humorist and highly regarded \ncolumnist. In 1982, he received a Pulitzer Prize. Art never stopped \nworking--writing and making us laugh right up until the very end.\n  Just last November, he published his final book, ``Too Soon To Say \nGoodbye.'' He even had the foresight to write one final column--\npublished today. Among his final words were these:\n\n       I don't know how well I've done while I was here, but I'd \n     like to think that some of my printed works will persevere at \n     least for three years.\n\n  In fact, Art, they'll persevere forever.\n  Vicki and I remember fondly celebrating Art's 80th birthday just over \na year ago with The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, together with \nmy sister Eunice and her husband Sargent Shriver. Like every gathering \nwith Art, it was an evening full of joy, humor and passion. Art was a \ngreat friend to the Brady Center and an inspiring advocate for sensible \ngun laws. He was a true leader for the cause and we are closer to our \ngoal of rational gun control today because of him.\n  Art was also an outspoken and powerful advocate on the importance of \nmental health care, speaking openly about his own experiences and \nproviding hope to some many others.\n  When we lost President Kennedy, Art honored him with his column, ``We \nWeep.'' He wrote:\n\n       We weep for our president who died for his country. We weep \n     for his wife and his children, brothers and sisters. We weep \n     for the millions of people who are weeping for him. We weep \n     for Americans that this could happen in our country. We weep \n     for the Europeans and the Africans and the Asians and people \n     in every corner of the globe who saw in him a hope for the \n     future and a chance for mankind.\n\n  Today, Art, the world weeps for you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Art Buchwald's final column, published \ntoday, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         (From the International Herald Tribune, Jan. 18, 2007)\n\n      Meanwhile: Goodbye, My Friends. What a Pleasure It Has Been!\n\n                           (By Art Buchwald)\n\n       Art Buchwald, who began his long career as a humor \n     columnist at this newspaper, asked that this column be \n     published following his death, which came on Wednesday at his \n     home in Washington.\n       Several of my friends have persuaded me to write this final \n     column, which is something they claim I shouldn't leave \n     without doing.\n       There comes a time when you start adding up all the pluses \n     and minuses of your life. In my case I'd like to add up all \n     the great tennis games I played and all of the great players \n     I overcame with my now famous ``lob.''\n       I will always believe that my tennis game was one of the \n     greatest of all time. Even Kay Graham, who couldn't stand \n     being on the other side of the net from me, in the end \n     forgave me.\n       I can't cover all the subjects I want to in one final \n     column, but I would just like to say what a great pleasure it \n     has been knowing all of you and being a part of your lives.\n       Each of you has, in your own way, contributed to my life.\n       Now, to get down to the business at hand, I have had many \n     choices concerning how I\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\n     wanted to go. Most of them are very civilized, particularly \n     hospice care. A hospice makes it very easy for you when you \n     decide to go.\n       What's interesting is that everybody has his or her own \n     opinion as to how you should go out. All my loved ones became \n     very upset because they thought I should brave it out--which \n     meant more dialysis.\n       But here is the most important thing: This has been my \n     decision. And it's a healthy one.\n       The person who was the most supportive at the end was my \n     doctor, Mike Newman. Members of my family, while they didn't \n     want me to go, were supportive, too.\n       But I'm putting it down on paper, so there should be no \n     question the decision was mine.\n       I chose to spend my final days in a hospice because it \n     sounded like the most painless way to go, and you don't have \n     to take a lot of stuff with you.\n       For some reason my mind keeps turning to food. I know I \n     have not eaten all the eclairs I always wanted. In recent \n     months, I have found it hard to go past the Cheesecake \n     Factory without at least having a profiterole and a banana \n     split.\n       I know it's a rather silly thing at this stage of the game \n     to spend so much time on food. But then again, as life went \n     on and there were fewer and fewer things I could eat, I am \n     now punishing myself for having passed up so many good things \n     earlier in the trip.\n       I think of a song lyric, ``What's it all about, Alfie?'' I \n     don't know how well I've done while I was here, but I'd like \n     to think some of my printed works will persevere--at least \n     for three years.\n       I know it's very egocentric to believe that someone is put \n     on earth for a reason. In my case, I like to think I was. And \n     after this column appears in the paper following my passing, \n     I would like to think it will either wind up on a cereal box \n     top or be repeated every Thanksgiving Day.\n       So, ``What's it all about, Alfie?'' is my way of saying \n     goodbye.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S751-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DEATHS IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, yesterday morning, January 17, a convoy \ncarrying a staff member of the National Democratic Institute and \nmembers of her security team was ambushed in Baghdad.\n  Andrea Parhamovich, an American citizens, was killed. Three other NDI \nemployees, citizens from Croatia, Hungary, and Iraq, also lost their \nlives in the attack.\n  Since June 2003, the National Democratic Institute has been working \nwith Iraqi citizens, outside the Green Zone and at great risk, to help \nbuild the foundations on which a true democracy depends. I did not know \nMs. Parhamovich, whose life was taken so tragically yesterday. But all \nof us recognize the ideals which inspired her to undertake such a \ndangerous mission for her country and the people of Iraq.\n  I offer my deepest respect and appreciation to her last true measure \nof devotion to democratic ideals. To her family, and the families of \nthose who were also killed, I offer my deepest condolences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S751-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LaMESA MARKS-JOHNS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

WILLARD LASSETER\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, it is with great pride that \ntoday I honor my dear friend and fellow Georgian, Willard Lasseter, who \nrecently completed his 50th year with John Deere's Lasseter Tractor \nCompany, Inc. Willard and I not only share a strong desire for a \nsuccessful agriculture sector throughout Georgia and the United States, \nbut we also share the same hometown of Moultrie, GA.\n  Willard began his many years of service to the farmers of Colquitt \nCounty in 1945 when he began to work part time for the local John Deere \ndealership. In 1956, with a little over $14,000 in borrowed money, \nWillard purchased a 25 percent share of the John Deere dealership and \non December 1, 1956, Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc. had its first day \nof business. By 1959, Willard, along with help from his father, had \nsecured the remaining shares of the John Deere dealership. The success \nof the business was almost instantaneous as Lasseter Tractor Company \nbecame the No. 1 dealer in terms of sales volume for the Atlanta branch \nof John Deere dealerships by 1960.\n  Since its first day of business Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc. has \nbeen a model dealership for Deere and Company. Lasseter Tractor \nCompany, Inc.'s many accomplishments include being named to the John \nDeere's Manager Club for 12 consecutive years, being a John Deere \nSignature Dealer for top performance in the market place for 5 \nconsecutive years, and being a Gold Star dealer for top performance in \ncommercial products in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Lasseter Tractor Company, \nInc. has also garnered the top market share in the Atlanta branch of \ndealerships for 3 consecutive years.\n  Through the years, Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc. has continued to \nexpand and prosper. In the late 1990's Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc. \nbegan construction of a state-of-the-art dealership and service \nfacility that encompasses over 45,000 square feet. The service center \nitself can accommodate over 20 cotton pickers. This is not only an \nimportant feature but it is also a necessary feature because Lasseter \nTractor Company, Inc., is among the top dealerships for sales and \nservicing of cotton pickers.\n  Today's Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc., spans south Georgia with \ndealerships in three counties. Not only has the business increased in \nsize but also in the number of generations that are now involved in the \nbusiness. Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc., now includes Willard's son \nTony and grandson Judd, who oversee the day-to-day operations of the \nbusiness. One philosophy that Lasseter Tractor Company, Inc., has \nmaintained throughout its existence is: ``You must give your customers \nthe best product at the fairest price possible.'' This is a philosophy \nthat has allowed the company to continue to meet and exceed the needs \nof its customers.\n  It is hard to imagine what the state of agriculture might be in \nsouthwest Georgia if that young high school student, Willard Lasseter, \ndid not step into the John Deere dealership in Moultrie, GA, in 1945 to \nbegin working part time.\n  I am extremely proud of the milestone that Willard has just met and \nit is my sincere hope that he continues his success in the agribusiness \ncommunity for many years to come. I want to thank my colleagues for \ngiving me the opportunity to recognize my dear friend Willard \nLasseter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S751-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S751-S752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING THOMAS WATSON BROWN\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, today I mourn the passing and \npay tribute to a wonderful Georgian and a personal friend. Thomas \nWatson Brown passed away on January 13, 2007, leaving a tremendous void \nin the hearts of all who knew and loved this extraordinary gentleman.\n  Although he was a longtime resident of Marietta, GA, Tom was actually \nborn here in our Nation's Capital where he attended Saint Alban's \nSchool. He graduated magna cum laude from Princeton with a degree in \nhistory and served a stint in the U.S. Army. He graduated from Harvard \nLaw School in 1959 and moved to Atlanta where he practiced law until \nhis death.\n  Although Tom was not originally from Georgia, his family had deep \nGeorgia roots. His great-grandfather was U.S. Senator Tom Watson, who\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\nwas nominated in 1896 for Vice President on the Populist Party ticket \nwith William Jennings Bryan. Brown's grandfather, J.J. Brown, served as \nGeorgia's commissioner of agriculture.\n  Tom was a character unlike any other. He often described himself as \nan ``18th-century gentleman'' and held court in his antebellum mansion \non Cherokee Street near the Marietta Square arguing politics with a \nhost of different personalities. History was his greatest passion, \nespecially the Civil War era. He had an unmatched intellect and was a \nrespected historian. He preferred his 10,000-volume library to a \npersonal computer.\n  Tom was also always ready to support education. He was the former \nchair of the Watson-Brown Foundation, established by his father Walter \nBrown in 1970 to provide college opportunities for underprivileged boys \nand girls. Today his son Tad is president of the foundation, which \nawards more than $1 million annually in merit- and need-based college \nscholarships to students from the Central Savannah River Area of \nGeorgia and South Carolina. The foundation also gives grants in support \nof southern colleges and universities. Recipients of these grants \ninclude the University of Georgia for a broadcast museum, Georgia \nCollege and State University in Milledgeville for its library, and \nMercer Press in Macon for publications of numerous books of Southern \nhistory and biography.\n  Tom led numerous business, civic, philanthropic, and scholarly \norganizations. He served on the boards of the Atlanta Historical \nSociety, the Georgia Historical Society, the Georgia Civil War \nCommission, the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, and the Georgia Legal \nHistory Foundation. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of the \nAtlanta Press Club and helped fund its debates each election cycle.\n  Tom was awarded the Martin Luther King, Jr., Center's community \nservice award for peace and justice. Coretta Scott King herself \npresented him with the award for his substantial contributions to and \nsupport of the Legal Aid Society of Atlanta.\n  This strong-willed and generous man will always be remembered for his \nkeen intellect and his devotion to history and education. He touched \nthe lives of many Georgians, including this Senator, through his \nefforts on behalf of our community and State.\n  It was an honor to know Thomas Watson Brown and it is a privilege to \npay tribute to his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S752-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S752-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S752-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n   FOREIGN TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN TO DISRUPT THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE \n                             PROCESS--PM #1\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the \nFederal Register for publication the enclosed notice, stating that the \nemergency declared with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to \ndisrupt the Middle East peace process is to continue in effect beyond \nJanuary 23, 2007. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was \npublished in the Federal Register on January 20, 2006 (71 FR 3407).\n  The crisis with respect to the grave acts of violence committed by \nforeign terrorists that disrupt the Middle East peace process and that \nled to the declaration of a national emergency on January 23, 1995, as \nexpanded on August 20, 1998, has not been resolved. Terrorist groups \ncontinue to engage in activities that have the purpose or effect of \nthreatening the Middle East peace process and that are hostile to \nUnited States interests in the region. Such actions constitute an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I have \ndetermined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency \ndeclared with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the \nMiddle East peace process and to maintain in force the economic \nsanctions against them to respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to authorize secure borders and comprehensive \nimmigration reform, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today before the \nSenate. This is an issue this Senate visited 9 months ago in the month \nof May. Nine months ago, the Senate tackled what I submit is the most \nimportant domestic issue in the United States of America and in every \nState. That is the issue of legal immigration and illegal immigration.\n  In that debate of what became known as a comprehensive immigration \nreform bill, I submitted an amendment that ended up being amendment No. \n1. The amendment simply said that before any provision of this act that \ngrants legal status to someone who is in America illegally takes \neffect, the Secretary of Homeland Security will certify to the Congress \nthat all of the provisions of border security contained in the bill \nwere funded, in place, and operational. It become known as a trigger--\nand it was a trigger--because the immigration issue is not like when \nyou can never figure what is the chicken, what is the egg, and what \ncame first. There is no way to reform illegal immigration unless you \nfirst stop the porous borders we have and the flow of illegal \nimmigrants. But to do only one without the other is a terrible mistake.\n  The result of last year's debate was the Senate passed a bill without \nthe trigger that granted new legal statuses. Although it provided for \nthe authorization of border security, it did not provide for the \nguarantee of border security. The House reaction was, we want border \nsecurity only, and the debate to this day between the House and the \nSenate has been the Senate is for comprehensive reform and the House is \nfor border security only and never the twain will meet. The twain must \nmeet. It is the No. 1 domestic issue.\n  I come to the Senate today to introduce a major immigration reform \nbill that is the bridge from where we are to where we must go. For a \nmoment, I will discuss the provisions of that proposal.\n  First of all, it contains the trigger. It predicates any reform of \nimmigration that grants legal status to someone here illegally to be \nnoneffective until we have first closed the doors to the south and to \nthe north. It provides for all the security measures the Senate passed \nlast year--and they are 2,500 new port-of-entry inspectors, 14,000 \nborder inspectors, trained and ready to deploy, $454 million for \nunmanned aerial vehicles to give us the 24/7 eyes in the sky essential \nto enforcement on our border, authorization and ultimate appropriation \nfor those barriers and those fences and those roads that are necessary \nfor our agents to patrol, 20,000 beds for detention, to end the \npractice of cash and release.\n  When I came to the Senate 2 years ago as a Georgian and one who loves \nthe outdoors, I thought ``catch and release'' was a fishing term. I \nfound out it became a border term, where we would catch people, tell \nthem to go home, release them and they would wait for us to leave and \ncome back again.\n  We must remember the reason we have this problem is we have the \ngreatest Nation on the face of this Earth. We do not find anyone trying \nto break out of the United States of America. They are all trying to \nbreak in and for a very special reason: The promise of hope, \nopportunity, and jobs. But we must make the right way to come to \nAmerica be the legal way to come to America, not the ease of crossing \nour border in the dark of night under some other cover.\n  Lastly, an integral part of border security is a verifiable program, \nwhere\n\n[[Page S755]]\n\nAmerica's employers can be given a verifiable ID by someone who is here \nlegally that verifies they are who they say they are. The biggest \ngrowth industry in the United States of America on our southwestern \nborder is forged documents. We have a proliferation today of forged \ndocuments, where illegal aliens have legal-looking documents and we \nhave a customs and immigration system that cannot tell an American \nfarmer or an American employer that, in fact, the document they were \nshown is, in fact, right or wrong. That has to be fixed.\n  Once those provisions are in, we have a secure border. Interestingly \nenough, it takes about the same amount of time to put in the barriers, \nget unmanned aerial vehicles in the air, train the border security and \nport-of-entry people as it takes to get the verifiable identification \nsystem in place. We know both will take about 24 months.\n  When we have the trigger, it does not protract reform, but it \nprecedes the implementation of what is going to take 24 months to do \nanyway. And all of a sudden we have a new paradigm in America. Those \nwho want to come here realize the way to come is the legal way, not the \nillegal way. They learn there are consequences to coming illegally and \nemployers know when they get an ID they can either swipe it on a \ncomputer or they can go up on the Internet and code to customs and \nimmigration and find out that person is legal. The paradigm changes, \nand then the hope and opportunity of reforming legal immigration in \nthis country can become a reality.\n  I am not an obstructionist to doing it. In fact, if anything needs to \nbe done, we need to reform the legal system because we almost promote, \nthrough the rigidity and difficulty of legal immigration, coming here \nillegally because we are looking the other way on the border. We have a \nhistorical precedent.\n  In 1986, we reformed immigration with the Simpson Act. We granted 3 \nmillion people amnesty, said we were going to secure the border and \ndidn't. Today, we have 12 million because we did not secure that \nborder. That can never happen again.\n  Second, if the border is secure and we give people who are here \nillegally but are lawfully obeying the laws a chance to come forward, \nwe can identify who is here who is not a problem.\n  And you, also, leave open, for those who do not come forward whom you \nmust concentrate on, to see to it they are not here for the wrong \nreasons and they go home. But you can never enforce the system \ninternally before you first close the external opportunity to come \nthrough illegal immigration.\n  Mr. President, in May 1903, Anders Isakson came through Ellis Island \nbecause of the potato famine in Scandinavia. In 1916, my father was \nborn to him and his wife, Josephine. My father became a citizen of this \ncountry because he was born on our soil. In 1926, my grandfather became \na naturalized citizen of the United States of America.\n  In my home today, framed and hanging on the wall, are his \nnaturalization certificates from 1926, when he raised his right arm and \npledged his allegiance to the United States of America. There is no one \nwho has greater respect and greater joy in the promise of this country \nand the opportunity of immigration. But we must begin restoring the \nrespect for legal immigration and shutting the door on illegal \nimmigration, or else those lines become blurred, and the stress we have \non our social service system, civil justice system, public health \nsystem, and public education system that is stretched to the limit \nbecause of illegal aliens today will increase.\n  We owe it to the history of our country and the greatness which makes \nus great to secure our borders, to honor legal immigration, and to move \nforward with a reform of illegal immigration that matches the economic \nneeds of the United States of America.\n  I stand on the Senate floor today committed to work with any Member \nof this Senate for comprehensive reform, as long as its cornerstone in \nits foundation is that we fix the problem on our borders, have it \ncertified, and have that fix be the foundation for the modernization \nand reform of our immigration laws.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nGeorgia. He has described something that for the last several months I \nhave been calling the Isakson principle. I believe the Isakson \nprinciple is the basis for a comprehensive immigration bill that could \nattract 85 to 90 votes in the Senate and could, in a fairly short \nperiod of time, be reconciled with legislation passed by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  It would be a single piece of legislation that would work in two \nstages. It would first secure our border; and then, as the Senator from \nGeorgia says, the trigger would come in, and we would get the rest of \nthe job done. And the rest of the job includes defining who can work \nand who can study in the United States if they come from overseas. The \nrest of the job also includes helping prospective citizens, of which \nthere are about a million a year today--people who are here legally--to \nhelp them learn English, to learn our history, and to learn our \ndemocratic traditions so we can be one country.\n  There is a lot of talk this week about the borders of Iraq. I believe \nthere are some more important borders in this world, at least to us \nAmericans, and they are the borders around our own country. It is more \nimportant that we secure our borders at home than it is to secure the \nborders in Iraq.\n  Last year, both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed an \nimmigration bill. I voted no on the Senate immigration bill. I opposed \nthe bill because I did not believe it did enough to secure our borders. \nIt had some good proposals for border security, and it had a number of \nother excellent proposals, but it did not guarantee they would be \nfunded. We all know that border security on paper means nothing. It \nrequires boots on the ground. It requires jeeps on the roads and \nunmanned aerial vehicles in the air. It requires an employer \nverification system. And it requires adequate funding.\n  So I voted no. But I said at the time I was ready to vote for, and \nwanted to vote for, a comprehensive bill, one that fixed the whole \nproblem. And I suggested then, as did a number of others, that the \nbasis for such a bill was the Isakson principle.\n  Well, instead of getting a bill passed into law, it was a political \nyear, and some Members of the House of Representatives, including some \nmembers of my own party, thought the wiser course was basically to run \nagainst the Senate bill that I voted against. Well, we now know how \nsuccessful that turned out to be. That was not successful because the \nAmerican people expect us to act like grownups, deal with big issues, \nand come to a conclusion.\n  There is no issue upon which we in the Congress have more need to \ncome to a conclusion on than the issue of immigration. It is our \nresponsibility. We cannot kick it to the Governors. We cannot blame the \nmayor of Nashville. We cannot blame anybody in Iraq. It is our job in \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  We should begin to do our job. We should take it up within the next \nfew weeks. We should base our bill on the Isakson principle. And we \nshould not stop our work on the immigration bill until we are finished.\n  The Isakson principle is the basis for success with immigration \nbecause of the so-called trigger. As the Senator from Georgia said, \nonce we put into effect all of the things we need to do to secure the \nborder, the trigger operates, and then we get to all the rest of the \nissues, some of which are hard to solve. But they are made much easier \nto solve once we and the American people are assured the border will be \nsecured.\n  It is outrageous for us in the Senate to preach about the rule of law \nto the rest of the world and ignore it here at home. The rule of law is \none of the most important principles of our country. We should make no \napology, not be embarrassed 1 minute for insisting upon it. Every new \ncitizen knows that. They do not come to this country to become an \nAmerican based upon their color or their ethnic background. They come \nbecause to be an American, you believe in a few principles which you \nmust learn if you are going to become a citizen. Foremost among those \nis the rule of law.\n  So we start with that. But that is not the only principle new \ncitizens learn. There is the principle of laissez-faire--\n\n[[Page S756]]\n\nin other words, a strong economy. And immigrants help a strong economy, \nwhether they are going to be Nobel Prize winners or whether they are \ngoing to be picking fruit in California.\n  There is the principle of equal opportunity. There is the principle \nof e pluribus unum, engraved right up there above the Presiding \nOfficer: How do we become one country? We learn our tradition. We learn \na common language. We adhere to common principles, instead of color and \nbackground. And there is the tradition of the country that we are a \nnation of immigrants. By our failure to act, we are showing a lack of \nrespect for the rule of law and a lack of respect for our tradition as \na nation of immigrants.\n  It is especially outrageous for us not to act when there is no one to \nblame but us. We cannot blame Syria for this one. We cannot blame the \nIraqi Government. We cannot blame Iran. We cannot blame al-Qaida. It is \nus. It is our job. So, Mr. President, I am here today to commend the \nSenator from Georgia. Since last fall, he has had before us the basis \nfor sound, comprehensive immigration legislation--all in one bill; two \nparts: secure our borders; and once that is done, then all the rest of \nit. I believe that would attract 85 or 90 votes. And I would suggest, \nrespectfully, to my friend, the Democratic leader, and my friend, the \nRepublican leader, that if we are looking for things to do that are \nimportant, that the American people expect us to act on, that we have \nalready demonstrated we can work on together, that within a few weeks \nwe take up the matter of immigration, we base it on the Isakson \nprinciple, and we do not stop until we finish the job.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 331.

The bill is a very straightforward \nmeasure that seeks to increase the number of alternative refueling \nstations across our country, something that I hope the full Senate will \nsupport later this year.\n  Today, there are over 9 million alternative fuel automobiles on the \nroad in America. However, while automakers have pledged to produce an \nincreasing number of these vehicles, there is a serious shortfall in \nthe number of gas stations to support these vehicles. For instance, \nwhile there are more than 6 million flex-fuel vehicles on the road \ntoday which can run on E-85 or gasoline, less than 1 percent of all gas \nstations in this country offer E-85 fuel. Clearly, more must be done to \nincrease the availability of alternative fuels at the retail level.\n  The Alternative Energy Refueling Systems Act would authorize the \nDepartment of Energy, through the existing Clean Cities Program, to \nprovide grants to gas station owners who will install alternative \nrefueling systems. These grants would greatly assist in expanding the \navailability of alternative fuels such as E-85, which is a mix of 15 \npercent gasoline and 85 percent ethanol, or biodiesel, natural gas, \ncompressed natural gas, hydrogen, or liquefied petroleum gas.\n  Under this legislation, gas station owners who wish to install a new \nalternative fuel tank would be reimbursed for up to 30 percent of the \ncost, not exceeding $30,000, of expenses related to the purchase and \ninstallation of a new alternative refueling system. Keep in mind that \nsubject to an annual appropriations, funding for these grants would \ncome from a portion of the penalties that are collected annually from \nauto manufacturers who violate the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or \nCAFE standards, most of which are foreign automakers.\n  I have to say the cost to install a pump like this generally runs \nsomewhere from $30,000 to $40,000 to about $200,000, depending on where \nyou are in the country. So obviously, it is a big investment for a lot \nof these filling station owners. But the fact is, they need to have an \nincentive and some assistance to make sure we are closing the gap that \nexists in this country between the production of renewable energy--a \nlot of ethanol production is going on in the country. In my State alone \nwe have 11 plants currently operating, 5 more under construction, and \nwe will be, by 2008, at 1 billion gallons annually of ethanol in South \nDakota alone. So when you add to that the ethanol that is produced in \nother areas of the Midwest, we have a lot of production out there, and \nI think we have a big market growing. We have a renewable fuels \nstandard that requires that we use 7.5 billion gallons annually by the \nyear 2012, which, frankly, I think we will eclipse way before that \ntime. Because at the current rate of production, we are going to blow \nby that in a very short time.\n  But that being said, there is a requirement out there that a market \ndevelop for this. We have a lot of consumers around the country who \nwould like to have access to renewable energy who believe for a lot of \nreasons, as I do, that it makes sense to lessen our dependence upon \nforeign sources of energy, to become more energy secure. It cleans up \nthe environment and, obviously, in my part of the country, it is very \ngood for American agriculture. But what we are missing in that \ndistribution system is the retail level. We have the production, we \nhave the demand, we have a renewable fuels standard, we have a market, \nbut we don't have a way of joining those. Because of the costs \nassociated with installing some of these pumps, a lot of filling \nstation owners are reluctant to do so. What this would do is provide up \nto $30,000 or 30 percent of the cost not to exceed $30,000 toward that \nend. So we think this is a very commonsense approach to doing something \nthat we really need to be doing in America today, and that is moving \naway from our dependence upon the oil industry for our energy.\n  I wanted to tell my colleagues a little bit about who supports this \npiece of legislation. We have a number of businesses, agricultural and \nalternative energy groups, including General Motors, Ford Motors, \nDaimler Chrysler--all the big domestic automakers--Wal-Mart, the \nPetroleum Marketers Association of America, the National Ethanol \nVehicle Coalition, the National Association of Fleet Administrators, \nthe Renewable Fuels Association, the National Biodiesel Board, the \nNational Corn Growers Association, the American Soybean Association, \nthe American Coalition for Ethanol, and the National Association of \nTruck Stop Operators.\n  So up and down the so-called food chain, from the production, the \ncorn growers, the manufacturers of vehicles in this country, those who \nare involved at the retail level with getting fuel out there--filling \nstations, convenience stores--all the agricultural organizations, as I \nsaid, the ethanol industry, are all very much supportive of this \nparticular piece of legislation.\n  A measure very similar to this overwhelmingly passed in the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 355 to 9 back on July 4 of 2006. \nUnfortunately, the Senate was unable to consider our companion measure \nbefore adjourning last year.\n  So Senator Salazar and I wholeheartedly believe this is a commonsense \nmeasure that will significantly increase the number of alternative \nrefueling stations nationwide. As I said earlier, it accomplishes a lot \nof objectives that are important from a policy standpoint, a national \nsecurity standpoint, energy security standpoint, and an environmental \nstandpoint. This, to me, is a win-win, and I hope the Senate will act \non it before this year is out. Hopefully, we will start to consider \nvery seriously in the weeks and months ahead energy legislation and \nanother farm bill, which I hope will have a very robust energy title \nincluded in it. It is high time we did something substantial to lessen \nor to close this gap we have and this problem that needs to be \naddressed in terms of our ability to continue to grow the renewable \nfuels industry in this country, home-grown energy, energy that we get \non an annual basis.\n  We raise a corn crop every year in South Dakota, as they do in Iowa, \nMinnesota, and Nebraska and in other States across this country which \nare all starting to realize the benefits of ethanol production and what \nit means to their agricultural economy. So this\n\n[[Page S757]]\n\nis a good piece of legislation that makes sense in so many ways. I hope \nthe very clear logic of it will help us prevail in getting it passed in \nthe Senate this year.\n  This legislation is cosponsored by Senator Hagel of Nebraska and \nSenator Conrad of North Dakota. I again put this bill before the \nSenate, and I look forward to its consideration.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator Thune today \nin introducing S. 331, the Thune/Salazar Alternative Fuel Grant \nProgram. I am proud that Senators Hagel and Conrad are also joining us \nin this effort.\n  This morning I spoke about the dire threat that our dependence on \nforeign oil poses to our energy security and our national security. We \nare simply too vulnerable to oil shocks, supply disruptions, and the \nwhims of oil-rich and democracy-poor countries.\n  It is time to build a new, clean energy economy that runs on \nbiofuels, wind, solar, and alternative energies. This clean energy \neconomy will move us out of the shadows of our oil dependence. Our \nfarmers, ranchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs should play a lead role \nin this clean energy revolution, and Congress should do more to help \nthem.\n  The bill that Senator Thune and I are introducing today, S. 331, is a \nstraightforward bill that will help expand the availability of \nalternative fuels at our Nation's filling stations.\n  It aims to solve a key problem that is slowing the growth of \nalternative fuels in the transportation sector. Although our farmers \nand ranchers are producing more and more biofuels each year, and our \ncar manufacturers are building more and more vehicles that run on E-85, \nconsumers still have a difficult time finding anything but gasoline at \ntheir filling station.\n  Our alternative fuel infrastructure is woefully behind the times. At \nlast count, only a few hundred filling stations around the country \ncarried E-85 fuel, while more than 6 million flexible fuel vehicles are \non the road.\n  Consumers should have the choice of whether to fill their car with \nbiofuels or with gasoline. Unfortunately, most of them do not.\n  The bill we are introducing is simple. It would provide grants to \neligible gas station owners, farmers, and businesses that install pumps \nto deliver alternative fuels, such as natural gas or E-85.\n  The bill uses funds collected through CAFE penalties--approximately \n$20 million--for grants of up to $30,000. The funding would still be \nsubject to annual appropriations and is budget neutral.\n  This bill will dramatically improve the availability of alternative \nfuels to consumers. It will allow those with E-85 vehicles to finally \nuse the fuel they dream of using. It will also put in place the \ninfrastructure we need for cellulosic ethanol, which is expected to \ncome to market in just a few years.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a serious look at this bill--it is \ncommon sense, straightforward, fills a clear need, and is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  I again thank my colleague from South Dakota for his leadership on \nthis matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 334. A bill to provide affordable, guaranteed private health \ncoverage that will make Americans healthier and can never be taken \naway; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it has been more than a decade since the \nU.S. Senate last addressed fixing health care. I do not think it is \nmorally right for the Senate to duck on health care any longer and that \nis why I am proposing legislation today to provide affordable, \nguaranteed, private health coverage for all Americans.\n  The legislation, called the Healthy Americans Act, ensures care for \nthe 46 million Americans who now live without health insurance, frees \nbusiness owners from the skyrocketing costs of insuring their workers, \nand promises every American health care coverage that can never be \ntaken away. My proposal is fully paid for, holds down health care cost \ngrowth in the future and provides coverage just like Members of \nCongress can get now.\n  America spent $2.2 trillion on health care last year. \nPriceWaterhouseCoopers expects premiums will increase 11 percent this \nyear alone and I believe the American health care system as we know it \nis not sustainable.\n  Our current employer-sponsored health insurance system is a historic \naccident. In the 1940s, employers needed a way to attract workers as \nwage and price controls continued. Our country needs a uniquely \nAmerican solution that works for an economy that is competing not just \nwith the company across town but the company across the world. \nAmericans need a health care system that works for individuals and \nfamilies, and encourages people to stay healthy instead of only seeking \ncare after they are sick.\n  The Healthy Americans Act does this and more. It doesn't take long to \nexplain how the Healthy Americans Act works. From the first day \nindividuals, families and businesses win. The Healthy Americans Act \ncuts the link between health insurance and employment altogether. Under \nthe Healthy Americans Act, businesses paying for employee health \npremiums are required to increase their workers' paychecks by the \namount they spent last year on their health coverage. Federal tax law \nis changed to hold the worker harmless for the extra compensation, and \nthe worker is required to purchase private coverage through an exchange \nin their State that forces insurance companies to offer simplified, \nstandardized coverage, with benefits like a Member of Congress gets, \nand prohibits insurers from engaging in price discrimination.\n  Requiring employers to cash out their health premiums, as I propose \nin the Healthy Americans Act, is good for both employers and workers. \nWith health premiums going up 11 percent this year, employers are going \nto be glad to be exempt from these increases. With the extra money in \ntheir paycheck, workers have a new incentive to shop for their health \ncare and hold down their cost. If a worker can save a few hundred \ndollars on their health care purchase, they can use that money for \nsomething else they need.\n  In addition, the Healthy Americans Act is easy to administer and \nguarantees lifetime health security. Once you have signed up with a \nplan through an exchange in the State in which you live, that is it; \nyou have completed the administrative process. Even if you lose your \njob or you go bankrupt, you can never have your coverage taken away. \nSign up, and the premium you pay for the plan and all of the \nadministrative activities are handled through the tax system. For those \nwho cannot afford private coverage, the Healthy Americans Act \nsubsidizes their purchases.\n  Businesses that have not been able to afford health coverage for \ntheir workers, under the new approach, will pay a fee--one that is \ntiered to their size and revenue, with some paying as little as 2 \npercent of the national average premium amount per worker for that \nbasic benefit package.\n  It will be easy to administer, locally controlled, with guaranteed \ncoverage as good as your Member of Congress gets. The Lewin Group has \ncosted out my proposal and reports that it is fully paid for and in \naddition to expanding coverage for millions of people, guaranteeing \nhealth benefits as good as their Member of Congress gets, it also saves \n$4.5 billion in health spending in the first year. Money is saved by \nreducing the administrative costs of insurance, reducing cost shifting, \nand preventing those needless hospital emergency room visits. Also, \nthere are substantial incentives that come about because insurance \ncompanies would have to compete for the business of consumers, who \nwould have a new incentive to hold down health costs.\n  There are other parts of the Healthy Americans Act I wish to describe \nbriefly. As the name of the legislation suggests, I believe strongly \nthat fixing American health care requires a new ethic of health care \nprevention, a sharp new focus in keeping our citizens well, and trying \nto keep them from falling victim to skyrocketing rates of increase in \ndiabetes, heart attack, and strokes.\n  Spending on these chronic illnesses is soaring, and it is especially \nsad to see so many children and seniors fall victim to these diseases. \nYet many Government programs and private insurance devote most of their \nattention to treating Americans after they are ill and give short \nshrift to wellness.\n\n[[Page S758]]\n\n  Under the Healthy Americans Act, there will be for the first time \nsignificant new incentives for all Americans to stay healthy. They are \nvoluntary incentives, but ones that I think will make a real difference \nin building a national new ethic of wellness and health care \nprevention.\n  Parents who enroll children in wellness programs will be eligible for \ndiscounts in their own premiums. Instead of mandating that parents take \nyoungsters to various health programs--and maybe they do and maybe they \ndon't--the Healthy Americans Act says when a parent takes a child to \none of those wellness programs, the parent would be eligible to get a \ndiscount on the parent's health premiums.\n  Under the Healthy Americans Act, employers who financially support \nhealth care prevention for their workers get incentives for doing that \nas well. Medicare is authorized to reduce outpatient Part B premiums so \nas to reward seniors trying to reduce their cholesterol, lose weight, \nor decrease the risk of stroke. It has never been done before. For \nexample, Part B of Medicare, the outpatient part, doesn't offer any \nincentives for older Americans to change their behavior. Everybody pays \nthe same Medicare Part B premium right now. The Healthy Americans Act \nproposes we change that and ensures that if a senior from Virginia or \nOregon or elsewhere is involved in a wellness program, in health care \nprevention efforts, like smoking cessation, they could get a lower Part \nB premium for doing that.\n  The preventive health efforts I have described are promoted through \nnew voluntary incentives under the Healthy Americans Act, not heavy-\nhanded mandates. What this legislation says is--let's make it more \nattractive for people to stay healthy and change their behaviors to \npromote the kind of wellness practices we all know we should do but \nneed an incentive to follow.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the Healthy Americans Act does not \nharm those who have coverage in order to help those who have nothing. \nThe legislation makes clear that all Americans retain the right to \npurchase as much health care coverage as they want. All Americans will \nenjoy true health security with the Healthy Americans Act, a lifetime \nguarantee of coverage at least as good as their Member of Congress \nreceives.\n  A recent ``Health Affairs'' article pointed out that more than half \nof the Nation's uninsured are ineligible for public programs such as \nMedicaid, but do not have the money to purchase coverage for \nthemselves.\n  At present, for most poor people to receive health benefits, they \nhave to go out and try to squeeze themselves into one of the categories \nthat entitles them to care. Under the Healthy Americans Act, low-income \npeople will receive private health coverage, coverage that is as good \nas a Member of Congress gets, automatically. Like everyone else, they \nwill sign up through the exchange in their State. When they are \nworking, the premiums they owe are withheld from their paycheck. If \nthey lose their job, there is an automatic adjustment in their \nwithholding.\n  In addition, under the Healthy Americans Act, it will be more \nattractive for doctors and other health care providers to care for the \npoor. Those who are now in underfunded programs, such as Medicaid, are \ngoing to be able to have private insurance that pays doctors and other \nproviders commercial rates which are traditionally higher than Medicaid \nreimbursement rates.\n  Because low-income children and the disabled are so vulnerable, if \nMedicaid provides benefits that are not included in the kind of package \nMembers of Congress get, then those low-income folks would be entitled \nto get the additional benefits from the Medicaid Program in their \nState.\n  The Healthy Americans Act also makes changes in Medicare. As the \nlargest Federal health program, Medicare's financial status is far more \nfragile than Social Security. Two-thirds of Medicare spending is now \ndevoted to about 5 percent of the elderly population. Those are the \nseniors with chronic illness and the seniors who need compassionate \nend-of-life health care. The Healthy Americans Act strengthens Medicare \nfor both seniors and taxpayers in both of these areas.\n  In addition to reducing Medicare's outpatient premiums for seniors \nwho adopt healthy lifestyles and reduce the prospect of chronic \nillness, primary care reimbursements for doctors and other providers \nget a boost under the Healthy Americans Act. Good primary care for \nseniors also reduces the likelihood of chronic illness that goes \nunmanaged. This reimbursement boost is sure to increase access to care \nfor seniors--and I see them all over, in Oregon and elsewhere--who are \nhaving difficulty finding doctors who will treat them.\n  To better meet the needs of seniors suffering from multiple chronic \nillnesses, the Healthy Americans Act promotes better coordination of \ntheir care by allowing a special management fee to providers who better \nassist seniors with these especially important services.\n  Hospice law is changed so that seniors who are terminally ill do not \nhave to give up care that allows them to treat their illness in order \nto get the Medicare hospice benefit. In addition, the Healthy Americans \nAct empowers all our citizens wishing to make their own end-of-life \ncare decisions. The legislation requires hospitals and other facilities \nto give patients the choice of stating in writing how they would want \ntheir doctor and other health care providers to handle various end-of-\nlife care decisions.\n  When I announced the Healthy Americans Act last December, I stood \nwith an unprecedented coalition of labor and business. Andy Stern, \npresident of SEIU said ``It is time for fundamental, not incremental \nchange and Senator Wyden has a plan that is practical and principle, \nand sets down a moral test'' 'Why doesn't every American have the right \nto the same health care as the President, the Vice President, 535 \nmembers of Congress and 3 million Federal workers?' '' Steve Burd, the \nCEO of Safeway, a Fortune 50 company that has focused on prevention and \nwellness, called the Healthy Americans Act ``an innovative proposal \nthat lays a foundation to begin a serious discussion on health care \nreform in this country.''\n  Ron Pollack of Families USA, listed the principles embodied in the \nHealthy Americans Act that he believes are important: universality; \nsubsides to make the coverage affordable; community rating rules so the \nsicker and older are not priced out of the market; and benefits like a \nMember of Congress has today.\n  Also at my press conference was Mike Roach, of Portland, OR, a 30-\nyear member of National Federation of Independent Businesses. He owns a \nclothing store in Portland and employs eight people. He believes the \nHealthy Americans Act will help him attract good employees. And Bob \nBeal, president of Oregon Iron Works, an Oregon-based company that \ncompetes internationally, believes that we must also address the \nskyrocketing health care costs that make it harder for companies like \nhis in the international market place.\n\n  Like me, the people who stood by me when I announced the Healthy \nAmericans Act believe we need to move the health care debate forward \nand cannot afford to let more time to go by. The last time Congress \ntook a serious look at reforming health care, there wasn't anything \nresembling this kind of coalition of labor, business, low-income and \nend-of-life advocates standing together to call for action.\n  In tackling one-seventh of the economy, invariably technical issues \narise. I want to thank many people who have assisted along the way. Len \nNichols of the New America Foundation sent me e-mails at 2 in the \nmorning that helped refine provisions. John Sheils, Randy Haught and \nEvelyn Murphy of the Lewin Group assisted in telling us our numbers \nworked or didn't. The Congressional Research Service staff followed up \non questions from the common to the obscure. That group included: Bob \nLyke, Jeanne Hearne, April Grady, Julie Whitaker, Christine Scott, \nChris Peterson, Richard Rimkunas, Karen Trintz, Julie Stone and Andrew \nSommers. The Senate Legislative Counsel staff translated the ideas and \nconcepts into legislative language. They devoted an enormous amount of \ntime in getting the ideas and the language right. I'd like to thank \nMark Mathiesen, Mark McGunagle, Bill Baird, John Goetcheus, Stacy Kern-\nSheerer, Kelly\n\n[[Page S759]]\n\nMalone and Ruth Ernest for their patience and extraordinary effort.\n  On my staff, Joshua Sheinkman, my legislative director and Jeff \nMichaels, my administrative assistant, were instrumental in completing \nthe tax and business sections of the bill. Emily Katz who started in my \noffice as a legislative fellow and became a permanent part of the Wyden \nhealth team made sure we had credible facts and statistics. Last but \nnot least, I would like to thank Stephanie Kennan, my Senior Health \nPolicy Adviser for the last 9 years who played devil's advocate, worked \nthrough the conflicting and evolving ideas, and kept the many threads \nof the bill working together.\n  The full text of the Healthy Americans Act and the Lewin analysis are \navailable on my Web site.\n  In closing, I believe that without your health, you don't get to the \nstarting line of life. For too long, the Congress has dodged the debate \nand chosen to slice off parts of the issue. And as worthy as those past \nefforts have been to help certain segments of our citizens, all \nAmericans deserve guaranteed coverage like their Member of Congress, \nand no one should go to bed at night worrying about losing their health \ncare. It is time for Congress to provide 21st century solutions to one \nof the most important issues our country must address. The Healthy \nAmericans Act starts that debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent, that the Healthy Americans Act section-by-\nsection summary, and examples of how the legislation would affect \nindividuals and families and employers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              The Healthy Americans Act Section by Section\n\n       Section 1-- Short Title and Table of Contents\n       Section 2--Findings\n       Section 3--Definitions\n\n\n           TITLE I: HEALTHY AMERICANS PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS\n\n                Subtitle A--Guaranteed Private Coverage\n\n       Section 101: Guarantee of Healthy Americans Private \n     Insurance Coverage: Within 2 years of enactment States must \n     create a system as outlined in the bill to provide \n     individuals the opportunity to purchase a Healthy Americans \n     Private Insurance (HAPI) plan that meets the requirements of \n     the Act.\n       Section 102: Individual Responsibility to Enroll: Adults \n     (over age 19, U.S. citizens, not incarcerated) must enroll \n     themselves and dependent children in a plan offered through \n     the state-wide Health Help Agency (HHA) unless they provide \n     evidence of enrollment or coverage through Medicare, a health \n     insurance plan offered by the Department of Defense, an \n     employee benefit plan through a former employer (i.e. retiree \n     health plans), a qualified collective bargaining agreement, \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Indian Health \n     Service.\n       Religious Exemption: If a person opposes for religious \n     reasons to purchasing health insurance the requirement may be \n     waived.\n       Dependent Children: Each adult has the responsibility to \n     enroll each child in a plan. Dependent children include \n     individuals up to age 24 claimed by their parents for \n     deductions in the tax code.\n       Penalty for Failure to Purchase Coverage: If an individual \n     fails to purchase coverage and does not meet the exceptions \n     or the religious exemption, then a financial penalty will be \n     assessed. The penalty is calculated by multiplying the number \n     of uncovered months times the weighted average of the monthly \n     premium for a plan in the person's coverage class and \n     coverage area, plus 15 percent. Payments will be made to the \n     HHA of the State in which the person resides. That agency \n     also may establish a procedure to waive the penalty if the \n     penalty poses a hardship. Each State shall determine \n     appropriate mechanisms to enforce the requirement that \n     individuals be enrolled, but the enforcement cannot be the \n     revocation or ineligibility of coverage.\n\n Subtitle B--Standards for Healthy Americans Private Insurance Coverage\n\n       Section 111: Healthy Americans Private Insurance Plans: At \n     least two plans that meet the requirements of the Act must be \n     offered through the Health Help Agency in each State. The \n     offerings permitted through Health Help include several \n     options: (1) a plan similar to the Blue Cross Blue Shield \n     Standard Plan provided under the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefit Program as of January 1, 2007; (2) plans with \n     additional benefits added to the standard plan so long as \n     those benefits are priced and displayed separately; and (3) \n     actuarial equivalent plans to the standard plan. In addition, \n     plans must provide benefits for wellness programs; incentives \n     to promote wellness; provide coverage for catastrophic \n     medical events resulting in the exhaustion of lifetime \n     limits; create a health home for the covered individual or \n     family; ensure that as part of a first visit with a primary \n     care physician, a care plan is developed to maximize the \n     health of the individual through wellness and prevention \n     activities; provide for comprehensive disease prevention, \n     early detection and management; and provide for personal \n     responsibility contributions at the time services are \n     administered except for preventive items or services for \n     early detection.\n       Family Planning: A health insurance issuer must make \n     available supplemental coverage for abortion services that \n     may be purchased in conjunction with a HAPI plan or an \n     actuarially equivalent HAPI.\n       Actuarial Equivalent Plans: Actuarial equivalent plans have \n     to have a set of core benefits that include preventive items \n     and services; inpatient and outpatient hospital services; \n     physicians' surgical and medical services; and laboratory and \n     X-ray services. Like the other HAPI plans, actuarial \n     equivalent plans cannot charge copays for prevention and \n     chronic disease management items or services.\n       Coverage Classes: There will be the following coverage \n     classes: (1) individual; (2) married couple or domestic \n     partnership (as determined by a State) without dependent \n     children; (3) coverage of an adult individual with 1 or more \n     dependent children; (4) coverage of a married couple or \n     domestic partnership as determined by a State with one or \n     more dependent children.\n       Premium Determinations: Community rating or adjusted \n     community rating principles established by the State will be \n     used. States may permit premium variations based only on \n     geography, smoking status, and family size. States may \n     determine to have no variations.\n       A State shall permit a health insurance issuer to provide \n     premium discounts and other incentives to enrollees based on \n     participation in wellness, chronic disease management, and \n     other programs designed to improve the health of \n     participants.\n       Limitations: Age, gender, industry, health status or claims \n     experience may not be used to determine premiums.\n       Section 112: Specific Coverage Requirements: This section \n     requires existing provisions of law currently applied to \n     group health markets to be applied to the plans offered \n     through Health Help Agencies including: protections for \n     coverage of pre-existing conditions; guaranteed availability \n     of coverage; guaranteed renewability of coverage; prohibition \n     of discrimination based on health status; coverage \n     protections for mothers and newborns, mental health parity, \n     and reconstructive surgery following a mastectomy; and \n     prohibition of discrimination on the basis of genetic \n     information.\n       This section also states that a HAPI plan shall not \n     establish rules for eligibility for enrollment based on \n     genetic information, and premiums and personal responsibility \n     payments cannot be adjusted based on genetic information.

This amount \n     represents 25 percent of the national average essential \n     benefit premium per employee.\n\n\n                      Mid-Sized Manufacturing Firm\n\n       Allied Industrial has 1,000 full time employees. The firm \n     pays 100 percent of individual premiums and 80 percent of \n     family premiums for all employees. Currently Allied pays \n     $6,100,000 per year in health care premiums and has been \n     seeing 10 percent increases year over year for several years \n     despite the use of a number of cost-control measures. Allied \n     falls into the middle range of companies in revenue per \n     employee, paying the 21 percent rate. Under the Healthy \n     Americans Act, Allied will pay $1,629,890.\n\n\n                        Large Specialty Retailer\n\n       Acme Game Emporiums is a national specialty retailer with \n     2,000 full time and 7,000 part time employees who work an \n     average of 22 hours per week. All full time and 4,500 of the \n     part time employees are eligible for and take advantage of \n     Acme's health plan. The firm pays 95 percent of employees' \n     premiums and 60 percent of family premiums. Their current \n     total health care costs are $52,000,000 per year. As a \n     retailer with relatively low revenue per employee, Acme pays \n     the 19 percent rate. Under the Healthy Americans Act, Acme \n     will pay $8,626,351.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 335. A bill to prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from using \nprivate debt collection companies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Murray and 15 \nof our Senate colleagues in reintroducing legislation to stop the \nInternal Revenue Service from outsourcing part of\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\nits tax collection responsibilities to private collection companies.\n  Last fall, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, ignored objections \nraised by many Federal policymakers and tax experts, including the \nIRS's own National Taxpayer Advocate, and moved ahead with its \ncontroversial plan to hire private companies to collect Federal tax \ndebts. When the IRS attempted a similar plan in 1996, it failed \nmiserably. The 1996 initiative lost money. Taxpayers were harassed by \nprivate debt collectors. In many instances, private debt collectors \nviolated Federal debt collection laws and confidential taxpayer \ninformation was not properly secured.\n  Today, the IRS is planning to share more than 2.5 million taxpayer \naccounts with up to 12 private collection companies when its new \nprivate debt collection plan is fully implemented--even though there is \ncompelling evidence that this new initiative will suffer from many of \nthe same maladies experienced by the IRS and taxpayers in the ill-fated \n1996 plan.\n  IRS Commissioner Everson readily admits that if the IRS hired and \nused trained IRS employees for this purpose, not private collectors, \nfar more revenues would be deposited in the U.S. Treasury fund. Yet the \nIRS is ready to hand out very large commissions ranging from 21 to 24 \npercent to private firms for every dollar they collect, when internal \nIRS reports suggest that it would cost the Federal Government just 3 \npennies on a dollar to have trained IRS employees collect tax debts \nthat are owed.\n  Stated another way, the IRS anticipates spending well over $300 \nmillion in commission payments to private firms to collect an estimated \n$1.4 billion in tax debt over 10 years, when internal IRS reports \nsuggest that spending $296 million to hire new IRS collectors could \nraise some $9.5 billion annually. At a time of exploding deficits and \nFederal debt, the IRS's use of private debt collectors is an \ninexcusable waste of taxpayer money.\n  In fact, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, released a report \nlast September revealing that the cost of implementing the IRS's \ninitial phases of its tax debt collection initiative alone, excluding \nany commission payments, may actually exceed all of the tax revenues \ncollected by these private collectors by millions of dollars. The IRS \nplan is riddled with hidden costs. For example, the three companies \nhired by the IRS in the initial phase of its private collection plan \nhave some 75 employees working on what the IRS has described as \nrelatively easy collection cases. However, at least 65 IRS employees \nhave been tasked to monitor the work of these collectors. So from a \nrevenue collection and efficiency standpoint, it doesn't take a \ncalculator to figure out that IRS private collection plan is not worth \nthe paper it's printed on.\n  Using private debt collectors is also very troubling because it puts \nconfidential taxpayer information at risk of public disclosure and \nmisuse. Just over two years ago, a Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration, TIGTA, investigation found that a contractor's \nemployees committed security violations, placing IRS equipment and \ntaxpayer data at risk. In some cases, TIGTA officials found that \ncontractors ``blatantly circumvented IRS policies and procedures even \nwhen security personnel had identified inappropriate practices.''\n  As I've mentioned, the IRS has agreed to pay three private collection \nfirms at the outset of its initiative nearly a quarter for every dollar \ntheir employees collect on what the IRS has described as relatively \neasy cases. The IRS's use of very large commissions to pay private \nfirms for their work on such cases is not only fiscally unsound and a \nshameful example of government waste, it also increases the potential \nfor overzealous collection practices and the misuse of sensitive \ntaxpayer return information. Private debt collection agencies are \ndriven by profit motives, not public service.\n  Let me emphasize, once again, one very important point. Everybody \nneeds to pay the taxes they owe. If they do not, however, professional \nIRS employees, not private collectors in search of profits, should be \nthe ones to ensure that outstanding tax debts are paid. If the IRS now \nsays it needs more resources for tax enforcement and collection \nactivities, then Congress should consider providing them.\n  I fully agree with the recommendations by the independent Taxpayer \nAdvocacy Panel last summer--and recently echoed by National Taxpayer \nAdvocate Nina Olson in the Taxpayer Advocate's 2006 Annual Report to \nCongress--that the IRS should terminate its outsourcing of taxpayer \ndebt collection and restrict collection activities to properly trained \nand proficient IRS employees. Indeed, the IRS should immediately \nreverse course and indefinitely suspend the implementation of its \nprivate debt collection activities.\n  The House of Representatives voted last year to eliminate funding for \nthis IRS initiative in its version of the Treasury Department spending \nbill, which was never approved by the full Congress. I will be working \nwith Senator Murray and many of our colleagues early in this new \nCongress to get similar language passed by the full Senate at the first \navailable opportunity.\n  The IRS should act on its own to stop its use of private debt \ncollectors and save any further expenditures of taxpayer money for this \npurpose. If it will not, however, I will do everything in my power to \nput the brakes on this initiative in the U.S. Senate. That's why I urge \nmy colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and help us, as the \nTaxpayer Advocate has suggested, terminate the IRS's privatization \ncollection initiative ``once and for all.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Levin, Mr. Obama, \n        Mr. Bayh, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 336.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure and foster continued patient quality of care by establishing \nfacility and patient criteria for long-term care hospitals and related \nimprovements under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould take steps to protect access to long-term care hospitals while \nensuring that these institutions are admitting the appropriate type of \npatients. I am pleased to be introducing the bill along with my \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, and I urge my colleagues to consider \ncosponsoring this cost-saving proposal.\n  Long Term Acute Care hospitals, or LTAC hospitals, serve a vital role \nin the Medicare program by providing care to beneficiaries with \nclinically complex conditions that need hospital care for extended \nperiods of time. These are patients who are too sick to go home or even \nto a skilled nursing facility, but are stable enough to be released \nfrom an intensive care unit. I am happy to have two of these hospitals \nin North Dakota, one in Fargo and one in Mandan. Together, these two \nhospitals employ several hundred people and provide care to thousands \nof North Dakotans. They are a vital part of the North Dakota continuum \nof care.\n  While these hospitals provide important health services to very frail \nindividuals, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has \nbecome concerned with the growth in these facilities. In 2006, there \nwere 400 LTAC hospitals, compared to 100 in 1996. In addition, the \nagency has also expressed concern that some LTAC hospitals are \nadmitting patients that may be better served by nursing homes or \nanother level of care. As a result, CMS has begun to arbitrarily cut \nLTAC hospital payments across-the-board.\n  As Chairman of the Budget Committee, I have a unique appreciation for \nthe enormous fiscal challenges that face our country and respect CMS's \nefforts to reduce growth in Medicare. However, any cuts in spending \nshould be targeted at waste and abuse. We should address the growth in \nLTAC hospitals, but we also want to ensure that there is a place for \npatients who truly need long-term hospital stays.\n  The legislation I'm introducing today is a first step in clarifying \nCongressional intent and giving CMS clearer definitions of what is and \nis not a LTAC hospital and what type of patient should be admitted to \nthese facilities. At the heart of this bill is a provision that limits \nthe types of patients who can be admitted to LTAC hospitals to those \nwho truly need the specialized care these facilities provide. LTAC \nhospitals like those in my state that admit only very sick patients \nwill not be significantly affected. But, by eliminating abuses by those \nfacilities that have been receiving generous payments for patients who \ndo not require this sort of specialized care, this provision of the \nbill would significantly reduce Medicare spending on LTAC hospitals.\n  It was not easy for the LTAC hospitals in North Dakota and across the \ncountry to support legislation that restricts their payments, but I \ncompliment them for working with me to put forward a constructive \npublic policy proposal. In particular, I want to recognize Custer \nHuseby, Chief Executive Officer of SCCI Hospital in Fargo. He \nunderstands that the status quo is no longer defensible and has fought \nto put forward a workable solution that maintains access to these vital \nfacilities, where they are appropriate. I also want to thank Chip \nThomas and Karen Haskins of the North Dakota Healthcare Association, \nwho have partnered with Mr. Huseby to support this legislation.\n  Long-term care hospitals serve a vital role in our health care \nsystem, and we must protect access to these facilities for those who \ntruly need it. But, we can also take responsible steps to ensure that \nour federal tax dollars are well spent and directed to the most \nappropriate level of care. I believe my legislation achieves this \nbalance and urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleagues, Senators \nConrad, Wyden, Vitter, Dorgan and Lincoln in introducing legislation to \ncreate standards for long-term, acute-care (LTAC) hospitals. My home \nState of Utah has LTAC hospitals located in Salt Lake City, West Valley \nCity and Bountiful.\n  Let me explain what LTAC hospitals are to my colleagues, and discuss \nthe need for this legislation. A general hospital stay in the United \nStates is about 6 days. In contrast, the average patient stay in an \nLTAC hospital is 25 days. LTAC hospitals represent one of four post-\nacute care facilities. Of the four types of post-acute care, LTAC \nhospitals are the most expensive. And, the number of LTAC hospitals has \ngrown rapidly from 100 to 400 over a 10-year period. These dynamics \nhave led the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to push for \nhaving certain LTAC patients treated in less costly facilities such as \nnursing homes or rehabilitation clinics.\n  Our legislation is premised on the belief that only truly sick \npatients should go to LTAC hospitals. Less medically-complex patients \nshould be seen at less intensive facilities. S. 338 limits the type of \npatients who may be treated in LTAC hospitals and, by doing so, it will \ngenerate at least $1 billion in savings over the next 5 years.\n  LTAC hospitals have a role to play in the American continuum of \nhealth care. We all agree that there should be a place for patients who \ntruly need long-term hospital stays. In that sense, LTAC hospitals \nserve an important role. Today, Medicare spending on LTAC hospitals is \nlittle more than one percent of total Medicare spending.\n  Let me conclude by saying that this bill is just one component of a \nlarger debate that we need to have about Medicare post-acute care. LTAC \nhospitals are one component. Nursing homes and rehabilitation clinics \nare other components. All long-term care providers need to do a better \njob in convincing the Congress and Federal regulators why our health \ncare system needs four different types of post-acute facilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Conrad-Hatch legislation--it is \na good bill and it addresses an important aspect of the long-term \nhealth care debate. As baby boomers continue to retire, long-term care \nwill become more and more important to all Americans.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join, again, with a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators to introduce a bill to reform our immigration laws \nconcerning foreign agricultural workers. America's farmers are calling \nfor a greater number of legal foreign workers, and an improved system \nfor obtaining those workers. We need to likewise ensure meaningful \nbenefits and protections to the workers who will fill these jobs.\n  I am especially pleased that measures are included to help dairy \nfarmers, who in my home State of Vermont are an integral part of our \neconomy, our history, and our culture. Indeed, it is difficult to think \nof the Green Mountain State without conjuring up the image of verdant \nrolling hills dotted with Holstein cows. The provisions in this bill \nmake the H-2A program more workable for dairy farmers by lengthening \nthe time period a foreign worker may remain in the country, providing a \nprocess by which an employer can extend the stay of a worker, and by \nensuring that workers may ultimately apply for an adjustment to \npermanent legal resident status.\n  The bill we introduce today goes a long way toward reforming our H-2A \nvisa program. Along with measures to help streamline procedures for \nlabor certification by employers, the bill will make it easier for \nemployers to meet their responsibilities to ensure that available \nagricultural jobs are offered first to domestic workers. The bill also \nmakes the process easier for an employer to apply for an extension to a \nworker's stay, and makes it easier for a foreign worker to switch jobs \nduring their stay.\n  The bill includes greater protections for workers, including the \nrequirement that employers meet the same motor vehicle safety standards \nfor H-2A workers that are required for domestic workers. A limited \nFederal right of action is provided for H-2A workers to enforce the \neconomic benefits provided under the H-2A program, or those provided in \nwriting by their employers.\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\nMore flexibility is provided for workers and employers by permitting \nemployers to elect to provide a housing allowance, instead of housing. \nThese are but a few of the positive reforms contained in the bill.\n  The bill also contains a procedure by which undocumented workers who \nhave been working in agriculture can apply for a ``blue card,'' a \nsystem where through consistent employment, a fine, proof of the \npayment of taxes, and proof of no serious criminal history, an \nundocumented worker can continue his or her contribution legally, and \neventually adjust his or her status. The ``blue card'' program \nencourages family unification by making special provisions for spouses \nand children of the card holder. The program also has a numerical cap \nand the built-in safeguard of a sunset provision.\n  These reforms are a commonsense response that should help meet the \nneeds of our farmers without burdening them with an unduly, time-\nconsuming procedure for securing legal workers. The bill represents an \neffort to meet both the needs of agricultural employers while \nrespecting the rights and interests of agricultural workers, and is an \nexample of a bipartisan group of legislators listening and responding \nto the interests of all parties affected.\n  I join with other Senators in recognizing the needs of our modern \neconomy, and the needs of the American farmer as well as the rights of \nthe individuals who make up the backbone of many farming operations. \nWorking together we can ensure that no American farmer is put in the \nposition of having to choose between obeying the law and making a \nliving, and that no willing worker is denied a chance to work.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Martinez, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Specter, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. McCain, Mr. Obama, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Salazar, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 340. A bill to improve agricultural job opportunities, benefits, \nand security for aliens in the United States and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Senators Craig, Kennedy, Martinez, \nBoxer, Voinovich, and several others are once again introducing \nlegislation that will address the chronic labor shortage in our \nNation's agricultural industry. This bill is a priority for me and for \nthe tens of thousands of farmers who are currently suffering--and I \nhope we will move it forward early in this Congress.\n  The Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act, or \nAgJOBS, is the product of more than ten years of work. It is a \nbipartisan bill supported by growers, farmers, and farm workers alike. \nIt passed the Senate last year as part of the comprehensive immigration \nreform bill last spring in the 109th Congress. It is time to move this \nbill forward.\n  The agricultural industry is in crisis. Farmers across the Nation \nreport a twenty percent decline in labor.\n  The result is that there are simply not enough farm workers to \nharvest the crops.\n  The Nation's agricultural industry has suffered. If we do not enact a \nworkable solution to the agricultural labor crisis, we risk a national \nproduction loss of $5 billion to $9 billion each year, according to the \nAmerican Farm Bureau.\n  California, in particular, will suffer. California is the single \nlargest agricultural State in the Nation. California agriculture \naccounts for $34 billion in annual revenue. There are 76,500 farms that \nproduce half of the Nation's fruits, vegetables, and nuts from only 3 \npercent of the Nation's farmland. California farms produce \napproximately 350 different crops: pears, walnuts, raisins, lettuce, \nonions, cotton, just to name a few.\n  Many of the farmers who grow these crops have been in the business \nfor generations. They farm the land that their parents and their \ngrandparents farmed before them.\n  The sad consequence of the labor shortage is that many of these \nfarmers are giving up their farms. Some are leaving the business \nentirely. Others are bulldozing their fruit trees--literally pulling \nout trees that have been in the family for generations--because they do \nnot have the labor they need to harvest their fruit.\n  Once the trees are gone, they are replaced by crops that do not \nrequire manual labor. And our pears, our apples, our oranges will come \nfrom foreign sources. The trend is quite clear. If there is not a means \nto grow and harvest our produce here, we will import produce from \nChina, from Mexico, from other countries who have the labor they need.\n  We will put American farmers out of business. And there will be a \nripple effect felt throughout the economy: in farm equipment, inputs, \npackaging, processing, transportation, marketing, lending and \ninsurance. Jobs will be lost and our economy will suffer.\n  The reality is that Americans have come to rely on undocumented \nworkers to harvest their crops for them.\n  In California alone, we rely on approximately one million \nundocumented workers to harvest the crops. The United Farm Workers \nestimate that undocumented workers make up as much as 90 percent of the \nfarm labor payroll. Americans simply will not do the work. It is hard, \nstooped labor, requiring long and unpredictable hours. Farm workers \nmust leave home and travel from farm to farm to plant, prune, and \nharvest crops according to the season. We must come to terms with the \nfact that we rely on an undocumented migrant work force. We must bring \nthose workers out of the shadows and create a legal and enforceable \nmeans to provide labor for agriculture. That realization is what led to \nthe long and careful negotiations creating AgJOBS.\n  The AgJOBS bill is a two part bill. Part one identifies and deals \nwith those undocumented agricultural workers who have been working in \nthe United States for the past 2 years or more. Part two creates a more \nusable H-2A Program, to implement a realistic and effective guest \nworker program.\n  The first step requires undocumented agricultural workers to apply \nfor a ``blue card'' if they can demonstrate that they have worked in \nAmerican agriculture for at least 150 workdays over the past 2 years. \nThe blue card entitles the worker to a temporary legal resident status. \nThe blue card itself is encrypted and machine readable; it is tamper \nand counterfeit resistant, and contains biometric identifiers unique to \nthe farm worker.\n  The second step requires that a blue card holder work in American \nagriculture for an additional 5 years for at least 100 workdays a year, \nor 3 years at 150 workdays a year. Blue card workers would have to pay \na $500 fine. The workers can travel abroad and reenter the United \nStates and they may work in other, non-agricultural jobs, as long as \nthey meet the agricultural work requirements.\n  The blue card worker's spouse and minor children, who already live in \nthe United States, may also apply for a temporary legal status and \nidentification card, which would permit them to work and travel. The \ntotal number of blue cards is capped at 1.5 million over a five year \nperiod and the program sunsets after 5 years. At the end of the \nrequired work period, the blue card worker may apply for a green card \nto become a legal permanent resident.\n  There are also a number of safeguards. If a blue card worker does not \napply for a green card, or does not fulfill the work requirements, that \nindividual can be deported.\n  Likewise, a blue card holder who commits a felony, three \nmisdemeanors, or any crime that involves bodily injury, the threat of \nserious bodily injury, or harm to property in excess of $500, cannot \nget a green card and can be deported.\n  This program, for the first time, allows us to identify those \nhundreds of thousands of farm workers who now work in the shadows. It \nrequires the farm workers to come forward and to be identified in \nexchange for the right to work and live legally in the United States. \nAnd it gives farmers the legal certainty they need to hire the workers \nthey need. The program also modifies the H-2A guest worker program so \nthat it realistically responds to our agricultural needs.\n  Currently, the H-2A program is bureaucratic, unresponsive, expensive, \nand prone to litigation. Farmers cannot get the labor when they need \nit.\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\nAgJOBS offers a much-needed reform of the outdated system. The labor \ncertification process, which often takes 60 days or more, is replaced \nby an ``attestation'' process. The employer can file a fax-back \napplication form agreeing to abide by the requirements of the H-2A \nprogram. Approval should occur in 48 to 72 hours. The interstate \nclearance order to determine whether there are U.S. workers who can \nqualify for the jobs is replaced by a requirement that the employer \nfile a job notification with the local office of the State Employment \nSecurity Agency. Advertising and positive recruitment must take place \nin the local labor market area.\n  Agricultural associations can continue to file applications on behalf \nof members. The statutory prohibition against ``adversely affecting'' \nU.S. workers is eliminated. The Adverse Effect Wage Rate is instead \nfrozen for 3 years, and thereafter indexed by a methodology that will \nlead to its gradual replacement with a prevailing wage standard. \nEmployers may elect to provide a housing allowance in lieu of housing \nif the governor determines that there is adequate rental housing \navailable in the area of employment.\n  Inbound and return transportation and subsistence is required on the \nsame basis as under the current program, except that trips of less than \n100 miles are excluded, and workers whom an employer is not required to \nprovide housing are excluded.\n  The motor vehicle safety standards for U.S. workers are extended to \nH-2A workers. Petitions for admission of H-2A workers must be processed \nand the consulate or port of entry notified within 7 days of receipt. \nRequirements are the same as current law.\n  Petitions extending aliens' stay or changing employers are valid upon \nfiling. Employers may apply for the admission of new H-2A workers to \nreplace those who abandoned their work or are terminated for cause and \nthe Department of Homeland Security is required to remove H-2A aliens \nwho abandoned their work. H-2A visas will be secure and counterfeit \nresistant.\n  A new limited Federal right of action is available to foreign workers \nto enforce the economic benefits required under the H-2A program, and \nany benefits expressly offered by the employer in writing. A statute of \nlimitations of 3 years is imposed.\n  Finally, lawsuits in State court under State contract law alleging \nviolations of the H-2A program requirements and obligations are \nexpressly preempted. Such State court lawsuits have been the venue of \nchoice for litigation against H-2A employers in recent years.\n  AgJOBS is the one part of the immigration bill about which there is \nuniform agreement. Everyone knows that agriculture in America is \nsupported by undocumented workers. As immigration enforcement tightens \nup, and increasing numbers of people are prevented from crossing the \nborders or are being deported, the result is our crops go unharvested. \nWe are faced today with a very practical dilemma and one that is easy \nto solve. The legislation has been vetted over and over again. Senator \nCraig, I, and a multitude of other Senators have sat down with the \ngrowers, with the farm bureaus, with the chambers, with everybody who \nknows agriculture, and they have all signed off on the AgJOBS bill. \nThis is our opportunity to solve a real problem.\n  I ask my colleagues to join this bipartisan coalition and support \nthis legislation. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 340\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TREATMENT OF ALIENS GRANTED BLUE CARD STATUS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided under this \n     section, an alien granted blue card status shall be \n     considered to be an alien lawfully admitted for permanent \n     residence for purposes of any law other than any provision of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.).\n       (b) Delayed Eligibility for Certain Federal Public \n     Benefits.--An alien granted blue card status shall not be \n     eligible, by reason of such status, for any form of \n     assistance or benefit described in section 403(a) of the \n     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \n     Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1613(a)) until 5 years after the date \n     on which the alien is granted an adjustment of status under \n     section 103.\n       (c) Terms of Employment.--\n       (1) Prohibition.--No alien granted blue card status may be \n     terminated from employment by any employer during the period \n     of blue card status except for just cause.\n       (2) Treatment of complaints.--\n       (A) Establishment of process.--The Secretary shall \n     establish a process for the receipt, initial review, and \n     disposition of complaints by aliens granted blue card status \n     who allege that they have been terminated without just cause. \n     No proceeding shall be conducted under this paragraph with \n     respect to a termination unless the Secretary determines that \n     the complaint was filed not later than 6 months after the \n     date of the termination.\n       (B) Initiation of arbitration.--If the Secretary finds that \n     an alien has filed a complaint in accordance with \n     subparagraph (A) and there is reasonable cause to believe \n     that the alien was terminated from employment without just \n     cause, the Secretary shall initiate binding arbitration \n     proceedings by requesting the Federal Mediation and \n     Conciliation Service to appoint a mutually agreeable \n     arbitrator from the roster of arbitrators maintained by such \n     Service for the geographical area in which the employer is \n     located. The procedures and rules of such Service shall be \n     applicable to the selection of such arbitrator and to such \n     arbitration proceedings.

ADJUSTMENT TO PERMANENT RESIDENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), the \n     Secretary shall adjust the status of an alien granted blue \n     card status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for \n     permanent residence if the Secretary determines that the \n     following requirements are satisfied:\n       (1) Qualifying employment.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the alien has \n     performed at least--\n       (i) 5 years of agricultural employment in the United States \n     for at least 100 work days per year, during the 5-year period \n     beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act;

Mr. President, the last Congress worked long and hard to \nresolve one of the most contentious issues of our time: immigration. As \nmany of our colleagues know, while a number of border enforcement \nmeasures were enacted, we did not complete all the critical elements of \na comprehensive strategy on immigration reform.\n  Today, I am joining with Senators Feinstein, Kennedy, Specter, Leahy, \nMartinez, Voinovich, McCain, Hagel, Domenici, Boxer, Clinton, Obama, \nKohl, Salazar, Murray, and Schumer in reintroducing legislation to \naddress a very important piece of that unfinished business: the \nestablishment of a workable, secure, effective temporary worker program \nto match willing foreign workers with jobs that Americans are unwilling \nor unable to perform.\n  Our legislation is specific to U.S. agriculture, because this \neconomic sector, more than any other, has become dependent for its \nexistence on the labor of immigrants who are here without legal \ndocumentation. The only program currently in place to respond to a lack \nof legal domestic agricultural workers, the H-2A Guest Worker Program, \nis profoundly broken. Outside of H-2A, farm employers have no \neffective, reliable assurance that their employees are legal.\n  The bill we are reintroducing is called AgJOBS--the Agricultural Job \nOpportunity, Benefits, and Security Act. This bill was part of the \ncomprehensive immigration legislation passed last year by the Senate. \nToday's version incorporates a few language changes that update, but do \nnot substantively amend, that measure.\n  We are reintroducing AgJOBS to fix the serious flaws that plague our \ncountry's current agricultural labor system. Agriculture has unique \nworkforce needs because of the special nature of its products and \nproduction, and our bill addresses those needs.\n  Our bill offers a thoughtful, thorough, two-step solution. On a one-\ntime basis, experienced, trusted workers with a significant work \nhistory in American agriculture would be allowed to stay here legally \nand earn adjustment to legal status. For workers and growers using the \nH-2A legal guest worker program, that program would be overhauled and \nmade more streamlined, practical, and secure.\n  This legislation has been tested and examined for years in the Senate \nand House of Representatives, and it remains the best alternative for \nresolving urgent problems in our agriculture that require immediate \nattention. That is why AgJOBS has been endorsed by a historic, broad-\nbased coalition of more than 400 national, State, and local \norganizations, including farmworkers, growers, the general business \ncommunity, Latino and immigration issue groups, taxpayer groups, other \npublic interest organizations, State directors of agriculture, and \nreligious groups.\n  We all want and need a stable, predictable, legal workforce in \nAmerican agriculture. Willing American workers deserve a system that \nputs them first in line for available jobs with fair market wages. All \nworkers should receive decent treatment and protection of fundamental \nlegal rights. Consumers deserve a safe, stable, domestic food supply. \nAmerican citizens and taxpayers deserve secure borders and a government \nthat works.\n  AgJOBS would serve all these goals.\n  Last year, we saw millions of dollars' worth of produce rot in the \nfields for lack of workers. We are beginning to hear talk of farms \nmoving out of the country, moving to the foreign workforce. All \nAmericans face the danger of losing more and more of our safe, domestic \nfood supply to imports.\n  Time is running out for American agriculture, farmworkers, and \nconsumers. What was a problem years ago is a crisis today and will be a \ncatastrophe if we do not act immediately. I urge my colleagues to \ndemonstrate their support for U.S. agriculture by cosponsoring the \nAgricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act--AgJOBS 2007--\nand by helping us pass this critical legislation as soon as possible.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senators \nFeinstein and Craig and my other colleagues today as we re-introduce \nthe Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act of 2007. \nI commend them and Representatives Howard Berman and Chris Cannon for \ntheir bipartisan leadership and am pleased to be part to this landmark \nlegislation.\n  The bill reflects a far-reaching and welcome agreement between the \nUnited Farm Workers and the agricultural industry, one of the most \ndifficult immigration challenges we face, and we in Congress should \nmake the most of this unique opportunity for progress.\n  America has a proud tradition as a nation of immigrants and a nation \nof laws. But our current immigration laws have failed us on both \ncounts. Much of the Nation's economy today depends on the hard work and \nthe many contributions of immigrants. The agricultural industry would \ngrind to a halt without immigrant farm workers. Yet, the overwhelming \nmajority of these workers lack legal status, and thus can be easily \nexploited by unscrupulous employers.\n  The Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits, and Security Act--\nAgJOBS--is an opportunity to correct these long-festering problems. It \nwill give farm workers and their families the dignity and justice they \ndeserve, and it will give agricultural employees a legal workforce.\n  This compromise has broad support in Congress, and from business and \nlabor, civic and faith-based organizations, liberals and conservatives, \ntrade associations and immigrant rights groups.\n  The AgJOBS Act is a needed reform in our immigration laws, to reflect \ncurrent economic realities, address our security needs more \neffectively, and do so in a way that respects America's immigrant \nheritage. It provides a fair and reasonable way for undocumented \nagricultural workers to earn legal status and also reforms the current \nvisa program, so that employers unable to find American workers can \nhire needed foreign workers. Together they serve as the cornerstone for \ncomprehensive immigration reform of the agricultural sector.\n  AgJOBS is good for labor and business. The Nation can no longer \nignore the fact that more than half of our agricultural workers are \nundocumented. Growers need an immediate, reliable and legal workforce \nat harvest time. Farm workers need legal status to improve their wages \nand working conditions. Everyone is harmed when crops rot in the field \nbecause of the lack of an adequate labor force.\n  The AgJOBS Act provides a fair and reasonable process for \nundocumented agricultural workers to earn legal status. Undocumented \nfarm workers are clearly vulnerable to abuse by unscrupulous labor \ncontractors and growers, and their illegal status deprives them of \nbargaining power and depresses the wages of all farm workers. Our bill \nprovides fair solutions for undocumented workers who have been toiling \nin our fields, harvesting our fruits and vegetables.\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\n  The bill is not an amnesty. To earn the right to remain in this \ncountry, workers would not only have to demonstrate past work \ncontributions to the U.S. economy, but also make a substantial future \nwork commitment. These workers will be able to come forward, identify \nthemselves, provide evidence that they have been employed in \nagriculture, and continue to work hard and play by the rules.\n  The legislation will also modify the current temporary foreign \nagricultural worker program, while preserving and enhancing key labor \nprotections. It strikes a fair balance and streamlines the H-2A \nprogram's application process by reducing paperwork for employers and \naccelerate processing. But individuals participating in the program \nreceive strong labor protections. Anything else would undermine the \njobs, wages and working conditions of U.S. workers.\n  This legislation would unify families. When temporary residence is \ngranted, the farm worker's spouse and minor children would be allowed \nto remain legally in the U.S., but they would not be authorized to \nwork. When the worker becomes a permanent resident, the spouse and \nminor children would also gain such status.\n  AgJOBS will also enhance national security and reduce illegal \nimmigration. AgJOBS will also reduce the chaotic, illegal, and all-too-\ndeadly flows of immigrants at our borders by providing safe and legal \navenues for farm workers and their families. Future temporary workers \nwill be carefully screened to meet security concerns. Enforcement \nresources will be more effectively focused on the highest risks. By \nbringing undocumented farm workers out of the shadows and require them \nto pass thorough security checks, it will enable our officers to more \neffectively train their sights on terrorists and criminals.\n  Last year, the Senate came together--Democrats and Republicans--to \npass farreaching immigration reform legislation, which included the \nAgJOBS bill. The American people are calling on us to come together \nagain. They know there is a crisis and they want action now.\n  The President has been a leader on immigration reform, and I'm \nhopeful that he will renew his efforts with members of his party, so \nthat we can enact comprehensive reform legislation, to end the \nfestering crisis once and for all. The House of Representatives is now \nready to be a genuine partner in this effort.\n  By heritage and history, America is a nation of immigrants. Our \nlegislation proposes necessary changes in the law while preserving this \ntradition. This bill will ensure that immigrant farm workers can live \nthe American dream and contribute to our prosperity, our security, and \nour values and I hope very much that it can be enacted quickly in this \nnew Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/18/senate-section/article/S779-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 33--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n   UNITED STATES SHOULD EXPAND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REPUBLIC OF \nGEORGIA BY COMMENCING NEGOTIATIONS TO ENTER INTO A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n                               S.
