Mr. President, it is hard to comprehend why we have to file \ncloture on a motion to proceed to a bill dealing with veterans, but \nthat is what is happening. It has been heard on this floor on many \noccasions in recent weeks, but it is hard to comprehend what the \nRepublicans are trying to do with the country, other than maintain the \nstatus quo.\n  We invoked cloture twice on a technical corrections bill, and now, on \na veterans' benefits act, we have to invoke cloture on even being able \nto debate it. That is really too bad. There have been 4,039 Americans \nkilled in Iraq; I read that in the newspaper this morning. The occupant \nof the chair indicated to me that he presented a flag to some Ohio \npeople who lost a loved one. Tens of thousands of troops have been \nwounded. The morning papers report that 20 percent--one out of every \nfive--of the Iraq veterans, our soldiers, coming home from Iraq have \ntraumatic stress disorder.\n  Mr. President, we have talked about those who have been killed in \nIraq, those who have been wounded, but there are also, as a result of \nthis huge military presence there--earlier this year, about 175,000--\npeople who are in the military who get hurt when trucks back over them \nby mistake or they may have falls--a lot of things happen to disable \nthese veterans. We have been trying to bring this legislation to the \nfloor since last August. In the height of the war, with soldiers being \nkilled every day, being wounded every day, coming home from Iraq every \nday, we cannot even get to a bill to deal with their health. The \nRepublicans are holding that up. We have been trying since August to \nbring it up.\n  This comprehensive, budget-neutral legislation will provide much \nneeded benefits for veterans young and old. The legislation, among \nother things, would expand the number of individuals qualifying for \ntraumatic injury insurance.\n  In the morning papers all over the country, there are headlines such \nas ``VA Suicide Hotline Set Up Last Year Credited With Saving 726 Lives \nSo Far.'' As I said, we have these stories appearing all over the \ncountry.\n\n       Twenty-two-year-old Joshua Omvig shot himself in his truck \n     outside his parents' home in Grundy Center, Iowa, on December \n     22, 2005. A local newspaper reported that he\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\n     had talked to his mother shortly before killing himself. \n     Among his final words: ``I've been dead ever since I left \n     Iraq.''\n\n  As a result of this, and in paying tribute to him, we have created a \nsuicide hotline for veterans. That is what this is all about. We have \nsaved 726 lives. Veterans need help. This is a war like we have never \nhad before. We have never fought a war in big cities, street to street, \nhouse to house.\n  Last night, I had a marine in my office, at about quarter to 7 last \nnight. He came with his wife-to-be, his mother, and his father. They \nare from Illinois. He is a big, strong man. One of his ears was \ncauliflowered, as he had been a college wrestler. He was missing his \nright leg above the knee. He is going to be in and out of the hospital, \nand he will be able to go home soon. His problem is not with the leg he \nlost, it is with the leg he still has. He lifted up his pant leg and \nshowed me the scars. He had major surgery and has scars. He is tough \nand said, ``I am going to be just fine.''\n  We are trying to help people such as him. They are all over America, \ncoming home from Iraq and are hurt and need help. We cannot even debate \nthis legislation because Republicans are stalling it. We are having a \nvote at noon on Tuesday. I hope we will be able to get 60 votes and \nproceed. You would think there would be nine Republicans who are caring \nenough to allow us to go forward on this most important issue.\n  We also extend eligibility for specially adapted housing benefits to \nindividuals with severe burns. This war, which is within cities--I got \ncarried away describing this man's injuries.\n  I said, ``Tell me what happened.''\n  He said, ``We came out of the house, climbed in the vehicle, and it \nblew up.''\n  I said, ``How long were you in the truck?''\n  He said, ``Maybe 20 seconds.''\n  The road had been paved--a newly paved road. They put a bomb on it. \nWhen he drove over it, the compression caused it to blow up. He had \nburns--you could see them--on his face. The scars weren't bad, but \nthere were burns.\n  A lot of the people, because of these explosive devices, have \nterrible burns. This legislation we want to try to pass extends \neligibility for these people who were burned badly to have special \nhousing benefits.\n  The legislation would extend and increase benefits for individuals \ntrying to change what they do, with apprenticeships and on-the-job \ntraining programs.\n  Also, the legislation would restore veteran status to Filipino \nveterans who served under U.S. command in World War II. One only need \nwatch Tom Hanks's World War II series that appeared on television. It \ntalked about the valor and the absolute necessity for the Filipino \nsoldiers who were there fighting under our command. We have been trying \nfor decades to extend benefits to them. They are getting very old with \neach day that goes by, and more of them are dying. Their average age is \nwell over 80. We want to allow them certain benefits. They fought \nalongside U.S. troops during World War II. It is the moral obligation \nof this Nation to provide for those Filipino veterans who fought under \nthe U.S. flag during World War II.\n  After 8 months of obstruction by the Republicans, it is time to allow \nthis bill to be debated. If there are people who don't like provisions \nin this bill, they can offer an amendment to try to take them out. Why \nhold up benefits for veterans?\n  This legislation provides much needed benefits and includes 8 titles, \nwith 38 benefits. If there were ever a piece of legislation that should \nnot be stalled, obstructed, and delayed, it is this one. We have waited \n8 months to bring this up. With the Republicans, it is always tomorrow, \nwe almost have it worked out, or how about tomorrow or next week or \nnext month? We cannot wait any longer. People have to step up to the \nbar here, Mr. President, on Tuesday at noon and vote to find out if we \ncan legislate for the veterans coming back from Iraq and those veterans \nwho have, prior to Iraq, dedicated their lives to the service of their \ncountry, our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/18/senate-section/article/S3172-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3172-S3173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMEMORATING EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 38 years ago, Senator Gaylord Nelson of \nWisconsin founded Earth Day to celebrate the environment and to call \nattention to the major environmental issues of the time. Once again we \ncelebrate the progress we have made to protect our environment, and are \nagain called upon to address new challenges facing our planet.\n  Since Earth Day's conception in 1970 our Nation has worked to reduce \npollution and clean up lakes, streams, and the air we breathe. These \nenvironmental accomplishments have made us healthier, our economy \nprosper, and have helped to make America even more beautiful.\n  Although we have made great strides to improve and protect our \nenvironment, it is clear that we are facing one of the gravest \nenvironmental challenges of our time. Global warming from man-made \ngreenhouse gas emissions may be the most complicated crisis our world \nhas ever faced. We must address it quickly and boldly in the United \nStates and assert global leadership on this most important issue.\n  Rising temperatures threaten to devastate western landscapes, \nintensify drought, and magnify summer heat waves. Fortunately, if we \nact swiftly, we still have a narrow window of time and opportunity to \nreduce our greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate \nchange.\n  Over the next 15 years, I am confident that we can reduce emissions \nby at least 25 percent. We will establish a framework for capping \ngreenhouse gas emissions without imposing economic hardship on \nAmericans. We will also create a business environment that provides \nample incentives to phase out rapidly our current outdated 19th century \nenergy production and decisionmaking methods.\n  Global warming is an enormous opportunity wrapped in a complex \nchallenge. On this Earth Day, I want Nevadans and all Americans to \nembrace and prepare for the challenge, and recognize the tremendous \nopportunity we have to improve our energy security, create hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs and develop the new, clean, efficiency and \nrenewable energy economy of the future. With the right investments and \npolitical will, we can soon power all our cars, homes and industry with \npower from the Sun, the wind, and the Earth.\n  In a 100-mile-square area of Nevada and the Southwest's desert, we \nhave enough solar energy resources to supply the entire United States \nwith electricity. This might seem unreal today because our thinking is \nshaped most by those who profit from selling us fossil fuels. But, \nsolar technologies at the utility-scale and in distributed applications \nare quickly becoming economical and have far far fewer of the hidden \ncosts of coal, nuclear and other unsustainable resources.\n  In addition, we have vast wind and geothermal resources that America \nhas only begun to tap. By expanding and improving transmission access \nto rural and undeveloped areas where solar, wind and geothermal are \noften most plentiful, our renewable energy resources can work in \naffordable harmony, improving our energy security and reliability, \nusing cost-free fuel for ever.\n  In a speech I gave earlier this year, I established five policy goals \nto promote renewable energy. These principles will help launch Nevada \nand the nation in a new direction that chooses ingenuity over \nstagnation, progress over pollution. They include: consumer choice--\nallowing consumers to choose renewable energy to power their homes at \nreasonable cost; consumer empowerment--allowing homeowners to receive \ncredit for generating their own renewable electricity; making space for \nrenewables--setting aside federal land for renewable energy production; \ninvestment--providing incentives to utility companies to choose \nrenewables and efficiency over fossil fuels; and electric cars--\nbuilding a smart grid that can charge electric automobiles.\n  Achieving these policy goals could help make our nation more \nsustainable, both environmentally and economically. They are some of \nthe necessary steps we must take toward a low-carbon economy.\n  Climate scientists tell us that the countries of the world have \napproximately 10-15 years to radically transform the way that energy is \nmade and consumed because greenhouse gas concentrations in the \natmosphere are\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\nverging on dangerous interference with the global climate system. This \nmeans making tremendous reductions quickly and ensuring that our energy \ndecisions today do not warp the future for our children and generations \nto come.\n  As we celebrate Earth Day this year, I ask that you join me in \nthinking about the road ahead and how we will overcome this great \nenvironmental challenge that we face as Nevadans, Americans, and \ncitizens of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/18/senate-section/article/S3173-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    NATIONAL WEEK OF THE YOUNG CHILD\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I recognize the National Week \nof the Young Child. This week provides all of us here in Washington the \nopportunity to reflect on the ways in which we can better care for \nchildren in our communities and more effectively cooperate with \nteachers, parents, and other caregivers.\n  Critical to the success of many disadvantaged Iowa children is the \nHead Start program. If we really want to get kids ready for school, we \nmust focus on early intervention. This means improving access to \neducation and developmental services to help provide kids with a good \nstart in life. Since 1965, Head Start has served more than 24 million \nlow-income children and their families.\n  Head Start programs help Iowa families to meet young children's basic \neducational, health, nutritional and social needs with a goal of having \nthese kids ready for the first day of kindergarten. I was pleased to \nrecently help modernize and update Head Start by passing The Head Start \nfor School Readiness Act, which allows more families access to \nprograms, improves early childhood training for Head Start educators, \nand updates learning standards to reflect the latest research in child \ndevelopment. I also made sure that early learning programs do not \nignore the importance of wellness and healthy behaviors by requiring \ntraining to integrate physical activity and good nutrition in the \nclassroom.\n  I have heard tremendous stories from my State of children whose lives \nwere improved through the social services Head Start provides. These \nchildren received eye glasses or necessary dental work thanks to the \nearly intervention of our Head Start programs. Head Start educators and \nemployees often connect parents in need to the outreach services which \nhelp give children safe and comfortable homes.\n  I was particularly touched by the story of Rebecca Navarro. She \nwrites that her youngest son, Anthony, received help learning his \nletters and colors, and improved his social skills, through their local \nHead Start agency. At the same time, a Head Start social worker helped \nMs. Navarro go back to school and receive her degree, pay for food and \nutilities and provide a better quality of life for Anthony and his four \nsiblings. Anthony has now successfully graduated the 6th grade with \nmath skills above his grade level, and plans on going to college and \ngetting his master's degree in engineering and math.\n  Providing our Nation's youngest learners with the tools they need to \nsucceed benefits not only those children and their families, but our \nNation as well. While celebrating the victories of Head Start this \nweek, we should also continue to work hard to ensure every child has \nthe opportunity to reach his or her full potential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/18/senate-section/article/S3173-2", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HONORING THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN GOSPEL CHORALE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to highlight a memorable trip recently taken by a group of \nstudents from University of Michigan. Each spring, many students head \nfor warmer climates during spring break. However, the University of \nMichigan's Gospel Chorale, comprised of 40 students, spent this year's \nspring break accompanying university president Mary Sue Coleman and \nother faculty and staff to the nation of Ghana.\n  During this trip, the Michigan Gospel Chorale performed at churches, \nschools, colleges and public forums, including the National Theatre and \nthe Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center, where they \nwere warmly received. In fact, they performed before an audience of \nmore than 2,500 at Ghana's National Theatre. One of their most moving \nperformances occurred when the chorale sang in the dungeons of the \nElmina Castle, where slaves were once held captive before they were \ntransported across the ocean.\n  The purpose of the University's trip to Ghana was to strengthen \nexisting relationships the University of Michigan has in Africa and to \nexplore opportunities for new research programs and for faculty and \nstudent cultural exchanges. Currently, more than 120 University of \nMichigan faculty members are involved in various projects in Ghana and \nSouth Africa, and numerous students are taking courses or are involved \nin research activities.\n  As you know, the United States has a long history with Ghana, and \nthat partnership continues to grow. The people of Ghana will remember \nthe efforts of the University of Michigan and the Michigan Gospel \nChorale's visit for a long time. For the Michigan Gospel Chorale, the \njourney provided a significant global learning experience. Many of the \nstudents had never traveled by air or had been out of the country. I am \nsure my colleagues agree that it is important for our young people to \nhave opportunities to explore, and to contribute to, our ever-expanding \nglobal community.\n  I know my colleagues join me in commending the University of Michigan \nand the Michigan Gospel Chorale for their outstanding efforts in \nfostering goodwill between the United States and the nation of \nGhana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/18/senate-section/article/S3173-3", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3173-S3174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOLD ON NOMINATION OF HARVEY E. JOHNSON\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, more than 40 months ago, prior to \nhis confirmation as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, \nMichael Chertoff told me in my office that if confirmed he would move \nexpeditiously to implement the National Emergency Technology Guard--NET \nGuard--program. Unfortunately, Secretary Chertoff has so far failed to \nhonor this pledge.\n  The idea of NET Guard was born in the aftermath of 9-11, when a \nnumber of communications and technology companies told me they wanted \nto help New York City when it was attacked--and there was no system for \nusing their volunteers. Then-Senator George Allen and I moved on a \nbipartisan basis to support a program, called NET Guard, that would \nensure that volunteers with technology expertise could be fully \nutilized in future crises. These teams of local volunteers with science \nand technology expertise would be vital in assisting our communities in \nresponding to attacks on communications networks, or recovering from \nnatural disasters. Congress authorized the establishment of NET Guard 5 \nyears ago, in the Homeland Security Act of 2002.\n  However, DHS has delayed and delayed and so far failed to implement \nthis critical program.\n  At times, Secretary Chertoff has appeared willing to move forward on \nNET Guard, but each time he stops short of action. On August 1, 2007, \nthe Secretary pledged to me in a letter that he would be submitting a \nrequest to fund the NET Guard program in the President's fiscal year \n2009 budget. I will ask that a copy of Secretary Chertoff's letter be \nprinted in the Record. I thought this meant that the Secretary \nrecognized NET Guard's potential and understood Congress's intention in \nauthorizing the program. Unfortunately he failed to fulfill this \npromise and we again find ourselves at an impasse.\n  I feel that further delay is unacceptable. I reluctantly feel that I \nmust put a hold on the nomination of Harvey E. Johnson who has been \nnominated by President Bush to serve as Deputy Administrator of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, until the NET Guard program is up \nand running.\n  I place this hold reluctantly, but see no other option in light of \nthe Department's foot dragging. I am hopeful that the Department will \nsoon be able to stand up a NET Guard program, and I will be able to \nwithdraw my hold and Mr. Johnson's nomination can move through the \nSenate. In the meantime, I\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\nwill object to any unanimous consent agreement to consider Mr. \nJohnson's nomination.\n  I ask that the letter to which I referred be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                            Homeland Security,\n\n                                                   August 1, 2007.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for taking time this morning \n     to discuss the Department of Homeland Security's plans for \n     the National Emergency Technology Guard (NET Guard) program. \n     Following my June 29, 2007 letter to you that outlined our \n     program approach, and as a prelude to our discussion, members \n     of the Department's NET Guard team briefed your staff on our \n     proposed plan. The positive feedback from your staff, coupled \n     with your positive feedback this morning and the positive \n     feedback that we have received from State, local, and private \n     sector stakeholders, gives us confidence that we are taking \n     the right approach to implementing this important disaster \n     response program.\n       Accordingly, the Department is moving forward with plans to \n     implement 12-month NET Guard pilots beginning in September \n     2007. The recommendation to establish pilots in September is \n     consistent with the NET Guard Scoping Initiative Report, \n     which I will provide to you upon its completion this month. \n     To fund our efforts in fiscal year 2007 and 2008, we will \n     continue to work with Congressional appropriators. I will \n     also submit a request to the White House Office of Management \n     and Budget to fund the NET Guard program in fiscal year 2009. \n     On these and other program matters, the Department's Office \n     of Legislative Affairs will keep your staff apprised of our \n     progress.\n       I appreciate your interest and support of the Department's \n     disaster response mission and look forward to working with \n     you on this and other issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Chertoff. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/04/18/senate-section/article/S3174-1", "month": "04", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n       S. 2892.

A bill to promote the prosecution and enforcement of frauds \nagainst the United States by suspending the statute of limitations \nduring times when Congress has authorized the use of military force; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this country recently marked the 5-year \nanniversary of the war in Iraq--a war that the Bush administration \nrefuses to end. The losses in this war have been staggering. More than \n4,000 American soldiers have been killed and nearly 30,000 wounded. \nHundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars has been spent to fight this \nwar, money which could have been--and should have been--used to help \nAmerican needs here at home. Estimates for the cost of the President's \nadventure in Iraq are now into the trillions.\n  Through it all, the Bush administration has chosen essentially to \nignore one of its primary obligations during wartime--to protect \nAmerican taxpayers from losses due to fraud, waste, and abuse of \nmilitary contracts. Sadly, these problems are all too common in times \nof war, and have been particularly pervasive in Iraq.\n  Over the past year, I have chaired hearings in the Appropriations and \nJudiciary Committees focused on the billions that have been lost to \ncontracting fraud, waste, and abuse during this war. The testimony at \nthose hearings has exposed the Bush administration's failure to take \naggressive action to enforce and punish wartime fraud. It has also \nshown how difficult it can be for investigators to uncover and \nprosecute fraud amidst the chaotic environment of war.\n  These problems have been exacerbated time and time again by the Bush \nadministration, as tens of billions of dollars in ``no-bid'' and \n``cost-plus'' contracts have been awarded with little, if any, \noversight or accountability. Billions in cash--physical, paper money--\nhave been flown to Iraq and handed out in paper bags, often without \nrecords of who received what, and when. Billion dollar contracts for \ntraining services cannot be audited because the records are incomplete, \nlost, or in disarray. The Government has been billed for defective \nproducts, like faulty ammunition, unsafe bulletproof vests, and even \nunsanitary drinking water for the troops.\n  Too often we do not learn about serious fraud until years after the \nfact. What we do know is that tens of billions of dollars are \nunaccounted for, and potentially lost to fraud, and little has been \ndone to hold anyone accountable and recover the lost money.\n  This problem is not entirely new. Our nation has faced challenges in \npast wars. During World War II, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nspoke out against ``war millionaires'' who made excessive profits \nexploiting the calamity of war. President Harry Truman, when he served \nin the Senate, held historic public hearings to expose gross fraud and \nwaste by military contractors during the war.\n  Unlike the current President, however, Presidents Roosevelt and \nTruman took action to ensure that wartime fraud could be successfully \ninvestigated and prosecuted despite the difficulties presented by an \nongoing war.\n  In 1942, President Roosevelt signed the Wartime Suspension of \nLimitations Act, which made it possible for criminal fraud offenses \nagainst the United States to be prosecuted after the war was over. \nPresident Truman signed a bill making that law permanent in 1948.\n  Everyone understood then that it was unrealistic to believe that all \ncontracting fraud could be tracked down immediately in the midst of a \nwar. The law provided for the suspension of the statute of limitations \nuntil the war was over. Congress supported this law overwhelmingly, as \nthey had with a similar provision during World War I. President \nRoosevelt wrote: ``The crisis of war should not be used as a means of \navoiding just penalties for wrongdoing.''\n  While the provision for post-war enforcement against fraud is still \nthe law today, the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are exempt \nfrom its requirements. This Roosevelt-era law only applies ``when the \nUnited States is at war.'' The military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan were undertaken without Congressional declarations of war. \nIn recent decades, Congress has\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\nconsidered authorizations for the use of the Armed Forces, rather than \nformal declarations of war. I voted for the authorization to strike \nback at Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. I voted against the ill-\nconceived authorization to go into Iraq.\n  Today we introduce the Wartime Enforcement of Fraud Act of 2008, \nwhich updates President Roosevelt's law for our times. This will allow \nus better to protect American taxpayers from contracting fraud today, \njust as we did during World War II. I thank Senator Grassley for his \nco-sponsorship of this important legislation. He has been a leader in \nCongress on efforts to investigate and combat fraud against the United \nStates.\n  This bill would make current law suspending the statute of \nlimitations during wartime applicable to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. In doing so, we would allow investigators and auditors \nto continue their efforts to uncover criminal fraud and for those who \ncommit fraud to be brought to justice after the conflicts end. If left \nunchanged, under the current statute of limitations, each passing day \nof the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan could amount to immunizing \nfraudulent conduct by war contractors that has gone undiscovered during \nthe Bush Administration or during the conflicts.\n  This legislation would make three simple changes to current law. \nFirst, it would suspend the statute of limitations not only to when the \nUnited States is technically engaged in a declared war, but also when \nCongress has enacted a specific authorization for the use of the Armed \nForces consistent with the War Powers Resolution. In doing so, this \nlanguage would apply the existing World War II-era law to the ongoing \nconflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to similar actions in the \nfuture. It would not apply, however, to international peacekeeping \nmissions under the auspices of the United Nations or to military \nactions not specifically authorized by Congress.\n  Second, the legislation would extend the statute of limitations for \nfive years after the end of the conflict. The statute of limitations \ntoday for criminal fraud offense is five years from the time of the \noffense, and this bill would just toll the running of the statute \nduring the conflict itself and not a day longer.\n  Three, the bill would make clear that a Presidential proclamation \nending hostilities, and thus ending the tolling of the statute of \nlimitations period, must be a formal proclamation with notice to \nCongress. Secret proclamation by the President or a self-serving \n``mission accomplished'' speech will not do the trick.\n  The statute of limitations is an important check on the proper use of \ngovernment power, and we should not act to suspend it except in \nextraordinary circumstances. Wars provide exactly such circumstances, \nand current law recognizes this common sense reality by suspending the \nstatute of limitation for fraud offenses during wartime. It would be \nwrong to exempt the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan from this law and to \nallow war profiteers immunity for their illegal and unpatriotic conduct \nduring wartime.\n  President Roosevelt called upon Congress to act on this important \nmatter during World War II. Today, I echo his concerns and call upon \nthe Senate to pass this legislation to protect the American taxpayers \nfrom war contracting fraud. This Congress should pass--and the \nPresident should sign--the Wartime Enforcement of Fraud Act of 2008 \nwithout delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2892\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
