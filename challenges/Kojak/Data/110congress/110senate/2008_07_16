Mr. President, the bill that was read for the second time \nis a bill I introduced last night and put on the calendar. I attended a \nchairmen's meeting 2 weeks ago today. Much of the discussion at that \nmeeting was on gas prices. Much of the discussion on gas prices dealt \nwith speculation. The chairs of that meeting asked if I would prepare a \npiece of legislation dealing with speculation.\n  That is what this is all about. There are four or five Democratic \nproposals, there are some bipartisan proposals dealing with \nspeculation. That is what the bill that I have introduced does. It \ntakes some from all of those, what we believe is a good part of these \nbills and brings it to the floor.\n  There might be perfection in some things, but legislation is not one \nof them. It is very difficult to get something that is absolutely \nperfect. So this bill is not perfect.\n  Is speculation a problem? Of course, it is a problem. Is it the \nproblem? No. But it is an issue we must deal with. So I would hope in \nthe near future to bring this bill to the floor as a starting point for \nus to have some discussion as it relates to energy.\n  In arriving at the point where we introduced this bill, I had a \nmeeting last Thursday, where we had people from the financial \nmanagement world, banks, academics. We had, for example, one person who \nis the chief executive officer of United Airlines, who previously was \nchairman of Texaco and vice chairman of Chevron, who has a unique view \nas to what is going on.\n  His airline, all airlines in the country, are in deep trouble. He \nsees it from the perspective of someone running a major airline, United \nAirlines, and also having run major oil companies.\n  These academics, and you will see the writers, believe that probably \nspeculation amounts to about 30 percent of the cost of a gallon of \ngasoline. Now, the bill that has been introduced does a\n\n[[Page S6800]]\n\nnumber of things. It closes the London loophole, which prevents traders \nin the U.S. oil energy commodities from going overseas to evade \nregulatory requirements in the U.S. exchanges.\n  It directs the Commission to work with international regulators to \ndevelop uniform international reporting standards. It eliminates \nexcessive speculation. It requires the Commission to set position \nlimits on traders who are not involved in legitimate hedge trading of \nenergy commodities, requires large trader reporting, requires large \ntraders of energy commodities in over-the-counter markets to file \nreports of their activity with the Commission and directs the \nCommission to step in whenever a major market disruption occurs.\n  It makes index traders and swap dealers report. These market \nparticipants must routinely provide detailed reporting to the \nCommission to ensure that their activity is not adversely impacting \nprice in any negative fashion.\n  It increases the CFTC enforcement resources. It directs the \nCommission to hire an additional 100 employees to improve enforcement \ntransparency. It makes energy markets more transparent by directing the \nDepartment of Energy to collect information, analyze market data, and \ninvestigate financial institution investments in natural gas markets.\n  I have had a number of informal discussions with the Republican \nleader. I hope this piece of legislation dealing with speculation, \nwhich we hope will be bipartisan in nature, will be the beginning of \nour having a good discussion on energy prices, before we leave for the \nAugust recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6800-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, our Democratic friends yesterday came \nup with a new slogan for gas prices. It was: ``Act more, talk less.'' \nThey talked about to it the press, they talked about it in the Chamber, \nthey even used a colorful floor chart to make a point.\n  Frankly, I could not agree more with their new slogan. I hope they \ntake it seriously too. It is time to get about passing serious, \nbalanced legislation that will actually make a difference.\n  Americans are hurting as a result of high gas prices, and they are \nlooking to us for action. This is an issue that affects every single \nAmerican. So it is of great importance to every Member of this body.\n  The vast majority of Americans are asking us to get at the root of \nthe problem, instead of timidly dancing around the edges as some have \ntried to do. It is clear that the American people strongly support \nincreased responsible domestic production. It is also clear, at this \npoint, that a solid bipartisan majority in the Senate is ready and \nwilling to move forward on limited environmentally sensitive \nexploration here at home, so we can reduce our dependance on Middle \nEast imports.\n  Republicans welcome the new-found slogan from our friends on the \nother side of the aisle, but we hope it is more than a slogan. We \nshould act more and talk less. In the days ahead, the American people \nwill be able to judge who wants to boldly act and who wants to just \ntalk. So it is important for us not to fail the American people at this \ncritical point. I wish to congratulate the majority leader for turning \nto this subject. I think it is clearly and unambiguously the most \nimportant issue in the country. We look forward to having a real \nSenate-style debate over different approaches to this matter and, \nhopefully, coming together at the end of the time with a proposal that \nboth sides can feel proud of, that the markets will respond favorably \nto, and that people will generally feel made a difference on the No. 1 \nissue confronting the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6800-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wished to address this issue which \nboth the majority leader, Senator Reid, and the Republican leader, \nSenator McConnell, have talked about; that is, high gas prices.\n  This is a very real problem for Americans throughout the country. \nHigh gas prices today, the high price of home heating fuels as we \napproach the fall and winter, particularly natural gas prices which are \nexpected to be much higher this winter; propane prices; and home \nheating oil prices.\n  Unfortunately, as I am sure we are all aware, there has been a lot of \npolitics mixed in with the debate about what we ought to be doing to \ntry to deal with and help solve this problem. I hope we can put that \nbehind us and get onto a substantive discussion of the concrete steps \nthat would make sense.\n  Most agree there are three areas we might constructively address in \nthe very near term in the Congress. I hope we are able to address all \nthree. The first is the one Senator Reid was talking about earlier, and \nthat is, the proper functioning of energy markets or the so-called \nproblem of speculation in our markets.\n  The second, of course, is how do we reduce our demand for oil. \nEveryone recognizes that part of the high price of gas is the \nincreasing demand for oil, and the United States is a significant \nparticipant in increasing demand.\n  The third item is the increasing of supply which needs to be part of \nthe solution as well, in my view.\n  On the issue of proper functioning of the markets, Senator Reid \npointed out that as majority leader he has now put forward a piece of \nlegislation which we hope can gain bipartisan support and we hope can \nbe addressed in the Senate in the very near future. It takes some of \nthe ideas that have come from the Republican side of the aisle, and \nsome of the ideas that have come from the Democratic side of the aisle, \nand tries to meld these two into a piece of legislation that will do \nsome real good in taking speculation out of the market.\n  Now, there is a lot of dispute as to what extent there is speculation \naffecting the price of oil. But most experts say the increased \nspeculation in commodity markets is one factor.\n  On the issue of demand reduction, there are a lot of ideas also \naround the Congress as to things we might do. The President has not \nspoken about demand reduction, at least I have not heard him say \nanything about that. He has not spoken about the issue of speculation \nin the markets either or urged action there.\n  But I think the Congress ought to try to address both to speculation \nissue and demand reduction. Third, we ought to try to do something on \nthe issue of increasing supply. Now, the President has made this his \nsole issue that requires attention, as I understand his recent \nstatements.\n  He specifically has said the current ban on drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf is what needs to be changed, that is the one thing \nstanding between the American people and a lower price for gas at the \npump. Now, 2 days ago, he took action to revoke the Presidential \nwithdrawal of this Outer Continental Shelf land and challenged Congress \nto act similarly in the immediate future before the August recess.\n  Let me try to put some facts out for people to understand on this \ngeneral issue. Before doing so, I ask unanimous consent that my total \ntime allowed be 20 minutes as part of morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. This first map tries to make the point as to what we \nare talking about. We are all talking about the OCS, the Outer \nContinental Shelf. There are four areas that constitute the OCS. It is \nan area 200 miles going out from the U.S. coast all around the\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\ncountry, on the east coast, the west coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and all \naround Alaska. Those are the four areas that contain Outer Continental \nShelf lands. These are submerged lands owned by the Federal Government. \nThey have always been owned by the Federal Government. There is no \ndispute about that. States have rights going 3 miles out into the Outer \nContinental Shelf but after that, the Federal Government controls those \nlands. That is the OCS.\n  So if we should be drilling more in the Outer Continental Shelf, \nwhere does that resource lie? The Minerals Management Service, which is \npart of our Department of the Interior in this administration, says \ntheir best calculation at this point is that 44.9 billion barrels of \noil are in the Gulf of Mexico; that is 52 percent. Another 31 percent \nis not in the Gulf of Mexico, it is around the area of Alaska. On the \neast coast, there is 4 percent of what we believe exists in the way of \noil in the OCS; and on the west coast, 12 percent. That is their best \nestimate at the current time. On natural gas, it is even a larger \namount in the Gulf; there is about the same amount in Alaska as there \nis oil percentage-wise, 31 percent; and you can see natural gas is 4 \npercent on the Pacific coast and 9 percent off the Atlantic coast. That \nis where the resource is. To put it simply, according to this MMS 2006 \nsurvey, 83 percent of the oil and 86 percent of the natural gas on the \nOuter Continental Shelf is located in one of two places, either the \nGulf of Mexico or the area around Alaska.\n  The Atlantic coast is estimated to contain only 4 percent of the oil \nand 9 percent of the natural gas, and the Pacific coast is estimated to \ncontain 12 percent of the oil and 4 percent of the natural gas. That is \nthe basic information.\n  What is the proposal that Senator McConnell and President Bush have \nput forward to try to deal with this problem? First, let's talk about \nwhat they have not proposed. They have not proposed any change in the \nGulf of Mexico. They have said, leave the law as it is in the Gulf of \nMexico. There is no proposed lifting of any ban there. Second, they \nhave not proposed anything with regard to the area of second most \npromise, and that is around Alaska, because there is no moratorium to \nbe lifted up there. Third, they have said as to the two areas that have \nthe least resource as far as we know, the east and west coasts, that we \nshould give the Governors and the State legislatures of the coastal \nStates the authority to decide whether there is to be any drilling off \ntheir individual coasts. Not only should we give them that authority, \nwe should bribe them, in a sense, to make the right decision by \npromising to give them a chunk of the revenue, if, in fact, there is \ndevelopment permitted off their coast and if, in fact, they allow it.\n  This has been characterized, both by the President and the media, as \ngiving the States a say. That is not what the legislation calls for. \nThis legislation calls for giving the legislatures and the Governors a \nveto over development off their coasts. That is an unprecedented action \nby this Congress to say, OK, this is Federal land. This is a Federal \nresource. We are trying to craft a national energy policy. The way we \nwant to go about it is to give each State legislature and each Governor \nthe ability to veto development off their particular coast. I think \nthat is a terrible idea. I have spoken many times about this. I hope \nthe Congress will not agree to go along with the idea that we shift \nthis responsibility and authority to the State level. That is a point \npeople need to keep clearly in mind.\n  I believe strongly that there are several categories of land that are \nnot subject to the drilling ban, not subject to any moratoria, where we \ncould be producing more oil and gas. I wish to go through that list and \nexplain it a little bit. The first area is drilling leases that are not \nproducing oil. We know for a fact that most of the area that has been \nleased is not producing oil. Here is a chart that says 83 percent of \nthe leased area in the OCS is not producing energy. There may be good \nand sufficient reasons why the companies that lease that land are not \nproducing oil from it, but I believe we need to ensure that there is \ndiligent development of existing leases. I don't know that that is the \ncase. We wrote a letter to Secretary Kempthorne--30 Senators signed the \nletter--urging him to look into this and see if more can be done. I \nhope we can do more, and I am persuaded that we can. There are 2,200 \nproducing leases on the Outer Continental Shelf. There are 6,300 \nnonproducing leases. There are many reasons for this, but clearly this \nis something we should look into, and I believe we can do better to \nproduce oil from areas that have already been leased.\n  The second area on this chart is leases offered but not taken by oil \ncompanies. Here again, the current 5-year plan includes a sale every \nyear in the central and western Gulf of Mexico. We had a recent sale in \nthis lease sale 181 area that Congress legislated on in 2006, near the \neastern Gulf of Mexico. The fact is, for much of the land offered for \nleasing--two companies at the time--MMS received no bids. We need to \nget to the bottom of that and figure out why, when we offer this land \nfor lease, companies are not coming forward and actually bidding.\n\n  Let me also talk about this third area which is areas scheduled to be \nleased but not yet leased. The administration has done what previous \nadministrations have done, and that is to have a 5-year schedule of \nleases. We have a 5-year schedule in place now. The lease sale I \nreferred to in March was part of that 5-year schedule. I believe there \nare 16 additional lease sales scheduled in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and \n2012. All of those are on this chart on the right, scheduled lease \nsales. We need to look at that and ask: Is this an ambitious enough \nschedule of lease sales? Do we believe there is a greater appetite by \nthe oil industry than this reflects? Do we believe that if we put up \nmore land for leasing, we would get more production more quickly? If \nso, we should consider doing this. I don't see any reason why the Bush \nadministration couldn't offer a more ambitious plan in this regard.\n  The final category is areas that are not in the moratorium. They are \nsubject to no moratorium for drilling, and also they are not in the 5-\nyear plan. So they are not scheduled to be leased in the future either. \nWe have a chart here on Alaska. Most of the area I am talking about is \nthe Outer Continental Shelf that surrounds Alaska. You can see it is a \nvery large area. Of course, we claim our right to drill and to \nownership of the submerged lands way out around the Aleutian Islands. \nAll of this is part of the Outer Continental Shelf. What this chart \nshows is that there are 918 million acres in the Outer Continental \nShelf around Alaska that are open for drilling but have not been \nincluded in the administration's 5-year plan. So of the area in the \nOuter Continental Shelf in Alaska that is not covered by moratoria, \nabout 15 percent is included in the administration's 5-year plan. The \nother 85 percent is areas not covered. I would think the first thing to \ndo, if you want to get more production in the OCS in the near term, is \nto ask: How do we get more of that 85 percent leased? If there is a \ndemand for that, if the oil companies wish to develop that, how do we \nget that leased or how do we take the schedule of lease sales that take \nus through 2012 and accelerate some of that? I haven't seen anything \nfrom the administration indicating a desire to do that. We need to look \nat that as well.\n  All of these things I have on this list are ways to increase oil \nproduction that do not require any change with regard to who is going \nto control access to the Outer Continental Shelf. As I indicated, that \nwould be a big mistake to grant that authority to State legislatures \nand Governors.\n  Let me summarize by going back and asking, what should we do, what \nshould we as the Congress do in the coming weeks? And I hope what we \nare able to do. First, we should deal with speculation. Senator Reid \nhas a proposal in that regard. I hope it can get bipartisan support, \nand we can move ahead.\n  Second, we should do all we can to encourage more reduction in \ndemand. There are a lot of good ideas around, from Republicans, from \nDemocrats, from experts on all sides on that subject. We are having a \nworkshop tomorrow in our Energy and Natural Resources Committee where \nsome of these ideas will undoubtedly be discussed, as well as ideas \nrelated to supply. We are also going to have a hearing next week on the \nsubject of demand reduction and possible changes in policy that could \nhelp. Then we should\n\n[[Page S6802]]\n\nalso look at supply. That is what the President is focused on. We \nshould develop the leases we have already let that are currently in \nexistence. We should be sure they are being diligently developed and \ntake every step possible to ensure that.\n  Third, if companies have the ability and the desire to develop more \nleases on the Outer Continental Shelf, we should accelerate leasing in \nareas that are not covered by the moratoria, and there are a lot of \nthem, as I think these charts have made clear. There are a lot of areas \noutside the moratoria that could be leased under current law.\n  Finally, if the administration knows of particular areas they believe \nhave great promise and would like us to go ahead and open to leasing \nand that currently are not covered, I would be anxious to have them \npresent the evidence and tell us what those are. We put a provision in \nthe 2005 Energy bill, which many of us worked on, calling for a \ncomprehensive inventory of OCS oil and natural gas resources. It called \non the Secretary to do that. The Secretary did do a report, an \ninventory. He gave it to us in 2006. Unfortunately, what we said in the \nlegislation was that the Secretary should use all available technology, \nany technology except drilling, including 3-D seismic technology, to \nobtain accurate resource estimates. The administration chose not to do \nthat. They did not ask us for the funds to do that. So the report they \ngave us in 2006 does not have the benefit of any 3-D seismic survey. I \nthink if the President believes, and if the Minerals Management Service \nwithin the Department of the Interior believes, there are areas that \nare currently covered by a drilling ban that have great promise, then \nthey should come forward and at least ask for the resources to go ahead \nand complete the survey they were directed to do in section 357 of the \n2005 Energy bill.\n  There is a lot of progress we can make on a bipartisan basis. We need \nto quit suggesting that the solution to high gas prices is taking what \nhas always been a Federal decision--that is, who is going to have \naccess to the Outer Continental Shelf and under what circumstances--and \ngive it to the State legislatures and Governors. That would be a major \nmistake. I hope we do not go that route. There are things we can do on \nspeculation. There are things we can do on demand reduction. There are \nthings we can do on increased supply which I hope will help alleviate \nthis very real problem Americans are faced with.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Bingaman, the \nchairman of the Energy Committee, was talking about a very important \nsubject. Almost no American at this point can escape the consequences \nof what is happening with respect to our energy markets: the cost of \ngasoline, the cost of oil, its impact on drivers, its impact on \ntruckers, airlines, and farmers. It is pretty unbelievable.\n  I have come to the floor today to talk about a bill that was \nintroduced last evening, S. 3268, by the majority leader, Senator Reid. \nI have been working with Senator Reid--and many others have worked with \nhim as well--to construct a piece of legislation dealing with excess \nenergy speculation. I am convinced that dealing with excess speculation \nwill put downward pressure on oil and gas prices.\n  Now, I introduced a piece of legislation in June called the End Oil \nSpeculation Act of 2008. I have also been speaking on the issue of \nexcess speculation in the energy markets for several months on the \nfloor of the Senate. I have been very pleased to work with Senator Reid \nand others, and I am pleased with the result of the piece of \nlegislation Senator Reid has introduced with my cosponsorship and \nothers. It embodies most of that which was included in the legislation \nI had previously introduced in the Senate.\n  I wish to talk about why this is important. Now, I understand there \nare some people who scoff at this saying: Well, do you know what, there \nis no excess speculation. If we are going to deal with the energy \nissue, we have to drill, drill, drill.\n  We can drill. I support drilling. But the fact is, you can put a \ndrill bit in the ground today, and you are not going to do one thing \nwith respect to gas and oil prices. That is 2 years, 5 years, 10 years \noff. The question is, What do you do about what is happening today with \nexcess speculation in these markets?\n  Now, excess speculation is not new. It has happened in other markets, \nand it sometimes breaks the market. When the market is broken, there is \na responsibility, in my judgment, to take action.\n  So let me describe what I think we face. I also want to talk for a \nmoment about this new piece of legislation we introduced last evening, \nwhich I fully support. I am sure waves of opponents will come to the \nfloor and certainly come to offices around this Capitol Building and \ntry to defeat it.\n  First of all, I have shown this many times: Fadel Gheit has testified \nbefore our Energy Committee. For 30 years, Mr. Gheit has been a top \nenergy analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. Here is what he says:\n\n       There is absolutely no shortage of oil. I'm absolutely \n     convinced that oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a \n     barrel.\n\n  What he means is there is unbelievable excess speculation in the oil \nfutures market. He says:\n\n       I call it the world's largest gambling hall . . . It's open \n     24/7 . . . Unfortunately it's totally unregulated . . . This \n     is like a highway with no cops and no speed limit, and \n     everybody's going 120 miles per hour.\n\n  So you wonder, is there excess speculation going on that has driven \nthe price of oil and gas up like a Roman candle? Well, according to a \nstudy that was done by the House Subcommittee on Oversight, in the year \n2000, 37 percent of the people in this market were speculators. Now it \nis 71 percent of the people in these energy markets who are \nspeculators.\n  Well, how does that happen? We have a regulator: the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission. They are supposed to wear the striped \nshirts like referees at a basketball or football game. They wear the \nstriped shirts and have a whistle, except these folks forgot to put on \ntheir shirt and don't know how to blow a whistle. They are not \ninterested in being a referee. They say: Whatever happens, happens.\n  Mr. Lukken, the Acting Chairman of the CFTC, says: Everything is \nfine: ``Based on our surveillance efforts to date, we believe that \nenergy futures markets have been largely reflecting the underlying \nfundamentals of these markets,'' which means there is no excess \nspeculation here. That is from the top regulator.\n  From the Secretary of Energy, Sam Bodman, last month: There's no \nevidence we can find that speculators are driving futures prices [for \noil].\n  Oh, really? Let me show you this chart. This is a chart by the Energy \nInformation Administration. We fund that agency with $100 million a \nyear. These are the folks who make projections. Take a look at every \none of these projections for the last year, as shown on this chart: In \nMay of 2007, here is what they said the price of oil would be. In July \nof 2007, here is what they said the price of oil would be. In November \nof 2007, here is where the price of oil would go. Yet here is where the \nprice actually went: straight up.\n  Why were they so wrong? Because this is not about supply and demand. \nIt is about an orgy of speculation--unbelievable excess speculation--\nthat has driven this market like this.\n  Now, we can ignore all this. You can pretend it does not exist. But \nevery bubble bursts. We know that. The question is, when? In the \nmeantime, how much damage will be done to this country's economy? How \nmuch damage to the airline industry, the trucking industry, to farmers, \nto families trying to figure out: How do I borrow enough money to fill \nthe gas tank in order to drive to work?\n\n[[Page S6803]]\n\n  So here is what the legislation will do that we have introduced. As I \ndescribe this, let me say this: There are a lot of press conferences \naround here talking about what we have to do. I support all of it. In \nfact, Senator Bingaman, myself, Senator Domenici, and Senator Talent \nwere the four original cosponsors of legislation of opening lease 181 \nin the Gulf of Mexico. That is now done. That is law. I support \ndrilling offshore. I demonstrated that by the lease 181 position.\n  I do not support drilling everywhere. And if drilling is our answer \nevery 20 years, that is called yesterday forever. I am much more \ninterested in doing a lot of everything: conservation, efficiency, \ndrilling, especially renewables, and I am especially interested in \nsomething that is game changing. What I would like to do, on an \nemergency basis, is put in place something that 10 years from now will \nallow us to understand we are using energy in a very different way, and \nwe do not need so much oil from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and \nVenezuela.\n  But that is not what some would have us do. The whole issue--the \nmaster narrative--for them is: You have to drill, you have to drill, \nyou have to drill right now. Some of the same people who talk about \nthat ignore the growing bubble in the oil futures market that has \ndriven up the price of oil double in 1 year.\n  Now, I ask anybody in this Chamber to provide me and the American \npeople with anything that has changed with supply and demand that \njustifies the doubling of price in 1 year. They will not do it because \nyou cannot do it. I had one of the top people on Wall Street, from one \nof the biggest firms on Wall Street, come to see me. He is one of these \nguys that talked so fast, when he was finished talking, I was out of \nbreath. He could not answer the question when he came to my office, and \nhe could not answer the question when he left my office.\n  What has happened with respect to supply and demand that justifies \nthe doubling of the price of oil in 1 year? The answer is: Nothing has \nhappened in supply and demand in the last year. What has happened is \nthis unbelievable rush of new money into these futures markets through \nspeculators. Now, what is a speculator? First of all, these markets are \nvery important. We had a futures market established in 1936 for a very \nimportant reason. Those who are trading--that is producers and \nconsumers--a physical product need to be able to hedge their risks. But \na substantial portion of that which is now in those futures markets is \nnot about hedging risk by producers and consumers of a physical \nproduct. It is about people who have no interest in the product. They \nhave interests in exchanging contracts for the purpose of making money, \nand they have driven up these prices in a very dramatic way.\n  So let me describe what we propose to do. We propose to have a \nregulatory agency--one that so far has been dead from the neck up--do \nthe following things: No. 1, distinguish between legitimate hedging--\nthat is, hedging between producers and consumers of a physical product \nin order to hedge risk--distinguish between that and all other trades \nwhich are purely speculative trades having nothing to do with what the \nproduct is. They are just interested in making money with respect to \ntheir own speculation.\n  I have said many times that Will Rogers described this in the 1930s. \nHe talked about people who buy things they will never get from people \nwho never had it--and in these days with money they don't possess. But \nit is causing dramatic damage to this county's economy when you have a \nbubble of speculation occur in this commodities market.\n  To those who say it is not happening, I would ask them to bring this \nchart to the floor from the Energy Information Administration and take \na look at the last eight estimates of prices for energy based on supply \nand demand by the best people they have to evaluate supply and demand. \nThey should take a look at what has happened to the price of oil \nrelative to what EIA officials expected to have happen, evaluating \nsupply and demand. If you don't get excess, unbelievable, relentless \nspeculation out of this chart, then you don't get it at all.\n  Now, the proposal that has been offered is S. 3268. I indicated it \nrequires the delineation between normal hedging of a physical product \nby producers and consumers as opposed to those who are engaged in pure \nspeculation.\n  Then, it requires position limits that are significant against those \nwho are pure speculators. Those position limits are very important \nbecause that is what helps wring the speculators out of this \nmarketplace.\n  The proposal also increases regulation of Foreign Boards of Trade, \nindex traders, swap dealers, and over-the-counter transactions, among \nother things.\n  It requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to convene an \ninternational working group to work to find ways to standardize \nregulation and protect the futures markets from non-legitimate hedge \ntrading.\n  The proposal would also require the CFTC to use its existing \nauthority to revoke or modify all prior actions or decisions that \nprevent the CFTC from protecting legitimate hedge trades and to \ndiscourage speculative trades. Inexcusably, the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission itself has taken the position: Do what you want to \ndo. We will not look. Don't worry. In fact, the evidence of that is all \nin what are called ``no action'' letters. Boy, what a description for a \nregulatory agency: no action letters. They put them out again and again \nand again and again, which says: Do you know what, let's blindfold \nourselves. We propose we blindfold ourselves. It is unbelievable, in my \njudgment.\n  We provide that 60 days after passage of this bill, a report to \nCongress must be offered by the regulatory agency with respect to any \nadditional authority they need. But we take the position the CFTC has \nample authority to do all the things we have described but does not use \nthe authority because it is not interested in regulating.\n\n  So there are a number of things we believe are important. Protecting \nlegitimate hedge trading, that is a very important part of this market. \nThis market is an important market. But when a market is broken or \nperverted or a market is a place of excess or relentless speculation \nthat damages this country's economy, then I think we have a \nresponsibility to take action.\n  Now, some will say: Well, you have to do these six things. We would \nnot accept a bill or we would not even consider a bill that deals with \nspeculation unless you do the other five or six things. It is akin to \nsomebody who has a heart attack who is grossly obese, dramatically \noverweight. He has a heart attack and somebody says: Well, instead of \nworking on the heart, let's work on this overweight issue. Let's try to \ndeal with this obesity. Well, what about dealing with the heart attack \nfirst? How about dealing with the things you can deal with first that \nputs some downward pressure on prices?\n  So I expect this town now, from having filed S. 3268, will be full of \npeople who will say: There is no speculation. Or if there is \nspeculation, it is a minor amount. Or if there is speculation, this is \nthe wrong remedy. Or if you take this remedy, you drive all trading \noverseas, which is absurd, by the way. Or if you do this, you ruin the \nmarkets. I expect we will see all those excuses.\n  To all those who come to the floor to say: I support conservation, I \nsupport efficiency, I support renewable energy, I support additional \ndrilling, I say: Do you know what, I agree with all that. I agree with \nall that, though I do not support indiscriminate drilling everywhere. \nThat does not make any sense to me. But I agree with a remedy that \nsays: We should do a lot of things and a lot of things well. But I also \nthink if all we do every 20 years is talk about more drilling, you are \nnot talking about anything that is game changing for this country. That \nis called yesterday forever. Congratulations on the policy, but it is a \npolicy that hardly begins to free this country from the shackles that \nbind it with respect to the current energy policy. Even as we consider \nall of those other issues--and we must on an emergency basis--I think \nwe ought to take the first big step and deal with this issue of excess \nspeculation in the market.\n\n  Again, I come back to this chart. If you don't believe excess \nspeculation exists, then answer this question: What has happened in the \nlast 12 to 14 months that justifies the doubling of the price of oil? \nDemand up, you say. No, I am sorry, that is not the case. Demand is \nslightly less than was expected\n\n[[Page S6804]]\n\nin every one of these circumstances. So if demand isn't up, you may \nsay: Well, but China and India, Senator Dorgan. Don't you understand \nthat? Yes; 12, 14 months ago we understood what China and India were \nexpected to demand at that point.\n  My point is aggregate demand in the United States is down slightly. \nChina and India are up. It was expected that our demand would increase \nfor the first 5 months of this year. In fact, we experienced increases \nin inventory and stocks of the supply for the first 5 months. So you \ncannot point--and I have never found an expert who can point--in the \nlast 12 to 14 months, to something that has changed in any significant \nway in supply and demand that justifies the doubling of oil prices.\n  So my proposition is this: Let's deal with what most people \nunderstand to be a problem. Excess speculation is rampant and the \nmarketplace is broken. Let's demand the regulators begin to earn their \nsalary by thoughtful regulation with that which is prescribed in the \nlegislation that I have introduced. Then, at the same time, we should \nmove on to other issues for the coming decade when we ought to \ndramatically change the way we use and produce energy in this country--\nrenewables, conservation, efficiency and so much more.\n  I see I have exceeded my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a \nquick question?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. May I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to \nask the Senator one question?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there \nwill be no objection if an equal amount of time that is used by the \nDemocratic side will be added to the Republican side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for \nyielding. Would the Senator address the question of--in his very \nexcellent and very compelling argument he has just made about \nspeculation, it has been determined that speculation may be as much as \none-third the cost of gasoline, even up to one-half the cost of \ngasoline that is as a result of speculation?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to \nrespond, and that the Senator from Tennessee then be given an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have had testimony from experts who \nhave said that this excess speculation has driven up the price of oil \nand gasoline, in some cases they estimate by 20 percent; in other cases \nthey estimate as much as 40 percent. I don't think there is any \nquestion that if you look at this line--this is the line where prices \nhave gone--that you have to conclude this has had a dramatic impact on \nthe price. You can't see these things swing back and forth $4 and $7 \nand run up to $145 a barrel like some sort of wild curve, behind which \nthere are no set of facts that would justify it. That is why it is \nimportant, I believe, for this Congress to tackle this issue.\n  I yield back the remaining time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time do we now have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 36\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I intend to consume about 12. Would the chair please \nlet me know when 10 have expired?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so advise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6804-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6804-S6806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to say first that I had the \nchance to hear not only the Senator from North Dakota but the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, and what was going through my mind is \nthat this is exactly what the Senate ought to be doing every day--every \nday--until we have a full and complete debate about all of the causes \nof the current high gasoline prices, all of the solutions that we can \nput in place today, until we consider all of the amendments that we \nneed to bring up, and that we come to as a result. That is what the \nSenate is supposed to do. It is wonderful that we have 36 minutes to \nget up and present our sides, but our mode of business for the most \ndifficult problem facing our country ought not to be back-and-forth \narguments, or it ought not to be just to consider one bill brought up \nby the Democratic leader just because he is the majority leader and can \ndo that and not consider all of the other ideas.\n  I would like to hear all that Senator Bingaman has to say, for \nexample, about why he doesn't like the idea of State options for \noffshore exploration. He is a thoughtful Senator and chairman of the \nenergy committee. I would like to hear all that Senator Dorgan has to \nsay about speculation. He is a thoughtful Senator and, as he said, has \nbeen willing to support more offshore exploration in some cases, and \nmight do more.\n  We need to have a full debate about the extent to which speculation \nis a problem. For example, Senator Dorgan cited speculation as one \nreason we have gas prices above $4 a gallon. Republicans believe \nspeculation is part of the problem as well. The Gas Price Reduction Act \nwe introduced, with 44 Republican Senators supporting it--and we hope \nit earns significant support on the other side--has as one of its four \nparts speculation and putting 100 more cops on the beat to deal with \nit.\n  But we are also aware that Warren Buffett, who is invited to lunches \non the other side of the aisle because he is a well-admired person who \nunderstands the market well enough to make a lot of money on it, Warren \nBuffett said in June: ``It is not speculation; it is supply and \ndemand.''\n\n  The International Energy Agency, an energy policy organization with \n27 member nations, says:\n\n       Blaming speculation is an easy solution which avoids taking \n     the necessary steps to improve supply side access and \n     investment, or to implement measures to improve energy \n     efficiency.\n\n  So we need to consider a full debate on the extent to which \nspeculation makes a difference.\n  We believe--and we are not the first to have this idea--that the \nsolution to $4 gasoline prices is to find more oil and to use less oil. \nI wasn't the best student in economics at Vanderbilt University years \nago, but that is what I was taught in economics 101, that the reason \ngas prices are high is because we have had growing demand and \ndiminishing supplies. Also--I will get back to this more--what we do \ntoday about future prices can make all the difference in today's \nprices. I am not the only one who believes that.\n  Martin Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under \nPresident Reagan, a Harvard professor and member of the Wall Street \nJournal's board of contributors said in an article a few days ago: Any \nsteps that can be taken now to increase the future supply of oil--that \nis finding more--or reduce the future demand for oil in the United \nStates or elsewhere--that is using less--can, therefore, lead to lower \nprices and increased consumption today.\n  Not 10 years from now, not 5 years from now; what we plan for the \nfuture can make a difference in the prices today, and we need to be \ndoing that.\n  April is a single mother of two in Sevier County, TN, who took a job \n40 miles away 2 years ago so she wouldn't have to live off welfare. \nWith gas prices rising, she is spending about $160 a week on gas and \ncan't afford to pay all the bills. She sent me that letter in the past \ncouple of weeks.\n  Dave from Murfreesboro was laid off from his job at a trucking \ncompany in Jackson because they had to declare bankruptcy. They \ncouldn't afford the gas. The company just expanded the dispatch office \nand they bought new trucks when they ran out of money from rising fuel \nprices. He is now worried our middle class is disappearing.\n  Robert in Elizabethton, TN, a retired police officer, worked his \nwhole life so he could retire. But now with gas prices so high, he says \nhe has to cut back on his trips to the doctor and the grocery store \nbecause it has gotten so expensive.\n  Glenna from Lafayette is on social security and lives on a very fixed \nincome. She can barely afford to leave\n\n[[Page S6805]]\n\nhome. Even the food at her local grocery store has gotten more \nexpensive because they have to pay a gas fee for deliveries.\n  David from Knoxville has had to cancel his family's vacation this \nyear. He will be having a ``STAYcation,'' as he says. He just got a \npromotion and raise at work, but the increase in living costs with food \nand gas has left him with no net gain. Instead, he is struggling to pay \nhis bills.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthese five letters and e-mails from Tennesseans who are Americans hurt \nby high gas prices.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator Alexander, yes, I would like to share my gas price \n     story.\n       I live in Sevier County where majority of the jobs pay well \n     below $10 an hour. In my hopes of no longer being dependent \n     on any form of welfare, I needed not only a well paying job \n     but one with really good benefits. I took that job (a federal \n     government position) back in April 2006 and it is 40 miles \n     away from where I live or can afford to live. I am a single \n     mother of two. When I took this job, I didn't realize I would \n     a year later be spending $100-$160 dollars a week in gas just \n     to get to work, get my kids to school and get to stores for \n     necessities. We are surviving only because I do not pay all \n     my bills and the ones that I do pay are usually not on time. \n     It saddens me that I am again in a position of choosing \n     between bills, food or gasoline and that there are others \n     like me going through the same. We have enough issues in this \n     country to deal with that we are unable to help, like the \n     floods in Iowa wiping out farms which I do expect to increase \n     food prices. We can help what we do with the gas prices. \n     Thanks for reading my story. I would say more but it just \n     plain makes me angry.\n     April, Sevier County.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Alexander, I very much appreciate your fight \n     to prevent a 53-cent gas tax hike that had been included in \n     climate change legislation currently being debated in the \n     U.S. Senate.\n       I also welcome your support of legislation to explore now \n     for more American oil and natural gas in a way that preserves \n     the environment for future generations. We MUST have energy \n     independence from the middle east if America is to survive as \n     an independent, sovereign nation.\n       Your proposal for a new Manhattan Project may be just what \n     we need for that survival. As a former US Navy Submariner, \n     and Plankowner on the USS Tennessee (SSBN 734) I am keenly \n     aware of the narrow lead we had during WWII, and how (with \n     God's help) the Manhattan Project barely gave us enough of an \n     edge to win WWII. Today the balance may be even more delicate \n     and narrow than many realize.\n       I was laid off from a trucking company (St. Michael Motor \n     Freight) in Jackson TN, when they ran out of money to buy \n     fuel.\n       I had previously applied for a job with American Freight in \n     Christiana TN, around the time I went to work for St \n     Michael's in Jackson. They had ordered about 60 new \n     International 9400i class 8 road tractors, at a cost of \n     around 110 to 120k each.\n       So when the Jackson company ran out of money, I went down \n     to American Freight between Murfreesboro and Christiana, on \n     US 231. When I got there, American Freight had been forced \n     out of business, due to the high fuel prices. There sat 60 \n     brand new trucks on the fence, with the whole place \n     padlocked. They had just expanded the dispatch office, not to \n     mention many other improvements; all wasted as the place sat \n     closed up in bankruptcy.\n       Many Americans in general, and Tennesseans in particular \n     are becoming more than frustrated by the systematic \n     degradation and destruction of America's middle class in \n     general.\n       It is basically the disappearing middle class in America \n     that is the last group that still believes in American \n     sovereignty. Many of the super rich would like to see this \n     country forced under the subjection of the United Nations. I \n     think we are seeing that happen each day as more companies \n     close doors here & ship jobs over seas.\n       Let me encourage you to keep up the good fight and not back \n     down from big business as you continue the fight to keep \n     Tennessee's working middle class from disappearing.\n       Thank you for your time and interest in your fellow \n     Tennesseans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dave.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Alexander, I am a retired police officer. I worked \n     my whole life just to get to the point where I could retire \n     and travel. I have had to cut back on trips to the doctor, \n     medicines and groceries. I hope that you can help the \n     American people, we deserve better. Good luck in trying to do \n     something about this problem.\n     Robert, Elizabethton, TN.\n                                  ____\n\n       Mr. Alexander, regards to you and your family. I commend \n     you on your outstanding job and your very informative email \n     updates on our economy.\n       Gas prices have really affected me as an individual. I am \n     on Social Security and my income doesn't increase with the \n     rise in gas prices. I rarely leave the house anymore due to \n     the expense of buying gas to get around with, I haven't \n     bought gas in over a month now, luckily I still have about a \n     quarter tank. Others around me have felt the sting as much; \n     some have gas stolen right out of their cars. Since gas has \n     risen so rapidly, the groceries and utilities have also \n     risen. I even heard the local grocer state that the reason he \n     had to raise prices on the shelf goods was because the \n     delivery trucks now charge him a gas fee for delivering the \n     goods. He tried to apologize and I could see the pain in his \n     eyes because he had no choice but to go up on the prices. Not \n     only has the prices risen, the size of most goods are \n     smaller. That causes us to have to go back to the grocery \n     store more often and with a fixed income, that really hurts! \n     I have considered selling my 2005 Ford Escape (was a used \n     automobile when I bought it) and buying a pedal car or a \n     bicycle of some sort or even start using the lawn mower to go \n     out in town. I shudder to think that in Jan. the little raise \n     we get on Social Security will only be an insult compared to \n     the extent of the expense of surviving. It wouldn't surprise \n     me if our landlord decided to go up on the rent and if he \n     does, which would be to cover his deepening expenses, that we \n     would have to move and sell all our belongings that we need \n     to sustain this home. Can the government find us a place to \n     live? The tornado that ransacked Macon Co. has made it almost \n     impossible to find rent houses here. Yes, it has affected us \n     drastically and will continue to suck the life out of us \n     making it impossible to have any luxuries like cable tv, \n     which isn't a choice anymore to get a picture and groceries; \n     already we have had to cut out fresh vegetables and fruits.\n       I pray there will be a solution soon.\n     Glenna, Lafayette, TN.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Alexander, I recently received a promotion and \n     raise that resulted in a 20% increase in my salary. Prior to \n     this year, my family and I were always able to afford to \n     vacation for a week in Florida every summer. After the raise, \n     the price of gas has gone through the roof. We have seen our \n     ``windfall'' become a non-factor in our budget. On average, \n     we are spending $50 more per week resulting in $100 more per \n     pay period on gas alone. In addition, our grocery bills have \n     gone up 20% due to increased prices from higher fuel costs of \n     delivery and the price of materials in packaging. All of this \n     has resulted in creating a ZERO net gain for our family out \n     of a promotion and raise that I have worked on for over 2 \n     years!!!\n       To add insult to injury we are having to do what a lot of \n     other Americans are doing this summer, a STAYCATION. In case \n     you don't know what that is, it is a vacation that you take \n     at your home. You don't go anywhere, you stay put. I don't \n     know about you but I would think that this development in \n     itself will have a detrimental effect on the entire country \n     given that money from leisure activities will be way down.\n       How did 30 years go by and we are no further along with \n     solar and wind energy conversion? How is it that we allowed \n     our pursuit of nuclear energy to be stalled? When are we \n     going to open up the pipeline in Alaska to prove to the rest \n     of the world that we have adequate supply so demand pricing \n     goes down? What is the plan???? We need one right now or my \n     children and your grandchildren are going to inherit \n     something that none of us envisioned and the Democrats are \n     going to tax all of us as a way to cure a problem that they \n     don't have an answer for. Please provide your excellent \n     leadership to our Congress so that we can save this country!\n                                              Dave, Knoxville, TN.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The writers of these letters may say: All right, you \nare United States Senators. You are in charge of the Congress. Do \nsomething.\n  Well, we say find more, use less. We have a bill, 44 Senators \ncosponsored the bill, and we asked to bring it up. Senator Vitter of \nLouisiana brought it up the other day, and on behalf of the Democratic \nside, it was objected to. Now, I can understand that. Maybe it wasn't \nconvenient to bring it up that day, but it is not convenient for the \nletter writers who wrote to me to wait another 2 days for us to \nseriously deal with the issue of gasoline prices either.\n  So my suggestion is that the Democratic leader--and the whole Nation \nshould understand this. The Democratic leader may not have much of a \nmajority, but he has control of the agenda. If he wants to put gasoline \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate, he can do it the next hour. He \ncan do it before noon.\n  When he does it, I would respectfully ask that the American people \nexpect us to have a full discussion and full debate about how we can \nfix this problem, and that means what can we do about finding more, \nwhat can we do about using less.\n  We just heard two of the most prominent Democratic Senators who \nunderstand energy and who say we do need to do a variety of things. \nThey say that. We had a second bipartisan breakfast yesterday morning \non gas prices. Fifteen Senators attended--\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\neight Democrats, seven Republicans--or maybe it was the reverse. I \nwasn't there because I was in Chattanooga for Volkswagen's announcement \nof a new plant in Chattanooga, for which we are grateful. But we had a \ngood discussion the week before, and we had a good one yesterday. We \nshould be having that discussion on the Senate floor.\n  Our plan, the Republican plan, which we hope earns Democratic \nsupport, is very simple. It would increase American production by one-\nthird over time--by one-third, one, by giving States the option to \nexplore offshore for oil and gas and keep 37\\1/2\\ percent of the \nrevenues. If I were the Governor, as I once was--we don't have a coast \nin Tennessee, but I would have been delighted to have that money. I \nwould have put it in the bank and built the best higher education \nsystem in America, kept taxes down, and done some other things. That is \nwhat the four States in the South do. Virginia might decide to do it, \nNorth Carolina, Florida might. The oil market would get the oil and our \nprices would begin to stabilize. That would be 1 million barrels a day \nthe Department of Interior estimates. Remember, 85 percent of the area \non the Outer Continental Shelf in which we could drill is now off \nlimits. We are going to have to deal with that issue. We should be \ndealing with it on the Senate floor.\n  Two, we could go to three Western States and lift the moratorium on \noil shale development. We should proceed with that in environmentally \nsound ways. That should produce, according to the Department of the \nInterior, 2 million barrels a day. What do those numbers mean? It means \nwe could increase our production by one-third--increase American energy \nby one-third.\n  Now, we only produce maybe 10 percent of the world's oil, but we are \nthe third largest producer. Many on the other side have said: Well, \nlet's sue OPEC, the Middle Eastern countries, and make them produce \nmore oil. By analogy, we should be suing ourselves for not allowing the \nU.S. to produce more oil. We produce about as much oil as Saudi Arabia. \nWe are the third largest producer. We should make our contribution to \nfinding more American energy by producing more oil, and there are many \nRepublicans and some Democrats who are ready to do that. So why are we \nnot debating that and acting on that and voting on that on the Senate \nfloor? That is what the Senate is expected to do.\n  Then, use less. We are willing to do both. We understand both parts \nof the equation of supply and demand. Our suggestion and our \nlegislation--and I believe, personally, the most promising way for our \ncountry to rapidly reduce our reliance on foreign oil--is to use plug-\nin electric cars and trucks.\n  Now, when I first began talking about this, some people thought I had \nbeen out in the sun too long. But Nissan, Toyota, Ford, General Motors, \nare all going to be making and selling to us within a year or two or \nthree electric hybrid cars, or in Nissan's case an electric car that \nyou simply plug in at night. Where do we get the electricity to do \nthat? We have plenty of electricity at night when we are asleep. In the \nTVA region, for example, where I am from, the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, we produce about 3 percent of all of the electricity in \nAmerica. We have the equivalent of 6 or 7 nuclear powerplants worth of \nelectricity available at night which is unused. So TVA can bring me a \nsmart meter and say: Mr. Alexander, you can fill up with electricity at \nnight and drive your car 30 miles a day without using any gas. When I \nam here in the Senate, that is about all I drive. Three-quarters of \nAmericans drive less than 40 miles a day. Over time, the Brookings \nexperts believe we could electrify half our cars and trucks, and do it \nwithout building any more new powerplants because we already have \nunused electricity at night. So we are willing to do more and use less.\n  We hear too much coming from the other side of the aisle to avoid the \nfinding more part. They are dancing around the issue. We say: More \noffshore exploration with some exceptions. We hear: No, we can't.\n  We say lift the moratorium on oil shale, with some exceptions. They \nsay, no, we can't. We say more nuclear power, which is clean and we can \nuse it for electricity and to plug in our cars and trucks. They say, \nno, we can't. We need to be finding ways that we can say, yes, we can, \nto finding more and using less.\n  My last comment is this: I hope not to hear anybody else ever say on \nthe floor of the Senate that we cannot do something because it will \ntake 10 years. Did President Kennedy say we could not go to the Moon \nbecause it would take 10 years? Did President Roosevelt say we could \nnot build a bomb to win World War II because it might take 3 years? Did \nour Founding Fathers say we cannot have a Republic or a democracy \nbecause it might take 20, 30, or 40 years? Our greatest leaders have \nsaid this is the way we go in America. This is what we should be like \nin 5 or 10 years. We should have a new ``Manhattan Project'' for clean \nenergy independence, to put us on a path toward that independence with \n5 or 10 years.\n  From the day we take those actions, the price of oil and gasoline \nstabilizes and begins to go down. That is what was so eloquently said \nin the Wall Street Journal article by Mr. Feldstein. Let me conclude \nwith the very words he said 2 days ago:\n\n       Now here is the good news. Any policy that causes the \n     expected future oil price to fall can cause the current price \n     to fall, or to rise less than it would otherwise do. In other \n     words, it is possible to bring down today's price of oil with \n     policies that will have their physical impact on oil demand \n     or supply only in the future.\n\n  The United States and this world are waiting for us to enact a plan \nthat will find more American energy and use less oil, so it can see \nthat in the future we are on a path to energy independence and, as a \nresult, the prices of oil today will stabilize and begin to go down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 22 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will take the first 10 minutes and ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from New Mexico be accorded the final 12 \nminutes of our morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6806-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6806-S6809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HIGH GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to talk as well about high gasoline \nprices. I agree with my colleagues that this is the No. 1 issue of the \nday when it comes to domestic policy.\n  Frankly, as we talk about the housing crisis, the subprime mortgage \ncrisis, hopefully, our economy will work through this difficulty with \nthe collective efforts of the White House and Congress. But, frankly, I \nam worried the most that unless Congress acts to lift the moratorium on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf, the oil shale, and other sources of oil \nhere at home, then it will be high gasoline and high energy prices that \nwill plunge our Nation into a recession.\n  As bad as people feel the economy is going right now, I believe it \ncan only get worse, unless Congress acts responsibly to deal with the \ncauses of high gas prices. It is within our grasp to have a positive \nimpact and bring down the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  I think it is important for the American people to understand that \nthe consequences of the last election in 2006 meant that the \nDemocrats--our friends on the other side of the aisle--are in charge. \nAs the Senator from Tennessee mentioned, it is Senator Reid, the \nSenator from Nevada, the majority leader, who controls floor time. We \ncannot bring things up on the floor of the Senate unless he says it is \nOK. What we are doing here today is imploring him to get to work--to \nallow us to get to work on the Nation's business when it comes to \nbringing down the price of gas at the pump.\n  There is some good news: After 145 days of delay and going dark \nlistening to foreign terrorists, because we hadn't reauthorized the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, we were able to get a bipartisan \ncompromise and pass that legislation.\n  Here, again, this is where the majority party, the Democrats, control \nthe agenda and, frankly, we are seeing unnecessary delays that were \ncausing harm not only to our intelligence gathering, but also it has \nbeen 603 days\n\n[[Page S6807]]\n\nsince the Colombia Free Trade Agreement has been stalled. This is an \nexample where my State sells $2.3 billion of produce from our farmers \nand manufactured goods to Colombia. They bear a tariff that would be \nremoved if that trade agreement were to go through, which would create \nadditional markets and help create jobs and improve the economy not \nonly in Texas but across the country. If we can persuade Speaker Pelosi \nand Majority Leader Reid to allow this thing to go through, we can see \na boost in our economy as a result of that free trade agreement.\n  Then, of course, there is the matter of judicial nominees who have \nbeen blocked because of the unwillingness of the majority leader to \nallow them to have a vote on the Senate floor. It has been 748 days.\n  I am here to talk about this last figure, and that is the 814 days \nsince Speaker Pelosi said, in anticipation of the 2006 election:\n\n       If Democrats get elected and if I become speaker, we are \n     going to have a commonsense plan to bring down the price of \n     gasoline at the pump.\n\n  That was when gasoline prices were $2.33 a gallon. We thought gas \nprices were high then. What are they today? They are an average of \n$4.11 a gallon. We are still waiting for that plan.\n  So we are here to ask, in the most respectful way we know how, for \nthe Democratic majority leader in the Senate, who controls the floor of \nthe Senate, to bring a bill to the floor that will allow us to deal \nwith this national economic crisis and provide some relief to the hard-\nworking families in Texas and across the Nation who need some help. We \nknow that high energy prices not only impact the quality of life and \nthe economic welfare of hard-working people in my State and across the \ncountry, it has a ripple effect on the price of food and other \ncommodities, which is driving up inflation and threatening our economy. \nSo we need some action.\n  I was somewhat amused to hear the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Menendez, come to the floor yesterday and talk about the \nneed to ``act more and talk less.'' Act more and talk less. I agree \nwith the slogan, but I wish the majority leader and our friends on the \nother side of the aisle, who are in control of the agenda of the \nSenate, would take their own advice: Act more, talk less.\n  We know what is necessary in order to deal with the energy crisis in \nthis country. Here is what we have encountered: Nothing but \nobstruction. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, is our leader \non energy issues. He is the ranking member, and former chairman, of the \nSenate Committee on Energy. He has been an unparalleled advocate of the \nexpansion of nuclear power to generate electricity in this country.\n  What happens when we ask our friends on the other side of the aisle \nto work with us to try to expand the availability of cheap electricity \nthrough nuclear power in a safe way? It is blocked. What are we told, \nregarding our 300-year supply of coal in this country, that we want to \ninvest money in clean coal technology and to use that energy in a way \nthat protects the environment but generates electricity to be used by \nthe American people? We are told, ``no, you cannot do that either'' by \nthe majority party. When it comes to offshore exploration, taking \nadvantage of the God-given natural resources America has been blessed \nwith, we are told, ``no, you cannot do that either,'' even though it is \nwithin the power of the Congress to lift the ban that was imposed by \nthe Congress, which would allow us to explore and produce oil from the \nsubmerged lands around our shoreline.\n  The President lifted the executive ban a couple of days ago. So the \nonly barrier to the production of more of America's natural resources \nhere at home in the submerged lands off our coastline is the Congress. \nOur friends on the other side of the aisle are in charge, and we are \nimploring them to work with us to produce more American energy. We have \nheard a lot about the oil shale out in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. \nAbout 2 million additional barrels of oil a day, we are told, could be \nproduced from that oil shale. But we are told, ``no, you cannot do \nthat.'' That was Congress that imposed that ban last year on developing \nthe oil shale, which could relieve some of that pain at the pump.\n  Then, of course, we know about ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. When Congress actually passed legislation that would allow \nexploration and production of oil in ANWR, President Clinton vetoed it \nabout 10 years ago. If he hadn't vetoed that legislation, we would have \nabout a million barrels a day on line that would help with supply and \nwould bring down the price.\n  So the new energy policy of our friends on the other side of the \naisle seems to be a ``no energy'' policy. It is not ``let's do this \ninstead of that''; it is just ``no new energy.'' Now we are told that \nthe majority leader wants to bring a bill to the floor to focus on \nspeculation in the commodities market. We favor an examination of the \ncommodities futures market, more transparency, and more cops on the \nbeat in order to make sure the American people are being well served by \nthe commodities futures market. But it is not the only problem we need \nto deal with. We need to deal with the law of supply and demand, which, \namazingly, Congress is under the misimpression that it can suspend the \nlaw of supply and demand.\n  We know, because we have been told by the world's experts, that we \nare in competition with growing economies, such as China and India, \nwith more than a billion people each, who are buying cars and using \nmore energy because they want the prosperity that comes along with more \nenergy use. China's GDP is growing at 10 percent a year. It is building \nabout two new coal-powered plants a week in that country. So we know we \nare in a global competition.\n  You would think that common sense would tell us, from a national \nsecurity standpoint and from the standpoint of bolstering our economy \nhere at home and producing additional supply, which will give us \ntemporary relief as we transit that bridge Senator Domenici talks about \nto a clean energy future--we know in the long run we are going to have \nto get off of an oil-based energy dependency. Frankly, there is not \nenough of it for us to permanently continue where we are now. That is \nwhy alternative sources of energy are important and why it is important \nthat we conserve and, as Senator Alexander said, ``find more, use \nless.''\n  I was in Tyler, TX, last week, at Brookshire Groceries, which is a \nchain there. They were talking about how they had retrofitted their \ntractor-trailer rigs and tried to find ways to conserve and use less \ndiesel. They told me how they had retrofitted their tractor-trailer \nrigs to try to conserve and use less diesel. They found, also, that if \nthey drove their trucks at about 62 miles an hour, they could maximize \nthe range that they could travel--the distance--and minimize the \nconsumption of diesel. If I am not mistaken, I think they told me they \nwere able to save roughly 20 percent of their diesel consumption by \nfinding ways to conserve. So we support the concept of using less, but \nwe need to find more at the same time.\n  It makes sense that we produce more here in America. It will create \njobs at a time when our economy is flying into a headwind right here in \nAmerica, all across the country. It will bring some relief to consumers \nat the pump. We know that 70 percent of the price of gasoline is \ndirectly tied to the price of oil.\n  We need to ``act more and talk less,'' I agree. But it is up to the \nmajority leader to allow us to act by bringing an energy bill to the \nfloor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from New \nMexico have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is a privilege this morning to follow \nafter two Republicans who have eloquently expressed their views on this \nsubject. I compliment our conference chairman from Tennessee, Senator \nLamar Alexander. He has quickly taken the lead in this area as \nconference chairman and is doing an excellent job of putting us in a \nposition where we can explain to the American people what this issue \nreally is.\n  Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ months ago, I introduced a bill. The bill was \nintended to call to the Senate's attention that we ought to be \nproducing oil and gas\n\n[[Page S6808]]\n\nfrom U.S. assets, this oil and gas to be used by the American people to \nlessen our demand on foreign oil so that as we move across the bridge \nto the next fuel the world uses, we use less crude oil from foreign \nsources by using our own. That was the gist of the bill. It had \nconservation in it. It had production in it. It had addressed the \ncontinental offshore exploration.\n  Indeed, after 2\\1/2\\ months, nothing has been done except that the \nPresident of the United States intervened and said to the American \npeople: Let's just put the blame right where it belongs. I am lifting \nthe Executive moratorium on all of the coastline of America in the \nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans that abuts our country. I am lifting the \nones I have control over. And, Congress, you do what is next; you lift \nyours so we can begin the orderly process of having leases and \nproducing oil and gas from our property for our people.\n  I cannot tell you how thrilled this Senator was with the President's \naction because it said: What is next? I can almost envision the minds \nof those who are in the business of holding us hostage to natural gas \nand crude oil we have to purchase from overseas, in particular crude \noil. I can almost envision them peeking over and peeking down into the \nCongress of the United States, saying: Now it is your turn; we are \nwondering what you are going to do. Those who are holding us hostage \nare wondering: Is the United States going into another deep sleep?\n  There has been a 27-year deep sleep by America on these very valuable \nresources that should be explored on our coastlines which we own--we, \nthe people, own--and we should get to work on a program to see how much \nof that we can use and where is it and how many billions of barrels \nthere are. Make no bones about it, it should have been inventoried in \ndepth, but it has not been. For a long time, people were scared to do \nthat because they did not want to hear the results. Lately, the \nadministration did not want to do it because they didn't know if \nCongress would ever let us use it. So we have just cursory inventories, \nbut they indicate that 20 billion barrels is a pretty good number to \nconsider as the barrels we will probably get from offshore America. I \nam somewhat informed, and I say that is a lowest possible number. I \nwould think, if these offshore oil lands should really be opened for \nexploration, we are talking about anywhere from 20 billion to 100 \nbillion barrels of oil that belong to Americans that ought to be \nproduced.\n  As those foreign countries peek over, they are doing two things: they \nare peeking at us to see what we will do, and they are also peeking at \nus to see whether we are going to let this asset go dormant or are we \ngoing to put it into the pool so that the psychology of what is \navailable to the world will work its will and bring the price of oil \ndown.\n  I rise again today to speak on the most important economic and energy \nissue of our time. America faces a grave and growing threat from our \nmassive dependence on foreign oil. We are told by lead economists for \nthe International Energy Agency that we face a ``dangerous situation'' \nand that at today's pace, our global suppliers of oil will fail to meet \ndemand over the next 25 years. We hear our businesses deeply concerned \nabout fuel costs, and we hear the American people clamoring for new \nenergy supplies in the wake of $4-plus gasoline.\n  Amidst all of this noise, from the majority in Congress we get a \ndeafening silence. In fact, I think some on the other side of the aisle \nwere hoping that this whole thing could disappear until after the \nelection, that they wouldn't have to vote on what they want to do with \nthe American people's assets--to wit, the offshore oil and gas reserves \nthat are theirs, that have been locked up, as I said, for 27 years. I \nthink sometimes the other side of the aisle--at least some of them--and \nthe leadership would think: Let's just wait until after the election, \nand then we will solve the problem and we won't have the Republicans in \nthe way here. They can't do that because this is the Senate. An energy \nbill has to come up. We have to have amendments to it, and we have to \nvote. We will be looking anxiously and waiting anxiously for that to \nhappen.\n  I have spoken recently about the need to build a bridge to a clean \nenergy future of affordable, reliable alternative energy fuel. The \nfoundations of that bridge for the next three or four decades will be \nbuilt on our Nation's use of crude oil. I hate to say that, but I have \nthought it through, and no matter what we do, no matter how successful \nwe are, we are going to have to use crude oil until we find a total \nsubstitute for the automobiles and the trucks of today. They are the \nbig users. We cannot just pile them up and throw them away. They are \ngoing to be used. As they are used, we must have crude oil. So we are \ngoing to be dependent, and we have to find our way to bridge that with \nas much of it as we can produce at home. I have spoken about this and \nthe fact that may be three or four decades. It is very important that \neverybody understand that.\n  A growing majority of the American people are clamoring for us to \nexplore for more homegrown energy. When you consider that an increasing \nnumber of Americans across all political ideological spectrum support \nmore oil production at home, the Senate's silence on this issue is \nrather shocking. It is past time that the majority in the Senate \nrespond to the clarion call of the overwhelming majority of Americans. \nIt is time for leadership. The American people are calling for \nsolutions, and they are getting excuses. They are growing disillusioned \nby the inactions of Congress.\n  I have spoken at great length on this Senate floor about the fallacy \nof the so-called ``use it or lose it'' argument. I want to do that one \nmore time.\n  I hear many Members of this body accusing others of sitting on \nleases. But perhaps we should point this bright perspective light back \non ourselves. With the Executive moratorium now lifted, Congress is \nsolely responsible for locking up billions of barrels of oil and \ntrillions of cubic feet of natural gas. Perhaps it is the American \npeople who will tell us: Use it or lose it.\n  According to a comprehensive report by the National Petroleum Council \ncalled ``Facing the Hard Truth About Energy,'' in the United States an \nestimated 40 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil resources \nare completely off limits or are subject to significant lease \nrestrictions. That is more than the equivalent of 8 years of total U.S. \nimports at current rates. On the Atlantic and Pacific OCS alone, there \nis estimated to be 15 billion barrels of oil. That is more than the \ntotal Persian Gulf imports over the past 15 years and approximately the \nsame amount of the total oil produced in the Gulf of Mexico in the past \nhalf century. There are abundant oil reserves there waiting to be \ndrilled, waiting to be explored, waiting for American ingenuity and \ntalent which is now in abundance, and it is best to act on it because \nit is ours.\n  These figures are staggering, and in light of the fact that our \nestimates have historically been very low when we get to actual \nexploration and production, perhaps we should take the time and \nresources to pay for a very comprehensive inventory. Then we would know \nhow much there is out there. The American people would be even more \nexcited about the prospects of that vast resource which is theirs.\n  Staggering as the numbers are, they do not include the 800 billion \nbarrels of oil-equivalent oil shale located in Colorado, Utah, and \nWyoming. By the conservative estimates of the RAND Corporation, our oil \nshale resources at the base is three times greater than the oil \nreserves in Saudi Arabia.\n  The facts are clear: We are spending hundreds of billions of American \ndollars to purchase something from around the world that we have \nsitting under our feet. As gasoline exceeds $4 a gallon and oil hovers \naround $140 per barrel, the American people should be tired of excuses. \nI believe they are.\n  Amidst this backdrop, it is stunning that the majority offers a \nsimple speculation bill. Every serious expert--from Daniel Yergin, to \nGuy Caruso, to Ben Bernanke, and Warren Buffett--recognizes it is a \nsupply-demand problem and not a speculation problem. We are glad to \ndebate the issue, but we better put some other things before the \nSenate, not just that, if we intend for the American people to believe \nwe care about their plight and the plight of the American economy \ntoday.\n\n  With all that is going on that is scaring the American people, I \npersonally believe the biggest culprit in the crowd is the growing \ndependence on crude oil, the amount of money we send overseas\n\n[[Page S6809]]\n\nevery hour, every day, every week, every month to countries, many of \nwhich are our enemies and could care less about us, that we must pay \nthat to get crude oil to be refined so that we can move our automobiles \nand our trucks and do our work and our business every day.\n  It sounds incredible that we would not join together, Democrats and \nRepublicans, on this exciting day and say we finally have pulled back \nthe curtain that has had a blackout imposed on offshore drilling in \nAmerica and join hands and say: What do we do to begin to develop it as \nquickly as we can? I don't see why we ought to be arguing. We ought to \ndo it together and quickly. That is what the American people would \nlike. I don't think that is what we are going to get. I hope some \nDemocrats will be listening. That is what this Senator would like to \ndo.\n  We have a bill. We have a proposal. It would probably be better if \nDemocrats and Republicans had one together that both produced and \nconserved, that produced more oil and conserved more in terms of our \nautomobiles by producing more electric cars. Just combine those--this \none, and match it off against another one--and we will be moving in the \nright direction.\n  I close by saying I hope that day comes. I hope the other side is not \nwaiting, doing nothing until the election is over, using any excuse \nthey would like. There is no excuse. We can do it, and we ought to do \nit now. The curtain has now rolled back. The offshore is there to look \nat, to see, and it contains billions of barrels of oil that are ours. \nWe ought to go get it in an orderly way, and we ought to pass laws in a \nbipartisan way that permit us to do it. But if not, we ought to put \nforth ours and have some serious votes in front of the American people \nto decide our future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EMERGENCY PLAN FOR INDIAN SAFETY AND HEALTH.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Fund.--There is established in the \n     Treasury of the United States a fund, to be known as the \n     ``Emergency Fund for Indian Safety and Health'' (referred to \n     in this section as the ``Fund''), consisting of such amounts \n     as are appropriated to the Fund under subsection (b).\n       (b) Transfers to Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Fund, out of funds of the Treasury not otherwise \n     appropriated, $2,000,000,000 for the 5-year period beginning \n     on October 1, 2008.\n       (2) Availability of amounts.--Amounts deposited in the Fund \n     under this section shall--\n       (A) be made available without further appropriation;\n       (B) be in addition to amounts made available under any \n     other provision of law; and\n       (C) remain available until expended.\n       (c) Expenditures From Fund.--On request by the Attorney \n     General, the Secretary of the Interior, or the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall transfer from the Fund to the Attorney General, the \n     Secretary of the Interior, or the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, as appropriate, such amounts as the Attorney \n     General, the Secretary of the Interior, or the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services determines to be necessary to carry \n     out the emergency plan under subsection (f).\n       (d) Transfers of Amounts.--\n       (1) In general.--The amounts required to be transferred to \n     the Fund under this section shall be transferred at least \n     monthly from the general fund of the Treasury to the Fund on \n     the basis of estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n       (2) Adjustments.--Proper adjustment shall be made in \n     amounts subsequently transferred to the extent prior \n     estimates were in excess of or less than the amounts required \n     to be transferred.\n       (e) Remaining Amounts.--Any amounts remaining in the Fund \n     on September 30 of an applicable fiscal year may be used by \n     the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Interior, or the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to carry out the \n     emergency plan under subsection (f) for any subsequent fiscal \n     year.\n       (f) Emergency Plan.--Not later than 1 year after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General, the Secretary \n     of the Interior, and the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, in consultation with Indian tribes (as defined in \n     section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n     Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)), shall jointly establish an \n     emergency plan that addresses law enforcement and water needs \n     of Indian tribes under which, for each of fiscal years 2010 \n     through 2019, of amounts in the Fund--\n       (1) the Attorney General shall use--\n       (A) 25 percent for the construction, rehabilitation, and \n     replacement of Federal Indian detention facilities;\n       (B) 2.5 percent to investigate and prosecute crimes in \n     Indian country (as defined in section 1151 of title 18, \n     United States Code);\n       (C) 1.5 percent for use by the Office of Justice Programs \n     for Indian and Alaska Native programs;

and\n       (B) use 45 percent to implement requirements of Indian \n     water settlement agreements that are approved by Congress (or \n     the legislation to implement such an agreement) under which \n     the United States shall plan, design, rehabilitate, or \n     construct, or provide financial assistance for the planning, \n     design, rehabilitation, or construction of, water supply or \n     delivery infrastructure that will serve an Indian tribe (as \n     defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)); and\n       (3) the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting \n     through the Director of the Indian Health Service, shall use \n     5 percent to provide domestic and community sanitation \n     facilities serving members of Indian tribes (as defined in \n     section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education \n     Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)) pursuant to section 7 of the \n     Act of August 5, 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2004a), directly or through \n     contracts or compacts\n\n[[Page S6810]]\n\n     with Indian tribes under the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the amendment I called up and made pending, \n5076, is an amendment we have been working on for some time. The \nSenator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, is going to offer a second-\ndegree amendment to this, but what I wish to simply say, by way of \nspeaking to the amendment, is this is an important piece of \nlegislation. No one can deny that since its enactment in 2003, PEPFAR \nhas helped provide basic medical care and other services to those in \nneed throughout Africa and around the world. There is clearly still a \nneed for many of these services worldwide, and I applaud the United \nStates for the leadership it has taken in combating HIV/AIDS overseas. \nUnfortunately, there are also many individuals in America who are \nstruggling to meet many of the basic standards of living, including \nmany Native Americans, with whom the United States has a trust \nresponsibility.\n  My bipartisan amendment, which has six cosponsors, seeks to ensure we \ndo not turn our backs on these critical domestic needs by redirecting \n$2 billion in authorization, or 4 percent of the overall cost of the \nbill, over the next 5 years to tribal public safety, health, and water \nprojects. This modest redirection will still allow for PEPFAR \nauthorization levels over three times their current amount, or $18 \nbillion over the President's request, while at the same time starting \nto address some very critical needs here at home. Unfortunately, many \nof these needs are great. Nationwide, 1 percent of the U.S. population \ndoes not have safe and adequate water for drinking and sanitation. On \nour Nation's Indian reservations this number climbs to an average of 11 \npercent, and in the worst part of Indian country that number is 35 \npercent. This lack of reliable, safe water leads to high incidence of \ndisease and infection. The Indian Health Service has estimated that for \neach $1 it spends on safe drinking water and sewage systems, it gets a \ntwentyfold return in health benefits. The IHS estimates that in order \nto provide all Native Americans with safe drinking water and sewage \nsystems in their home, they would need over $2.3 billion. What this \namendment does is it starts to address that need by authorizing $1 \nbillion for that important critical infrastructure need.\n  When it comes to the issue of health care--and that is where the \nsecond-degree amendment of the Senator from North Dakota will add to \nwhat my amendment does--we have Native Americans who are three times as \nlikely to die from diabetes as compared to the rest of the population. \nIn fact, an individual who is served by the IHS is 6\\1/2\\ times more \nlikely to suffer an alcohol-related death than the general population. \nAn individual served by IHS is 50 percent more likely to commit suicide \nthan the general population.\n  In terms of my State of South Dakota, on the Oglala Sioux \nReservation, the average life expectancy for males is 56 years. In Iraq \nit is 58, in Haiti it is 59, and in Ghana it is 60--all higher than \nright here in America on our Indian reservations.\n  In South Dakota, between 2000 and 2005, Native American infants were \nmore than twice as likely to die as non-Native infants. In South \nDakota, a recent survey found that 13 percent of Native Americans \nsuffered from diabetes. That is twice the rate of the general \npopulation, where only 6 percent suffer from that disease.\n  With respect to public safety, which is essential, because without \nsafety children cannot learn and economic development cannot occur, one \nout of every three Native American women, according to the national \nstatistics, will be raped in their lifetime.\n  According to a recent Department of Interior report, tribal jails are \nso grossly insufficient when it comes to jail space that only half of \nthe offenders who should be incarcerated are being put in jail. That \nsame report found that constructing and rehabilitating only those \ndetention centers that are most in need will cost $8.4 billion.\n  Again, when you drill down to my State of South Dakota, the South \nDakota Attorney General just released a new study on tribal criminal \njustice statistics this week, and according to that study homicide \nrates on South Dakota reservations are almost 10 times higher than \nthose found in the rest of South Dakota. Forcible rapes on South Dakota \nreservations are seven times higher than those found in the rest of \nSouth Dakota.\n  The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has a crime rate six times higher than \nthe rest of the country. This crime rate places them in the top 15 for \nreservations nationwide, which is a drop from last year's rating, which \nhad them in the top 10. Unfortunately, this drop has nothing to do with \nimproving public safety on Standing Rock but instead is because of \nworsening crime rates and conditions on other reservations.\n  By way of example, some of these critical unmet needs have actual \nconsequences in the day-to-day operations of tribal courts and law \nenforcement, and I want to point out one example from the Standing Rock \nSioux Reservation, which borders South Dakota and North Dakota.\n  Earlier this year, the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation had six police \nofficers to patrol a reservation the size of Connecticut. Now that \nmeans that during any given shift, there was only one officer on duty. \nOne day in particular, the only dispatcher on the reservation was out. \nThat left one police officer to act both as a first responder and also \nas the dispatcher. Not only did this directly impact the officer's \nability to patrol and respond to emergencies, it also prevented him \nfrom appearing in tribal court to testify at a criminal trial.\n  In the Rosebud Sioux Tribal Court there was another example of a \ntribal prosecutor who was scheduled to attend court proceedings that \nday but who didn't appear in court that morning. Being somewhat alarmed \nby this, the tribal judge sent a court employee to the police \ndepartment to ensure that the prosecutor was not hurt or in an \naccident. Once it was clear that the prosecutor had not been injured, \nbut instead just did not make it to court that day, all cases scheduled \nhad to be dismissed because no replacement prosecutor was available. \nCases that were dismissed included sexual assault, domestic violence, \nchild abuse, and DUIs.\n  Again, what this amendment does, very simply, is it redirects $2 \nbillion of the $50 billion that would be authorized under this bill for \nPEPFAR--$1 billion to an emergency plan for Indian public safety, and \n$1 billion to clean water programs--and then, as I said earlier, by way \nof a second-degree amendment that will be offered by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, $250 million to health care. Within 1 year, the Attorney \nGeneral, the Secretary of Interior, and the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services shall establish an emergency plan to address law \nenforcement and drinking water needs of Indian tribes.\n\n  Specifically, the amendment requires the authorization to be spread \nequally between public safety and water projects as follows: $750 \nmillion for public safety, of which $370 million would be used for \ndetention facility construction, rehabilitation, and replacement. That \nis through the Department of Justice; $310 million for the BIA's Public \nSafety and Justice Account, which funds tribal police and courts; $30 \nmillion for investigations and prosecutions of crimes in Indian \nCountry, which includes the U.S. attorneys and FBI; and $30 million \nwould be used by the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs for Indian and \nAlaska Native programs. Finally, $10 million for cross-deputization or \nother cooperative agreements between State or local governments and \nIndian tribes and $250 million for health care, which will be split, as \nthe Director of Indian Health Services determines, between contract \nhealth services, construction and rehabilitation of Indian health \nfacilities and domestic and community sanitation facilities serving \nIndian tribes, and, as I said, $1 billion for water projects which will \nbe used to implement Indian water supply projects approved by the \nCongress.\n  We have been working now the last several days on this amendment. I \nthank my colleagues who have been involved with that. Senator Kyl is a \ncosponsor of this amendment. Last week he and I worked to put this \namendment together, to file it. Subsequent to that, I began to work \nwith Senator Dorgan, who chairs the Indian Affairs Committee in the \nSenate, trying to get sort of a bipartisan agreement we could proceed \non that included not only water\n\n[[Page S6811]]\n\ndevelopment and law enforcement but also Indian health services.\n  I also thank Senator Biden and Senator Lugar, the managers of the \nbill, for their cooperation on this, in making it possible for us to \nproceed to a vote and actually to do something meaningful to address \nthe very desperate and acute needs that exist across this country on \nAmerica's Indian reservations.\n  Some of the statistics I have quoted show the needs are very real. In \nthe area of law enforcement and public safety, we have a crisis across \nthis country when it comes to making sure we meet the needs of Native \nAmericans living on our reservations--that they can live with basic \npublic safety and security, that they have access to basic \ninfrastructure such as water and health care.\n  Those are all things this amendment is designed to address, and it \ndoes it in a way that is consistent, I believe, with the purpose and \nintention of the underlying bill, which is to provide many of these \nsame services to those in Africa. As I said earlier, I believe it is \ncritically important that in the context of addressing those needs, we \naddress the very important needs at home, in our own backyard. In South \nDakota, we have nine tribes. In many of our reservations, the poverty \nrates and the degree of hopelessness and despair that exists on the \nreservations comes back to these very issues. It comes back to a lack \nof infrastructure, it comes back to the need for basic public safety \nand security, and it comes back to the need for critical health care \nservices that are often unmet on America's Indian reservations.\n  I thank my colleagues for working with me. I thank those who have \ncosponsored the amendment and the managers of the bill for working with \nus to put it in a form that could be accepted. I hope as it proceeds to \nthe House--as indicated in conversations and discussions with the \nchairman of the committee last night--that we will be able to retain \nthe amendment when it gets to that point in the process.\n  Again, I offered the amendment, got it pending, and I know the \nSenator from North Dakota, my colleague, has some remarks he wants to \nmake with regard to his amendment and his second degree. At this point, \nI yield the floor to allow him to make those observations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota. \nSenator Thune and Senator Kyl have worked on a piece of legislation \nthat I believe is very important. We have worked together on a wide \nrange of these issues.\n  I held a hearing in Arizona with Senator Kyl on Indian law \nenforcement issues. I worked with Senator Thune on the issue he \ndescribed with respect to the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation \nand the very serious law enforcement problems and challenges they face \nthere.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5084 to Amendment No. 5076\n\n  I wish to offer a second-degree amendment. I offer it on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Thune, Senator Johnson, Senator Kyl, and Senator \nBingaman. I ask the second-degree amendment be considered. I send it to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     and Mr. Thune, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kyl and Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5084 to amendment No. 5076.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reallocate the distribution of funds from the Emergency \n                   Fund for Indian Safety and Health)\n\n       On page 4, line 8, strike ``and water'' and insert ``, \n     water, and health care''.\n       On page 4, line 12, strike ``25 percent'' and insert ``18.5 \n     percent''.\n       On page 4, line 15, strike ``2.5 percent'' and insert ``1.5 \n     percent''.\n       On page 4, line 21, strike ``1 percent'' and insert ``0.5 \n     percent''.\n       On page 5, line 12, strike ``20 percent'' and insert ``15.5 \n     percent''.\n       On page 5, line 20, strike ``45 percent'' and insert ``50 \n     percent''.\n       On page 6, strike lines 7 through 17 and insert the \n     following:\n       (3) the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting \n     through the Director of the Indian Health Service, shall use \n     12.5 percent to provide, directly or through contracts or \n     compacts with Indian tribes under the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450 et \n     seq.)--\n       (A) contract health services;\n       (B) construction, rehabilitation, and replacement of Indian \n     health facilities; and\n       (C) domestic and community sanitation facilities serving \n     members of Indian tribes (as defined in section 4 of the \n     Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 450b)) pursuant to section 7 of the Act of August 5, \n     1954 (42 U.S.C. 2004a).\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the underlying legislation that is offered \nby Senator Biden and Senator Lugar is a very important piece of \nlegislation. We have moral responsibility to address global AIDS, so I \nsupport what we are doing. I believe it is very important. We have \nworked with Senator Biden and Senator Lugar with respect to the first-\ndegree amendment offered by my colleagues and the second-degree \namendment I have offered.\n  While I believe we have a significant moral responsibility to address \nglobal AIDS and will do so in the underlying bill, it is also the case \nthat we do not have to go off our shore to find Third World conditions. \nYou can go to some Indian reservations in this country and find Third \nWorld conditions in this country, dealing with health care, with crime, \nwith education, and a whole range of issues.\n  Take a look at some of the Indian reservations and you will find \npeople have water in their house because they hauled water. They haul \nwater every day, or sometimes two or three times a week, in order to \nhave water in their home. You will find there are places that do not \nhave indoor plumbing; they have outdoor toilets. We have had testimony \nbefore my committee of people living in used trailer homes with wood-\nburning stoves, vented out of a pipe through a window in the living \nroom. Third World conditions exist in this country.\n  The amendment offered by my colleagues, and my second-degree \namendment, begin to address these issues in the area of law \nenforcement, health care, and water policies. It is very important.\n  I wish to describe the second-degree amendment. I fully support the \nunderlying bill and am proud to be a cosponsor of it.\n  In regards to the law enforcement issues, you don't feel safe, you \nare afraid of the violence on the Indian reservations, as stated by my \ncolleague who described the Standing Rock Reservation that straddles \nNorth and South Dakota and its substantial runup in violence. In \nresponse to this, we now have additional resources, additional law \nenforcement people, but they will only be there for 90 days. We need to \naddress these issues. One in three Native American Indian women will be \nraped or sexually assaulted during their lifetime. My colleague \ndescribed that. We had a hearing about that subject. We need to address \nthe violence that exists and therefore address the law enforcement \nissues. That is what the underlying amendment does. My colleagues, \nSenator Thune and Senator Kyl, have done a great job working on this.\n  We have also worked together on other legislation we are introducing \nthat is bipartisan, that is a broad legislation dealing with law \nenforcement. I appreciate the work of all my colleagues on the Indian \nAffairs Committee to address those issues.\n  But I wish to talk about this second-degree amendment. The underlying \namendment is a $2 billion issue. A portion of that, $250 million, will \nbe dealing with the issue of Indian health. As we described before, the \namendment deals with water and law enforcement. This second-degree \ntalks about $250 million dealing with Indian health, half of which will \nbe addressing facilities and the needs of facilities and the other half \naddressing contract health funding shortages that are in desperate \nneed.\n  We had a hearing about 2 weeks ago. A young woman named Tracie Revis \ncame to the hearing. She was a member of the Muscogee Creek Nation, a \nstudent at the University of Kansas Law School, a Native American. She \nshared her story with my committee, and here is the story.\n  She began law school in August 2005. After she had been sick for a \nyear and a half, she finally withdrew from law\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\nschool in order to try to get some medical treatment. Her doctors \ndiscovered a large mass in her chest and she was subsequently diagnosed \nwith Hodgkin's Lymphoma. She went through several cycles of \nchemotherapy, stem cell transplant, radiation in order to try to be \ncancer free. She is cancer free today.\n  Throughout her diagnosis and treatments, she struggled to try to get \napproval for coverage from the Indian Health Service. Due to the lack \nof access--there was very little access where she was--and the urgency \nof treatment, she was forced to pay for most of her own treatment. She \nwas left with over $200,000 of personal debt. That included the cost of \na surgical procedure where a doctor was conducting a biopsy on this \nyoung woman, and, during the conduct of this biopsy, they discovered a \ncancerous tumor that was much larger than they expected. They decided \nto surgically remove 75 percent of that tumor during the biopsy. The \nproblem was the doctor doing the surgery, while in the operating room, \nmade this decision but didn't get approval from the Indian Health \nService for the surgical procedure so that now the young woman \npersonally owes the funding for that surgery.\n  That is what is happening in the Indian Health Service, and it has to \nend. When we dealt with an Indian health bill a while ago, I showed a \nphotograph of this young woman, 5 years old; her name is Ta'shon Rain \nLittlelight. I will tell you about her, briefly, to tell you why I am \nso passionate about trying to provide some funding for Indian health. I \nwas, at the time, at the Crow Nation in Montana with Senator Tester, \nholding a hearing, and her grandmother showed up. Her grandmother held \nthis photograph above her head and she said Ta'shon was 5 years old. \nShe loved to dance. You could see the sparkle in her eyes. Ta'shon \nbecame very ill. They took her again and again and again to the Indian \nhealth clinic and they diagnosed this 5-year-old girl with depression--\ndepression, they said.\n  Then one day she became violently ill. They took her to Billings, MT. \nFrom there, she was put on an airplane, taken to the cancer center in \nDenver, CO, and she was judged to have had terminal cancer.\n  Ta'shon Rain Littlelight lost her life. Her grandmother and then her \nmother told me of 3 months of unmedicated pain for this little 5-year-\nold girl because she didn't get the health care treatment most of us \nwould expect for all our families. In fact, when they diagnosed this \nyoung girl with terminal cancer, one of the things Ta'shon Rain \nLittlelight told her mother she wanted was to go see Cinderella's \nCastle, and Make-A-Wish Foundation--what a wonderful organization--\nprovided the opportunity for her to go to Orlando, FL, to see \nCinderella's Castle at Disney World. The night before she was to visit \nthe castle, in the motel room, Ta'shon snuggled up to her mother and \nsaid: I am so sorry I am sick. I am going to try to get better, Mommy.\n  She died that night in her mother's arms. She never saw Cinderella's \nCastle. Now, a 5-year-old is dead because she didn't get the kind of \nhealth care most of us would routinely expect. She was sick so they \nsaid she was depressed. No, she wasn't depressed. She had terminal \ncancer and wasn't treated and she lived the last 3 months of her life \nat that age in unmedicated pain.\n  This country can do better than that and has a moral responsibility \nto do better than that.\n  I can stand here and tell stories for hours--Ardel Hale Baker, who \nwas having a heart attack and was sent to a hospital and pulled on a \ngurney into the hospital with an 8-by-10 piece of paper Scotch-taped to \nher leg that said: If you admit this patient, understand we are out of \ncontract health care funding so you, hospital, may be on your own; you \nmay not get paid. This is a woman having a heart attack, wheeled into \nan emergency room with a piece of paper tacked to her leg saying: By \nthe way, you might not want to admit this patient because Indian \nContract Health is out of money.\n  If I am upset about these things it is because I have seen and heard \nso much that makes me sick about the way this health care system works \nfor some and not for others. We can do much better.\n  My second-degree amendment is supported by a good number of my \ncolleagues--Senator Johnson, Senator Thune, Senator Kyl, Senator \nBingaman, and Senator Murkowski. My amendment takes a portion of this \n$250 million authorization out of the $2 billion, that is the subject \nof the underlying amendment and says: Let's do this. Let's deal with \nthe water issues--which are very important. I commend my colleague. \nLet's deal with the law enforcement issues. They are urgent. I commend \nmy colleagues for that. Then let's also carve a piece out with respect \nto Indian health, half of which will deal with facilities that are \ndesperately needed and half of which will deal with contract health \ncare funding. This funding is so desperately short that in many parts \nof Indian Country the refrain is: Don't get sick after June because \nthere is no money.\n  We have a trust responsibility. And that trust responsibility is a \npromise this country made long ago and a promise this country ought to \nstart keeping. So I am proud to offer the second-degree amendment. This \nis a bipartisan effort to deal with water, law enforcement, and health \ncare.\n  I am pleased to be here with my colleague, Senator Kyl, who will be \nhere shortly. But as I indicated, he and I have conducted a hearing on \na reservation just outside of Phoenix, AZ, on the law enforcement \nissues. He has worked very hard on those issues, and so, too, has \nSenator Thune. I appreciate the cooperation and the work we have done \ntogether.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me say to both Senator Thune and to my \ncolleague from North Dakota that I think the work they are doing here \nis first rate.\n  As a matter of fact, Senator Kyl, who is coming to speak on this \namendment as well, and I have agreed to, through the Judiciary \nCommittee and through the regular order of business, work on one aspect \nof the three pieces of this amendment: water, health, and law \nenforcement.\n  I think we are going to be joined by our colleague as well on further \nincreasing the assistance to the Indian nation. It is not an \nexaggeration to say that it is fairly astounding how poorly, over the \n35 years I have been here, we have treated the Indian nations.\n  An awful lot of people, at least in my neck of the woods, think \nbecause they read about some of these Indian nations that have gambling \non their reservations and are making tens of millions of dollars that \nsomehow all is well, that we do not have to pay much attention to the \nmoral obligation we have and the treaty obligations--I will not get \ninto all of that but the treaty obligations we have been making and \nbreaking since the 1800s.\n  So I am reluctant--I was reluctant--to talk about beginning to chip \naway at this bill which Senator Lugar and I and many others have worked \nso hard on. But I conferred with my Democratic colleagues on the House \nside who have jurisdiction over this matter. And I wanted to make it \nclear to Senator Thune, because I do not want to make a commitment I \ncannot keep, that if and when we get to the point where--I do not speak \nfor Senator Lugar, but I am prepared, on the Democratic side, to accept \nthe amendment at the appropriate time. And I wanted to make it clear \nthat I was kidding yesterday, and I will say in the Record, I want it \nnoted that I am joking, but this is not a Russell Long ``acceptance of \na voice vote.''\n  It used to be, in the old days when I got here, Russell Long would \naccept anything on a voice vote on a finance bill. And the joke was, \nbefore he got to the other side of the House, they were dropped. That \nis why most people asked for rollcall votes, to make it harder for the \nconference to drop amendments.\n  It is my commitment to my colleague that I have been told by the \nHouse that although they prefer nothing change in the bill, they are \nprepared to accept this amendment and that there is no intention of \ndropping this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Murkowski be added as a \ncosponsor on my second-degree amendment. She is a cosponsor of the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I wanted to make sure we are playing on a level playing \nfield because I want to say publicly what I was privately asked. So I \nhope when Senator Kyl in his leadership capacity I do not think he is \nable to be here for another few minutes, but when he does come and \nspeak, that we may be able to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Before we leave the discussion, I want to thank the \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Delaware, for his \nwillingness to work with us. And we did have some discussions last \nnight privately about what happens as this proceeds to the House.\n  I appreciate his comments for the Record today and his commitment to \nwork with us to see that it is retained when the bill moves forward to \nthe House.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Indiana as well, Mr. Lugar, for his \nwillingness to work with us to accept this amendment. I do not disagree \nfor a minute about the importance of the underlying bill. I do believe, \nas I stated earlier, however, that there are some incredibly critical \nneeds in this country. And, of course, the amendment addresses law \nenforcement, infrastructure needs with respect to water development, \nand also health care.\n  But the law enforcement component is something on which I have been \nvery active for some time. As I mentioned, we have some tremendous \nneeds. If you go back to 1870, there are photos of that time, there is \na photo at the tribal headquarters at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation \nin the 1870s, a vintage photo of a number of cops on the reservation. \nThere were 28 of them. We are down now to eight or nine cops, and we \nhave a responsibility, I believe, for public safety and security when \nit comes to our reservations and our tribal leaders who work with us. \nThey have advocated coming and requesting additional assistance in \nfunding to address law enforcement needs on the reservations.\n  The Senator from Delaware had indicated last night, as well, a \nwillingness to work with us not only on this piece of legislation but \nadditional efforts to solidify and reinforce the commitment that we \nmade to the people who live on reservations that we are indeed serious \nabout law enforcement, about providing basic levels of public safety \nand security.\n  So I thank him for his commitments and look forward to working with \nhim and with the Senator from Indiana as this process moves forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5083\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a bipartisan commission for the purpose of \nimproving oversight and eliminating wasteful government spending under \n            the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief)\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 5083 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5083.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be no \nsecond-degree amendments in order to the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I was saying, I think we can all agree \nthat providing relief for those afflicted with the AIDS virus is a \nworthy and noble goal. I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Lugar, and the Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, for their work.\n  I think we all would recognize, though, that it is important not only \nthat Congress provide appropriate oversight for the various programs \nthat we create and the spending that we authorize but that we actually \ndo everything we can to make sure any waste associated with a \nGovernment program, particularly one as big as this one, with a $50 \nbillion authorization, that we establish mechanisms that will allow us \nto review and provide the appropriate oversight, and, if necessary, \neliminate inefficient and wasteful programs.\n  My amendment establishes the bipartisan U.S. Authorization and Sunset \nCommission, which will help improve oversight and eliminate wasteful \nGovernment spending in programs reauthorized or established by S. 2731, \nthe PEPFAR bill.\n  Just to be clear, in negotiations with the majority leader, I \nactually had a sunset commission bill modeled after the sunset \ncommission in my State and a variety of States that has been enormously \neffective in looking across the Government to reduce waste and \ninefficient programs. But in our negotiations we agreed this would be \nnarrowly addressed in the PEPFAR Program, which I think is appropriate. \nBut I want to say that I intend to be here at every opportunity \npressing this issue because of its importance across the Federal \nGovernment in reducing waste and inefficiency.\n  As I said, the sunset commission idea was modeled after the process \nin my State, which--and I know many other States, but in Texas it was \ninstituted in 1977 and has eliminated, over time, more than 50 State \nagencies that were no longer serving their stated purpose and saved \nState taxpayers more than $700 million.\n  The commission consists of four Senators and four Members of the \nHouse of Representatives. The CBO and GAO will serve as nonvoting ex \nofficio members. My original intent, as I said, was to make this more \nbroad than just the PEPFAR Program, but perhaps this would be a great \nsort of pilot program, if you will, to see how it works, as we consider \nprograms and expand it more broadly.\n  The commission will recommend ways to improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency of the PEPFAR Program according to a timeline. While \ncertainly this $50 billion is an awful lot of money, and certainly it \nis $20 billion over and above what the President actually originally \nasked for, and as the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office has said, it \nis probably going to be impossible for the program to spend more than \n$35 billion within the 5-year budget window, it makes it even more \nimportant--the matter of making sure that the money is spent for \nintended purposes--that it is actually used to treat AIDS and HIV and \nactually help people get better and not waste it on extraneous matters. \nUnder this amendment, Congress cannot simply ignore the commission's \nreport. The amendment provides expedited procedures that will force \nCongress to consider and debate the commission's work, similar to the \nBRAC procedures.\n  This commission will help Congress do the necessary oversight to make \nsure every taxpayer dollar under PEPFAR is being spent wisely. The \ncommission will focus on unauthorized and ineffective programs, as I \nsaid. The simple fact is, within the myriad of programs, funds, and \norganizations funded by Congress each year, the Office of Management \nand Budget has done a review of about 1,000 Government programs and \nconcluded that about 25 percent of them were either ineffective or that \nthe OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, said there was not \nsufficient information to make a conclusion one way or another.\n  That is 25 percent of about 1,000 Government programs. So we know \nthere is waste and ineffectiveness of Government programs, and the need \nfor more oversight is there. I think this would basically provide \nCongress two bites at the apple when it comes to evaluating Federal \nspending: when it authorizes a program, and, secondly, when it \nappropriates money for it.\n  Year after year the Congressional Budget Office has found that \nCongress appropriates billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' \nmoney on programs, despite the fact that their authorization has \nexpired. This means Congress has dropped the ball when it comes to \ndoing the hard work of figuring out whether these programs are working \nand whether taxpayers' money is being spent efficiently or wastefully.\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\n  While we all do our best to ensure that proper oversight is given to \nevery program, we simply do not have the tools or the time necessary to \nmonitor and review every program. That is why this sunset commission \nreview is important. It would give these tools, specifically because of \nthe narrowed-down nature of the amendment, to the PEPFAR Program. But I \nthink it is particularly applicable, given the fact that this bill \nwould more than triple the amount of Government spending for this \nparticular program.\n  The commission will be of assistance to the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It will not replace \ntheir work; instead, it will supplement their work. It will serve as \nanother set of eyeballs, keeping a close eye on the wallets of the \ntaxpayer.\n  Let me be clear, though, in conclusion. This is not a problem only \nfor PEPFAR and this program, it is a problem in every part of our \nGovernment. I continue to support the creation of a sunset commission \nthat would review all Government operations--from transportation to \nscientific research to foreign aid. And my hope is at a later point we \nwill be able to urge its adoption more broadly.\n  Simply put, the purpose of the commission is to ask: Is this program \nstill needed? Is it still serving the intended purpose? Is the money \nthat Congress has appropriated, is it accomplishing the goal that \nCongress intends?\n  I think, and my hope is, that my colleagues would support this \namendment and provide this needed additional oversight that would \nassist the Congress in making sure that taxpayers' money is being spent \nas intended to help the worthy humanitarian purposes for which this \nparticular program is intended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Cornyn amendment \ncreating a sunset commission related to this bill. This amendment would \nrequire that PEPFAR programs be abolished within 2 years after the new \ncommission reviews them, regardless of whether the review recommends \nabolition, unless Congress takes steps to reauthorize the programs.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and other committees in the \nHouse, the Senate, and Congress as a whole have spent the last year \nreviewing U.S. HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs in \npreparation for the debate on this bill. During this process, numerous \nchanges have been made to achieve greater transparency and oversight, \nalong with programmatic changes to ensure that PEPFAR is moving in the \nright direction. The bill before us today has benefited from extensive \nfield examinations of the program, GAO review, and a study by the \nInstitute of Medicine of the National Academies. Moreover, the \nunderlying bill mandates regular scrutiny by the inspectors general, \nthe GAO, and the IOM.\n  This reauthorization is based on the widespread view in Congress and \nin the executive branch that these programs are working and that they \nhave humanitarian and foreign policy values. I do not believe we should \nbe turning over responsibility for part of the legislative process to \nan unelected commission. Constitutionally, this is a job for Congress, \nworking in association with the executive branch of Government. \nCongress does not lack the power to end or to change programs. Indeed, \nthe Appropriations Committee must review the program every year during \nthe annual budget process. If some aspect of this program is not \nmeeting expectations, Congress has the ability to withhold funds at \nthat point.\n  I understand that sunset laws in some cases can have value, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas has pointed that out from experience \nin the State of Texas. For example, they have been used to eliminate \nunnecessary reports or other provisions of law that have been forgotten \nor fallen into disuse. But this does not apply to this bill which is \ncontinuing a core foreign policy program. There is no lack of scrutiny \ntoward PEPFAR. It is an extremely high-profile endeavor the President \nhas asked us to reauthorize for 5 years. I would, therefore, ask \nMembers to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will speak briefly, and then we are ready \nto vote on this amendment.\n  I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nIndiana, and I would add two points.\n  I am a fan of sunsetting legislation. There used to be a fellow who \nworked here with us named Lawton Chiles. He got here in 1970 and \nstarted sunsetting ideas, and I am a supporter. But here is the deal, \nwhat makes this different.\n  One of the problems in getting many of these African governments in \nparticular to sign on to being recipients and participants in the \nPEPFAR legislation to save the lives of their own constituents has been \nthe uncertainty of whether, if they start the program, it will, in \nfact, last. What they don't want to do, since they know they can't \ncarry it themselves, they don't want to find themselves out there where \nthey have made a promise, and it turns out that we decide, at some \nnear-term date, to say no, we are out. That is not what the Senator is \nsaying. He is not saying we are going to get out. He is saying we are \ngoing to review. I argue that, as the Senator from Indiana has, we are \nreviewing. There is built-in review here.\n  Let me mention one point. The Ministers of Health from 12 African \ncountries wrote the Congress to express their concern, not about this \namendment per se but about the impact of uncertainty around the \nreauthorization of PEPFAR and what impact it would have on their \nprograms in their countries. They said this uncertainty will cost lives \nbecause providing these antiviral treatments for people living with \nHIV/AIDS or caring for orphans and vulnerable children is a long-term \ncommitment, and if the partners can't be confident we are going to \ncontinue the program, they are going to be much less willing to enroll \nnew patients and take on a financial responsibility they can't bear. I \nunderstand the intent. But it is particularly dangerous to apply it \nhere.\n  By the way, we don't know whether it applies to PEPFAR specifically, \nto the tuberculosis program, to the HIV program. Does it apply to all \nthe myriad pieces of this legislation that are holistically designed to \nprevent and treat the spread of these diseases and the prolonging of \nlife?\n  The last point, we essentially have a sunset provision. It is only \nauthorized for 5 years. At the end of 5 years, it is over. We have \nhortatory language saying it is our hope and expectation, if it works \nas well as we anticipate and works as well as it has in the past, it \nwill be continued for another 5 years. But we can only authorize it for \nthat 5 years.\n  For those reasons and others which I will not bore my colleagues with \nnow, some of which, if not all of which, my friend from Indiana has \nalready mentioned, I will at the appropriate time ask for the yeas and \nnays and suggest to our colleagues that we defeat the amendment.\n  Mr. President, we all want to see effective oversight of taxpayer \ndollars, but this amendment would exacerbate the very problems it is \nattempting to solve.\n  It would create an expensive new bureaucracy that would duplicate \nfunctions already being performed by numerous inspectors general, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the Office of Management and Budget, \nand other outside organizations commissioned by Congress to carry out \nreviews of this program.\n  The Congress just spent the last year reviewing the HIV/AIDS, TB, and \nmalaria programs.\n  The bill before the Senate is based on extensive field examination of \nthe programs, on a GAO review and on an Institute of Medicine study.\n  We are considering a reauthorization based on the widespread view in \nCongress that these programs are working. We have a near consensus that \nthey are some of the best foreign policy programs that we have. Why do \nwe need another review at this stage to repeat what has just been done?\n  Furthermore, the Senate bill already mandates regular scrutiny by the \ninspectors general, by GAO, and the IOM.\n  Not only would this Sunset Commission be redundant, it could be \nharmful.\n  Under this amendment, AIDS, TB, and malaria programs would be \nabolished within 2 years after the commission's review--even if that \nreview is\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\npositive--unless Congress acts to reauthorize them.\n  Aside from the fact that we don't want to be fighting to get these \nprograms to the floor every 2 years, think about what message this \nwould send to the world.\n  As I have said, last year, the ministers of health from 12 African \ncountries wrote to the Congress to express their concern about the \nimpact uncertainty around reauthorization of PEPFAR would have on HIV/\nAIDS programs in their countries.\n  They said that uncertainty could cost lives because providing \nantiretroviral treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS or caring for \norphans and vulnerable children are long-term commitments, and if \npartners cannot be confident that the program is going to continue, \nthey are going to be much less willing to enroll new patients for \ntreatment.\n  This provision would only magnify that problem, calling into question \nthe U.S. commitment to this program.\n  Finally, the amendment does not define what a program is. Is it \nPEPFAR itself? Is it our treatment programs? Is it a single grant to a \nfaith-based organization working in Kenya?\n  PEPFAR is widely respected as a high-performing program that embraces \nwhat works and discards what doesn't.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I think everyone admires the humanitarian \nintent of this legislation. But the American people have a right to \nknow that their money is going to be spent for the intended purpose--to \ntreat AIDS and HIV in the countries covered--and that it is not wasted. \nOne of the reasons foreign aid gets a bad rap is because people wonder \nwhether it is going to be squandered or used appropriately.\n  The only thing this amendment does is provide an extra set of eyes to \nmake sure every dollar is spent, as Congress intended, on a \nhumanitarian purpose. This is especially important under this \nparticular program because the Congressional Budget Office says that \neven though this bill authorizes $50 billion for this purpose, only \nabout $35 billion could actually be spent during the 5-year period \ncovered by this bill. What is going to happen to the additional $15 \nbillion? One might ask, are we going to try to jam $15 billion more \ninto the program than can actually be spent effectively and efficiently \nto accomplish congressional purpose?\n  The extra set of eyes would be welcome. It doesn't substitute for the \nimportant oversight work the committee is performing, but when the \nOffice of Management and Budget surveys 1,000 Government programs and \nfinds that almost a quarter of them are not operating the way Congress \nintended or there is not enough evidence to tell, which I am not sure \nwhich is worse, we have to be more diligent than we have been about \nspending money effectively.\n  As regards the uncertainty of future Congresses and how they might \nact, that is inherent in the fact that Congress can pass laws, can \nrepeal laws. That is part of what we do, the reason why we have an open \nprocess and full and fair debate on issues. No one is suggesting that \nis going to happen here. I am saying, let's make sure this money is \nspent for the intended purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have been instructed by the floor staff \nthat they are running traps to make sure people are prepared for a \nvote. I hope we can do that because if we don't vote by 12:15, we \nprobably will not get back on voting until after 4 because of some \nluncheons; that is, the caucus lunch, the leadership lunch. There is a \nRepublican meeting as well.\n  In the meantime, if I could take a moment while that is being checked \nto suggest how maybe we will proceed, if we can, between now and 12:15, \nhopefully we will be able to get this vote in. Also, I spoke with \nSenator Kyl on the Dorgan-Thune, et al., amendment, which we are \nprepared to accept. He says he only needs to speak for a minute or two. \nMy hope was that we could wrap up both those things. Maybe Senator Kyl \nis available, and we could move to the voice vote on that. In the \nmeantime, if we don't vote by 12:15, there will be no votes until \naround 4 p.m.\n  One of the things I have learned, in a major bill such as this, if \nyou lose momentum, it just takes longer. I would like to keep some \nmomentum going.\n  I would like to suggest the absence of a quorum. Let's hang here for \na few minutes to see if we can clear a vote on the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5076\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Biden has indicated that one of the \npieces of business on this legislation we can take care of right now \nrelates to an amendment Senator Thune and I offered to the bill, and \nthen if Senator Dorgan and others have reached an agreement with us \nabout a way to modify that amendment so that it is acceptable to all, \nboth the second-degree and then the underlying amendment can be adopted \nwithout the necessity of a rollcall vote.\n  Let me describe what it is. Some of us had felt that the total price \ntag at $50 billion, while too high for this particular program, at \nleast was an acknowledgment that we were willing to spend that amount \nof money on matters that related to needs both here in the United \nStates as well as abroad.\n  Among those needs, as a result of hearings Senator Dorgan has had and \nSenator Thune and I have identified, as well as others, are needs \ndealing with Native Americans in the United States, some of which are \nthe same in terms of water projects that we would be dealing with in \nthis underlying PEPFAR bill, but rather than doing that all in \ncountries of a continent such as Africa, for example, some of that \nwould be done for U.S. citizens because of reports that have \ndemonstrated the dire conditions that exist on some of our Indian \nreservations.\n  So the amendment Senator Thune and I proposed was to take $2 billion \nof the total $50 billion authorization from PEPFAR and devote it to a \ncombination of law enforcement on Indian reservations and for Native \nAmericans and water-related needs of our Native Americans.\n  Senator Dorgan wanted to further amend that by providing for some \nIndian health activities that could be funded by part of the amendment \nas well. So the second-degree amendment provides for funding of $750 \nmillion for law enforcement and $250 million for Indian health-related \nactivities. In addition, the underlying Thune-Kyl amendment provides \nfor an additional $1 billion authorization for water development and \nprojects on the Indian reservations.\n  So the bottom line is, the $50 billion for the PEPFAR authorization \nwould be reduced to $48 billion. Two billion dollars in authorization \nwould go to the Indian reservations and Native American needs, and \nAlaska Natives as well, that I indicated. That is an agreement that has \nbeen reached as a result of Senator Thune, myself on the Republican \nside, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Biden on the Democratic side, but \nalso several other Members--both Democrat and Republican--with whom we \nhave spoken who have asked to be listed as cosponsors on the amendment \nor second-degree amendment before we pass it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5084\n\n  There is no indication, Mr. President, there is a need for a rollcall \nvote on this amendment since it has been agreed to by all. Therefore, \nunless there is anyone else who would wish to speak to this amendment, \nI ask unanimous consent that the second-degree amendment be called up \nfor a vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. A voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on amendment No. 5084? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5084) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 5076, as Amended\n\n  Mr. KYL. So, Mr. President, if I could, before I thank everyone \ninvolved here, by unanimous consent, the second-degree amendment was \nadopted,\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\nand we voice-voted the underlying amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was a voice vote on the second degree.\n  Mr. KYL. OK. So, then, we need to have a voice vote on the underlying \namendment as well?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask for that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n5076, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 5076), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I just use this opportunity to also \nthank Senator Lugar, whom I did not mention but who was also helpful, \nand his staff, as well as Senator Biden and his staff, and Senator \nThune, for all of his work in bringing this issue to the attention of \nthe body, and acknowledge the groundwork that Senator Dorgan and his \ncommittee laid in order to make this possible for us to achieve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I now, after discussions with my colleague, \nask unanimous consent that at 12:15 p.m. the Senate vote in relation to \nCornyn amendment No. 5083 and that the time until that vote be equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Senator Vitter has been kind enough to come \nto the floor. He is trying to help move this process. He has an \namendment relating to an inspector general. We have not had a chance to \ntalk to him, but Senator Lugar and I have a second-degree amendment to \nthat amendment that I think it may be worthwhile for the three of us to \ntalk about.\n  Senator Vitter has indicated he would like--and I have no objection, \nassuming the second degree is in order--that the pending business, when \nwe return, when the leadership meetings are over, be the Vitter \namendment. I forget the number, quite frankly, but the Vitter amendment \nrelating to inspectors general.\n  Am I correct, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. VITTER. Correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have no objection to that, as long as there is a second-\ndegree amendment in order to the Vitter amendment when that occurs.\n  But I yield to my colleague, Senator Lugar.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of the \nchairman. It is my understanding we could continue on after the vote \nwith Senator Vitter presenting his amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. In other words, there will not be a recess in which \neveryone leaves the floor?\n  Mr. BIDEN. There is not a recess, correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I just wanted to establish that point. The continuity of \nthe debate will continue.\n  Mr. BIDEN. So maybe rather than asking unanimous consent, it might be \nworthwhile to state the intention of the managers that after the vote \non the Cornyn amendment, what we will do is move to the Vitter \namendment; that he is here on the floor and will seek recognition to \nmove his amendment. In the meantime, we will let him know what the \nsecond-degree amendment we are going to be offering to his amendment \nwill be. As a practical matter, it will be the order of business at the \ntime because he will have been recognized to move to his amendment.\n  In the meantime, unless my friend from Texas would like to speak \nfurther on his amendment, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, the vote is now set for 12:15 on the Cornyn amendment; \nam I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Cornyn \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. There is a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 32, nays 63, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 178 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--32\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     McConnell\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--63\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Bayh\n     Kennedy\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 5083) was rejected.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, for the benefit of our colleagues, we are \nmaking pretty good progress here. We only have a few amendments to go. \nTo try to get a sense for our schedules and time, I will start by \nsaying I don't see any reason why we will not finish this bill early \ntonight, No. 1. No. 2, I am told by the leaders that there will be no \nvotes between now and 4.\n  We are prepared to take up, debate, discuss, and accept some \namendments. I wish to ask my colleagues who have amendments--Senator \nVitter is working with us right now. We may be able to work something \nout on his amendment. Senator DeMint has an amendment that we have \ndebated. We are ready to vote on it, but he indicated he may have other \npeople wishing to speak to it. We are ready to vote, after 4 o'clock, \non that. I wish to set a time for that. Senator Craig has two \namendments. One we are prepared to accept, and the other we are \nprepared to vote on. I believe he is ready to vote when we can set the \ntime. Senator Kyl has an amendment that I believe we are ready to vote \non. The only question is whether there will be a point of order on that \namendment because it relates to the budget. That is being discussed \nnow. Senator Sessions has an amendment which we are desperately trying \nto figure out how to proceed on and work out. We may be able to \naccommodate that and end up with a voice vote on that amendment.\n  I want my colleagues to know that in the next ensuing minutes and \nhours we are going to try to work out specific times. As my grandfather \nused to say, ``With the grace of God and the good will of the \nneighbors,'' by 4 o'clock, we will be able to set a series of votes. I \ndon't see why we cannot finish this by 5 o'clock. That is the \nintention, but intentions here are not always met with reality. That is \nthe intention.\n  I see my colleague, the ranking member of the committee, standing up. \nI don't know if he wants to make any comment.\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. No.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5085\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. While we are working on the Vitter amendment--we made an \noffer and there has been a counteroffer--I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside and I send to the desk an amendment \nby Senator Gregg and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for Mr. Gregg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5085.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To encourage the inclusion of cost sharing assurances and \n  transition strategies among compacts and frameworks agreements, the \nactivities authorized under section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act \n     of 1961, and the highest priorities of the Federal Government)\n\n       On page 77, line 2, strike ``and''\n       On page 77, line 5, strike ``.''.'' and insert a semicolon.\n       On page 77, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       ``(C) the inclusion of cost sharing assurances that meet \n     the requirements under section 110; and\n       ``(D) the inclusion of transition strategies to ensure \n     sustainability of such programs and activities, including \n     health care systems, under other international donor support, \n     or budget support by respective foreign governments.''.\n       On page 88, line 22, strike ``.''.'' and insert the \n     following: ``, including--\n       ``(A) cost sharing assurances that meet the requirements \n     under section 110; and\n       ``(B) transition strategies to ensure sustainability of \n     such programs and activities, including health care systems, \n     under other international donor support, or budget support by \n     respective foreign governments.''.\n       On page 94, after line 25, add the following:\n       ``(G) Amounts made available for compacts described in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be subject to the inclusion \n     of--\n       ``(i) cost sharing assurances that meet the requirements \n     under section 110; and\n       ``(ii) transition strategies to ensure sustainability of \n     such programs and activities, including health care systems, \n     under other international donor support, and budget support \n     by respective foreign governments.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Very briefly, this amendment relates to cost sharing and \ntransition strategies. It has been cleared on both sides. I suggest we \nmove by voice vote. I ask unanimous consent we proceed to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5085) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, unless my friend from Indiana thinks we \nshould proceed, I think we should spend the next few minutes in a \nquorum call while we try to work out, if we can, the Vitter amendment. \nSo I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on June 9, just a month ago, Nebraska Beef, \nan Omaha slaughterhouse, received a notice from the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture that two beef samples had tested positive for E. coli. By \nthe second week in June, it had also been confirmed that numerous \npeople from my State, Ohioans, had been infected with E. coli O157:H7, \na sometimes deadly strain of bacteria. It was not until July 3--June 9 \nwas the original notification--that Nebraska Beef finally acquiesced \nand issued a recall of 5.3 million pounds of its meat.\n  Federal officials at the USDA have criticized Nebraska Beef for being \nslow to respond. Unfortunately for consumers in my State and other \nplaces, USDA's authority--beyond issuing public admonishments--to \nprotect the public is limited. In other words, USDA under the law \ncannot order a recall. They can be critical of Nebraska Beef. They can \nnotify others about what Nebraska Beef is doing. But they cannot order \na recall. For instance, most Americans would be alarmed to learn that \nthe Federal Government does not have the power to issue a mandatory \nrecall of contaminated food. Had the USDA been able to issue a \nmandatory recall of Nebraska Beef once it became clear that consumer \nsafety was at risk due to unsanitary production conditions, unsafe food \nwould have been taken off of the shelves more quickly and fewer people \nwould have purchased it and consumed contaminated meat.\n  Again, June 9 is when the USDA first found out, but it was not until \nJuly 3--almost 4 weeks--until Nebraska Beef did what it should have \ndone right away, something USDA had no authority under law to do. Lives \ncontinue to be put at risk because of delay since many consumers may be \nunknowingly storing infected meat in their kitchens for future use.\n  I have been on this floor lots of times in the 18 months I have been \nin the Senate, especially the last 8 or 9 months, talking about food \nbanks and food pantries. I know the Presiding Officer from New Jersey \nhas had particular concerns of constituents of his in places such as \nEssex County and urban poor areas but also rural, low-income areas or \neven moderate-income areas where people with jobs, people employed but \nnot making much money have to go to food banks and food pantries to \nsupplement their food budgets because of the cost. We have enough \nconcerns of people getting food. We should not have to have concerns in \nNew Jersey or Ohio about buying food and being uncertain of its safety.\n  In my State, health officials have confirmed that 21 Ohioans, plus \nanother 20 in other States, have been made ill by this outbreak. \nYesterday, reports were released that indicated the outbreak has spread \nfrom Ohio and Michigan, where it was initially reported and perhaps \nconfined to, to now New York, Kentucky, Indiana, and possibly Georgia. \nThe 21 ill Ohioans hail from Franklin County, Columbus, Fairfield, \nwhich is where Lancaster is the county seat, Lucas, which is where \nToledo is located, Delaware, Seneca and Union Counties. Eleven people \nhave required hospitalization.\n  This recent example is, unfortunately, not an isolated case. An \nanalysis of a selected sample of outbreaks affecting Ohio over the last \n5 years has shown a widespread problem. It is not the first time, and \nit probably will not be the last time. It means it is a real public \nhealth issue. Ten outbreaks dating back to 2003 have led to 217 \nillnesses, 66 hospitalizations, and 1 death.\n  Of the people exposed to food safety problems, to toxins, to bacteria \nin our food supply, those who are harmed the most are the very young \nand very old, people whose immune systems are weaker, who are sick \nanyway and are most likely to be hospitalized or even die from these \nkinds of outbreaks. But it affects all of us. Some of these outbreaks, \nsuch as those involving hepatitis A and botulinum, cause serious \nlifelong health problems. It is not a question of your digestive tract \nclearing it out and surviving these bacteria; sometimes they actually \ncause long-term health problems.\n  The top priority for both USDA and the Food and Drug Administration, \nthe two chief food safety oversight agencies, should be to protect the \npublic's health--a mission that will sometimes require swift and \ndecisive action that sometimes the industry simply will not like. It is \nall about public health.\n  That is why yesterday I introduced legislation to provide mandatory \nfood recall authority for both the USDA, which is responsible for \npoultry and beef, and the FDA, which is responsible for most processed \nfoods, fruits and vegetables--everything the USDA doesn't do. Mandatory \nrecall authority will ensure that these agencies have the necessary \nleverage to demand that those private companies, such as Nebraska Beef, \nthat have sometimes been\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\nresistant--many companies have. Many companies that hear it want to \ndeal with it immediately, but some do not. Under our legislation, these \nagencies will have the necessary leverage to demand that those private \ncompanies responsible for feeding our Nation follow strict safety \nstandards, and it means that when mistakes are made, public safety is \nnot compromised.\n  I have partnered in this initiative with Representative Diana \nDeGette, a Democrat from Colorado. She and I sat together on the Health \nSubcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. She still sits there \nand has been a long-time advocate of making a generally good food-\nsafety regimen in this country even better. This is one major step in \ndoing that.\n  In 2004, the GAO concluded that the current recall system, which \nrelies on voluntary action by industry, is flawed and that the USDA and \nFDA must do better to ensure recalls are prompt and complete. The \nadministration seems to have reached a similar conclusion, asking \nCongress late last year to provide FDA with mandatory recall authority.\n  So consumer groups want it, the FDA wants it, the President wants it, \nand an awful lot of us in this Chamber think the FDA and USDA should \nhave authority to do mandatory recalls. I hope the FDA food safety \nlegislation currently being drafted in both Chambers ultimately \nincludes mandatory recall provisions and that we get a chance to vote \non such a proposal this year.\n  It is imperative both USDA and FDA be given this authority. We can't \nafford to continue to put the public's health at risk by waiting for \nsome kind of comprehensive legislative package. A simple fix such as \nthe one in my and Representative DeGette's SAFER Meat, Poultry, and \nFood Act, could solve this glaring deficiency in our food safety \nsystem. I implore my colleagues to support our legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in response to the outrageously high cost \nof fuel all across this country, and the fact that people both in the \nsouthern part of America and the northern part of America are very \nworried about how they are going to stay warm next winter and stay cool \nthis summer, I introduced S. 3186, the Warm In Winter And Cool In \nSummer Act, which will provide immediate relief to millions of senior \ncitizens, families with children, and the disabled who are struggling \nto pay their home energy bills. Specifically, this bill would nearly \ndouble the funding for the highly successful Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, that is the LIHEAP program, in fiscal year 2008, \ntaking LIHEAP from $2.57 billion to $5.1 billion, a total increase of \n$2.53 billion. I mention that is, in fact, what this program is \nauthorized for.\n  I thank Majority Leader Reid for completing the rule XIV process. My \nhope is that this legislation, this bill, will be on the Senate floor \neither this week or next week because it is imperative that we move it \nas quickly as possible.\n  There are many Members of the Senate, Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents, who have been active on the LIHEAP issue for a number of \nyears. I want, at this time, to announce that we have now 40 Senators \nwho are cosponsors of this tripartisan legislation. That includes 10 \nRepublicans. It includes 30 Democrats and 1 Independent in addition to \nmyself, making 2 Independents.\n  The cosponsors of this legislation are Senators Obama, Snowe, \nMajority Leader Reid, Smith, Durbin, Coleman, Murray, Sununu, Landrieu, \nCollins, Leahy, Murkowski, Clinton, Gregg, Cantwell, Lugar, Kerry, \nDole, Kennedy, Bond, Schumer, Levin, Cardin, Brown, Klobuchar, \nMenendez, Casey, Bingaman, Lautenberg, Stabenow, Bill Nelson, Baucus, \nLieberman, Salazar, Rockefeller, Wyden, Jack Reed, Dodd, Whitehouse, \nand Tester.\n  In other words, we have very strong tripartisan support, from the \nnorthern part of our country, from the southern part of our country--\nall over. People look at the degree of partisanship that takes place in \nCongress. I am happy to say this bill is bringing all kinds of people \nfrom all kinds of ideologies together to say we have a crisis now; that \nin the United States of America people should not freeze to death in \nthe winter; in the United States of America people should not be dying \nof heat exhaustion in the summer.\n  In addition to engendering widespread tripartisan support in the \nSenate, another bill, exactly the same, is being circulated in the \nHouse with very good cosponsorship. Furthermore, I am happy to say we \nhave over 200 groups, national and local groups from all over the \ncountry, that are supporting this legislation. They include, among many \nothers: AARP, the city of Phoenix, AZ, Catholic Charities, Salvation \nArmy, the American Red Cross, the American Association of People with \nDisabilities, et cetera, et cetera--tremendous grassroots support from \nall over the country.\n  Let me quote from the AARP which, as you know, is the largest senior \ngroup in this country. This is what they say:\n\n       AARP fully supports the Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer \n     Act. This legislation will provide needed relief for many \n     older persons who may not receive assistance--despite their \n     eligibility--due to a lack of funding. Older Americans who \n     are more susceptible to hypothermia and heat stroke know the \n     importance of heating and cooling their homes. They often \n     skimp on other necessities to pay their utility bills. \n     However, today's escalating energy prices and the Nation's \n     unpredictable and extreme temperatures are adding to the \n     growing economic hardships faced by seniors. LIHEAP is \n     underfunded and unable to meet the energy assistance needs of \n     the program's eligible households.\n\n  That is from the AARP. I reiterate, Mr. President--what I know you \nknow--there are some Americans and maybe even Members of Congress who \ndo not know that when we talk about LIHEAP, we are not just talking \nabout the problems that occur in my State where the weather gets 20 \nbelow zero or in your State. We are talking about problems that take \nplace in Arizona and Texas, where temperatures get to be 110, 115 \ndegrees. With a declining economy and escalating utility bills, many \npeople--seniors, disabled, lower income people--cannot afford their \nelectric bill. Their electricity is being disconnected. You are finding \nelderly people, people with illnesses, in a very horrendous position.\n  This is not just a northern State issue. It is not a New England \nissue. This is, in fact, a national issue and that is why we have \ncosponsorship for this bill from all over the country.\n  I have talked in the past and will talk again, obviously, about what \nLIHEAP means for northern States such as my own, but let me say a few \nwords about what it means for southern States. Let me quote from the \ncity of Phoenix, AZ.\n  This is from Phoenix, and the person there is saying:\n\n       I am writing to express my support for the Warm in Winter \n     and Cool in Summer Act. Currently Arizona can only provide \n     assistance to 6 percent of eligible LIHEAP households. To \n     make matters worse, Phoenix continues to experience extreme \n     heat. In the past month alone we have had 15 days with \n     temperatures at or above 110 degrees. This extreme heat is \n     especially hard on the very young, the elderly and disabled \n     who are on fixed incomes and can no longer afford to cool \n     their homes.\n\n  Arizona Public Service reported that there was a 36 percent increase \nin the number of households having difficulty in paying utility bills \nand an increase of 11,000 families being disconnected compared to a \nyear ago. Rising energy and housing costs are placing enormous strains \non households across Arizona.\n  Now, imagine being ill or elderly, having your electricity \ndisconnected with temperatures day after day after day being 110 \ndegrees. That is a serious health problem. But the issue obviously is \nnot only in the South.\n  In my State there is a newspaper called the Stowe Reporter. This is \nwhat they say, very briefly, in an editorial:\n\n       It could be New England's own Katrina disaster. Hundreds of \n     homes rendered uninhabitable, families' finances stretched to \n     the limit, some driven away altogether to take\n\n[[Page S6819]]\n\n     shelter with friends or family. But unlike Katrina, this \n     calamity is clearly visible on the horizon and we have months \n     to prepare.\n       With home heating oil prices nearly twice what they were \n     one year ago, and no price relief in sight, thousands of \n     Vermonters will be struggling this winter to keep their homes \n     warm. The financial effect of an additional $500 to more than \n     $1,000 on the winter's oil bill will force many to choose \n     between heat and other necessities, such as food.\n\n  So what we are looking at in the northern tier of this country is our \nown Katrina, if you like: people being forced out of their homes, \npeople becoming ill, people leaving the northern part of this country \nbecause they cannot pay these outrageously high energy costs. This is, \nin fact, a life-and-death issue. Unlike hurricanes or tornadoes, you \nare not going to see CNN there. But as my friend from Maine, who is \njust walking in, understands, in her State and in my State, we are \nseeing people struggle in a life-and-death fashion. This is very \nimportant for people to know, because it does not get a lot of \npublicity, but according to the Centers for Disease Control, over 1,000 \nAmericans from across the country died from hypothermia in their own \nhomes from 1999 to 2002, and those are the latest figures we have \navailable.\n  In other words, they froze to death because they could not afford to \nheat their homes. How many of these deaths were preventable? Well, \naccording to the CDC, all of them were preventable. If people were \nliving in homes that were adequately heated, those folks would not have \ndied. It is important to understand that it is not only heating oil \nprices that are skyrocketing but electricity prices are also soaring.\n  Recently, USA Today ran a headline on its front page that said: \n``Price Jolt: Electricity Bills Going Up.'' According to this article, \nutilities across the United States are raising power prices up to 29 \npercent, mostly to pay for soaring fuel costs. In other words, the \nsituation that exists in the southern part of the country is that the \nelectricity is disconnected because you cannot afford the huge \nincreases in your electric bill, and if the temperatures are 110 \ndegrees in Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, you are in serious trouble.\n  Before I yield to my friend from Maine, I did want to mention some \ninformation in our southern and southwestern States. Due to a lack of \nLIHEAP funding, the State of Texas only provides air conditioning \nassistance to about 4 percent of those who qualify. Recently I received \na letter from Shawnee Bayer, from the Community Action Committee in \nVictoria, TX. In her letter, Shawnee Bayer told me that LIHEAP funding \nfor their elderly and disabled clients ran out on May 1 of this year. \nAs a result, they have had to turn away over 500 elderly and disabled \nfamilies seeking assistance with their air conditioning bills.\n  According to Ms. Bayer:\n\n       The temperatures in our area have been 100 to 110 degrees \n     for 16 consecutive days. I fear it is going to be very tragic \n     at the current pace we are going with so little funding \n     available. There are so many who need our assistance, like \n     the elderly lady in her 80s who recently almost died due to \n     kidney failure; now she doesn't want to use her air \n     conditioner because she is afraid she won't be able to pay \n     the bill and that we won't have funding to assist her when \n     she needs us.\n       She just called me last Thursday and has pneumonia; she \n     could hardly talk. Last year she was placed in the hospital \n     in ICU due to a heat stroke as a result of using only a fan, \n     not the air conditioner. I see children every day who have \n     not eaten because the parents, grandparents and in some cases \n     great grandparents are just trying to keep the electricity \n     on. The electric bills in our area have tripled.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the Senator \nfrom Vermont, my friend and colleague, in discussing the need for \nlegislation which we have introduced to increase funding for the low \nincome heating assistance program.\n  As my colleague from Vermont has described, our citizens in the \nNortheast are facing a crisis this winter. In the State of Maine, 80 \npercent of homes rely on home heating oil. The average home in Maine \nuses between 800 and 1,000 gallons of heating oil to get through the \nwinter season. My constituents are looking at paying as much as $5,000 \nthis winter to keep warm. And this is in a State that ranks 37th in per \ncapita income. This is a true crisis. It is clear that we need to do a \ngreat deal to solve the overall energy crisis facing this country.\n  We need to produce more, use less, and pursue alternatives. But we \nalso need to look for short-term help for our citizens. The legislation \nwe have cosponsored, S. 3186, would provide an additional $2.5 billion \nfor the low income heating assistance program, known as the LIHEAP \nprogram.\n  Most of our colleagues are pretty familiar with this program. But let \nme remind them that it is a Federal grant program that provides vital \nfunding to help very low-income citizens meet their home energy needs. \nThe level of funding our legislation would provide would bring the \nprogram up to the fully authorized amount of $5.1 billion. That is the \nleast we can do. Due to record high oil costs, the situation for our \nmost vulnerable citizens, particularly the low income and elderly, is \nespecially dire.\n  In my State of Maine, people face a crisis as they look ahead and try \nto figure out how they are going to stay warm this winter.\n  Nationwide, over the last few years, the numbers of households \nreceiving assistance under the LIHEAP program increased by 26 percent, \nfrom 4.6 million to 5.8 million. But during that same period, Federal \nfunding increased by only 10 percent. The result is that the average \ngrant declined from $349 to $305 at a time of record high prices.\n  The large rapid increase in energy prices, combined with lower levels \nof funding available per family, has imposed a tremendous hardship on \nthose who can afford it least. Our bill would provide an additional \n$2.5 billion as emergency funding, and the term ``emergency'' could not \nbe more accurate, because that is exactly what we face.\n  Our Nation is in an energy emergency. Families are already being \nforced to choose between paying for food and paying for heat for this \ncoming winter. One woman in Maine told me she has to turn over half of \nher Social Security check to meet the budget plan she is on for meeting \nher obligations to the oil dealer to stay warm--half of her Social \nSecurity check.\n  She literally is deciding if she can afford to fill the prescription \nshe needs, can she buy the healthy food she needs. I am worried that we \nare going to see seniors this winter suffering from hypothermia. I am \nworried we are going to see deaths from carbon monoxide from bringing \nin unsafe grills trying to stay warm. I am worried we are going to see \nhousehold fires as people try to stay warm.\n  I tell my colleagues, we must act and we must act now. If we can \nincrease the funding and help people purchase the fuel they need now, \nit will make a real difference. As the Senator from Vermont has said, \nand he is not exaggerating, this is a matter of life and death. That is \nnot an exaggeration. We must act.\n\n  I also want to mention another program that cries out for more \nfunding, and that is the Weatherization Program. We are going to \nproceed separately on the weatherization front, but we must not forget \nthat if we can help people weatherize their homes, we can help them, on \naverage, reduce their fuel consumption by 31 percent. It is one of the \nfew things we can do right now that would make a difference this \nwinter. I wish to see us double funding for weatherization. The payback \nis enormous. It would make a real difference. Before the current price \nspike, the Department of Energy estimated that weatherization saved the \naverage household $358 per year.\n  This winter, with the cost of fuel doubled what it was last winter, \nthe savings will be that much higher as well. So let's do both. Let's \ngive speedy approval to the legislation we have introduced to increase \nthe funding for the LIHEAP program so it reaches $5.1 billion. And then \nlet us, through the emergency supplemental bill that I hope will be \ncoming to the floor, do a substantial increase in the Weatherization \nProgram as well. It was so shortsighted of President Bush to propose \nthe termination of the Weatherization Program. That makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  The Energy Department's spending bill before the Appropriations \nCommittee restores some of the money, but it is still below the level \nthat was spent\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\non weatherization last winter. We should be greatly increasing funding \nfor weatherization as well. I have been working with the Senators from \nMinnesota, both Senator Klobuchar and Senator Coleman, to lead a \nbipartisan effort. My friend from Vermont and the Presiding Officer \nhave also signed onto that, calling upon the appropriators to increase \nweatherization funding as well.\n  If we could provide an additional $40 million to the Weatherization \nProgram, it would help another 15,000 households who are in need of \nweatherization.\n  Let me end my comments by saying it is imperative we act both on the \nlegislation to increase funding for the LIHEAP program and then proceed \nto also increase funding for weatherization as well. It is the least we \ncan do to help some of the most vulnerable citizens avoid a true crisis \nthis winter.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST \n   HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008--\n                               Continued\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will now continue \nconsideration of S. 2731, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2731) to authorize appropriation for fiscal \n     years 2009 through 2013 to provide assistance to foreign \n     countries to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nlegislation before the Senate today. This legislation is really of \nhistoric scope and importance, dealing with the global crisis of HIV/\nAIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.\n  There has been a lot said about this legislation. It is certainly not \na perfect piece of legislation, and rarely do we see something that \nfits that description, but when we talk about infections and the impact \nof HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria around the world, it is hard to \nexaggerate the devastating impact these diseases have had. It is also \nhard to fully appreciate the positive impact the U.S. leadership in \nthis area has had as well.\n  Around the world, there are over 30 million people infected with HIV/\nAIDS. I think perhaps even more striking is that you have 2.6 million \ndeaths attributed to tuberculosis and malaria a year. These are deaths \nthat are preventable. That is why the funding in this legislation is so \nimportant, because we know it will not just deal with the spread of \nHIV/AIDS and new infections around the world, but will also help \nprevent deaths today, tomorrow, the year after, and the year after.\n  We have the ability to prevent these illnesses, to treat them as \nnever before, and to save lives. That is why this funding is so badly \nneeded and will be so beneficial. I think this is the greatest \nhumanitarian crisis I have seen, certainly in my lifetime, the spread \nof these diseases around the world and in particular in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n  Many people have observed that this legislation includes a dramatic \nincrease in funding, and it certainly does include a significant \nincrease in funding, but it is essential that we allocate these funds \nto PEPFAR, the President's initiative, and to the global fight because \nwe have seen the dramatic impact and success of the funds we have \nalready allocated and appropriated.\n  Today, we can look back over the last 5 years and appreciate that 1.7 \nmillion people around the world now have the ARVs to treat HIV/AIDS \nthat didn't have them before, 55 million people around the world have \nbeen reached with prevention efforts dealing with HIV/AIDS, and 25 \nmillion malaria deaths have been prevented. That is a dramatic success, \nand that is something all of those countries that have participated in \nthis fight should be very proud of.\n  Under this legislation, the funding and initiative and the effort \nwill continue, with $4 billion to deal with tuberculosis, $5 billion to \ndeal with malaria, and $2 billion in funding for the Global Fund. These \nare significant sums of money. Many of my colleagues have observed that \nwith such a significant allocation, oversight and accountability are \nessential. I could not agree more.\n  We need to ensure, through every avenue possible within the U.S. \nGovernment, the Global Fund, and within other relief organizations, \nthat every effort is made to ensure appropriate use of the funds, to \nensure the use of efficient allocation, and, of course, to ensure \naccountability.\n  We are measuring success, measuring performance better today than we \nhave ever done before. We need to continue to improve that effort. We \nneed to make sure we understand how much it costs to reach an \nindividual or a family with ARVs, how much it costs to get treatment \nfor malaria into the hands of those who can most benefit, how we can \nreduce those costs, and so on.\n  The fact that we have not always been able to account for these funds \nas effectively as we would like is not a reason not to pursue such an \nimportant initiative. We have better benchmarks than ever before in \nthis legislation, better standards for accountability and oversight \nthan ever before. The cost of delay isn't measured in days or weeks; \nthe cost of a delay of this legislation is measured in lives. That is \nwhy it is so important that we act on the legislation this week, before \nwe break for August, and that we have it signed into law this year.\n  Only the United States can provide this kind of leadership in terms \nof public awareness and in financing. It is the U.S. leadership that \nhas been the driving force behind the successes I mentioned earlier--\nthe numbers reached with ARVs, the numbers reached with prevention \nefforts, the number of lives saved, and the number of malaria deaths \nprevented.\n  There are many reasons to undertake a piece of legislation of this \nscope and importance. We can begin with the humanitarian aspect. There \nis no greater crisis anywhere in the world than the humanitarian crisis \ncreated by the spread of HIV/AIDS and the millions who die every year \nfrom malaria, tuberculosis, and the millions of deaths that are \npreventable. There are the public health aspects that, in the long run, \nbenefit not just those countries that benefit from PEPFAR, but in \ncountries around the world, in the United States and our allies, where \nimprovements in public health, reductions in the number of infections \nand, in the end, programs lead to healthier and longer lives and a \nbetter quality of life.\n  There are the economic impacts and benefits. It is hard to imagine a \ndisease that has had a greater economic impact in the last 20 or 30 \nyears than HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa. The economic costs are \nborne not just by the individuals in those countries where the \ninfection rates are high, but, again, they are borne by neighboring \ncountries, by their trading partners, and they are borne by the \neconomies of the Western World that are called on to provide the \nhumanitarian relief, which could be avoided if we do a better job with \nprevention and treatment. So there is a humanitarian cost, a public \nhealth cost, and there is an economic cost.\n\n  Finally, there is also a national security benefit to dealing more \neffectively with infections of HIV/AIDS and the cost of these diseases. \nIf a public health crisis such as this is allowed to go unchecked and \nthe economic effects are devastating, and we see weakness and \ncollapsing economies around the world, in particular in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica, and the subsequent collapse of civil society brings important \ngovernment institutions to a halt or renders those institutions \ndysfunctional, then the United States and our allies will have to deal \nwith the crisis of a failed state.\n\n[[Page S6821]]\n\n  We have seen the way in which public health crises around the world \nhave contributed to chaos and failure of government institutions and, \nultimately, to the potential to lead to a more fertile ground for \noppression, terrorism, and a collapse in the rule of law. All of those \nfailures have national security implications not just for the United \nStates, but for our allies around the world.\n  This is an important piece of legislation for what it does, for those \naround the world who are affected by HIV/AIDS, but also for what it \ndoes in setting us and our allies on the right path to deal with a \nhumanitarian and public health crisis around the world.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the legislation, even though in \nthe eyes of some it may not be perfect, because it is certainly \nsomething that is necessary, needed, valued, and it is an area of \ninvestment that has already had a dramatic and positive impact in the \nlives of millions around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Low-Income Heating Assistance\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to speak \nfor a few minutes on a piece of legislation which is not pending but \nwhich I know is scheduled to be debated in the coming days in the \nSenate, and that measure deals with the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program or LIHEAP.\n  Senator Sanders of Vermont has introduced the Warm in Winter and Cool \nin Summer Act to address a potential crisis as we enter the fall and \nwinter heating months. Heating assistance for those in economic need--\nnot just in New England but across the country--will become a pressing \nissue.\n  I think this is important legislation, and I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of Senator Sanders' initiative to provide emergency funding \nnow so that Congress does not have to deal with it in a crisis mode as \nthe winter months approach.\n  With heating oil over $4 a gallon, this is an issue that Congress \nneeds to address early and aggressively. It is imperative that those \nseniors and families who depend on low-income heating assistance in New \nHampshire and across the country feel confident that the resources will \nbe there when they need them.\n  It is also important that Congress address this issue early so States \ncan work with those agencies that administer the heating assistance \nprogram. In New Hampshire, the community action programs have done an \noutstanding job ensuring that appropriate funding is available at \ndifferent eligibility levels and that this assistance gets to where it \nis needed as efficiently and effectively as is possible. As we approach \nthis debate, I encourage my colleagues, to give this legislation \ncareful consideration and support because it will make a difference in \nthe lives of millions of people across the country. This bipartisan \nlegislation is also something that we have the ability to pass right \nnow.\n  In addition, the Senate needs to take up legislation that deals with \nour nation's energy situation, and I firmly believe that means being \nproactive on conservation, alternative and renewable clean energy \ndevelopment, and new energy exploration here at home. Congress must \nstop ruling things out. We have to stop saying: We can't do this, we \ncan't do that. Both sides of the aisle must find ways to work together \nor we will never reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  As we debate additional low-income heating assistance funding, we \nneed to look at conservation, alternative and renewable energy, and \nmore energy production at home--there is no magic bullet; all of these \navenues must be pursued to address the issue in the medium and long \nterm. But for many families, whether heating oil is at $4 a gallon or \n$3 a gallon, the impact of the cost is dramatic. That is why we also \nneed to have in place a strong Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram that will make a difference to those families in need.\n  I look forward to supporting the legislation of my colleague from \nVermont and, again, encourage all my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                               Oil Crisis\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republicans have been talking now for \nseveral weeks about needing to do something about oil. But you see, we \non this side of the aisle have been talking about doing something about \nit for a long time--a long time. That is why we brought the global \nwarming bill to the floor. That is why we pushed very hard to have the \nrenewable energy tax credits put in place so the American entrepreneur \ncan invest in solar, wind, and geothermal, creating hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. We have been stopped doing anything about global \nwarming, we have been stopped doing anything, of course, about \nrenewable energy, which would take tremendous pressure off the oil \nmarkets.\n  We have worked on doing other things. We introduced legislation \ndealing specifically with gas prices, and we were turned back from \ndoing that. We could not get 60 votes.\n  The causes of high gas prices we all know are complicated: We have \nstability problems in Iraq and in Iran, the Middle East; we have \nproblems in Nigeria now, which is the fifth largest producer of oil in \nthe world; the weak dollar is creating more problems; some say the \nglobal demand is outpacing supply with India and China coming online to \nbuy a lot of this oil; and the failure of the oil companies to use \ntheir record profits to invest in new refining capacity and research \nalternatives.\n  Speculation in oil, is that the problem? Of course not. But it is a \nproblem. It is a big problem, and I think there is a lot of agreement \nto that effect. Economists agree that probably up to 30 percent or more \nof the price we pay at the pump is due to speculation.\n  I had a conversation this morning with the head of United Airlines. \nThis man comes with a pretty good resume. I did not meet him until a \nfew months ago when he and a number of people from the airline \nindustry--all the bosses--came to see me lamenting the fact that these \ncompanies were in desperate need of help. They explained to me there \nwere airplanes that were filled to capacity every trip they took in \nAmerica, but they were going to cancel those flights. Why? Because the \nairplanes they are using use a lot of gas. The flights they took used a \nlot of kerosene, is basically what they burn. Therefore, they were \ngoing to terminate the flights and use airplanes that did not use as \nmuch gas because they lose less money. They lose basically money on \nevery flight they take and that we take as consumers.\n  I met him then the first time. I have had other conversations with \nhim. He is one of the experts we had in a meeting last Thursday to talk \nabout speculation. Today I talked with him because we introduced \nlegislation to deal with speculation to get the energy debate started.\n  The Republicans, in the bill they have introduced, have a provision \nabout speculation. So they should join with us in allowing us to get \nthis bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Tilton said to me today he appreciated our working to get this \nbill done. We have taken parts from Democratic bills and Republican \nbills to be at a place where we are now. Mr. Tilton said this is \nextremely important for the industry, to recognize that we in Congress \nare trying to do something to tamp down speculation.\n  President Bush said yesterday there is no immediate fix, that it took \na while to get to this problem; there is no short-term solution. That \nis true. When President Bush took office, a gallon of gasoline cost \n$1.46. Today the average price is $4.11 or $4.12 a gallon. When \nPresident Bush took office, a barrel of oil cost $32. Today, with the\n\n[[Page S6822]]\n\nvolatility involved, it has been up near $150 and has dropped down to \n$140, but it is very high, certainly more than $32 a barrel.\n  The President is correct that his administration's energy policy has \ncreated a crisis that the American people will suffer long past his \nPresidency. It is true we need long-term solutions, including a serious \ncommitment to providing tax cuts, as I already talked about, to \ncompanies and innovators who are investing in clean alternative fuels \nthat could take us off our addiction to oil--and that is what it is. \nPresident Bush identified that in one of his first State of the Union \nMessages, but he has not done anything about that.\n  The American people deserve solutions that will ease the pain at the \npump and also make the future look better for them. One of those \nsolutions is this bill that has been introduced, the Energy Speculation \nAct of 2008. We have done that together. We reach out and ask the \nRepublicans to join with us in a bipartisan effort to tamp down \nspeculation. Right now Wall Street traders are raising gas prices with \nnothing more than a click of a mouse.\n  In the nearly 8 years of this Bush-Cheney administration, the most \noil-friendly administration in the history of the country--both made \ntheir fortunes in oil--they have turned a blind eye to this excessive \nspeculation. Our legislation will finally hold the energy futures \nmarket to the same standards of accountability that other futures \nmarkets are held.\n  Sadly, for American consumers, the Federal watchdog that is working \nto do this has been understaffed over the last many years. Part of our \nlegislation gives them more staff, to give them more power to do \nthings. They were tremendously underfunded as a result of the work of \nPhil Gramm, one of John McCain's chief economic advisers. The 2000 \nCommodities Futures Modernization Act, which, in effect, allowed \ntraders to buy and sell oil without actually taking physical delivery \nof it.\n  We are not saying in our legislation they have to take physical \ndelivery of it. But we know where the problem started. The so-called \nmouse-click energy market was born as a result of John McCain's chief \neconomic adviser, who, by the way, thinks people who are complaining \nabout high gas prices and the housing crisis are a bunch of whiners. \nThose are his words.\n  We talked with one of the most fair, seasoned legislators in \nCongress, Carl Levin, a Senator from Michigan, to get more information \non large traders of energy quantities in over-the-counter markets. That \nis in our legislation--something he came up with.\n\n  So we feel we are headed in the right direction. We have gotten help \nfrom the CFTC, the man who runs that, we have gotten help from the \nchairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Bingaman, and we are doing \nour best to address an issue we feel is very important to the American \npeople.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be glad to yield to my colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say, through the Chair, that in a recent hearing of my \nAppropriations subcommittee, I asked the Acting Chairman of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, responsible for regulating these \nenergy futures markets: What is the size of the market? There is one \nexchange known as NYMEX, which is regulated by his commission, there is \nanother known as ISE, based in London, which is coming under \nregulation, but there is a whole world of trading out there involving \nfutures trading with swaps, over the counter and the like, and he \nsaid--this Acting Chairman said--I don't know. I don't know the size of \nthe market.\n  So when Americans express their concerns about speculation and its \nimpact on oil and ask whether our Government is doing its job to make \nsure there is no manipulation of the future price of oil, that there is \nnot excessive speculation, the honest answer from Mr. Lukkin and I \nbelieve it was honest--is he doesn't know.\n  This legislation which we are presenting is going to call for more \ndisclosure and more oversight and more reporting of these markets so we \nwill have information and be able to look closely at these trades. I \nask the Senator from Nevada, as part of this legislation, is it not a \nfact that we are going to dramatically increase the number of people \nworking at this commission--100 new full-time employees--and new \ncomputer capabilities so they can keep up with the dramatic increase in \ntrading which is taking place, and will have people to deal with the \nnew information that is collected?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, if you had to put a mark on this \nlegislation--what does it do more than anything else--I would say \ntransparency. It will allow the entity we depend on to allow us to know \nwhat is going on with trading of futures, to have more manpower in \norder to get more information for the American people.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois it is important that we have \ntransparency. That is what we are talking about. That is why I \nmentioned Senator Gramm and what he did. He took away transparency so \nthat the American people will have some idea of what is going on.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for one more question--because \nI see some of my other colleagues on the floor, including Senator \nDorgan, who has done some extraordinarily good work on this issue--I \nask the Senator from Nevada: A month ago, when I visited the Air \nTransport Association here in Washington and met with the CEOs of all \nthe major airlines in America--I say half jokingly that it is a good \nthing you couldn't open the windows on that high floor of that building \nbecause some might have been tempted to jump out, they were so \ndespondent about what is happening to their businesses as airlines--and \nI know the Senator from Nevada has seen flights canceled to his home \nState, I have seen flights canceled in and out of Chicago, American \ntoday announced the layoff of 200 more pilots, more planes being \ngrounded--when this bill has a limitation on the positions, which is \nthe amount that can be traded, does this bill not also protect the \nright of companies, such as airlines, that want to legitimately hedge \nso they can be protected from future oil increases, so those legitimate \ncommercial interests can trade on the markets and use this speculation \nin a positive way to protect them from the uncertainty of oil prices in \nthe future?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend that the direct answer to the point is \nyes. But talking about 200 pilot layoffs, the last time I flew to Las \nVegas was right before the July 4 break. I got on the plane and the \npilot said to me, the captain: Senator, good to have you on our plane. \nHe said: You know, there are 950 of us going to be laid off--950 pilots \nwere given notice less than a month ago. Now we have 200 more.\n  The Senator said in a side remark that these people likely felt like \njumping out of that window of that high-rise. My comment to that is, \nthat is fairly valid. They are desperate. These are companies which are \nthe largest companies in America--United Airlines, Delta, Northwest. \nThese companies have been around for a long time and have employed \nhundreds of thousands of people.\n  The State of Nevada has two population centers. It is a huge State \nareawise, some 700 miles tall and some 400 miles wide at its widest \npart. But the population, 90 percent of the people, live in Reno and \nLas Vegas. If you want to go to Elko or Ely, you have to drive. It used \nto be that from Salt Lake to Elko you had a flight every hour. Now \nthere is one a day. There used to be a number of flights from Reno to \nElko. None.\n  Rural America is going to be in deep trouble. We have become an \nairplane society. We go places in airplanes. That is going to come to a \nscreeching halt unless something is done quickly, because these \nairlines are cutting the flights as we speak. I repeat, every hour \nthere was a flight from Salt Lake to Elko. Now there is one a day.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, would the Senator from Nevada yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. Be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was noticing a story that just moved on the wire, and \nit says:\n       In a big win for the U.S. futures industry, new Senate \n     legislation unveiled on Wednesday would not impose higher \n     margins on oil traders but would still aim to rein in \n     excessive speculation in energy markets.\n\n  I want to make a comment about that, because it goes on to say:\n\n       Futures markets participants had feared that earlier \n     legislation introduced by Senator Byron Dorgan to boost \n     significantly the\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\n     amount of money, or margin, that speculators would have to \n     put up to trade oil futures would make it into the final \n     anti-speculation bill.\n\n  So they paint this as some sort of victory, but let me point out what \nthey missed. Yes, I am the one who authored a bill that said: Let's put \nin 25 percent margin requirements in order to wring out the speculation \nin this market. What they missed, however, is that last week we met in \na room over here for 3 hours into the evening, and I indicated then \nthat I don't need to have a 25-percent margin requirement if you have \nposition limits that are effective. The bill the majority leader has \nintroduced, which I am cosponsor of, and pleased to be a part of it, \ndoes the following: It distinguishes between legitimate hedge trading \nby commercial producers and purchasers of physical energy commodities \nfor future delivery and their direct counterparties, and all other \nspeculators. Then it establishes real position limits. That is what \nwrings the speculators out of the system.\n  Now, there are some who say: Well, speculation is not going on here. \nThere is no issue with speculation. A study done by the House \nSubcommittee on Oversight and Investigations found that in the year \n2000 about 37 percent of those who were in the oil futures market were \nspeculators. Today, it is 71 percent. This market is broken. It has \nbeen taken over by speculators. Will Rogers described them as people \nwho are buying things they will never get from people who never had it, \nmaking money on both sides of the trade, and grinning all the way to \nthe bank. The problem is they are damaging this economy, hurting \nAmerican families and destroying this country's airlines and farmers \nand truckers.\n  I wanted to make the point to the Senator from Nevada that when \nsomeone writes a story and says this is a big victory for the futures \nmarket because it doesn't have the 25-percent margin requirement, I was \nfine with dropping that piece if we had strong position limits that \napply against those who aren't engaged in legitimate hedging but, \ninstead, are engaged in pure, raw, unadulterated speculation.\n  If I might make one other point. This market was set up in 1936 by \nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt. When he signed the bill, he warned \nabout speculation. He warned about speculators taking over a market. \nThe fact is, the bill that created this market has a provision that \ndeals with excess speculation. Our problem is that under this \nadministration, there is no such thing as regulation. So the \nregulators, who are supposed to be wearing the striped shirts and \nblowing the whistles and calling the fouls in these markets, have \ndecided they don't want to regulate. These folks have gone hog wild and \ndestroyed the market for oil futures and driven these prices up to \n$130, $140 a barrel, far beyond where supply and demand would justify \nit being.\n  That is why I wanted to make the point that the bill we introduced \nlast night--and I applaud the majority leader--is a bill that does \nexactly what we had intended it to do following our meeting last week. \nYes, we dropped the new margin requirement, but that is not a failure. \nWe dropped that because we put in very strong position limits to wring \nthe speculation out of these markets. Isn't that the case, I ask the \nSenator?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. And let me say to my friend, going back to the \nPresident of the United Airlines today--and again let me remind \neveryone of his background: president of Texaco, vice chairman of \nChevron, and now the chief executive officer of United Airlines. He \nsaid not only are businesses, including the airline industry--using his \nwords--``patting us on the back,'' but in addition to that, all the \nbanks that have loaned money to these airline companies, all the other \nentities around our country that are looking at these businesses, such \nas the airline industry, to succeed, this has a wide-ranging impact on \nour success as a country. We have to do something about this.\n  Now, people can criticize this legislation all they want. It is not \nperfect legislation, but it is very good legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might make an additional point, Mr. President, by \nasking the Senator from Nevada a question. The issue of position limits \nis critical. That is why this bill has teeth and bite and could \nactually accomplish something. We will have some other people here in \nthis Chamber who will come to the floor believing in their policy, \nwhich is yesterday forever--drill, drill, drill, drill. Every 20 years, \nwe have another debate about who wants to drill where. But the fact is, \nthat is not a game-changing approach to address energy in a significant \nway.\n  We want to do this in 2 steps: No. 1, wring the speculation out of \nthis market and bring down prices, and some say by as much as 40 \npercent; and No. 2, we see a very different kind of energy future. Yes, \nwe increase production, but we must have conservation, efficiency, \nrenewables, and other things.\n  So for those who come to the floor and say, well, taking on \nspeculation is too easy, well, it is easy when it is right in front of \nyou. There are some people refusing to recognize it when it is right in \nfront of them.\n  I want to show this chart to my colleague from Nevada. This chart \nshows what has happened to the price of oil, and every driver in this \ncountry knows that is what has happened to the price of gasoline as \nwell. This red line is the price, and it goes up like a Roman candle: \nup, up, up, up.\n\n  Here is what our Energy Information Administration said. We spend \n$100 million a year on this agency down at the Department of Energy \nthat has all the people who estimate what is going to happen to the \nprice of oil. Let me show you their estimates. Back in May of last \nyear, here is what the price of oil is going to be--straight across. \nKind of a bump here and there. In July, here is the price. January of \nthis year, here is where we think the price of oil will be.\n  So how is it they could miss it by so far? Because at each of these \njunctures they took a look at supply and demand and estimated what the \nprice would be. They missed it by a country mile. You would have to be \nblind to miss it by this far, right?\n  Why did they miss it? Because this is all about speculation. It has \nnothing to do with supply and demand--not a thing. And if we say \nspeculation is fine, let's let it damage our country, let's do nothing \nabout it, I think we would be fools. The American people understand you \nhave to take these two steps: No. 1, wring the speculation out of this \nsystem and put downward pressure on prices; and then, No. 2, do a new \nconstruct with a game-changing plan on energy for the future.\n  But I ask the Senator from Nevada: Is it not the case that the agency \nwe rely on for estimates has not just been wrong by a foot but wrong by \na mile in every case because they could not measure what this excess \nspeculation was going to do to this country?\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend be good enough to put up the previous chart \nthat is under that one?\n  Common sense enters into Government as it does in everything. Common \nsense dictates, when looking at this information we have before us, \nthat we should do something about speculation. Now, this is not \ninformation that was dreamed up by some high school student. These were \nhearings that brought this out, congressional hearings that looked at \nwhat took place in 2000 and what took place in 2008. Look at this \ndifference. Look at the difference--a more than 100-percent increase or \nclose to a 100-percent increase as to what has taken place.\n  If somebody could sue us because we didn't do anything, they should \nsue us for negligence that we, looking at this chart, would do nothing \nas it relates to speculation.\n  Now, I say to my friend, is speculation the only thing we need to do? \nOf course not. There is a lot more we can do. Do we believe in \nincreasing domestic production? Of course we do. We want to work and \nincrease domestic production, and there are lots of ways we can do \nthat. But it speaks volumes. My friends on the other side of the aisle \nkeep talking about: let's go drill someplace else. The 68 million \nacres? We will just hang on to that, and that will be part of our \nbalance sheet. We have 68 million acres, and we want other places to \ngo.\n\n  I say to my friend, and everyone within the sound of my voice: We \nlistened to the oil companies less than 2 years ago. They said they \nwanted to drill in the best place they could find in America, in the \nGulf of Mexico, the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. We \nagreed with them. We said: OK, 8.3 million acres--because this is what \nthey wanted. We gave it to them.\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\n  Everyone should know what they have done in 2 years: Nothing. \nNothing. In the area they said was the most ripe for discovering new \noil, they have not driven a boat to fish off the side of there. They \nhave done nothing.\n  Now they are coming to us, these oil companies that have during the \npast year made $250 billion. Have they built new refineries as we gave \nthem tax incentives to do? Of course not. It appears, some say, they \ndon't want the quantity to go up any more so they keep these prices \nhigh.\n  But separate and apart from that, we know the last 8.3 million acres \nwe gave them they have not so much as gone swimming there, as far as we \nknow.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one additional question, I \nwould make the observation that we come to the floor of the Senate \nwanting to do something. I understand there are 100 ideas, some of them \nlong term, some would have an impact in 10 years, some in the sweet by-\nand-by. But this proposition is about the here and now. What do we do \nabout the here and now with respect to speculation?\n  There is a radio announcer who was talking once about interviewing an \nold man--age 85 years old. The radio announcer said: I bet you have \nseen a lot of changes in your life.\n  And the old guy said: Yes, and I have been against every one them.\n  We know some people like that, and they serve in this Chamber. They \nare against anything.\n  My question is, wouldn't it make sense for us at least to put this in \nthe bank of progress; that is, to shut down the speculation, put \ndownward pressure on oil and gas prices? If some experts are right--Mr. \nGates, for example, a top energy analyst for Oppenheimer & Co. for 30 \nyears, says as much as 40 percent or more of the increase in the price \nof oil and gas is because of excess speculation. He said to us it is \nlike a casino open 24/7 today, like a highway with no speed limit and \nno cops.\n  Let's assume he is right. Other experts have said the same thing. \nWouldn't it make sense for all of us at least to agree to take this \nstep and then take the other steps? Let's try to find a way to come \ntogether rather than to have all the folks who come to this Chamber \nsay: No, not now, not this. Every single day we hear that.\n  My hope will be that we will get bipartisan support because it is the \nright thing to do and it is the right time to do it.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the business community is crying for \nhelp. They believe this is a big step in the right direction. Our \noffices are now receiving e-mails and phone calls from all the airline \ncompanies, banks that are concerned about them, and hundreds of other \nbusiness entities that believe this is the right thing to do.\n  Are these organizations usually those that support Democrats? I am \nsomewhat constrained to say no. They usually are all Republican-\noriented businesses. But they know we are doing the right thing. I \nplead that my Republican friends will join us in helping the American \nbusiness community. If there are other things that need to be done at a \nsubsequent time, we will try to work with our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. But this is part of their legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. When they introduced their bill, they said speculation was \nimportant, so let's focus on speculation.\n  I want to say one other thing, Mr. President. My friend from North \nDakota has been a real activist on this issue and trade issues and \nothers that are important to the American economy. I appreciate his \nwillingness to compromise. This legislation is not everything he wants. \nIf he were King Dorgan, he would have written something else. But we \nare now in the legislative process, and the Senator from North Dakota \nand I have been in it for a long time. Legislation is the art of \ncompromise, and that is what we have.\n  I hope my friends will realize our good faith. I am trying to do \nsomething we believe will have tremendous impact on stabilizing oil \nprices in our country.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might make just one final very brief comment. There \nare people in this Chamber, in the Republican caucus and the Democratic \ncaucus, who have all spoken of speculation. My hope is that we can come \ntogether, work together, and do something in the next week or two, \nRepublicans and Democrats, on this issue. I think we have put together \na good bill.\n  I would say to the Senator from Nevada, one of the things he talked \nabout in the middle of last week was making this a bipartisan \ninitiative in the Chamber of the Senate. I very much hope that can be \nthe case in the coming days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As the majority leader knows, I travel home a long \ndistance every week to Washington State and get in my car and drive for \nseveral hours to get to my home. I have been paying these increased gas \nprices like my constituents. It is shocking. Last weekend I paid $4.45 \na gallon to fill up my tank in my car. This is impacting absolutely \neverybody in my State, my region, just as it is the rest of the Nation.\n\n  My constituents say to me: I have been hearing all this talk about \ndrilling. Please tell me that will bring my gas prices down.\n  I have told my constituents, as we all know--in fact, not just me but \nthe Bush administration's Energy Information Office, this is the Bush \nadministration: The impact on wellhead prices from opening the Pacific, \nthe Atlantic, and the gulf waters to drilling ``is expected to be \ninsignificant.'' I have not said that. This administration, the Bush \nadministration's Energy Information Administration Office, has said \nthat.\n  I say to my constituents, the drill, drill, drill or, as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota called it, ``the forever yesterday policy of drill, \ndrill, drill,'' is not going to have a significant impact at all on \ntheir gas prices.\n  I thank the majority leader for coming forward with a package that we \ndo believe will have an impact on gas prices and deal with the \nexcessive speculation that is in the market today.\n  We met last week with a number of experts in this field. We have \nlistened to our Republican counterparts as well who agree that \nspeculation is an issue that we can all come together on and on which \nwe can have an immediate impact in passing a bill.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to thank the majority leader and to \nask him, as he puts this bill together, to deal with excessive \nspeculation with the hope that it will, as the experts have told us, \nbegin to reduce gas prices, that we as a caucus, and I hope as a \nSenate, will begin to look also at the longer term issues affecting \nenergy and investing in alternative energy so we do not continue to be \nso dependent on oil.\n  I ask the majority leader his comments on that.\n  Mr. REID. I say through the Chair to my friend from Washington, I \nhave been to Washington. I have driven a lot of the State of \nWashington. It is absolutely a beautiful State. Part of it reminds me \nof Nevada. People think that Washington is a State where the ocean is \neveryplace, and it is not. Washington is a State where there is desert. \nSo I love the State of Washington.\n  But the Senator from Washington is in a very good position to \nunderstand how I am sure her constituents feel about what we are trying \nto do; that is, do something to affect this increase in price, to try \nto tamp down speculation. To have the people of Washington be told this \ndoesn't matter, speculation doesn't matter, let's drill some more off \nthe coast of Washington and not only drill some more, in effect--no one \nquestions the Federal Government owns 200 miles off our coast. That is \nthe Outer Continental Shelf, and that is recognized by international \nlaw.\n  To think that the Federal Government would just give up on that and \nsay: OK, States, do whatever you want--how do the people of Washington \nfeel about that?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I say to the majority leader that the people of my State \nare a very generous people. If there were a real national crisis that \nwe could solve from my home State by drilling off our coast, my \nconstituents would be willing to sacrifice that. But we know that \ndrilling off the Outer Continental Shelf will have a huge economic \nimpact in my State with no result of reducing gas prices. So that is a \nsacrifice they\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\nshould not be asked to give at this time.\n  As a matter of fact, what I see happening is that the oil companies \nin this country that hold 68 million acres of land they can drill \ntoday, that they are not drilling, are just looking at this crisis we \nhave today as a land grab, that they can reach out, scare all of us, \nand have this Congress give them more land, including the pristine \nshores off my State of Washington, never intending to use them.\n  I was on the Senate floor with Senator Biden yesterday as we \ndiscussed this issue. He made a very cogent argument. The fact that if \nwe all decided this was it, this was it and we absolutely had to drill \neverything, and we gave the oil companies the Outer Continental Shelf \noff the coast of Washington and Oregon and California and his State of \nDelaware, that a minimal amount of oil in 20 or 30 years may be \ndrilled, but who among us thinks that OPEC--which actually controls the \nprice of gas--if a 3-percent increase in oil came about as an effect of \nthat drilling, wouldn't reduce their capacity by 3 percent in order to \nkeep their prices high and their profits at maximum level?\n  Let's not sell the American people a bill of goods. Let's not promise \nthem something that cannot be delivered. No one wants to hear empty \nrhetoric or to give up something that is extremely important to them if \nthe facts are not there to back it and only, by the way, to give oil \ncompanies more excessive profits.\n  Let's do something that is real--and that is what the bill the \nmajority leader and others have introduced does--to deal with the issue \nof excessive speculation; to do what many experts have told us to bring \nthe price of gas down. Then, for the long term, we, as a body, have to \nsay: What are we going to invest in in this country for the long-term \nfuture so we are not so dependent on oil, so that the next generation \nbehind us doesn't come back and hear yesterday forever, drill, drill, \ndrill, as Senator Dorgan has said time and time again is the solution \nthat doesn't work.\n  We need to get off our dependence on oil. We need to do that in the \nlong run. But in the short term let's deal with the speculation issue \nand let's pass responsible legislation in a bipartisan way, not as a \nsilver bullet. No one thinks that is the ultimate answer to bring gas \nprices to what they were a year ago, but it is a step in the right \ndirection. It is a responsible step to meet the important crisis that \nwe face today, coupled with looking at what we will do long term.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has been a leader on this issue. I know \nhe is the chair on the Energy appropriations bill, where he is looking \nat the investments we can make in alternative energy so we can get off \nof the same argument of yesterday forever and really begin to be \nresponsible leaders at a critical time in our Nation's history.\n  It is so easy to come out here and say drill on the Outer Continental \nShelf. But I will tell you, in a State such as mine, Washington State, \nthat has an economy that is dependent upon our waters, whether it is \nour fisheries or our environment or tourism but a place that our Nation \nshould say is absolutely one of critical importance--not just my coast \nbut the rest of the coastal States--we should not jeopardize it to get \nnothing--to get nothing because, as the Bush administration itself \nsaid: The impact on wellhead prices from opening the Pacific, the \nAtlantic, and the gulf waters to drilling ``is expected to be \ninsignificant.''\n  Let's focus on doing something that is responsible, that is not just \nempty rhetoric, that obviously is not a silver bullet to the energy \ncrisis in total but is sincerely a step in the right direction.\n  I am proud to join my colleague as we move this legislation forward. \nI look forward to working, I hope, with Members on both sides of the \naisle to move forward on this critical piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me make a couple of points. No. 1, \nthis legislation is real. I know people who look at the Congress and \nlook at Washington, DC, and its Government and say, they have not done \none thing to address this issue or that issue. This is one thing, and I \nthink a significant thing, that could address the issue of the prices \nof oil and gas that have doubled in a year, with no justification for \nthat doubling relating to supply and demand. This is one thing.\n  My hope is, in a Chamber that disagrees so often--my hope is that on \nthis issue of national importance we could agree on this one thing.\n  I was sitting here thinking about when I was growing up. We raised \nsome livestock and lived in a very small town. My father also had a gas \nstation that he managed. So as a young man, I worked at that gas \nstation. I pumped a lot of gas. People have told me my occupation may \nnot have changed very much.\n  But the fact is, back in those days when gasoline was priced at a \nvery low price and plentiful, the supplies of energy were plentiful, \npeople did not think much about where is the energy going to come from.\n  Near my little hometown, they decided to drill an oil well. I had \nnever seen an oil well. I remember as a little boy going out about 1 \nmile from town, looking at the oil well. There was not much to do in \nthat small town. So you drive out and look at the lights on that \ndrilling rig and stare. How exciting it was. And then it turned out to \nbe a dry hole.\n  Well, 2 weeks ago, I was in western North Dakota where they are \ndrilling in what is called the Bakken shale. When my colleagues talk \nabout drilling, let me remind them that I asked for an assessment of \nwhat is called the Bakken shale formation. The U.S. Geological Survey \ncompleted it 2 months ago. It turns out they estimate there is 3.6 to \n4.3 billion barrels of oil recoverable in the Bakken shale formation in \neastern Montana and western North Dakota. The 3.6 to 4.3 billion is \njust in the North Dakota portion. The fact is, we have nearly 80 drill \nrigs right now drilling in that area, producing a great amount of \nadditional oil. So I support that, my colleagues support that. We do \nsupport additional production. That additional production is ongoing \nand happening right now. It will be good for this country.\n  But the fact is, we are in a situation where we have an urgent need \nto deal with something that is happening in this country that is \ndamaging our economy. The price of oil has doubled in the past year, \nand there is no justification in the marketplace for it related to the \nsupply or demand--in fact, demand is going down in this country. We \ndrove 5 or 6 billion fewer miles in the 6-month period than a \ncomparable period before.\n  Today, we saw another monthly description of inventory going up. So \nthe fact is, there is no justification for prices to have doubled. Now, \nto do nothing about this issue of speculation, which has run up the \nprice double in a year, is to ignore the obvious. I mean, some might be \ncontent to ignore the obvious, not me.\n  Let's say someone who is grossly obese is brought to the hospital on \na stretcher having a heart attack, and a doctor takes a look at this \ngrossly obese patient having a heart attack and says: Well, what we \nneed to do, we need to work first on the weight problem. Let's \nprescribe a diet.\n  No, that is not what they would do. They would deal with the heart \nattack first. That is what we need to do with respect to energy. We \nneed do a lot of things, but first and foremost, we have to find a way \nto make this futures market work and wring the speculation out of that \nmarket and bring down prices.\n  Now, we have people who talk about the ``free market.'' Well, I am a \nbig fan of markets. I do not know of a better allocator of goods and \nservices than the marketplace. I am a big fan. I used to teach \neconomics in college ever so briefly. The marketplace is something I \nadmire. I want the free market to work. But sometimes the market is \nbroken. Sometimes the arteries to the market are clogged and do not \nwork. That is certainly the case with oil.\n  How do you make the market in oil? Well, you have the OPEC countries. \nThey formed a cartel. It would be illegal and prosecutable in this \ncountry. OPEC forms a cartel. They all close and lock a door and have a \nsuggestion about how much they want to produce and what price they are \ngoing to extract for it. That is the front end.\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\n  Second, you have oil companies, bigger and stronger through mergers. \nAll of them now have two names: ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, they all \nhave two names because they decided to get together and get hitched. So \nthey did mergers. They are all more powerful and have more muscle in \nthe marketplace.\n  You have OPEC, bigger oil companies with more muscle in the \nmarketplace, and at the other end you have this futures market that has \nbecome an orgy of speculation, unbridled speculation. I showed a chart \na bit ago that showed over 70 percent of the trades in the oil futures \nmarket are not by people who ever want to see a can of oil or carry a \n5-gallon can of oil or see a 30-gallon drum of oil.\n  They are people who want to trade contracts and make money. That \nmight be fun for them. They might be the most satisfied people in the \nworld traipsing back and forth to put our money in their bank accounts \nin the last year. God bless them.\n  But if we have our way on the floor of the Senate, that is going to \nend. Because what is happening when you run up the price of oil--and \ngasoline doubled--and do the kind of damage that exists in this country \ntoday, airlines declaring bankruptcy, cities losing their airlines, \nfamily truckers who have been working for 30 years saying they cannot \ngo on because they cannot afford to fill their tanks with diesel fuel, \nfarmers and families trying to figure out: How do I scrape up enough \nmoney to fill my tank to be able to drive to work?\n  The fact is, it does not work for us to allow this to continue. This \nmarket is broken. We have a right, it seems to me, to restore the \nmarket to its original purpose. Go back and look at the legislation \nthat created the oil futures market. The purpose was to have normal \nhedging to hedge risk between producers and consumers of a physical \nproduct, a perfectly reasonable and necessary thing to do. But what has \nhappened is the market is taken over now by other interests. Those \ninterests are described by a Wall Street Journal article many months \nago that piqued my interest in what was going on: investment banks, \nhedge funds, pension funds, running deep into these futures markets \ndriving up prices. Investment banks buying oil storage capability to \nbuy oil and take it off the market.\n  That is not the way a market should work or should be expected to \nwork. When a broken market damages this country's economy, we have a \nright and, in fact, we have a responsibility, in my judgment, to \naddress it. There will be those who disagree very strongly with that \nwhich I say. They will be surrounding Capitol Hill with substantial \neffort to say: This legislation that we introduced last evening will be \ndestructive and damaging.\n  I say to them: I know what is destructive and damaging, it is \ndoubling the price of oil and gasoline in the last year. That is \ndestructive and damaging to this country, to the families in this \ncountry, and to a good many businesses in this country that cannot fly \nthrough that storm.\n  So my hope is we will be able to get some bipartisan support for a \npiece of legislation that begins to shut down the excess speculation in \nthe market that is damaging this country's economy.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I rise to speak on the bill being \nconsidered at this time, the foreign aid bill we call PEPFAR. I would \nlike to speak about it in relation to the overall condition of America, \nAmerica's economy, so that we can put it in context.\n  These are very difficult times for our country, we all know. It seems \nthe news keeps getting worse. Obviously, we are at war. As the \nsituation improves in Iraq, Afghanistan seems to be deteriorating. We \nhave to keep our focus on the terrorist problem around the world.\n  Our economy also seems to be failing or at least slowing at this \ntime. The energy situation is crushing Americans. Just filling up their \ncars and trucks with gasoline every day becomes more burdensome. People \nare really hurting. It is very difficult to make ends meet paycheck to \npaycheck. The mortgage companies and banks are experiencing extreme \ndifficulty, making it harder for people to buy homes and to stay in \ntheir homes. Now we hear that the government-sponsored enterprises we \ncall Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are the largest credit \norganizations in the world, are experiencing difficulty and that we may \nneed to step in this year and bail them out to the tune of $40, $50 \nbillion this year. Families are struggling. Any family that has debt \nand can't make ends meet, can't meet their expenses, would not consider \ngoing out and buying a new gas-guzzling SUV. We wouldn't do it.\n  Why, at a time when our country is in debt and, as far as we can see, \nexpenses will be more than revenues, would we create the biggest \nforeign aid bill in history and borrow more money, $50 billion, and \nsend it all around the world to some countries that are much better off \nthan we are? We are doing this in the name of generosity and \ncompassion, helping countries in Africa with the epidemic of AIDS. I \nsupported the program in 2003, and it was a huge, expensive program at \nthe time of $15 billion. Because it has been focused and somewhat \naccountable, it has been somewhat effective. But now we come back and \nincrease that budget over 300 percent, expand it from countries it was \noriginally designated for to the point where now money is going to the \nUnited Nations, to China, India, other countries. Some of these \ncountries are much better off than we are as a nation.\n  This chart will help my colleagues focus on what we are dealing with \nand what we should consider as we talk about spending more money at a \ntime when we are at war and our economy is in difficulty and the credit \nindustry is in trouble.\n  Historically, we have been at about 20 percent of spending as the \nFederal Government in relation to our total economy, what we call GDP, \nor gross domestic product. Beginning now, projected spending is \nincreasing dramatically because of retirees and those going on Social \nSecurity and Medicare and the fact that younger workers are not coming \nin at nearly the rate people are retiring. Our expenses as a country \nare increasing dramatically and will for the foreseeable future. We \nhave no plans to meet this type of spending increase and no place to \nget the revenue. We are already in so much debt that some of the \ncountries holding our debt are trying to get rid of it. Yet we continue \nto spend money. This doesn't even reflect all of the expenses we are \ngoing to have to continue the war on terror and supplemental emergency \nspending, such as floods. None of that is in here. So spending is going \nto increase dramatically. By 2050, which seems a long way off, it is \ngoing to go from around 20 to over 40. During that period, we continue \nto see astronomical increases in spending, with no plans to curtail it.\n  Perhaps even worse, we need to address our debt. That affects the \nvalue of our dollar, interest rates, and the money we have to spend on \nother priorities. We have never seen anything like this. This is not \nmade up. This comes from the Committee on the Budget, as well as the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget \nfrom the administration. This is real.\n  In 2007, Government debt was 37 percent of our total economy. If we \ncontinue spending at the current rate, the U.S. Government's debt will \nbe at 109 percent--larger than our total economy--in a little over 20 \nyears. There is no way we can maintain a successful economy and be the \nleader of the world with this scenario.\n  Some of our colleagues have rightly said in private that this is a \ncrisis; we could be close to a meltdown as a nation. Yet what we are \ndoing here this week I consider obscene and completely unacceptable. It \nis almost unthinkable that we would come in here, at a time when we \nneed to be addressing an energy problem or looking at how we are going \nto deal with Social Security and Medicare and stay more competitive as \na nation and keep jobs here, and talk about expanding the\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\nlargest foreign aid program in history, with no thought of where we \nare.\n  The world has to look on us and wonder: What are they thinking? They \nare running out of energy. Yet their laws keep them from developing \ntheir own energy supplies. They are in huge debt. Yet they keep giving \nmoney away to other countries that are eating our lunch economically, \nsuch as China. What are we thinking?\n  The fact is, we are thinking about the next election instead of the \nnext generation. We have heard comments such as: There is no need to go \nafter any energy in America; it will take 5 or 10 years. That is what \nPresident Clinton said when he vetoed a bill that would have given us \noil supplies from Alaska 10 years ago. We would today be getting as \nmuch oil from Alaska as we are having to buy from Venezuela if we \ndidn't have a President who said we didn't need to be thinking 10 years \nin the future. I say we need to be thinking 50 years in the future. We \ndon't need to be borrowing more and more money and charging it to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  This bill we are talking about this week is all with borrowed money. \nIt is not our generosity. None of us are going to give a penny to help \nAfrica or other nations.\n  We are going to charge it to our children and grandchildren and walk \nout of here and feel good about ourselves. And we should be ashamed of \nourselves. We should be more accountable to the American people.\n  This is a devastating chart to look at, yet we ignore it every day. \nEvery spending bill that is put on this floor passes with flying \ncolors, and it seems to be an insult to this body to even suggest we \nmight cut the budget to some realistic level.\n  I have an amendment we will vote on in a few minutes that takes the \nlevel of spending from $50 billion to $35 billion over 5 years. That is \nstill way too much, and we should not be doing it. It is still more \nthan the President asked for. He asked for $30 billion. What it is, is \nthe amount of money that the Congressional Budget Office said that no \nmatter how hard you tried with this PEPFAR Program, you can't spend \nmore than $35 billion effectively in 5 years; without wasting money, \nyou can't spend more than $35 billion.\n  There is no reason this Senate can't say: Wait a minute. We are in \nfinancial trouble as a country. We still want to help people around the \nworld. Let's bring it back to a level that at least is reasonable in \nthe sense that it is all we can spend without wasting it.\n  My amendment does not change anything about the bill except moves the \nlevel from $50 billion to $35 billion. This will not take one dime away \nfrom AIDS treatment in Africa because if we keep it at $50 billion or \n$60 billion or $100 billion, we cannot get any more money to the people \nwe are trying to help. So if we are at $35 billion, we are at the level \nthat is going to help the people we are intending. In fact, it is still \nmore than twice what we started this program with only a few years ago.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a moment to think about America and \nwhere we are. It is wonderful to be compassionate and generous. But \nthis bill is not about compassion and generosity because none of this \nmoney is coming from us or our salaries, and we are not paying for one \npenny of it by cutting another program or making a sacrifice somewhere \nelse.\n  We are not being honest about where the money is going because it is \nno longer an AIDS to Africa program, it is an ``anything anywhere in \nthe world'' program. We at least need to say we have the discipline to \nbring it back to the level that is the maximum amount our own services \ntell us we can spend. If we cannot do this, if Members of this Senate \ncannot take that one, small step of responsibility, we should not be in \nthis body. We certainly should not go out to the American people and \npretend we have done something good for them around the world because \nwe have not. We are doing business as usual here, spending like there \nis no tomorrow, and there might not be if these same folks stay in the \nSenate and the Congress and continue to spend our money here.\n  I plead with my colleagues to look at reality, to look at where we \nare as a country, in debt and spending. Please, let's demonstrate to \nthe American people that we can trim in one place--this massive foreign \naid bill, giving money, which we are borrowing, all over the world--\nthat we can, we have the self-discipline. We can walk out of here and \nsay: We at least trimmed it back to the maximum amount they said we \ncould spend.\n  I hope some of my colleagues are listening. I appeal to them to show \none grain, one little bit of sanity here as we approach the future, to \ntake this bill back down to a level that is at least vaguely \nresponsible.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator DeMint for causing us \nto confront a very difficult truth; and that is, that we do not have \nunlimited money. We do have to manage it well.\n  I, frankly, have been uneasy as to the way this process developed. I \nsupported the previous $15 billion AIDS bill for Africa that was the \nlargest expenditure to fight a disease in the history of the world. I \nremember thinking the President's plan to double it was a bold, big \nstep, and I hoped to be able to support that. I certainly favored an \nincrease in what we were spending on this program because I think it \nhas made some positive difference. Then I was shocked that out of the \nblue they added another $20 billion to it. So a 5-year program spending \n$15 billion on this disease has all of a sudden been converted into a \n5-year program that will spend $50 billion.\n  It is very difficult to spend that kind of money wisely in \nundeveloped countries. In fact, as the Senator noted, the Congressional \nBudget Office--our independent analysis branch of the Congress--has \nconcluded we cannot spend that much. They say all we can spend is $35 \nbillion. He has an amendment to bring this bill down to that amount, \nand I intend to support it. I think that is a very generous increase.\n  I will note that the G8 nations that are supposed to be participating \nwith us in this--the nations we are supposed to be leading and, in \nfact, are dramatically leading in this effort worldwide based on the \namount of money we have put forth, and with the leadership President \nBush has given--those G8 nations recently met and committed to spending \n$60 billion in the next five years on this project. Obviously, most of \nit is, of course, the money we are spending. So I do not know that we \nhave the kind of followers that leaders ought to have. We need to stay \non those other nations around the world and insist they participate in \na generous way.\n  But I have to tell you, it is not easy to spend this money wisely. \nFive years ago, when we were talking about this bill, Sir Elton John \ntestified before our committee. He has an AIDS program in Africa, and \nhe works hard at it. They raised a few million dollars. They spend a \nfew million dollars a year. I cannot remember the number. I asked him \nabout that at the committee hearing. I said: Sir, we are talking about \n$15 billion. What do you think about that? Is that something we can \nspend wisely? I am sure you try to use your money wisely. What advice \ndo you have?\n  This is what this man, who has committed much of his life and effort \nfighting AIDS in Africa, responded:\n\n       I concur with you totally. . . . This is just something \n     that the politicians have to make sure that when the [AIDS] \n     money goes to governments--\n\n  That is governments throughout Africa primarily--\n\n     the money is spent in the right way. . . . We are a very \n     small AIDS organization; we can control where everything \n     goes, and we do. We know where every penny goes. But when you \n     get to these vast sums of money that we are talking about \n     here today--\n\n  He was talking about $15 billion, not $50 billion--\n\n     you are going to run into those kinds of problems, and I do \n     not personally know myself how you solve them, but I do \n     concur with you that that is a major problem.\n\n  Well, that is obvious to us. So we have not had any kind of intensive \neffort to ensure this money will be spent wisely. It went to the \nForeign Relations Committee, and they popped it out with the full \nfunding--$20 billion more than the President originally asked for, and \nhe is the world leader on this, and the money is just passed along. I \nsay to my colleagues, we ought to be more responsible.\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\n  I shared with a group of Senators the other day--yesterday, in fact--\nthese figures, following up on Senator DeMint's comments. In this year, \nthis is what this Congress has done:\n\n  We have voted for a $150 billion stimulus package--every penny of \nthat in emergency appropriations, going straight to the debt.\n  We expanded the GI bill by $60 billion. Everybody wanted to help the \nsoldiers have more education. How could we say no to that? Senator \nMcCain raised a concern that was very legitimate. They attacked him as \nnot caring about veterans. Basically, thank goodness, most of what he \nasked for got fixed in that bill because it was contrary to what the \nDefense Department believed was good, and Senator McCain helped us \nimprove that bill.\n  We passed a $180 billion war supplemental. We spent about $18 billion \non a Medicare fix. We now are doing a $50 billion AIDS bill. We are \ngoing to have a $15 billion to $18 billion housing bill.\n  Revenue to the U.S. Treasury, because of the economic slowdown, is \ngoing down. So that is a difficulty we face. Last year, after 3 \nconsecutive years of reducing the $400 billion deficit--it fell to $177 \nbillion, and we were feeling pretty good. But now our expenditures are \nsurging, and our revenue is going to be down as a result of the \ndeclining taxes because people are not making as much money, they are \nnot making as much overtime, they are not going to get the bonuses they \ngot in the past, which they may well have paid 35 percent on to the \nU.S. Treasury.\n  The Wall Street Journal said the deficit this year, instead of $177 \nbillion, would be $500 billion. So I am telling you, we have to be \nresponsible here. Every single billion has to be watched with care, and \nI wanted to mention it.\n  I thank Senator Biden and Senator Lugar for their support on an \namendment I have offered on this bill. It follows up on an amendment I \noffered 5 years ago to deal with the concern of how many people are \nbeing infected with AIDS as a result of medical treatment--either \nthrough blood transfusions or reusing needles in medical settings. We \nhad an estimate 5 years ago that 300,000 people a year were being \ninfected as a result of medical transmissions. It is hard to believe \nthe testimony to that effect. So we came up with a program that \nrequired needles that could not be reused, and checking the blood \nsupply before transfusions. I was pleased to see that in the USAID's \nreport on their Web site a few days ago, they have calculated that the \nefforts to improve the safety of immunizations, made possible through \nthe legislation Senator McConnell and others accepted which I \nproposed--and it went in that bill--have saved as many as 300,000 \nlives.\n  But Dr. Gisselquist, a researcher from Pennsylvania, who raised that \nissue originally, and some others who supported this concern, believe \nthere are other things that need to be done, and I have offered some \nadditional legislation this time.\n  I thank Senator Biden--I know he cares about it--for accepting this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I do support the initiative of the \nSenator from Alabama. I think what he has said about the consequences \nand effects of what he is doing are absolutely correct. At the \nappropriate time, with the permission of the Senator from Indiana, and \nin the context of a unanimous consent agreement here, we would be \nprepared to accept the amendment. But we are not quite there yet.\n  While I have the floor, if I could say for the benefit of my \ncolleagues and their staffs who are listening as to the status of where \nwe are, the Senator from Indiana and I think we are very close to the \nwrapping up of an entire unanimous consent agreement which would allow \nus to have no more than four votes, including final passage--at least \nthat is the expectation--and that we would be able to do that sometime \nwithin the next 2 hours, and we would be out of here relatively early.\n  On that point, I thank all the Senators who have had amendments for \ntheir cooperation in moving this along, I think a great deal more \nrapidly than anybody anticipated, at least more rapidly than I \nanticipated we would be able to do.\n  To conclude where I began, I say to the Senator from Alabama, I think \nhis initiative is first rate. Everything he says about the consequences \nof what he is talking about is absolutely accurate, as best I know the \nsituation.\n  In the context of a wrap-up unanimous consent agreement, we will be \nable to handle all of this. So that is the intention, I say to the \nSenator.\n  I am told in the meantime if and when the Senator from Alabama yields \nthe floor, the Senator from Florida is looking to proceed as in morning \nbusiness for some relatively short period of time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5086\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments \nbe set aside, and on behalf of Senator Vitter, I send to the desk an \namendment to the Vitter amendment, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for Mr. Vitter, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5086.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To withhold 20 percent of the Federal funding appropriated \nfor the Global Fund until the Secretary certifies that the Global Fund \n has provided the State Department with access to financial and other \n                                 data)\n\n       On page 60, strike line 2.\n       On page 60, line 12, strike the period at the end and \n     insert the following: ``; and\n       ``(K) has established procedures providing access by the \n     Office of Inspector General of the Department of State and \n     Broadcasting Board of Governors, as cognizant Inspector \n     General, and the Inspector General of the Health and Human \n     Services and the Inspector General of the United States \n     Agency for International Development, to Global Fund \n     financial data, and other information relevant to United \n     States contributions (as determined by the Inspector General \n     in consultation with the Global AIDS Coordinator).\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I wish to correct what I said. I said I \nsend to the desk an amendment to the Vitter amendment. I send the \nVitter amendment to the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that we move \nto its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5086) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I \nbelieve we are down to three amendments. As my grandfather would say, \nGod willing and the creek not rising, we will get a UC that can wrap \nthis up pretty quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Biden for his \ncommitment and Senator Lugar's commitment to this. I know it is quite \nsincere, and I know this reauthorization will, indeed, save lives. I \nwill note I have a New York Times article from 2004 about 428 Libyan \nchildren who were infected with HIV by Bulgarian nurses who were \nreusing needles. So during our discussion before, we learned there were \nquite a number of children infected with HIV whose mothers were not \ninfected with HIV, and it indicated they got it from some other source. \nIt was believed that medical transmissions were a part of that. So I \nbelieve we can make a difference.\n  One of the things this legislation calls for is that whenever a \ncircumstance such as this is discovered, that an investigation be \nundertaken to find out how it occurred so a stop can be put to the \ntragedy of someone going to a physician--a doctor--or a clinic to get a \nshot for an infection or a virus or an antibiotic and they come home \nwith a deadly disease. We can do better with that, and I hope we will.\n  I will note also how proud I have been of Dr. Michael Saag at the \nCenter for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a \npart of the infectious disease program. They have operated programs \nthroughout the world, including Zambia, under a program headed by Dr. \nJeff Stringer.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Tom Coburn. Sometimes people complain \nthat Dr. Tom Coburn holds up bills and doesn't always let them pass by \nunanimous consent--with no debate, no ability to offer amendments. He \nfelt this\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\nbill needed to be improved. I met with a group from Africa who urged us \nto oppose the legislation as originally written for a few reasons, \nprimarily because it removed the requirement that a significant \npercentage of the money from the bill be spent on medical treatment. \nThey said, in fact, we should oppose the bill, even though they would, \nin many ways, benefit. We had a grandmother come whose daughter died \nfrom AIDS and she had her granddaughter with her and the granddaughter \nwas infected with HIV. So it was an emotional moment.\n  I wish to say that as a result of Senator Coburn's objections to the \nbill and the willingness of the sponsors and leaders of the bill to \nlisten to Dr. Coburn's complaints and concerns, considerable changes \nwere made that I think made this bill better. I do feel better about \nthat. I wish to say I am pleased that occurred.\n  So, again, I am going to support the amendment of Senator DeMint \nwhich would reduce the funding to a level above that which President \nBush originally asked for, to the level the Congressional Budget Office \nhas said is all we can spend.\n  I am going to remember--I will not forget--what Sir Elton John said: \nThat it is a responsibility that he felt to everybody who contributed \nto his program to see that every penny is spent wisely. There is no way \nthis huge increase in spending can effectively occur with this \nlegislation. There is no way it can be passed down through governmental \nagencies and bureaucracies and be wisely spent. I hope some of the \namendments and ideas to ensure integrity in the process will become \npart of the law.\n  So I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this. I do \nbelieve it will have a positive impact in the world. I do believe the \nUnited States should lead, and we are able to lead, but I have to tell \nmy colleagues that we are in a position financially where we can't do \neverything we would like. We wanted to help the veterans. We wanted to \nstimulate the economy. We wanted to support housing. We wanted to \nsupport a worldwide program to fight disease, as this bill does, but \nthere comes a point in time when we have to ask ourselves: Where are we \ngoing to get the money?\n  I am telling my colleagues, the deficit this year will be more than \ntwice what it was last year. A lot of this spending we approved this \nyear is not going to come out of the budget until next year. Unless the \neconomy dramatically improves, we will probably see less tax revenue \nnext year than this year. Much of this AIDS money would not come out \nuntil next year to be spent. So I am worried about that. I think we \nought to be responsible. I don't think we have been sufficiently frugal \nin managing this program and in ensuring that every single penny does \nwhat we want it to do and that we are building up the funding at a rate \nwe are sure can be done safely and effectively and protect the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  So for that reason, I intend to support the amendment of Senator \nDeMint and some of the other amendments that call for rigorous \nmonitoring to ensure that the money is spent wisely.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I understand that when we \nfinish the work on this Global AIDS relief bill, we are going to take \nup the urgent matter of speculation in the commodities trading markets \nspecifically with regard to energy and specifically with regard to oil. \nI wish to speak on that critical subject. Is it my understanding that I \nshould speak as in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is up to the Senator to make that \ndetermination.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Well, I will speak with the existing floor \nlegislation then.\n\n\n                            Energy Concerns\n\n  Madam President, it is time for us to address this matter of \nspeculation. We have heard testimony on Capitol Hill from numerous \nexperts in the Agriculture Committee, the Commerce Committee, the \nHomeland Security Committee, and many others over the course of the \nlast several weeks. All signs are indicating there is something \nterribly wrong with the markets--the energy markets, the financial \nmarkets--and they are having an effect upon each other. Something is \nclearly causing high gas prices and our people are hurting and we have \nto get to the bottom of it.\n  When somebody comes up with a solution, those who are on the other \nside of that say: No, that is not true. Well, we are going to have to \nforce the issue and get to the bottom of it because now the President \nhas lifted the moratorium on offshore drilling in the areas that have \nbeen under a moratorium for decades.\n  The President is offering that as if that were the solution, instead \nof taking on the oil speculators. The President implies that by lifting \nthe moratorium, if you drill off the coast in the areas that heretofore \nhad been off limits to drilling, it is going to affect the price of gas \nbut, in fact, the President's own Energy Information Agency has stated \nin a report they published last year that if you drilled all over the \nentire offshore, it would not affect the price of gasoline until the \nyear 2030. So the President's own administration is undercutting the \nvery argument the President is saying. So if they know it would not \naffect gas prices, why are they saying it? They are saying it because \nthey know it is a seductive argument at a time when people are hurting \nunder the strain of paying for $4 gas. It sounds simple: Well, let's go \ndrill. However, the fact is, if we want to drill, why don't we drill?\n  There are 68 million acres under lease by the oil companies. Let me \nrepeat that figure: 68 million acres under lease by the oil companies \nthat have not been drilled. It is seductive to say: Well, let's drill. \nWell, then, if we are going to drill, let's drill. Let's drill in what \nis available with thousands of permits that have already been issued to \ndrill. Why aren't we drilling? If we look at the argument, we will find \nthat to lower gas prices by as much as half, you have to go after the \nunregulated speculation that keeps driving up the price of crude oil, \nand up to unrealistic and shockingly high prices, largely because of a \nlegal loophole called the Enron loophole that was enacted in December \nof 2000.\n  Oil is hovering now at about $138 a barrel, but recent congressional \ntestimony has told us from a leading industry executive--I am talking \nabout an oil industry executive--that under normal supply and demand, \nthe crude oil price ought to be about $55 a barrel, not $138 a barrel. \nIf you brought that price back down to what normal supply and demand \nwould require, then instead of gas being $4 a gallon, you are talking \nabout gas being around $2.28 a gallon. So that is why a number of us \nhave gotten into this act and offered various bills on speculation.\n  My legislation, S. 3134, would take us back to the status quo before \nthe Enron loophole was enacted, and it would say you would have to \nregulate the energy commodity trading markets. That way, I think we \ncould bring gas prices back down to a more realistic level.\n  So what Senator Reid has done is, he has reached out to all these \ndifferent speculation bills, and he has tried to put them together into \na leadership bill that reins in the speculation by imposing position \nlimits so one particular speculator couldn't absorb most of the oil \ncontracts in a particular market, so it would ensure legitimate \nspeculation doesn't get out of hand. Senator Reid's approach is a more \ncomplicated approach that leaves the door open for unregulated trading, \nbut if it is done right, the approach that the majority leader has \ntaken can get us where we need to be. So I am going to be trying to \nassist our leader as we try to get this kind of legislation passed.\n  Now, it is interesting what we have heard coming from the Wall Street \ninvestment banks that have a lot of involvement in this speculative \nbidding up of the price, and what we have heard from the editorial page \nof the Wall Street Journal, which says that if you attack speculation \nit is misguided, and they say that the spiking price of a barrel of oil \nis just the supply and demand question; that the demand exceeds supply.\n  Just ask yourself if that makes sense. When the Saudis agreed to \nincrease production, there was no drop in the price of oil. They \nincreased the supply, but there was no drop in the price, and the price \nof oil keeps spiraling on. And one day it jumped up $11 a barrel.\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\n  When there is no evidence of any dramatically increased demand, there \nis plenty of evidence that speculative money is pouring into the energy \nfutures market. If you were making that much money, putting it into \nthat marketplace, why wouldn't you pour your money in there?\n  Madam President, our airlines are just about to go out of business. \nThe day that oil jumped $11 a barrel, just that $11 a barrel jump cost \nthe airline industry $4 billion extra. The airlines go out and they bid \nin the speculative market to hedge against increases in the price of \njet fuel. But they are hurting so bad because of this marketplace going \nhaywire. There are legitimate hedgers who try to use the futures \nmarket. Every CEO of every major airline has written us, all asking us \nto take action against excessive speculation. In the meantime, you know \nthe drill--the oil companies keep asking loudly, along with the \nPresident--they claim they need to drill in new areas off of Florida \nand off of California. They will argue that this is going to increase \nthe supply of oil.\n  But what they don't tell us is that in the Gulf of Mexico, there is \nalready 39 million acres under lease, and 32 million acres of that 39 \nhas not been drilled. So why wouldn't they drill?\n  Well, there is a fact of a balance sheet and assets. The more areas \nof land and offshore land they can have under lease, the more reserves \nthe oil company accumulates, and the more that is a valuable asset that \nis added to their books.\n  This Senator was involved in crafting a compromise 2 years ago on \ndrilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Initially, the proposal was to drill in \n2.5 million acres. That was going to go on a beeline straight toward \nTampa, FL. This Senator, and others, crafted a compromise of 8.3 \nmillion new acres for lease, keeping it away from the coast of Florida \nand away from the military testing and training area. We have the \nlargest testing and training area for the U.S. military in the world, \nwhich is basically the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida. So we worked out \nthat compromise.\n  But in this argument to lift the moratorium, their side is not \ntelling you that in the 8.3 million new acres they got in the gulf 2 \nyears ago--that did nothing to bring down the price of gasoline and \noil. They don't tell you they have not drilled in any of that new 8.3 \nmillion acres. It is available, and it is there.\n  So the fact is, they ought to be sinking wells in the areas they have \nunder lease--68 million acres--before demanding the control of millions \nof new acres with all the resulting tradeoffs that may occur. What do I \nmean? For example, States such as my State of Florida or California \nhave an enormous part of their economy depending on pristine beaches. \nIn our State alone, we have a $60 billion-a-year tourism industry. Do \nwe want that threatened? Do we want our economy threatened?\n  In States such as mine, the State of California, and many other \nStates, there are these delicate bays and estuaries where so much \nmarine life is spawned. Do we want that threat? No. I admit everything \nis a tradeoff. So why can't we balance the interests here by protecting \nthe economic interests, the environmental interests, and the military \ninterests against the interests to have additional oil drilling by \nutilizing the 68 million acres to drill on, already leased, including \nthe 32 million acres available in the Gulf of Mexico that is under \nlease but hasn't been drilled? It is too much of a commonsense question \nthat people like to ignore. This Senator is going to continue to demand \nthat we answer that in a commonsense way.\n  Let me point out something else. By the lifting of the moratorium, \nwhich the President has just done on Monday, it would lift the \nmoratorium all up and down the eastern seaboard, from Maine all the way \ndown to the Keys in the State of Florida. That would open in the \nAtlantic the area off of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and the \nKennedy Space Center. Do you think we ought to be having oil rigs out \nthere where we are dropping the solid rocket boosters of every space \nshuttle flight, and where the defense satellites that are being \nlaunched out of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, on whose ride to \nspace are expendable booster rockets, with the first stages dropping \noff into the Atlantic--should we threaten that capability of our \nnational security? Yet what Senator McConnell is going to offer as a \nRepublican alternative is to allow this drilling in all of the areas \noffshore of the United States, with the exception that the Governor of \nan individual State could veto drilling off that State.\n  Do we, the United States, whose main function as a government is to \nprovide for the national security, want a Governor of an individual \nState to have veto power over whether the military interests of the \nNation are going to be able to be conducted off the shore of that \nparticular State? I think the answer is clearly no. You can't let a \nsingle individual, with their point of view of a State, say we are \ngoing to drill out there and kill that military testing and training \narea or in the case of Cape Canaveral, the area where we have to launch \nour rockets into space. Yet this is what we have come to.\n  So why do we want, in this system of tradeoffs, a tradeoff against \nthe interests of our national security, our environment, and our \nindividual State economies? It is simply not worth it if you have an \nalternative. The alternative is to go ahead and drill in the 68 million \nacres you already have under lease. We are not opposed to drilling. We \nwant to make sure we approach this, as you make the decisions of \ntradeoff, in a commonsense way. That is what a lot of people do not \nunderstand. We simply cannot allow the administration to take advantage \nof the situation, to give away the store, before this President leaves \noffice in about 5 months.\n  Instead, we need to do something that is going to reduce gas prices \nby curbing the profiteering and the excessive speculation on the \nunregulated markets. That is the real solution for the short term. \nThen, for the long term, we must rapidly develop alternative fuels and \nvehicles and have a legitimate alternative to petroleum as a means of \nthe source of energy as we propel ourselves forward in this country in \nthis century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I am \ngoing to propound, very shortly, two unanimous consent requests \nrelative to the legislation. I wanted to make sure Senator Lugar has \ncopies of them.\n  The first one relates to the Sessions amendment. Then the second \nrelates to wrapping up the entirety of the bill, all remaining \namendments. With the Senator's permission, I will proceed.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for \nSenator Sessions to substitute an amendment on promoting blood safety \nfor the amendment he currently has listed under the agreement with \nrespect to S. 2731, with no second-degree amendments in order to the \namendment; that the Sessions amendment be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the Sessions amendment on the \nlist be deleted, and that no point of order be in order to the bill \nbased on section 305.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, that means the Sessions amendment is now \nagreed to; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We do not have the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5087\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for Mr. Sessions, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5087.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5087) is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To advise the public about the risks of contracting HIV from \nblood exposures, to investigate unexplained infections, and to promote \n             universal precautions in health care settings)\n\n       On page 20, line 13, strike ``and'' and all that follows \n     through ``(C)'' on line 14, and insert the following:\n       ``(C) promoting universal precautions in formal and \n     informal health care settings;\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\n       ``(D) educating the public to recognize and to avoid risks \n     to contract HIV through blood exposures during formal and \n     informal health care and cosmetic services;\n       ``(E) investigating suspected nosocomial infections to \n     identify and stop further nosocomial transmission; and\n       ``(F)\n       On page 28, line 13, insert ``public education about risks \n     to acquire HIV infection from blood exposures, promotion of \n     universal precautions, investigation of suspected nosocomial \n     infections'' after ``safe blood supply,''.\n       On page 102, line 21, strike ``and'' and all that follows \n     through ``(xii)'' on line 22, and insert the following:\n       ``(xii) building capacity to identify, investigate, and \n     stop nosocomial transmission of infectious diseases, \n     including HIV and tuberculosis; and\n       ``(xiii)''\n       On page 132, between lines 12 and 13, insert ``public \n     education about risks to acquire HIV infection from blood \n     exposures, promoting universal precautions, investigating \n     suspected nosocomial infections,''.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I urge passage of the amendment by voice \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5087) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments be in order to S. 2731; that the Senate then proceed to vote \nin relation to the pending amendments in the order listed below; that \nprior to each vote there be 4 minutes equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form; that after the first vote in the sequence, each \nsucceeding vote be limited to 10 minutes each; that upon disposition of \nall of the amendments, and prior to voting on final passage of H.R. \n5501, the House companion, there be 40 minutes of debate, with the time \nequally divided and controlled between the chair and ranking member; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to \nvote on passage of H.R. 5501, as amended, with any other provisions of \nthe previous order remaining in effect.\n  The amendments in question are the Gregg amendment, No. 5081; the Kyl \namendment, No. 5082; and the DeMint amendment, No. 5077.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I believe we are looking for a unanimous \nconsent to begin the first amendment in the series of votes at 5 \no'clock.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of \nthe votes that was set out in the unanimous consent agreement begin at \n5 o'clock, the first vote beginning at 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5081\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, is the regular order now that we are to \nproceed to a vote on a series of amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A series of amendments with 2 minutes of \ndebate on each side preceding each amendment vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is the first amendment my amendment relating to the \ninspector general?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first amendment is the amendment, of the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I will go forward, and I guess the \nSenator from Indiana will close.\n  This amendment seems to me to be eminently reasonable in the sense \nthat all it does--it is certainly not partisan in any way--is set up an \nindependent inspector general for this specific program. Why does this \nprogram need an independent, specific inspector general? It is because \nunder the present law, where we have over $15 billion being spent over \n5 years, we have five different inspectors general looking at these \nprograms, and it has been pretty clear that they haven't had time to do \nit very effectively. Only one inspector general has spent any time, in \nfact, and that has been the USAID inspector general. By requiring the \nprogram to increase threefold, we are dramatically increasing the \nresponsibility relative to spending money, but the USAID inspector \ngeneral isn't going to have time to increase their efforts \nsignificantly in this account. So it is very important that we have an \nindependent inspector general.\n  This is especially true because almost every country that these \ndollars are going to go into is a country which rates very low on the \ninternational evaluation of transparency, integrity, and functioning of \nthe government in a way that we would deem to be efficient and \neffective. We cannot afford to have U.S. tax dollars wasted, and we \ncertainly don't want to have them going to processes which are corrupt. \nThe way to avoid that is to set up a specific inspector general for \nthis account.\n  I wouldn't ask for it if we weren't expanding it so dramatically. But \nwhen you take a program and triple its size, you better have someone \nlooking over the shoulders of the folks spending that money. That is \nwhy we need an independent inspector general relative to this account.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, while I agree with the oversight goals \nthe Senator has suggested, the underlying bill we are debating has a \nvery strong inspector general infrastructure, and it operates at much \nless cost than the cost that would be assumed by the Senator's \namendment.\n  PEPFAR has set a high standard for results-based, accountable \ndevelopment programs both within our own Government and in the \ninternational community. PEPFAR has been among the most evaluated of \nnew programs in the U.S. Government, with five GAO reports already \ncompleted and a sixth on the way.\n  I believe we now have a strong system of oversight already in the \nbill that recognizes the participation of many agencies in our \nantidisease programs, and this system has extensive experience and \ncontinuity of oversight over these programs. I believe we should retain \nthis system. Therefore, I hope Members will oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from New Hampshire. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the \nSenator from Massachsetts in (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 179 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Klobuchar\n     Kyl\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\n\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Bayh\n     Kennedy\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 5081) was rejected.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5082\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided in relation to the vote on the Kyl amendment, No. 5082. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. I would like my colleagues' attention so I can briefly \nexplain the amendment.\n  Mr. President, this will take a moment. This is a very simple \namendment. We have tried to authorize $50 billion over 5 years. All my \namendment says is that in those 5 years, the last year will have $10 \nbillion authorized--in other words, one-fifth of the total. And that if \nthere is an appropriation exceeding that amount, that there would be a \npoint of order against it.\n  The reason for it is very simple. Under the current law, we have \nexceeded the authorization by about $4 billion, actually close to $5 \nbillion. What that does is to affect the baseline for the following \nreauthorization.\n  All we are trying to do is to say if this is $50 billion--that is $10 \nbillion a year. The House actually has it designated as such, the \nSenate does not. All I am saying is, is not even designate each year as \n10, just make sure the last year is 10.\n  One reason for doing that is to make sure that is the baseline for \nthe subsequent reauthorization. That is all we are trying to do. This \nis a very simple, very easy amendment to support. I would think those \nwho are strongly in support of PEPFAR would agree to this amendment \nbecause it would grant further assurances about the program not having \nmission creep and expanding more than it should in future years, that \nwould make some folks feel better about it.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask Senators to oppose this amendment. \nBecause of the anticipated funding curve over the next 5 years, this \namendment likely would have the effect of cutting funds available in \nthe final year by several billion dollars.\n  We should retain the flexibility to spend less than $10 billion now, \nwhile spending more than $10 billion in future years, if needed, when \nour programs are reaching more individuals with treatment and \nprevention services.\n  We want the program to expand at a rational pace based on thoughtful \ngoals and on the developing capacity to absorb investments. Our \nagencies have demonstrated they know how to achieve this. We should \nretain the flexibility that will give them the best opportunity to \nsucceed.\n  I ask Senators to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that is a reasonable argument. My amendment \ndoes not preclude the reasonable ramping up of the money. But what we \nare hoping to do is to keep the appropriation to $50 billion--actually \nit is now $48 billion. Under current law, at $15 billion authorized, we \nare spending just under $20.\n  In other words, the appropriations have exceeded the authorization. \nAll I am trying to do is not prevent the internal adjustment to allow \nthe full expenditure of the amount authorized but to prevent an \nappropriation above that. That is why the point of order would only \napply to appropriations that exceed the authorized amount in the final \nyear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want the Senator to have the last word, \nso I would ask that he have another 15 seconds to respond to what I am \ngoing to say.\n  Let's get this straight. This is an authorization. This is not an \nappropriation. I understand the Senator's concern. But we may need to, \nin terms of rationally ramping up the expenditures of this money \nwithout wasting the $48 billion, be spending $11 or $12 billion in the \nfifth year.\n  His concern is that becomes the baseline for the next 5 years. We are \nnot authorizing for the next 5 years. We are authorizing for this 5 \nyears. All we are doing is authorizing.\n  So I would strongly urge us to vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 15 seconds to sum \nup.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work both the chairman \nand the ranking member have put in. Their arguments have been made. I \nask my colleagues to improve the bill a little bit by adopting our \namendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to the DeMint amendment No. 5077. \nWho yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, since the President introduced his bill to \nreauthorize the PEPFAR program several months ago, a lot has changed. \nOur economy has continued to slow. We have passed a housing bill that \nallows up to $300 billion of risky loans to be added to the Federal \ndebt. We have now been told by Secretary Paulson that it is likely we \nwill have to come up with $40 to $50 billion in the next year to prop \nup the Government-sponsored enterprises of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nI appeal to my colleagues to consider reducing the amount of \nauthorization for this PEPFAR bill to $35\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\nbillion. The Congressional Budget Office tells us we cannot spend more \nthan $35 billion over a 5-year period without wasting, that the \nmechanisms are not there. For us, in the face of what we are dealing \nwith, to go beyond what the Congressional Budget Office tells us we can \nspend and authorize $50 billion at this time is irresponsible. I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for this amendment to reduce the \nauthorization amount to $35 billion.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the President and Members of the House of \nRepresentatives have carefully examined the PEPFAR situation and \nstrongly recommended the $50 billion authorization. In the event we \nwere to pass this amendment, it would be a severe blow to United States \nleadership and prestige on this issue, because it would profoundly \naffect the calculations of individuals, groups, and governments that we \nare trying to engage in this fight against HIV/AIDS. These commitments, \nmany of them, are contingent upon our action today. I believe the $50 \nbillion figure will maximize the humanitarian and foreign policy \nbenefits of the PEPFAR program. We have an opportunity to save lives on \na massive scale and preserve the fabric of numerous fragile societies. \nI ask my colleagues to continue to work together for this result. I \noppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 32 seconds.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, with due respect to my colleague, \napparently there is nothing magic about $50 billion, because today we \narbitrarily cut $2 billion and sent it somewhere else. Again, the \nCongressional Budget Office says that nothing will be sacrificed. No \naid will be taken away from Africans with AIDS and others we are trying \nto help, because within the 5-year period we cannot spend $50 billion \neffectively and efficiently. Let's show some restraint in this body and \nat least move it to the maximum figure we can do effectively.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, currently we are spending $6.3 billion a \nyear. This amendment is based in part on the Congressional Budget \nOffice report that assumes PEPFAR, tuberculosis, and malaria spending \nfor fiscal 2009 will only be $1.5 billion. That false assumption stems \nfrom the fact that the Congressional Budget Office is evaluating this \nauthorization act as if it were starting from zero. That is how they \nget the $35 billion. It is not starting from zero. It is starting from \n$6.3 billion. Slashing funding will require slashing targets set in \nthis bill, including prevention of 12 million HIV infections; care for \n12 million people, including 5 million orphans and vulnerable children; \ntreatment of millions of people with AIDS, according to a formula that \nclimbs as appropriations rise over time; and a major expansion of \nefforts to combat tuberculosis and malaria together which claim 6.3 \nmillion lives a year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n5077.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the \nSenator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Madam President, on rollcall vote 181, I voted ``yea.'' \nIt was my intention to vote ``nay.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the \noutcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n2731, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership \nAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of \n2008. This legislation would provide a substantial increase in our \nresources to address these devastating diseases on a global scale. It \nwill enable us to increase the number of health professionals, expand \ntreatment, and prevent new infections, thus improving the lives and \nfutures of millions in countries around the world.\n  I am particularly pleased to see the advances that this bill makes in \nproviding information about effective interventions, such as those that \ncan prevent the perinatal transmission of HIV and save the lives of \nnewborns. It also will allow us to implement new strategies to protect \nwomen and girls from HIV infection. This bill is an important step in \nour fight against global AIDS, and I would urge all of my colleagues in \nthe Senate to vote for it.\n  I would like to draw attention to several provisions in this \nlegislation which I believe will help to improve our efforts to combat \nAIDS around the world. One of these is an increased emphasis on \nidentifying and replicating best practices in service delivery, a \nscience known as operations research.\n  Let me give you an example of how operations research can help to \nimprove our response to global AIDS. In the developing world, about 1 \nout of every 3 children born to mothers with HIV end up with the \nvirus--a tragic statistic and one we know how to prevent. We have \nlearned from our experience in the United States, where less than 100 \ncases of perinatal transmission were recorded in 2005, that providing \naccess to critically needed, life-extending drugs can significantly \nreduce cases of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. With data from \noperations research, we will be able to understand how we can, in low \nresource settings, improve testing, education, and treatment options in \norder to reduce mother-to-child transmission to levels that are \ncomparable to those we see in the United States. And prevention of \nmother-to-child transmission of HIV is just one of the areas where the \ndata from operations research can transform our ability to maximize the \nU.S. investment in global AIDS funding.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the PEPFAR Accountability and \nTransparency Act to expand our investment in operations research. I am \npleased to note that several of the provisions from that legislation \nhave been incorporated into this bill, which will require the \ngovernment to incorporate\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nplans to improve program monitoring, evaluation and operations research \ninto its overall strategic plan for AIDS. Doing so will allow us to \ndetermine the effectiveness of the interventions we are funding, so \nthat we can replicate those that are working well, and examine ways to \nimprove those that could be better. The bill would also increase the \ndissemination of research findings, so that information about cost-\neffective interventions will be available with people working to combat \ndiseases in their own communities, shared through a ``best practices'' \nreport compiled and published annually by our government.\n  I am also pleased to see that this legislation increases our efforts \nto address the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV infection. \nAccording to the United Nations, more than 15 million women were living \nwith HIV at the end of 2007, accounting for slightly less than half of \nall those living with HIV. But in the places that are hardest hit by \nepidemic, AIDS has a disproportionate impact upon women. In sub-Saharan \nAfrica, for example, 61 percent of those living with HIV are women. And \nwe are not doing enough to help women protect themselves against \ninfection, particularly young women. Studies completed in 17 countries \nin 2003 show that more than 75 percent of the young women surveyed \ncould not identify ways to protect themselves against HIV infection.\n  Last year, I joined Representative Barbara Lee in introducing the \nProtection Against Transmission of HIV for Women and Youth (PATHWAY) \nAct, which would require the President to develop and implement an HIV \nprevention strategy that addresses the particular vulnerabilities of \nwomen and girls--the links between gender-based violence, lack of \neducational and economic opportunity, human trafficking and sexual \nexploitation, and increased risk for HIV infection. I am pleased to see \nthat this legislation contains a strong emphasis on addressing the \nneeds of women and girls. It will require the inclusion of programs to \naddress the needs of women and girls, in the President's 5-year \nstrategy to combat global AIDS, and will provide clear guidance to help \nintegrate gender across prevention, care and treatment programs. With \nthis increased commitment, we will be able to help prevent additional \nHIV infections among women, and increase access to care and treatment. \nDoing so will help not only women living with HIV, but the families for \nwhom so many of these women are the primary caregivers.\n  In addition to requiring a strategy to address the needs of women and \ngirls, the PATHWAY Act also repealed requirements that one-third of \nprevention funding under PEPFAR be spent on abstinence until marriage \nprograms. I believe that we need to repeal this hard spending \nrequirement in order to give countries the flexibility to tailor \nprevention programs to their local needs. Both the Government \nAccountability Office and the Institute of Medicine have produced \nreports demonstrating that such spending requirements impact the \nability of in-country programs to carry out effective interventions. \nThe bill we are voting on today removes the abstinence earmark and \nreplaces it with a requirement to submit reports on spending if in-\ncountry funding for abstinence and monogamy promotion drop below \ncertain levels. I am hopeful that this compromise will allow countries \nto tailor their prevention messages to the epidemic that exists, and \nimprove the efficacy of our efforts to halt the spread of HIV, and I \nwill monitor implementation of this provision to ensure that it does \nnot also constrain the ability of grantees to help prevent as many new \ninfections as possible.\n  This bipartisan legislation is an opportunity for us to renew our \ncommitment as a nation to fighting the global scourges of AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria. It improves our ability to care for those in \nneed, to help countries torn apart by these epidemics, to combat the \ndangerous stigma that often still exists around these diseases, and to \nprevent new infections. Today's vote represents a critical step in our \nefforts to halt and reverse the burden of these diseases, and I am \nproud to join my colleagues in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Global \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria reauthorization bill and urge its \nimmediate passage. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and chairman of its Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace \nCorps, and Narcotics Affairs, I can say that of all the global \nchallenges we face, few are more daunting in scope or immediate in need \nthan the scourge of HIV/AIDS. In so many parts of the world, the global \nHIV/AIDS pandemic threatens to undermine all of our other efforts to \nbring stability and prosperity to the world.\n  As a result of the original law Congress passed in 2003, the United \nStates has provided lifesaving drugs to nearly 1.5 million men, women \nand children; supported care for nearly 7 million people, including 2.7 \nmillion orphans and vulnerable children; and prevented an estimated \n150,000 infant infections around the world. Through this law alone, we \nas a nation have shown the world that Americans are a compassionate, \ncaring and generous people. It is a spirit I know to be true throughout \nour remarkable country. Our sustained commitment to the treatment, \nprevention, and care of HIV/AIDS globally through this law has helped \nus make great strides toward helping repair our Nation's image overseas \nso badly damaged by the war in Iraq. So, I tell my colleagues, the eyes \nof the world are upon us. We must reauthorize this program and we \ncannot wait another day to do it.\n  I want to thank and commend the chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden and Senator Lugar, \nfor crafting this bipartisan legislation that will continue the success \nof the 2003 law and make many important improvements to the program. I \nwould like to take a minute to highlight a few of what I believe are \nthe most critical improvements. Following that, I want to go into a bit \nmore detail about provisions in this bill that I am proud to have \nauthored, along with my colleague Senator Gordon Smith, relating to the \nprevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and the treatment of \nchildren living with this disease.\n  To begin with, the bill increases the authorization of appropriations \nto $50 billion, allowing for incremental increases in funding over the \ncourse of the next 5 years. HIV/AIDS killed more than 2 million people \nlast year, including 330,000 children under the age of 15, and an \nestimated 2.5 million people including 420,000 children were newly \ninfected. These numbers are staggering. Absent an increase in our \nfunding commitment, we may well lose all the hard-fought gains we've \nmade against this disease.\n  The bill also eliminates the restrictive ``one-third earmark'' \nlimiting prevention funding to abstinence-until-marriage programs. The \nInstitute of Medicine and the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nboth concluded that the one-third abstinence earmark unduly limited \nflexibility for the people implementing HIV/AIDS programs on the \nground. In fact, the GAO found that in order to meet the one-third \nspending requirement, country teams reported having to divert funds \nfrom prevention of mother-to-child transmission services.\n  The bill sets several key targets for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment \nand care as well as targets to expand the healthcare workforce in order \nto help achieve staffing levels recommended by the World Health \nOrganization. The bill moves from a reliance on a healthcare workforce \nthat was already in place in the developing world under the original \nlaw to investing new funds to train new healthcare workers and \nparaprofessionals, especially nurses and doctors, under the \nreauthorization bill. The various targets in the bill will help move \nthe program toward sustainability over the long term. That can only be \nachieved by a bold, sustained effort to train and retain new healthcare \nworkers, including adding new workers to the most rural of areas.\n  The legislation repeals the provision in current law barring the \nadmission into the U.S. of individuals who are HIV positive or have \nAIDS. This policy is an international embarrassment and its repeal \nshould be maintained in the final bill. Because of this law, the \nPresident has to seek a waiver from his own State Department to invite \nguests to White House events related to this program. The U.S. cannot \neven host an international conference on HIV/AIDS. The time to repeal \nthis statutory ban\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nthat discriminates solely on the basis of an HIV/AIDS diagnosis is long \npast due.\n  I would like to take a moment now to highlight a couple of key \nprovisions included in this bill that were drawn from legislation I \nintroduced earlier this year with my colleague, Senator Gordon Smith. \nOur bill, the Global Pediatric HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment Act, \nand the bill before us today set a target for the prevention and \ntreatment of mother-to-child transmission of HIV that, within 5 years, \nwill reach 80 percent of pregnant women in those countries most \naffected by HIV/AIDS in which the U.S. has such programs.\n  The bill also calls for integrating care and treatment with \nprevention of mother-to-child transmission programs, increasing access \nof women in these programs to maternal and child health services, and a \ntimeline for expanding access to prevention of mother-to-child regimes. \nThe ultimate goal of these policy improvements is to improve the health \noutcomes of HIV-affected women and their families and to improve \nfollowup and continuity of care.\n  I also want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee for including an amendment I offered in committee \nthat will convene a prevention of mother-to-child expert panel which \nwill report to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator and the public \nwithin a year on a plan for the scale-up of mother-to-child \ntransmission prevention services. This provision was not included in \nthe House-passed bill but I urge my colleagues to maintain it in the \nbill that is sent to the President.\n  We can prevent the transmission of HIV mother-to-child. We know how \nto do it. In the industrialized world, the standard of care involving a \ncomplex drug regimen has reduced mother-to-child transmission rates to \nas low as 2 percent. By the end of 2007, 34 percent of HIV-infected \npregnant women around the world received the medicines they need to \nprevent transmission of HIV to their babies, a substantial increase \nfrom 14 percent in 2005. While this is considerable progress, still \nalmost two-thirds of HIV-positive pregnant women did not receive the \nmedicines necessary to prevent the transmission of HIV to their baby. \nThat is why the target in the bill is so crucial.\n  I am in the unique position of serving on both the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee where \nI have spent many years working to improve the health and welfare of \nchildren and families. We have made great strides through the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act program in this country toward ensuring that children \nand their families receive adequate, family-centered care and treatment \nfor HIV/AIDS. In the United States, we have reached a point where a \nchild living with HIV/AIDS no longer faces certain death. Thanks to \nantiretroviral, ARV, therapy, many children born infected with HIV/AIDS \nnow have the opportunity to grow up healthy. However, long-term \nsurvival remains a dream that eludes most of the 2.5 million HIV-\ninfected children around the world.\n  Globally, HIV/AIDS infection rates in children continue to outpace \nthe rate at which they are treated. Every day approximately 1,100 \nchildren across the globe are infected with HIV, the vast majority \nthrough mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy, labor or \ndelivery or soon after through breastfeeding. Approximately 90 percent \nof these infections occur in Africa.\n  With no medical intervention, HIV-positive mothers have a 25 to 30 \npercent chance of passing the virus to their babies during pregnancy \nand childbirth. Without proper care and treatment, half of these newly-\ninfected children will die before their second birthday and 75 percent \nwill die before their fifth. Sadly, although children represent close \nto 16 percent of HIV infections, they are only 10 percent of those \nreceiving treatment.\n  That is why the bill before us today also includes a 5-year target \nthat the number of children receiving care and treatment for HIV/AIDS \nis proportionate to their infection rate in each country funded under \nthis program. One cannot lag behind the other and, with passage of this \nbill, they won't.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member again for working with me to \ninclude these vital provisions for children and families. I believe \nthey will have an enormous impact on the long-term health and survival \nof the millions of men, women and children affected by HIV/AIDS.\n  I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to highlight an area \nwhere I believe the bill regrettably does not incorporate the lessons \nlearned over the past 5 years about addressing HIV/AIDS, and that is \nthe lack of language in the bill facilitating linkages between HIV/AIDS \nactivities and family planning activities.\n  I recognize that Members have strong feelings on this issue. But \nfamily planning providers serve millions of women in developing \ncountries that are now at the center of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. \nMoreover, it is critical that this program continue to support \nvoluntary family planning counseling and referral as a core component \nof prevention of mother-to-child transmission and other HIV-service \nprograms. I look forward to working to ensure that this program links \nHIV/AIDS activities and family planning activities.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to act quickly to pass this bill to \nreauthorize a program that has helped save the lives of millions of \nmen, women and children. The President has asked Congress to pass the \nbill. The leading organizations advocating for reauthorization of this \nprogram have called on Congress to pass the bill. The House has already \npassed the bill. It is time for the Senate to do the same. I implore my \ncolleagues to put aside their differences and support passage of this \nbill.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I strongly support the reauthorization \nof the President's emergency plan for AIDS relief. The fight against \npandemic AIDS is an important international priority, and I am very \npleased that we can work toward a bipartisan consensus on this \nlegislation. We have the benefit of 5 years of lessons learned to \nintegrate into this bill, and the resources that we are putting into \naction through this measure will deliver lifesaving medicines, basic \nhealth care infrastructure and hope to millions of people around the \nglobal who face the threat of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.\n  I have had a particular interest in the area of health care \ninfrastructure in Africa, and have worked closely with my colleagues \nSenators Durbin and Feingold on legislation relating to this. I am very \npleased that some of our language and ideas have been integrated into \nthe current PEPFAR bill. The fact of the matter is that we face great \nchallenges in the area of health infrastructure in Africa, including \nserious shortages of health care workers, clinics, and hospitals in \nmany areas of the host countries that limit our ability to reach the \nmillions of people who need care and treatment. It is my view that at \nleast some of the answers may be found in the private sector, and it is \nmy hope that U.S. agencies will reach out to the private sector to help \nus meet the overwhelming needs of the affected countries.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues the success of one unique \nnonprofit from my home State that has harnessed the powerful force of \nfranchising to establish a sustainable network of health clinics and \npharmacies in two PEPFAR countries. This program, run by the \nHealthStore Foundation, was established more than a decade ago to \n``prevent needless death and illness by sustainably improving access to \nessential medicines.'' Since that time, the HealthStore Foundation has \nestablished a network of more than 65 franchises in Kenya, serving \nroughly 525,000 patients and customers in 2007. Currently, the program \nis expanding to Rwanda, and the first franchise should be open within a \nfew weeks. By 2012, the HealthStore Foundation plans to expand its \nnetwork to over 14 countries serving millions of patients per year.\n  Each HealthStore franchise is locally owned and operated by a \nlicensed nurse or by a community health worker. Some hire employees, \ncreating still more jobs, mostly for women. HealthStore operates as a \ntypical franchisor, and franchises are licensed under the Child and \nFamily Wellness Shops, CFW shops, brand name. The model incorporates \nkey elements of any successful franchise network:\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\nstrong branding, proven operating systems and training; strict quality \ncontrols enforced through regular inspections; and well-chosen \nlocations. It is worth noting that franchising the distribution of \nhealth care and pharmaceuticals has also helped to curtail incentives \nfor corruption, as franchisees risk losing their business if they fail \nto comply with franchise system standards.\n  I describe the HealthStore Foundation program as a ``microfranchise'' \nmodel, because this model shares many of the unique characteristics of \nthe microlending efforts led by the Grameen Bank. In Kenya, clinics are \neasily accessible, located within an hour's walk of the communities \nthey serve. Each clinic offers a range of government-approved, tested \nmedicines and products along with basic health care services from \nlicensed nurses. Up front costs for each franchise unit are modest, and \nthe stores generate a steady income for their owners. To ensure that \ncapital is available, the HealthStore Foundation provides financing for \nup to 88 percent of the required initial capital, although many owners \nraise funds through family and friends. Most importantly, these clinics \noperate to turn a profit, and it is the long-term maintenance of this \nprofit that sustains the system.\n  Franchising delivers certain competitive advantages, including \neconomies of scale, centralized distribution of high-quality drugs, \ncentral management of regulatory and legal issues, and a critical mass \nof locations that can share best practices and leverage resources. \nApart from the benefits accrued through these competitive advantages, \nfranchise owners also receive extensive training, marketing and \npromotions support, technical advice, and an established, trusted brand \nname.\n  The genius of the HealthStore Foundation's strategy for building a \nsustainable infrastructure of health care delivery in Kenya and Rwanda \nis the adoption of the franchise business model. Franchising is such a \ntried and true business strategy in this country that most Americans \ntake it for granted, but franchising is taking place all around us. In \nfact, a recent report by the International Franchise Association \nEducational Foundation shows that roughly 909,000 franchise businesses \nin the United States account for 21 million jobs and more $2.3 trillion \nin annual economic activity, and franchising has been growing at a \nfaster pace than the overall economy. In the United States, franchising \nis a business strategy that works because an entrepreneur with a great \nidea or great product can quickly and efficiently develop a network of \nbusinesses to deliver a consistent, high quality product in every \nState, city and town across the Nation.\n  The goal of this legislation is to halt the spread of pandemic \ndiseases in a large part of the world. Certainly, the HealthStore \nFoundation has proven that microfranchise businesses can be capable \npartners in this effort, but the ownership opportunities provided by \nfranchising also offer us other benefits. We know that ownership is a \npowerful incentive. Ownership gives people a stake in the future. In \nKenya, owning a HealthStore clinic has become an attractive career \nchoice for health care workers, helping to slow the pace of emigration \nof these trained professionals. The microfranchise model also supports \nthe development of a strong small business infrastructure in villages \nand towns throughout the PEPFAR regions, and the lessons learned \nthrough franchised health care clinics can be repeated in other kinds \nof businesses.\n  For these reasons, the Senate should work with U.S. agencies to \nconsider microfranchise business creation among the strategies for \nputting these resources to work in the PEPFAR region. In order to \ncontinue to raise awareness around this important approach that has \nbeen tried by the HealthStore Foundation, I plan to follow up this \nstatement with a colloquy with one of my Senate colleagues.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to reiterate my continued \nsupport for the passage of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde U.S. Global \nLeadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Reauthorization \nAct of 2008. The compromise that many of my colleagues were able to \nsupport is what I call the third way. Many on both sides of the aisle \nwould prefer to have it changed one way or another to assuage some of \ntheir concerns with the policies set out in the bill, and I can \nunderstand those concerns. However, now is the time to put away our \npartisan politics and pass a bill that will reach to save over 3 \nmillion more lives, care for more than 12 million more people affected \nby HIV/AIDS and continue to stop the spread of the disease by spreading \nthe messages about prevention. That is the bottom line--it saves lives \nand it really is a shining example of the generosity and goodness of \nAmerica and her people. Senators Coburn, Burr and I worked with \nSenators Biden and Lugar and many other members of the Senate to reach \nan agreement that we all think is fair, just and conscientious.\n  As I mentioned the other day, I have been to Africa more than once, \nso I have seen first hand the tremendous benefit that this program has \nachieved and I am confident that this bill will allow it to achieve \neven more. Now I know that some of us are concerned about, and have \nlegitimate disagreements, over the high authorization level attached to \nthis bill. I have always supported having a fair debate on this issue \non the Senate floor and I hope to find a fiscally responsible way to \naddress this crisis by having every member vote on a number that is \nreasonable and get the job done. There is an urgent need to meet this \nworld health crisis, and America has never turned her back when there \nis such a profound and pressing crisis affecting those who are far less \nfortunate. I again want to reiterate my support for this discussion and \nfor the continuation of the floor process to have this bill passed as \nquickly as possible.\n  I believe that the American people support these humanitarian \nefforts, and as their elected Representatives, we have the solemn \nresponsibility to see to it that their hard-earned dollars are being \nspent wisely and effectively. I happen to believe that it is critical \nthat the bulk of these funds are spent for the specific benefit of \npeople who are infected--for their direct medical care and treatment. I \npersonally am satisfied that we have secured a bill that will do just \nthat. In fact, in order to assure that this does happen, we have built \nin safeguards to ensure transparency and accountability throughout this \nbill so that we may better monitor the outcomes of this program and \neasily find the areas that are in need of improvement.\n  We have come a long way in assuring that over half of these funds \nwill be focused on treating people directly, so that the funds will \nfollow the individuals affected by HIV/AIDS. The more we are focusing \nour efforts on treatment, the less likely these funds will be spent on \nso called extraneous provisions that so many of my colleagues are \nconcerned about.\n  I hope that we can all agree to act on this bill in a timely manner \nwithout partisan politics. This is a good bill; it will save lives. As \nI said the other day, I urge all my colleagues to vote for passage and \nsend a message to the world's nations that America will always be there \nfor those who cannot help themselves--our commitment is to ridding the \nworld of these dread diseases, and we are resolute in our determination \nto reach that goal.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today to applaud the passage of \nthe Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership \nAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act. I am \nproud to have voted in support of this legislation that reauthorizes \nthe President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, and provides \nmuch-needed foreign aid to countries to combat these devastating \ndiseases.\n  Currently, more than 33 million people worldwide live with HIV/AIDS. \nMy own dear State of Maryland is one of the hardest hit States in the \nU.S. Maryland has the ninth highest AIDS rate in the Nation and the \nBaltimore metropolitan area has the second highest rate of AIDS cases \ncompared to other cities in the country. Today, by providing $50 \nbillion over the next 5 years to 120 countries we are recommitting \nourselves to fighting the deadly diseases of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand malaria. These global health problems affect not just patients, but \ntheir families and communities.\n  This act provides funding for education, prevention, research, care, \nand\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\ntreatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. It expands programs \nto increase access to care for children and expands the international \nhealth workforce to train and retain health care workers who can \nprovide much-needed care. As the champion of the Nurse Reinvestment \nAct, I understand how critical it is for any country to have a large \nenough health care workforce available to treat such destructive \ndiseases.\n  I would like to honor and thank the men and women who work hard daily \nto make a difference in the fight against these deadly diseases. There \nare many great organizations throughout the state of Maryland that have \nbeen on the front lines for decades fighting HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \nmalaria in the U.S. and worldwide. The National Institutes of Health is \nhome to some of the most significant advances made to treat HIV/AIDS \nand the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has been an \ninternational leader in creating innovative programs to fight disease \nepidemics. The University of Maryland is home to the Institute of Human \nVirology, where some of the world's most renowned scientists are \nundertaking groundbreaking research, such as developing an AIDS \nvaccine. I am also proud of organizations like Catholic Relief \nServices, which is headquartered in Baltimore, that work tirelessly all \nover the world to provide assistance and compassion to those who suffer \nthe physical, economic, social and emotional toll of these diseases. We \nhave made giant leaps forward because of their efforts.\n  I have always fought in the Senate to fund important programs that \nassist individuals living with HIV/AIDS, as well as fund the research \nthat will one day lead to a cure. I will continue the battle and stand \nsentry to fight and prevent HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in \nMaryland and around the world.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I support this bill, which extends the \nauthorization of United States HIV/AIDS programs administered by the \nOffice of the Global AIDS Coordinator, and includes several important \nchanges to the former authorization act. I commend Senators Biden and \nLugar, and their capable staff, for the outstanding work they have \ndone, over many months, to get this bill through committee and to the \nSenate floor.\n  This administration will not be remembered for its foreign policy \nachievements. In fact our country's reputation and leadership have been \nbadly damaged in the past 7 years, due to colossal blunders by this \nWhite House that will take years to overcome. But I do credit President \nBush for his consistent support for significant increases in funding to \ncombat HIV/AIDS around the world.\n  The Congress, of course, has surpassed the President's requests by \nincreasing funding for the PEPFAR program by $2 billion over the past 5 \nyears. We will continue to support this program whoever is the next \nPresident.\n  In addition to authorizing $50 billion over 5 years for HIV/AIDS \nprograms, the bill would call for increased U.S. contributions to the \nglobal fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria. The global fund is a \nmechanism for multilateral cooperation which has strong support in \nCongress, although the President has consistently cut funding for it. \nLike PEPFAR, the global fund is providing antiretroviral drugs to \nincreasing numbers of people infected with HIV, and it is expanding its \nprevention programs in many countries that are not PEPFAR focus \ncountries.\n  This bill does authorize considerably more--$20 billion more--than \nwhat the President initially proposed. Some Senators in the other party \nhave objected to that increase. Madam President, $50 billion is a lot \nof money. But those same Senators have never uttered a word of \nobjection to spending hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency, off \nbudget funding for a war that could have been avoided, has cost \nthousands of lives, that has made us less secure.\n  There is little doubt these additional funds will be needed, although \nthe capacity to use such large increases will take time to build. \nUltimately, it will be a matter for the Appropriations Committee. At \nthis point we are a long way from having the budget allocation to fund \nthese amounts, so we should not be under any illusions. It is one thing \nto authorize funding, but quite another to appropriate the money. Were \nwe to try to meet this level today, we would have nothing left to meet \nother pressing demands and threats around the world. We cannot put all \nour eggs in one basket without causing serious damage to other critical \nforeign policy programs.\n  There is also the question of how much we can do bilaterally and how \nmuch should be done through the global fund. We need to know what the \nright balance is--something the President has repeatedly ignored in his \nbudget requests.\n  This bill tackles many other issues, including how best to allocate \nHIV/AIDS funds. When the Republicans were in the majority at the time \nof the first PEPFAR authorization, the Congress took a prescriptive \napproach, even legislating percentages of the funds that must be used \nfor treatment or prevention, or which types of organizations could \nreceive funding. We are still struggling with that misguided legacy.\n  My own view is that the less Congress injects itself into matters of \nglobal health the better, because the result is too often that politics \nand ideology take precedence over what is in the best interest of \npublic health in a particular country. Every country has different \nconditions, different capacity, and different social traditions, and \ntrying to legislate in Washington the approach that should be used in \nMali or Bangladesh or Brazil is fraught with problems.\n  To me, the bottom line is simple. We are a country whose economy \ndwarfs all others. AIDS is a global pandemic--with over 33 million \npeople infected--that knows no geographical boundaries. It threatens us \nall, but in some countries the needs are far greater. In Africa, people \nsuffering from AIDS succumb from malnutrition and water borne \nillnesses. Others, in Haiti or Asia, suffer in pitiful conditions with \nno one to care for them. From Cambodia to Cameroon, grandmothers are \ncaring for five, six, seven children on an income of a dollar or two a \nday.\n  The PEPFAR program represents the best face of America. It is one way \nfor the United States to mitigate some of the damage to our image, by \nsaving lives in countries where AIDS no longer has to mean a death \nsentence.\n  We need to do a better job of making sure that our PEPFAR and global \nfund dollars are used as effectively as possible, which has not always \nbeen the case. The oil producing countries, which are making huge \nprofits and yet contribute little to the global fund, need to do a lot \nmore. And the Congress needs to give the public health professionals at \nPEPFAR, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Global \nFund the flexibility to make decisions based on the health needs of \neach country.\n  Again, I commend Senators Biden and Lugar, and their staffs, for \ncompleting this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of section \n305 of the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership \nAgainst HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act. \nSection 305 would make an important change in our laws that is long \noverdue.\n  Under current law, foreign students, tourists, refugees and \nimmigrants with HIV are prohibited from entering the United States. \nSection 305 would eliminate this HIV travel ban. I was pleased to join \nSenator Kerry and Senator Smith as an original cosponsor of the HIV \nNondiscrimination in Travel and Immigration Act, the original version \nof this provision.\n  Our immigration laws treat people with HIV differently than people \nwith any other medical condition. HIV is the only disease specifically \nlisted in U.S. law as a bar to entering the United States. For all \nother medical conditions, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \ndetermines whether the public health risk justifies a bar to admission.\n  Only 11 other countries have such harsh travel restrictions for \npeople with HIV. Listen to the other countries with HIV travel bans: \nArmenia, Colombia, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Solomon \nIslands, South Korea, Sudan, and Yemen. Even China recently took steps \nto overturn its HIV travel ban. Does the United States\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nreally want to be in the company of Sudan when it comes to the \ntreatment of people with HIV?\n  This HIV travel ban undermines our global leadership in the fight \nagainst AIDS and is incompatible with the goals of PEPFAR.\n  How can we tell other countries to end discrimination against people \nwith HIV when we ourselves treat people with HIV who want to travel to \nour country differently than those with any other medical condition?\n  The travel ban for persons with HIV was enacted in 1993, at a time \nwhen there was fear and misunderstanding about this disease. The travel \nban is a relic of an earlier time. Hasn't our knowledge about HIV and \ntolerance for people with HIV expanded enough in the 15 years to \neliminate the travel ban?\n  The travel ban does not further any public health goals. Eliminating \nthe ban will simply return the authority to the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to decide whether or not persons with HIV should be \nadmitted into our country, as they do for all other diseases.\n  Our laws already require that anyone who wants to immigrate here \ndemonstrate that they are unlikely to become an economic burden to the \nU.S. Government, which ensures that lifting the HIV travel ban would \nnot have a significant financial cost.\n  Over 200 organizations, including the American Medical Association, \nthe American Public Health Association and the World Health \nOrganization, oppose the HIV travel ban. A broad range of faith-based \ngroups, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, support \nlifting the HIV travel ban.\n  The HIV travel ban allows for a discretionary, case-by-case waiver \nprocess, but it is available only to a restricted group of visa \napplicants, and it is cumbersome and time-consuming. Let's take just \none example: when Chicago hosted the Gay Games in 2006, the organizers \nhad to work with various government agencies for several months before \nsecuring a waiver for persons with HIV to attend the event.\n  We will take an important step towards ending discrimination against \npeople with HIV by lifting this travel ban and treating persons with \nHIV the same way we treat those with other medical conditions. That is \nconsistent with the goals of PEPFAR and the U.S. leadership role in \nfighting discrimination against people with HIV around the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, let me first commend the work of Senators \nLugar and Biden for their leadership in chaperoning this bill through \nthe committee and on to the Senate floor. And, I am a proud cosponsor \nof this legislation. I also want to thank them for including the Kerry/\nSmith language on lifting the HIV/AIDS travel ban. This legislation is \nan important commitment to meeting the global challenges of this \nepidemic.\n  Right now, PEPFAR is on schedule to achieve its goals of supporting \ntreatment for 2 million AIDS patients with life-saving antiretroviral \ntherapies; preventing the transmission of 7 million new cases of the \ndisease; and supporting care for 10 million people infected and \naffected with HIV/AIDS, including orphans and most vulnerable the \nworld's children.\n  Despite what we have witnessed on the Senate floor over the past few \nweeks, PEPFAR, since its inception, has enjoyed wide bipartisan \nsupport. More importantly, it has served as a powerful demonstration of \nour Nation's leadership on global health issues and our Nation's \ncollective compassion to the most vulnerable throughout the world.\n  In the past, I have had the fortune of working with Senator Boxer on \nThe Stop Tuberculosis (TB) Act Now Act. Based on the recommendations of \nthe World Health Organization and the Stop TB Partnership, this \nlegislation would increase the resources available to combat TB in \ncountries with high drug resistant TB infection rates. For people \ninfected with AIDS, TB is often deadly. We have worked to have key \nprovisions of this legislation included in the bill.\n  Senator Dodd and I have worked closely with the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee chair and ranking member to include provisions from \nour pediatric HIV/AIDS bill. This legislation, the Global Pediatric \nHIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment Act, would increase the number of \nchildren receiving treatment under PEPFAR. Specifically, it would \nexpand services to prevent thousands of new mother-to-child \ntransmission cases.\n  Lastly, this legislation should serve as a mirror of reflection on \nour own Nation's policies related to individuals living with HIV/AIDS. \nI have sought in my years in the Senate to help in this fight, pushing \nfor more funding, authoring the Early Treatment for HIV Act and helping \nOregon's largest HIV/AIDS service provider, Cascade AIDS, where I am \nable. I honor the good work that Cascade AIDS has done in Oregon from \neducation and testing to hospice care at Our House and food services \nthrough Esther's Pantry. Cascade AIDS truly proves the good in \nOregonians in answering the many needs of those living with HIV/AIDS.\n  Yet while we have come a long way from the stigma, fear-mongering, \nand rampant discrimination of the 1980s against those living with HIV/\nAIDS, our Nation continues to discriminate. As many of you may not \nknow, the United States is 1 of only 12 Nations with an HIV immigration \nand visitor travel ban. Although we are the leader in public and \nprivate HIV research, we also legally ban people from entering the \ncountry who are HIV positive. It does not matter whether the individual \nseeks to enter the U.S. to attend a global health conference, conduct \nbusiness, vacation, or visit family or friends--they are all \ncategorically banned from entering the U.S. because they are HIV-\npositive. HIV/AIDS is the only medical condition that serves as \npermanent grounds for inadmissibility to the U.S. Even TB and leprosy \nare left to the discretion of the Health and Human Services Secretary \nin determining admissibility. While individuals with HIV can seek a \nwaiver from inadmissibility, it is cumbersome, restrictive, and \nineffective.\n  As a result, the U.S. has made it clear to individuals with HIV/AIDS \nworldwide that they are unwelcome in our country--period. The other \nNations that have put the ``unwelcome mat'' out to individuals with \nHIV/AIDS include Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Sudan. Aside \nfrom the U.S., only 11 other Nations have a ban. Even China, fearing \nembarrassment with hosting the upcoming Olympics, recently acted to \nremove its ban on HIV-positive visitors. It is time we join China and \nmost of the rest of the world.\n  Senator Kerry and I have introduced legislation, which was been \nincluded in this bill, to simply return the authority to the Department \nof Health and Human Services--as with other diseases--to decide whether \nor not HIV should be grounds for inadmissibility to the U.S. This ban \nis a byproduct of the ignorance surrounding HIV in the 1980s and 1990s. \nBy lifting this ban, we can finally set free the specters of phobia \nfrom our past and fully embrace our global leadership on HIV/AIDS. I \nurge my colleagues to join with me and Senator Kerry in removing this \nstigma from our immigration policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nthe engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Committee on \nForeign Relations is discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n5501, and the Senate will proceed to its consideration, which the clerk \nwill report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5501) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     years 2009 through 2013 to provide assistance to foreign \n     countries to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All after the enacting clause is stricken and \nthe text of S. 2731, as amended, is inserted in lieu thereof.\n  The question is on the third reading of the bill.\n  The bill, as amended, was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 40 minutes equally divided for \ndebate.\n  Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  For the benefit of our colleagues, there is 40 minutes of debate \nequally divided, but it is not the intention of the majority to use \nthat 40 minutes. For planning purposes, I do not think we will use more \nthan 8 minutes.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Ohio, Senator Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank the senior Senator from Delaware.\n  I rise in support of this very important legislation that the Senate, \nI hope, passes this evening. HIV, as we know, debilitates and kills. It \norphans children. It fractures communities. It drains resources from \nfragile economies. In addition to what it does to human beings, it \ndestabilizes fragile governments in the poorest countries in the world.\n  It is a human tragedy, the dimensions of which have humbled the world \ncommunity.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware for his terrific work and \nleadership on this legislation, and the senior Senator from Indiana, \nMr. Lugar, who has been a leader in combating global poverty, and \nespecially fighting for public health, combating malaria, AIDS, and \ntuberculosis.\n  I met a young man recently who now lives in my hometown of Mansfield, \nOH. He grew up in the Lake Victoria region of Kenya. He is now married \nto a Mansfielder, after he came to this country. He himself had \nmalaria, which caused his weight to drop to 110 pounds at one point.\n  Now that he is healthy again, he is finishing his degree at Oberlin \nCollege, not far from where I live. His life's goal is to train more \nhealth workers to work in Africa to combat TB, HIV, and malaria.\n  I was, earlier this evening, talking with Senator McCaskill about how \nwe can, with relatively small amounts of money, cure tuberculosis. With \nliterally $20, $30, $40 a patient, over a period of 6 months we can \ngive them medicine so they, in fact, can be made whole. It is the \ncombination of TB and HIV together--people get TB, their resistance \ngoes down, and that is what kills the most people with HIV in Africa \nand increasingly in India and other places around the world. The \ncombination of TB and HIV is ravaging Africa.\n  In 2006, 65 percent of new HIV cases and 72 percent of all HIV-\nrelated deaths occurred in Africa. TB killed half a million Africans \nlast year.\n  As important, what happens with TB does not stay necessarily in \nAfrica. We saw what happened just a year or so ago when a young man \nfrom Atlanta, a professional, who had TB--he was not probably sure he \nhad TB--flew around the world and could have very likely infected \npeople in an airplane with TB. People who are immigrants who come here, \npeople who are traveling abroad and come here from other countries, and \nAmericans traveling around the world, all can be infected with TB.\n  With PEPFAR, we are making a huge investment in services, in \nprevention of these diseases. Now our investment will grow. We \nobviously need to do more. What we are doing with PEPFAR with a scaled-\nup investment will mean significant numbers of children won't be dying \nfrom HIV and won't be dying from TB.\n\n  Investing more in family planning is one of the best ways of \npreventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. To address this issue, \nthis week I am introducing the Senate companion to Representative \nMcCollum's bill, a Congressman from St. Paul, MN, legislation entitled \n``Focus on Healthy Families Worldwide Act,'' a bill which will \nsignificantly scale up U.S. involvement in global family planning.\n  When I think of PEPFAR, I am reminded that we constantly need to \nthink about how our actions affect people directly in ways we don't \nfully understand, and in terms of our lives of plenty, we need to be \ncommitted to help. This is major landmark legislation. What Senator \nBiden and Senator Lugar are doing is so very important to our place in \nthe world, to a more peaceful world, to a more healthy, developing \nworld, but also to a more healthy United States because it really will \nmatter in this country. It will help to preserve our public health \ninfrastructure, and it deeply matters to people all over the world, \nespecially in our country.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, on the minority side, I wish to recognize \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio for his very generous comments.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. First of all, let me thank Senator Biden and Senator \nLugar for their hard work, and the staffs especially, as well as the \nWhite House, in working with us to accomplish what I think--and I \nbelieve others think--were significant policy changes that will make a \nreal difference for people in other countries. There is no question \nabout it.\n  I never approached, in any of my negotiations with the White House or \neither of the staffs, the cost of this bill, and I am concerned about \nthat. We all should be concerned. The $50 billion, we are going to \nauthorize it, and this is one that is going to get spent. This money is \ngoing to be appropriated. Everybody knows that. The question, then, \nbecomes, where is it going to come from?\n  Although I think this is our most successful foreign policy \ninitiative in my lifetime--I was born after the Marshall Plan started \nor thereabouts--I think this is the most effective thing we have done \nto build American prestige, esteem, and respect and thankfulness that \nwe have done in my lifetime. When we look at the 2 million people who \nare now vibrant and vigorous and not wasting, who don't have a \nsecondary disease such as Senator Brown talked about, what it does is \nit gives them hope, but it ought to give us hope. So I am extremely \nappreciative of the very cooperative attitude.\n  It has been said in recent days that you can't work with me. You \ncan't negotiate with Tom Coburn. Well, I will tell my colleagues we \nnegotiated a pretty good fix to a pretty good bill that is going to \nmake a lot of difference in a lot of people's lives. Talking about the \nGenetic Nondiscrimination Act, people said it couldn't work, but we \npassed that bill, didn't we? We fixed it. We made it to where it met \nall sides and all comers, and we did something great.\n  I wish to spend a very short amount of time talking about priorities. \nI think this bill is a priority for our country--making a real \ndifference.\n  How are we going to afford to appropriate this $50 billion? The only \nway we are going to afford to really do it and do it effectively and \nnot charge the $50 billion to Joe Biden's grandchildren or Tom Coburn's \ngrandchildren or Dick Lugar's grandchildren is if we go about making \nharder choices about the waste, fraud, and abuse that is in our present \nsystem. If you add up what the IGs say, what the GAO says, what the CBO \nsays, and what the CRS says, we have $300 billion every year that is \nwasted. It is either wasted or defrauded.\n  So my challenge as we finish this bill, which is going to pass--and \nit is the right thing to do; you heard me say it; it is the right thing \nto do--is we only have half our work done, because if we walk away \nafter the commitment of saying we are going to make a difference in \nAfricans' lives and we don't make a difference in our grandchildren's \nlives by getting rid of the waste that can pay for this so that there \nis no additional debt, we will have failed. So that is my plea to the \nMembers of this body.\n  Jim DeMint made a good plea. He showed you what is getting ready to \nhappen to us. He is right. We have precarious financial markets today. \nWe have a credit crisis. We have a housing crisis. We have a debt \ncrisis. We have a trade deficit crisis. Those things are fixable, but \nwe have to fix them with the same kind of zeal, the same kind of \ncommunity that we did on this bill.\n  So my challenge to the chairman and the ranking member is, as we \nappropriate this money--and we know it is going to happen--let's start \nmaking the same hard choices we made as we negotiated this bill about \nthe waste and abuse and fraud--$80 billion worth of waste and fraud in \nMedicare alone. Let's do it. Let's don't just give it lip service; \nlet's leave a legacy for the next generation so they can not only be\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\nproud about what we have done as great humanitarians by helping people \nwith a deadly infectious disease, but let's leave the same legacy to \nour grandchildren by being responsible. That means we are going to have \nto take some heat because anything we get rid of that is not efficient \nand not effective, somebody likes, somebody benefits from.\n  So my plea to the Members of this body as we pass this is let's do \nthe second half of the job. Let's get rid of the waste, fraud, and \nabuse. There is $70 billion worth of waste and fraud in the Pentagon. \nThere is $30 billion worth of contracting fraud. There is $24 billion \nworth of IT waste every year out of $64 billion we spend on IT. So we \ncan do it. My challenge to us--and my thanks to the chairman and the \nranking member--is let's finish the job when we get down to \nappropriating. Let's really do our homework. Let's give America not \nonly lower gas prices, let's give them lower costs for their kids and \ngrandkids in the future.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  I wish to make clear in the Record that I have never had any trouble \nworking with Tom Coburn. He is correct. We did work on this. He is one \nsmart fellow. He knew a great deal about the substance of this \nlegislation but also the financing of it. I wish to thank him and his \nstaff for his cooperation and thank him for his compliment to our \nstaffs on the committee. I share his view about them, but also it has \nalways been a pleasure to work with him.\n  I yield 5 minutes of our time to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank you very much, Madam President.\n  Let me begin by thanking the chairman of our Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Biden, and the ranking member, Senator Lugar, for \ntheir leadership and their efforts to help bring the Senate to where it \nis today. I appreciate what they have done to help elevate this program \nand bring it down to a new stage.\n  The truth is that for two shamefully sluggish decades, the Senate and \nthe Congress and the country really ignored this issue and were \nsomewhat timid, even scared of it for a lot of different reasons. We \nlost a lot of time in leading the fight against HIV/AIDS on a global \nbasis.\n  In 1999, I guess it was, Senator Frist and I were privileged to work \ntogether and bring an effort to the floor of the Senate, working as \ncochairs, ultimately, of CSIS's task force that was put together. We \nwrote a piece of legislation that ultimately drew broad support from \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. I am pleased to say that one of the \nimportant points people began to understand about this issue--not \npartisan and not ideological--was when the then-chair, I think, Senator \nJesse Helms, came onboard and became a cosponsor of our effort. That \neffort ultimately transformed itself, with President Bush's support, \ninto PEPFAR, when he picked up the cry for some $15 billion.\n  I will tell everybody that initially many of us had suspicions that \nit was going to be a public relations effort, not a real one. In fact, \nI think President Bush has probably transformed this effort into the \nsingle most important piece of his legacy. As Senator Coburn just said, \nthis is perhaps now one of the most important programs the United \nStates is doing on a global basis, and it has made a profound \ndifference.\n  My wife and I had the privilege of being in South Africa and Botswana \nlast November. I will never forget visiting the Umgeni School in \nKwaNgcolosi near Durban, where there was an incredible display of \ncommunity effort that had been brought together because the United \nStates was putting this money into the organizational effort of \ncommunity caretaking. I saw children, orphaned children who, long \nbefore the years that they should have been, had become the caretakers \nfor a whole family of brothers and sisters. I saw what they refer to as \nAIDS grannies who assumed responsibilities because of the deaths within \nthe family for the caretaking of people who were HIV positive. It was \nimpressive, and the gratitude of people toward the United States, the \nconnection they had with us as a result of this, is one of the most \nsignificant foreign policy initiatives in which we have engaged.\n  So I am very grateful to Senator Biden and Senator Lugar and the \ncommittee itself for its work and to the Senate now for embracing this \nmeasure which will take us to the next tier.\n  Two and a half million people will be infected in this next year; 2.1 \nmillion people are going to die of AIDS. The challenge of human \ninfrastructure to be able to deliver the antiretroviral drugs, to be \nable to reach people, to even begin to tackle some of the \ninfrastructure issues and deal with the mythology that works against \nus, to deal with denial in governments such as South Africa itself. \nSome of the AIDS workers I met with--we had to kick out the press and \nkick out public people in order to get them to talk openly and honestly \nabout the difficulties they were having because the Government itself \nwas engaged in some denial, and they feared retribution. It is our \neffort, our taxpayer money, our initiative, our caring that is making a \ndifference in those lives and breaking down those barriers of denial. I \nthink all of us in the Senate ought to be profoundly proud of this \ninitiative and this effort.\n  I am also pleased that in this legislation there are two items that I \nthought were important. One is creating advanced market mechanisms \nwhere we can say to people where there is no market for the creation of \na vaccine that that market will be there. Norway, Canada, the Gates \nFoundation, and others are involved--Germany and others are involved \nnow in providing that kind of market assurance. In that legislation, \nthere is an additional effort to engage us similarly in helping to \nprovide those market assurances so that drug manufacturers will invest \nin the creation of vaccines, knowing that indeed there will be a market \ndown the road.\n  Finally, we are going to allow people who are HIV positive to be \nable, on a case-by-case basis appropriately approved, to come to the \nUnited States as experts or otherwise on a humane basis to be able to \ntravel to the country. We are one of only 12 nations that don't allow \nit. President George Herbert Walker Bush thought we should do this, \nPresident Clinton thought we should do this, President Bush thinks we \nshould do this, and obviously a majority of the Senate thinks we should \ndo this. I think that is adopting a humane and sensible policy. The \nInternational AIDS Committee has held two conferences, one in Canada \nand one in Mexico, simply because they wanted Americans to take part, \nbut nobody could travel into this country, so the conference couldn't \nbe held here. I think it is a wise policy, and I appreciate the fact \nthat the leadership of Senator Biden and Senator Lugar on this \nlegislation was able to fight to hold on to that.\n  This is a good bipartisan moment for the Senate. Most importantly, it \nis a good moment for the American people because it reflects our values \nand I think will help us to be better understood and better appreciated \nin many parts of the world where today we have to climb back from our \nformer reputation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nhas sought time, and I wish to give him that time, but I simply wish to \nthank Senator Kerry for his leadership throughout the past decade, \nstarting with the task force which he mentioned and his work all the \ntime and his work all the time with Senator Biden, with me on the \nForeign Relations Committee. Likewise, I thank Senator Coburn for his \ngracious remarks and his leadership and his ability to work with all of \nus in a bipartisan way to fashion this bill. I believe that is the \nspirit that has characterized success in this endeavor. I am grateful \nfor that.\n\n  I wish to express a special appreciation to Shellie Bressler, Paul \nFoldi, Dan Diller, and Ken Myers of the Senate Foreign Relations Staff \non the Republican side, who have been so instrumental in working on \nthis bill. Of course, I thank profoundly my colleague, Senator Joe \nBiden, our chairman, and his remarkable staff. It has\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\nbeen a joy, once again, to work with them on something that is so \nimportant.\n  I recognize the presence of the Senator from Arizona. I believe we \nstill have 5 minutes on this side; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield that to Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I thank both Senator Lugar for his \ncourtesies, as well as Senator Biden. I appreciate the fact that we \nhave had an opportunity to make some changes in this bill which, while \nmodest, do improve it. Senator Coburn talked about some of the more \nimportant ones. I supported PEPFAR. When the President announced in his \nState of the Union speech that he would request Congress to double the \nauthorization for PEPFAR, I swallowed kind of hard but said, if it has \ndone a good job, which we will find out, maybe that is all right.\n  What we have found is that at the present level of authorization--$15 \nbillion--it has been a successful program. That is the good news. \nUnfortunately, when the bill was written, many of the policy provisions \nthat made it a success were changed. That has required some amendments \nto be adopted to get closer to the original purpose.\n  Unfortunately, some policy issues remain. I wish to note that my \nobjections to the bill relate to two primary points. First is a couple \nof policy issues, and second is the amount of money being authorized. I \nwill just mention three issues. Notwithstanding the positive changes of \nwhich Senator Coburn spoke, we still have a significant mission creep. \nYou cannot go from $15 billion--the amount authorized today--to $50 \nbillion without having substantial mission creep. You cannot spend it \nall on the original purpose of the program. Indeed, we add things such \nas nutrition, legal aid, and others that are quite far afield from the \noriginal mission, which was primarily the treatment of AIDS patients.\n  Secondly, we still have the problem that it deals with far more \ncountries, including wealthy ones, than the poor countries we should be \nfocusing on here. Unfortunately, we were not able to constrain it to a \nlist of more needy countries that would receive this aid.\n  The third policy problem, spoken about before, is the doubling of \nfunding for the U.N. Global AIDS Fund, which has had significant \nproblems. I think they have been well identified. It disregards U.S. \npolicy on matters such as abortion, needle exchange, and others. While \nmany of the policy problems have been resolved, there are still policy \nproblems with this legislation. If the amount of money was much less \nthan it is, this would be less significant. At $50 billion, these \npolicy changes can be magnified. Due to the cooperation of the \ncolleagues I have already mentioned, $2 billion of the authorization \nhas been diverted to some needs in the United States. I am grateful for \nmy colleagues' cooperation on that.\n  There is a lot we could do with money--$10 billion, $15 billion--in \nthe United States that we have not been able to do because of a lack of \nfunding. If we are going to commit to authorize $50 billion to deal \nwith some difficult issues, it seems to me we could have diverted more \nthan $2 billion of that to deal with some of our needs in the United \nStates.\n  But that brings me to the second points of my concern with the bill \nand that is the pure sticker shock of $50 billion. We are more than \ntripling the current authorization of $15 billion. As we heard earlier \nthis afternoon, I don't think there is any intention of appropriating \nless than that amount of money. If anything, we should be appropriating \nmore than that. Because one of my amendments was not adopted, there is \nno limitation on how much money could be appropriated. So we have gone \nfrom $15 billion to $50 billion. That is a lot of money in anybody's \nbudget--especially at a time in the United States when we are facing \nseveral crises.\n  I was down at the White House this afternoon with the Secretary of \nthe Treasury. We have a crisis dealing with a couple of the mortgage \nholders, we have a Fannie and Freddie problem, as well as other \npotential liabilities that will fall on the shoulders of American \ntaxpayers. We need to take these issues on because they are critical to \nour economy and indeed have ramifications throughout the world. But \nthey all involve the U.S. taxpayers potentially picking up the tab. We \ndon't have any choice. We need to do it. Gas prices are high.\n  We are going to take up energy on the floor next, I hope. That is a \nhuge problem. People are hurting because they are paying high gas \nprices and high food prices also. This is not the time for us to be \ntripling a worthy program to $50 billion when we are facing some huge \ncrises here at home. It seems to me we need to make sure we are in \nbetter financial condition to face those crises rather than authorizing \nanother $50 billion in foreign aid.\n  Now, we will hear the argument that this is to do. Nobody denies \nthat. The argument is not is this a good thing. Of course, it is. There \nis an argument about whether moving from $15 billion to $50 billion \nmore than triples the good that is done. I have heard nobody make that \nargument. In fact, the only way you can spend that much money is to \nincrease the mission beyond what it is today. The CBO--a nonpartisan \noffice--makes the point that at a $50 billion authorization, no more \nthan $34 billion could be effectively spent.\n  The point is there is only so much you can do on these programs--\nespecially without good policy to ensure that the money is spent \nwisely. There could be, and I submit will be, a tremendous amount of \nwaste if we authorize this program at $50 billion.\n  So for all these reasons, but primarily and, frankly, because of the \nhuge unmet needs we have at home and the uncertain future we have here \nand the things that we are going to have to do to shore up our \nfinancial system and make sure our economy can continue to operate \nstrongly, I cannot support a bill that authorizes $50 billion in this \nforeign aid. Our country needs to be strong, and we need to deal with \nthe crises here at home. We are a wealthy nation; we can afford to be a \ngenerous nation. We all want to be generous. We have supported the \nprogram in its current form.\n\n  The only question here is whether we can efficaciously go from $15 \nbillion to $50 billion. I find the answer to that question, at this \npoint, to be no. To be strong, we have to be strong here at home, and \nthen we can help people abroad. Reluctantly--because I realize the \nPresident supports this program strongly--I must oppose the program. I \nexpress the appreciation of those who helped adopt one of the \namendments I proposed. I think it will make a modest difference.\n  On behalf of taxpayers, we should not be committing to spend $50 \nbillion at this time.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, we are prepared to yield back the \nremainder of the time on our side.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield myself a couple of minutes. After \nfinal passage, I will go through the thank-yous that are robustly \nwarranted to the staff and individuals and Senators who are still here \nserving, and some who are not serving here, who have laid the \ngroundwork for us to get to this point.\n  In a small village in Otse, Botswana, there is a rural health clinic \nrun by a retired nurse in her seventies. Their patient log is a simple, \nhandwritten ledger. It lists in chronological order the patients who \nhave come in to her for treatment. The ledger has several columns, \nincluding one where, if the patient died, there is a mark made in red \nink.\n  On a visit to this clinic last summer by minority and majority staff, \nthis nurse, I am told by our staff, held up this ledger that showed an \narray of red marks in the early part of this decade. Then, a few years \nago, something drastic happened. The nurse explained, with great \nexcitement, to our staffs:\n\n       Look, no red marks. The red marks have stopped.\n\n  There is one reason for that dramatic turn of events in this small \nvillage in Africa, and that is PEPFAR, which I think would more \nappropriately be named the ``President of the United States fund.'' But \nit is nonetheless called PEPFAR, which is confusing to people.\n  The bottom line is what the President of the United States of \nAmerica, all the Senators, and others who have\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\nnot been mentioned today are about to do, began to change the life of \nthat village.\n  In 2003, President Bush and this Congress launched the largest public \nhealth program in the history of the world. It is saving lives--\nmillions of them. The funerals that were a daily occurrence have been \nreduced in number, and millions of people around the world have been \ngiven hope.\n  We have to sustain and build on this progress, and that is what we \nare doing today. That is what we are about to vote on. This bill we are \nabout to vote on will set the course for the next 5 years and, \nhopefully, beyond. I am confident that, with the hard work of our House \ncounterparts, this bill we are going to pass today will, in fact, be \nmoved very quickly and be sent to the President's desk for signature.\n  We set forth very ambitious targets for care, treatment, and \nprevention. We must do all three. We cannot treat our way out of this \ndisease, but we have succeeded at treatment in a way that nobody ever \nenvisaged when John Kerry, Russ Feingold, and others started talking \nabout this a long time ago. Five years ago, when we stood on the floor, \nI don't think anybody thought that the treatment side of this ledger \nwould be as successful as it has been. I expect and hope that we are \ngoing to continue to see this kind of progress.\n  There are a lot of people to thank. I will do that after we pass the \nbill. For the moment, I wish to thank the President of the United \nStates, President George Bush. His decision to launch this initiative \nwas bold, and it was unexpected. I believe historians will regard it as \nhis single finest hour. That is not a backhanded compliment. It would \nbe a fine hour under the tenure of any President of the United States \nof America.\n  I wish to thank--quite frankly, I don't do it often enough around \nhere--the American people for their generosity. Let me say it again--\nthe generosity of the American people. Senator Kyl makes the point that \nwe have serious needs here at home. Yes, the American people are \noverwhelmingly supporting what we are doing today, knowing the cost and \nknowing there will be tradeoffs. I also appreciate the hard work of \nthousands of men and women in our Government and of the governments of \nour foreign partners, and their partners in the private sector, who are \nworking on the ground around the world and have made this possible.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Virginia (Mr. \nWarner) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nbill was passed and to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have refrained from thanking the people \nwho need to be thanked on the incredible work that was done to get us \nto the point of such overwhelming passage on this legislation. I tell \nmy colleagues that there are no more votes, so I want to make clear we \nare not holding anybody up here, but I want to take about 5 minutes to \ntalk about the work done by our staffs and some of our predecessors in \nthis body to produce the result we have today.\n  And I might add, way ahead of time Senator Lugar's staff and my staff \nhave been coordinating this every step of the way with the House. So \nhopefully--God willing and the creek not rising--we are going to be \nable to produce something for the President's desk within a matter of \ndays so that we are not going to have to go to conference.\n  There are a lot of people to thank, but let me start saying that this \nwas a long time in coming.\n  The first bit of thanks, and I want to reiterate it again, goes to \nPresident Bush. I have been extremely critical of President Bush's \nforeign policy. I have been extremely critical of what I believe the \ndamage his foreign policy has done to our image and/or standing in the \nworld. But I must say the President of the United States has led us to \nthis incredible moment, where this is the single largest effort on the \npart of any country in the history of the world to go out and literally \nsave and extend the lives of tens of millions of people. This is a \ngigantic accomplishment. So first the credit should go to President \nBush. Because, in fact, without his making it clear and at the very end \nof this process, making it clear--I am told to some of his Republican \ncolleagues--how important this was, not merely to him but to the United \nStates, this would have never happened. That is an unusual position for \nme to be in, but\n\n[[Page S6856]]\n\ncredit should go where it is due, and credit is due to President Bush \nand his administration and the many people who have worked both in the \nWhite House and in the various Departments in order to get to this \nmoment.\n  I also want to thank an extraordinary combination of people. It is \npresumptuous of me to say this, but the chemistry between the minority \nand majority staffs on the Foreign Relations Committee is \nextraordinary. I have had the great privilege of working with my \ncolleague Senator Lugar for a long time. We have been working together \nfor over 30 years. To the best of my knowledge, there has never been a \nharsh word, a raised voice, a single solitary slight that ever has gone \nacross the aisle between the Senator and me. There is no one in this \nbody whose judgment on foreign policy I respect as much as this \nSenator. There is no one in the Congress, and quite frankly there is no \none else in the country, whose judgment on matters relating to our \nnational security and foreign policy I respect more, and I thank him. I \nthank him for his friendship and I also thank him in this specific case \nfor his leadership and that of his staff.\n  I wish to express my personal appreciation to Shannon Smith. Shannon \nSmith was new to my staff. She came up on the Hill at a time where she \nwas able to be the catalyst, along with a few other people I will name, \nto produce the result we have today. I can say to Shannon I am \nabsolutely confident--absolutely confident--that if you do nothing else \nin your professional life than what you put together with Senator \nLugar's staff today, you will have had a significant life, because very \nfew people ever get put in a position where they arrive at a moment in \nhistory where they literally can change the path of people's lives in \nother parts of the world.\n  I know that sounds like hyperbole, but it is literally true. Few \npeople get that opportunity. So you should relish it. You deserve it.\n  I also thank Brian McKeon of my staff, who has been with me since he \nwas a kid out of Notre Dame. I guess it is now 20-some years, with a \nbrief interlude where he went off to law school and clerked for the \nFederal Court and then came back as our legal counsel. I don't know \nanybody who knows his way around this body better than Brian does, and \nI don't know anybody who doesn't respect him. He is an incredible asset \nto have on this committee. And I should also credit Sherman Patrick, \nSteve Feldstein and Julie Baker on the staff of the Committee.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't say that it is hard on the Foreign \nRelations Committee--it is kind of like when Senator Lugar and I first \ngot here. There was a unified staff. I mean literally when I came here, \nSenator Fulbright was the chairman and there was a unified staff. The \nchairman hired everybody, but he didn't hire anybody without the \nconsultation and agreement of the minority. We have essentially arrived \nat the same place without having to go through that process.\n  There is Shellie Bressler, who has traveled the world with Shannon, \nwent to those places. I am not being solicitous, Shellie, when I say \nyou should understand that you made history. You helped make history.\n  People wonder whether we underpay the staff here. I say to the \nAmerican people all the time, and the people of Delaware, and I mean it \nsincerely, the single best buy they get in everything they purchase is \nthe incredible talent of the staff who work in this Congress and in the \nFederal Government. These people could go out and be making three and \nfour times what they are now, but they are incredibly bright and \ndedicated, and Shellie, I am telling you, you will be able to tell your \nchildren and grandchildren and your great-grandchildren that you made \nsomething consequential happen.\n\n  I can say the same about Paul Foldi, who works for Senator Lugar. But \nI want to remind Senator Lugar, he used to work for me. He is a \nDelaware guy. Paul was actually foolish enough to help me when I tried \nthe folly of attempting to get the nomination for President. I don't \nwant to ruin his reputation. He has gone right since then. He is now \nworking for a solid Republican. But Paul has been incredible. And Dan \nDiller has been as well.\n  I have managed many bills in my career, and have had some few \nsuccesses, so I apologize, because I usually don't take this much time \nto talk about the staff, but this has been a staff-driven success and \nthey deserve the attention and the recognition.\n  I also thank, in the Office of Legislative Counsel, Matt McGhie and \nKevin Davis, whom I have not spoken to, but the staff has spoken to \nconstantly and who worked tirelessly to prepare many drafts of this \nbill and numerous amendments that have been developed over the past \nseveral months.\n  In the other body, I also thank Peter Yeo and David Abramowitz and \nPearl Alice-Marsh on the staff of Chairman Berman, as well as Chairman \nBerman. We are indebted to the House committee for striking the initial \ncompromise that got us to this point, and we built on the House bill. \nWe have consulted them regularly--I would guess many times a day, when \nI say regularly, in the last few weeks--in the hope that they will be \nable to approve the Senate-passed bill, which is my expectation.\n  Finally, in the administration, several people have devoted many \nhours, and maybe a lot more than that, moving this bill forward. In the \nOffice of the Global AIDS Coordinator, great credit goes to Ambassador \nMark Dybul, a very talented public servant, who testified before our \ncommittee, and who has spent a lot of time with our staffs and helped \ndesign and implement the PEPFAR program and made several contributions \nto the compromises developed over the past few months to get us to the \n80-plus vote. I am embarrassed to say I don't remember the actual \ncount, but I think it was over 80 people who voted for this.\n  I thank, and his staff particularly, Myron Meche, and Tom Walsh, who \ncontributed a great deal to this moment. Also, at the White House, Deb \nFiddelke and David Boyer of the Office of Legislative Affairs have been \ncritical in this process.\n\n  Most of all, I want to thank in absentia the two people after whom \nthis bill is named. Tom Lantos was a friend of all of us, but he was a \nparticular friend of mine. Tom Lantos was a very successful \nbusinessman, an economics professor teaching at San Francisco State \nUniversity, advising a number of banks, as well as two major unions on \ntheir financial investments. I met him when I was a young Senator, and \nI asked him on a lark whether he would come and be my foreign policy \nand economic adviser, and he came and worked for me. He came and worked \nfor me--although, knowing Tom, he never worked for anybody.\n  But Tom Lantos, with his great Hungarian charm--everyone says Ireland \nhas a Blarney Stone. I am absolutely confident the Blarney Stone is \nonly a chip of the stone that is somewhere buried in Lake Balaton, in \nHungary.\n  Tom became a close friend. Annette and his entire family are close \npersonal friends still. Tom's daughter came to work with me as well, an \n18-year-old graduate of Yale Law School, who graduated from Yale with \nhonors at age 18.\n  He was an incredible man who, after a terrible tragedy in Guyana, \nwhere the San Francisco Congressman was shot dead, went home, ran for \nthat seat with my encouragement, and ultimately became the chairman of \nthe House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  And Henry Hyde, with whom I had many disagreements philosophically \nbut was always a gentleman, became a great friend of both Senator Lugar \nand myself. This is the Lantos-Hyde legislation. It is named after \nthem.\n  I know some of my colleagues will sort of wonder whether I am going \noverboard, but I also want to thank, in absentia--and I will thank him \nthrough Dot Helms--Jesse Helms. Jesse Helms had a conversion on the way \nto Damascus on AIDS. Jesse Helms started as a very hard edged guy, \nmirroring the attitudes of some of the most fundamentalist folks out \nthere talking about AIDS, that it was a scourge because of a lot of \nthings that I will not go into. This is a man who not only became \nconvinced of the necessity of this legislation, he became a disciple of \npushing this legislation.\n  Here in the Senate, and I will end with this, I don't know how we can \ntalk about the success here without recognizing on the Republican side \nSenator Brownback, a very conservative Member of the Senate who worked \nvery hard.\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\n  I do not think this would have happened without Dick Durbin being on \nthe floor of the Senate almost every day for the past 5 or 6 years, \npounding away, talking--I do not mean literally, but it seemed like \nalmost every day for the last 5 years--about the moral responsibility \nwe had as a nation to deal with this problem because we could--because \nwe could--because we had the capacity.\n  Senator Lugar has already mentioned--again, I apologize going on for \nso long, but these people deserve credit--John Kerry. This has been a \npassion of John Kerry's for the last 10 years. John Kerry, when this \nwas not at all popular, was not at all sort of the flavor of the day, \nJohn Kerry was banging away at the need for us to attend to this \nproblem. I think he is owed a debt of gratitude for his persistence and \nconsistency.\n  Also, the former majority leader, Dr. Frist, a doctor who came from \nTennessee, and he got deeply involved in this process and his \ncredibility as a great transplant surgeon sort of transcended the \npolitics of this issue. He deserves great credit.\n  One of the guys who maybe was--every once in a while there is sort of \na spark that ignites the kindling and gets it all going. I always kid \nhim, but Richard Holbrooke--and I say affectionately, who drives me \ncrazy sometimes--but Richard Holbrooke and Senator Feingold were on a \ntrip to Africa. Senator Feingold, who has been passionate about this \nissue, was chairman of the African Affairs Subcommittee--or he may have \nbeen ranking member at that time. In fairness, I cannot remember which \nit was. Senator Holbrooke going through a torturous confirmation \nprocess with the help of Senator Lugar and myself--was finally \nconfirmed and did a great job there.\n  He picked up the phone in classic Holbrooke fashion and called \nSenator Feingold and said: We are going to Africa. They went to, I \nthink--I would stand corrected by Senator Feingold, but I believe it \nwas 12 countries in 14 days. They didn't go for this purpose, but in \nthe process they visited clinics and the rest and they saw the depth, \nbreadth, and consequence of this problem. Richard Holbrooke, according \nto Russ Feingold, called Kofi Annan on the plane and said: Kofi, we \nneed a Security Council meeting on AIDS.\n  And Kofi Annan said: I am told we don't have health care Security \nCouncil meetings.\n  They had it, and that was also a major moment. So I thank Senator \nFeingold as well.\n  I could go on. There are others I am sure I left out, but in my years \nin the Senate, they were some of the people who delivered us this \nmoment.\n  Last, and I will not say any more because I am going to yield to \nSenator Wyden to ask a unanimous consent--but, again, nothing works in \nthis place unless it is bipartisan. No one has the credibility that is \nmore recognized to produce those kinds of bipartisan results than my \ncolleague, Senator Lugar, who deserves incredible credit for this bill.\n  I am told by staff Senator Wyden wishes to ask unanimous consent \nabout an issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. If the Senator will yield, I just thank the Senator for \nhis wonderful comments about so many very dear friends, both of ours \nand of the Senate.\n  I thanked a few people earlier on, but I really thank the Senator for \nhis comprehensive views. I think it was well worth both the time, as \nwell as the thoughtfulness of his remarks. They will be remembered by \nour staffs and by our friends.\n  I will not make further comments because I know other Senators are \nwanting to transact business, and we appreciate their patience.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6857-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6857-S6858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CAROLINE PRYCE WALKER CONQUER CHILDHOOD CANCER ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

So there are personal \nconnections with my position on this bill.\n  This body, as well as the House, less than a year ago, reformed NIH. \nWe did some very important things. One of the things we did was take \nout of the hands of politicians the direction that gives us the best \nopportunity to cure cancer. We put it back in the hands of peer-\nreviewed scientific study, which we know will accomplish much more than \nwhen we put our hands on it.\n  There are problems with this bill. One is that it has a registry at \nthe CDC. There are already two registries now at NEH. There is no way \nto fix that, so the American taxpayer is going to get to pay for two.\n  The second thing is, as we direct $30 million to this outside of what \nthey are already doing, that means $30 million isn't going to be \navailable for childhood or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, isn't going \nto be available for juvenile diabetes--where there might be greater \nhopes of saving more children and making greater impact.\n  I have great reservations when we start making the decisions on where \nthe scientific inquiry ought to go and it is not connected at all with \nreal science or peer-reviewed science. However, there are changes in \nthis bill and Deborah Pryce has been a great contributor to the body in \nthe House. I have held her in my arms as she has cried over this lost \nyoung child and, with reservation, I will not object to this bill. But \nI must say we are going down the wrong path. We are penny-wise and \npound-foolish because we want to do what is emotionally pleasing but \nscientifically stupid. We are going in this direction.\n  I am going to allow this. I will not object. I will not object on \nthis bill so this bill will be a great last accomplishment for Deborah \nPryce. It will be a fitting tribute to her daughter and all the other \nchildren. But I will tell you, we will get less, not more, by doing \nthis in terms of the research and the benefit for the children who have \nchildhood cancer in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor--and I know we \nhave colleagues who are waiting. I will not speak long--I want to \nexpress my appreciation to the Senator from Oklahoma for the judgment \nhe has made in letting Senator Reed's bill pass tonight. I know the \nSenator from Oklahoma cares very deeply about the health care of our \nyoung people. He and I served on the health subcommittee in the other \nbody. We can have debates about the merits of specific ways to address \nhealth issues. I share the view of the Senator from Oklahoma with \nrespect to making sure there is not a meddling by politicians in \nscientific matters. But tonight, on this legislation, legislation that \nhas passed the other body 416 to 0, the judgment that has been made by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma is in the interests of all of the youngsters \nof our country who are suffering so greatly, and their families.\n  Like the Senator from Oklahoma, I have sat with them as well, with \nconstituents. I just want to express my appreciation that the Conquer \nChildhood Cancer Act introduced by my colleague, Senator Reed, is going \nto pass tonight. This legislation would provide critical resources for \nthe treatment, prevention, and cure of childhood cancer.\n  We had a victim of childhood cancer in my home State, Jenessa Boey \nByers. She passed away from cancer last December, and she was only 8. \nShe battled cancer, not once but twice. She beat her cancer back into \nremission. She lost that second battle with cancer, but it never really \nbeat her.\n  I will remember always, going to see her in the hospital. What she \nsaid to me is that she was a warrior in the\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\nfight against cancer and that she was going to stand up for all of the \nother youngsters. She was a well-known advocate. She asked me to \nsupport Senator Reed's legislation, and I am very proud to do it. In \nfact, she said to me at one point:\n\n       If you sponsor my legislation, you will be my hero.\n\n  The fact is, the real heroes of this legislation are these youngsters \nwho have suffered, and suffered so greatly. So the decision made by the \nSenator from Oklahoma tonight is one that is going to benefit so many \nfamilies in our country.\n  I want to pay particular tribute to Senator Reed. He could not be \nhere for the unanimous consent, but Senator Reed has prosecuted this \ncause for months and months, working with the other body, working here \nwith colleagues. So full credit for this cause goes to Senator Jack \nReed who is helping so many of our youngsters afflicted by cancer.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nrequest is agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1553) was ordered to be read a third time, was read \nthe third time, and passed.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S6858, July 16, 2008, the Record reads: The bill (H.R. \n5501) was ordered to be . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: The bill (H.R. \n1553) was ordered to be . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I wish to make one other quick comment. I know colleagues \nare waiting. I wanted to make this comment with respect to health care, \nbecause two of my allies in this health care cause, Senators Landrieu \nand Crapo, are on the floor. There is special significance about the \ntwo of them being here tonight for these additional comments on health. \nWhat we have seen again in the last few days is one of the worst \npositions in our country to be in, to be in your late 50s and laid off \nfrom work without health care. If you are laid off in your late 50s, \nlet's say you are laid off at 56, 57, like a lot of these workers we \nhave been reading about in the Midwest who had big layoffs in GM, for \nexample, you go out into a broken individual insurance market. What the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, and the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, Mr. Crapo, and I are trying to do--we \nare part of a group of 16 in the Senate, 8 on the Democratic side, 8 on \nthe Republican side--is to help all those people in their late 50s who \nare being laid off.\n  In fact, under our legislation, the Healthy Americans Act, those \npeople would not go out into a broken individual insurance market. If \nyou are 57, 58, for example, and you are laid off in Louisiana or \nIdaho, under our legislation today, you can get discriminated against \nif you have a preexisting condition. What our group has been trying to \ndo, with the leadership of Senators Landrieu and Crapo, is say that is \nnot part of the individual market of the future. You can't be \ndiscriminated against under our legislation. So right away we are \ngiving some hope to those older workers who are laid off.\n  The second thing we do in our group is, we give that laid-off worker \nwho is 56, 57 years old some real tax relief, like she would have \ngotten through her employer if she still had her job. The irony is, if \nyou are laid off, for example, and you are 57, 58 in the State of \nLouisiana, if you have some high flying CEO, they have an employer \nhealth package, and they get a write-off. But you don't get a write-off \nif you are a laid-off worker in your late 50s. What we do in our \nlegislation is help those people as well.\n  I will be talking more about what it is like in this country to be in \nyour late 50s, years away from being able to get Medicare, and going \nout into the broken individual insurance market. I would have talked a \nbit longer, but colleagues have been waiting. I thought it was \nparticularly appropriate to bring this up tonight because Senators \nLandrieu and Crapo have joined Senator Bennett and me in this group of \n16 whom I believe tonight, when Americans have read those articles \nabout the GM retirees getting clobbered and losing their coverage, they \nought to know there is a bipartisan group of us here in the Senate that \nis committed to giving those people a fair shake and committed to \ngiving them new hope. They would have, under our legislation, under \nwhat Senators Landrieu and Crapo and I are working on, a legal \nguarantee to high quality, affordable coverage, unlike some of those \nretirees from GM. They would have a safety net.\n  This has been an important night in health care. First because \nSenator Reed's legislation to help youngsters afflicted with cancer has \npassed, and it honors the memory of one of my constituents from Oregon \nand, second, I thought it was particularly appropriate with Senators \nLandrieu and Crapo here tonight, with millions of Americans who are in \ntheir late 50s worried that they are going to lose their health \ncoverage, to know a group of us on a bipartisan basis have legislation \nthat would provide real relief, a legal guarantee to high quality, \naffordable coverage when they lose their job through no fault of their \nown.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Landrieu and Crapo, with particular \nthanks to Senator Reed, for passage of his legislation to help \nyoungsters afflicted with cancer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senator Landrieu be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank the \nSenator from Oregon for his kind remarks. More than that, I thank him \nfor his leadership. Health care, as all Americans know, is one of the \nmost significant issues we face today. Senator Wyden has been \noutstanding and relentless in his efforts to build bipartisan support \nfor comprehensive reform of our health care system. We have a lot of \ndifferent ideas in the Senate about how to reform health care. Frankly, \none of the reasons we have such a sort of a patchwork system of health \ncare is because each side in this debate wins a battle here and there \nand gets a piece of their idea into the solution. When we are done, the \npatchwork system we have probably is not as good as any one of the pure \nsystems that many people advocate for. But we have to work together in \na collaborative fashion and build consensus for true health care \nreform. I thank the Senator for his leadership in that regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6858-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6858-S6860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY CRISIS\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I want to speak on an issue which is as \nimportant to Americans as health care. In fact, it may be, today, more \non their minds and may be a more critical issue. That is our national \nenergy policy, particularly the increasingly high price of gasoline and \npetroleum.\n  About 2 weeks ago I asked my constituents in Idaho to contact me by \ne-mail and to tell me what the high price of gas meant in their lives. \nWhat was it doing? Was it another inconvenience or what was happening \nin their individual lives because of these high prices; secondly, to \ntell me what they thought Congress ought to do about it, what the \nsolutions should be. Overnight I had almost 600 responses. The total \nnow has risen to over 1,200 responses.The people in Idaho tell a story \nI am sure could be told by millions of people across this country about \nwhat the high price of gas means. It is not just an inconvenience; it \nis not just fewer trips to the restaurant or to the movies; it is \nimpacting people's lives across the board in monumental ways that \ncould, if we don't fix it, change the quality of life and the American \ndream. I am reading every one of these e-mails. I read stories from my \nconstituents about those who end up at the end of the week with just \nabout $40 or $50 left in their budget, and they haven't yet bought \ntheir food. They need to buy another tankful of gas so they can get to \nwork and keep their job. That is the decision they have to make. They \nbuy the gas because they have to keep their job. They try to figure out \nhow to do with less food.\n  I have stories coming in from individuals who cannot any longer \npurchase their medicine. Their choice is food, medicine, or fuel. Now \nthey are going without the medicines they need.\n\n  I read one this morning from a lady who needs to travel to a certain \nmedical facility for medical treatment. She no longer has the ability \nto make these trips because she does not have enough money to pay for \nthe gas. So she has had to try to make arrangements with her doctor to \nmake some educated guesses about her health care, because she cannot \nget to the medical facility for the treatments she needs and the\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\nanalysis she needs to receive clear answers for her health care.\n  I get information from those who run businesses who talk about the \nfact that they are going to have to lay off employees. The list goes on \nand on and on. As they talk to me about what they think we should do, \nthey have all the same commonsense ideas people across America are also \ncoming forth with. We here in the Senate, I hope, are going to be \ndebating a robust, full agenda of ideas about how to deal with this \ncrisis. We will have a tremendous amount of ideas coming forward from \nIdaho. I told my constituents that I would get their ideas and their \npositions put into this debate. I am putting every one of those e-mails \ninto the Congressional Record. I am going to talk about those e-mails \nand the responses and the ideas of my Idaho constituents in the debate \nas we move forward.\n  Another thing that is coming through loudly and clearly in the \nmessages from my constituency is, they believe that the problem we face \nis largely a result of Congress's failure to enact a rational, \nmeaningful energy policy for this country. Our failure to act is \nrecognized. I believe they are right. I jokingly said in an interview \ntoday, when someone said, Congress is responsible for this, I said: It \nis kind of a national pastime to blame Congress for just about \neverything. But this time they have it right. This time Congress could \nhave acted years ago, and we would be in a better position.\n  There is much we can do and need to do. We have an opportunity to do \nit. The American people, I hope, are watching. I hope they are weighing \nin heavily with their Senators and Congressmen to make sure that we act \nand that we don't sidestep the issue.\n  I think we will have an opportunity to act in the near future. The \nmajority leader has put a bill on the floor that we hope will be coming \nforward soon that I believe should be a vehicle for a robust debate on \nenergy policy. Unfortunately, this bill deals with only one issue, that \nof speculation in the futures markets. I want to talk about that for a \nminute. But my hope is we will have an open amendment process and that \nideas about other pieces of the solution can be dealt with. Frankly, \nthere is much more than simply the futures market to look at, as we \nseek to resolve our problems with the rising price of oil. In fact, it \nmay be that futures market issues are in the lower category of \npotential results.\n  Our Federal Reserve Board chairman talked to us yesterday at the \nBanking Committee about this and said:\n\n       Another concern that has been raised is that financial \n     speculation has added markedly to upward pressures on oil \n     prices. Certainly, investor interest in oil and other \n     commodities has increased substantially of late. However, if \n     financial speculation were pushing oil prices above the \n     levels consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand, \n     we would expect inventories of crude and petroleum products \n     to increase as supply rose and demand fell. But in fact, \n     available data on oil inventories show notable declines over \n     the past year.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       This is not to say that useful steps could not have been \n     taken to improve the transparency and functioning of our \n     futures markets, only that such steps are unlikely to \n     substantially affect the prices of oil or other commodities \n     in the longer term.\n\n  One of the concerns I have is that if Congress, once again, looks for \na quick fix, says, hey, there is one problem here, there is too much \nspeculation, we will stop that speculation in the futures market, and \nthen we will have solved the oil crisis, then Congress will have once \nagain failed to act in a responsible fashion. We need a rational energy \npolicy.\n  I like to analogize that to how we would deal with our own investment \nportfolio. When they invest their own resources, Americans are \nconstantly advised not to invest everything in one asset. Yet the \nUnited States has done that in our energy policy. We are far too \ndependent on petroleum as our source of energy, and we are far too \ndependent on foreign sources of that petroleum, as we have refused to \ndevelop and produce our own resources. We need to have a much more \ndiverse energy policy and a more diverse energy portfolio, where we \nlook at renewable fuels and alternative fuels, nuclear power. Yes, we \nwill have to have a significant amount of petroleum for the future. We \nwill still have a great need for petroleum, even as we seek to \ndiversify. But there are is a lot we can do. Add to that what often is \ncalled the fifth source of energy, which is conservation, where we can \nbe more efficient and much more effective in reducing our utilization \nof energy. Every barrel of oil not used, every kilowatt of electricity \nnot used, is equivalent to one that is produced. We have to become \naggressive in looking at these kinds of solutions.\n\n  Now, I understand the public is frustrated with the $4-plus price of \ngas. I understand how appealing and seductive it is to say we can solve \nthis problem if we just address those energy speculators. I actually \nwish that were possible. But so far, most of the experts are saying \nthat is not the source of the real problem. The underlying problem is \none of supply and demand.\n  Now, there are things, as I said, we can do on the issue of the \nspeculation in the futures markets. There are proposals to work on \nthat, not the least of which is that we need to give the CFTC the \nauthority to conduct the oversight of our futures markets to know what \nis happening and make recommendations to Congress about what changes, \nif any, should be made.\n  One of the first things we can do is to move through this Senate the \nconfirmations of three members of the CFTC who still languish on our \ndocket: Walt Lukken, Bart Chilton, and Scott O'Malia. They need to be \nmoved promptly. If we are going to address the oversight of our futures \nmarkets, we need to put the cops on the beat and we need to not only \nput the members of the CFTC in place, confirm them, but we need to give \nthem the resources for 100 new staff members that we have identified we \nneed so they can aggressively and effectively look at and oversee the \nfutures markets. That type of activity is appropriate.\n  But there are those who are proposing we do things to our futures \nmarkets that can cause great damage, and I am concerned the bill before \nus will do just that. The bill will not lower energy prices as it now \nsits because it attempts to address high oil prices but does so in a \nway that could actually increase volatility and make it harder for \nAmerican companies to manage higher costs, and those costs will then \nhave to be passed on to consumers.\n  It also will make it more difficult for companies, such as commercial \nproducers, to hedge against higher prices. It imposes severe \nrestrictions on investors and professional market participants. This \nmeans they would not be able to purchase the risk of higher prices from \ncommercial producers who want to pass that risk on through derivative \nproducts.\n  Let me give an example. Let's say there is an oil producer who wants \nto build a new drilling rig and needs to finance that construction with \na bank loan. Let's say this producer needs a $5 billion loan to engage \nin this new production that could help us. Any lender will insist that \nthis producer lock in the price of its oil for at least 3, probably 5, \nyears to make sure the producer has the cash flow to repay the loan. \nThe oil producer goes to swaps dealers to look for the price of its oil \nand to hedge its loan for the next 3 years.\n  If we do not have an effective and smoothly running futures market, \nthen that producer will not be able to effectively hedge the loan and \nwill not be able to essentially obtain the contracts necessary to \nassure the bank that the producer can deliver on the loan. If the loan \nis not made, the investment is not made, and the production does not \noccur.\n  Those are the kinds of things that could happen if we improperly undo \nthe smooth functioning of an effective futures market in this country.\n  The bill will also substantially limit the ability of pensions and \nother investors to protect themselves from higher prices and declining \nstock prices. It will allow the CFTC to break private contracts, \nsomething that I believe is going to be very detrimental in the \nmarketplace.\n  But the bottom line, as I see it--and I will probably come back to \nthe floor tomorrow to speak in more detail, as we have evaluated this \nbill more carefully--the bottom line is, even if the futures markets \nare the reason the price of oil is going up, the United States, simply \nby banning or regulating futures contracts in the United States, cannot \nchange the conduct of investment in futures globally.\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\n  Petroleum is a global product. Petroleum futures are marketed \nglobally. If we tell individuals or companies or entities they cannot \ninvest in futures or their investment in futures will be subject to \nextremely high regulatory restrictions in the United States, they can \nsimply go to Dubai, they can go to London, they can go elsewhere and \ninvest in futures where there are exchanges that are willing and able \nand anxious for their business to come. These requirements in the \ncurrent bill do not exist in these other markets, such as in the United \nKingdom, which is actively seeking the jobs and tax revenue that come \nfrom the financial services companies that work with these industries. \nThe bill will help accelerate the relocation of the derivatives \nbusiness from the United States to London.\n  There are many other things we need to talk about. Yes, there are \nthings related to the speculation in the futures markets that we can \nand need to do, but we have to be very careful.\n  As I said at the outset, I hope the debate we have in the Senate is \nnot just about the futures markets. It has to be about the oil prices \nand what needs to be done in this country to deal with them. For \nexample, the vast amount of the U.S. oil reserves, which are huge, are \nlocked away from production. There will be proposals that need to get a \nvote on this Senate floor that we open that production. The first \nexample I will give is the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  It seems to me we need to be as aggressive as possible in opening our \nproduction in the Outer Continental Shelf. The information I have is \nthat 14 billion barrels on the Atlantic and Pacific shelves are \navailable. If we were able to access that, that would be more than all \nof the U.S. imports from the Persian Gulf countries over the last 15 \nyears.\n  There will be proposals to go into the oil shale areas in Colorado, \nUtah, and Wyoming. I understand more are being identified in North \nDakota and Montana. The oil shale areas have more than three times the \noil reserves of Saudi Arabia. Yet the United States will not allow us \nto access them. And we pay Saudi Arabia to bring us its oil and \nincrease our balance of payment problems.\n  We need to look at conservation, where we work on plug-in electric \ncars and trucks, and move to a situation in which we get much more \nefficient in our country with regard to our energy. If we could \nincrease the efficiency of our buildings and our transportation system, \nI understand, globally, we could probably reduce by one-third the \nenergy consumption.\n  There are ideas that abound like these that we must debate on the \nfloor of the Senate. As we get this opportunity, I am confident the \nAmerican people, with the common sense my Idaho constituents are \nshowing, can weigh in and help Congress understand, help this Senate \nunderstand the kinds of moves we must take. We must be bold. We must be \ncomprehensive. We must look at the supply issues. We must look at the \ndemand issues. And we must look at the market issues. But we must act.\n  I will conclude, Mr. President, with just that reminder from my \nconstituents because, as I said before, as I read these e-mails, one \nthing that comes through unbelievably clearly to me is that the \nAmerican people get it. My Idaho constituents get it. They know we can \nhave a better energy policy, and they know that energy policy is \nachievable. They want Congress not to just take a baby step, not to \nduck the issue, or not to just take one little piece of the solution \nthat might work a little bit; they want us to move forward with \nlegislation that will address production of our own supplies and \nresources, expansion into new R technology, conservation, efficiency, \nrenewable and alternative fuels, nuclear power, and many other areas. \nWe have to do it fast. We have to do it now.\n  So my call tonight is an urgent plea to my colleagues, first and \nforemost, to get the issue of energy on the floor of this Senate, and \nthen secondly to have a full and open and robust debate over all the \nideas our colleagues can bring forward and to craft a bill that can \nthen become a gem but more importantly can become a very rational, \neffective national energy policy for our country. If we do that, we \nwill do one of the most important things we could possibly do with our \ntime in the Senate in the next few weeks.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank you and yield back any time I may \nhave remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am so happy to be able to speak for the next 10 or 15 minutes. It \nis important for me to do that. I said I would come to the floor every \nday we are in session until we leave--whether it is in the morning that \nI get that opportunity or in the afternoon or before going home at \nnight--every day until we leave in August to speak about this issue, \nbecause I agree 100 percent with my colleague from Idaho and I want to \nassociate myself with all of his remarks, from the first paragraph, \nthrough the middle, until the end, because he is absolutely correct in \nhis assessment of a couple issues: one, the anger, frustration, and \npain our constituents are feeling at this moment; the truth he spoke \nabout the fact that this is Congress's fault; the fact that he said the \nAmerican people get it and understand it. They don't just get it in \nIdaho, I say to the Senator, they get it in Louisiana. What a shame it \nwill be for us to leave in August or September or October or ever until \nwe get this done.\n  There is a moment of opportunity. There is a window. That window has \nbeen created, unfortunately, by extraordinarily high and historic \nprices that are forcing the attention on this issue. When we force \nattention, the pressure comes to bear to really make some headway. When \nprices are too low, there will occasionally be--or when they are low; \nthey can never, maybe, be too low. But when they are lower, there is \ninterest. But it is fleeting. Or maybe the prices are low, and we have \na little bit of a rush for some environmental legislation. We deal with \nit, and we move on to other things.\n  But there is no moving on to anything else right now in America \nbecause this energy price--this energy price--is unsettling to this \neconomy in ways that I don't have to explain tonight, and my time is \nlimited. I will leave that up to others. But I agree with my colleague \nfrom Idaho and associate myself with his remarks.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. President, also, briefly, before I get back to energy, I wish to \nthank my colleague from Oregon who spoke so kindly about the two of us \nand our efforts on health care because it is another issue that has to \nbe addressed but without the urgency, in my view, that the energy issue \nhas to be addressed.\n  I am very proud to be working with him and 15 other of our colleagues \nin a bipartisan effort to bring down the cost of health care in a new \nand innovative approach. I am looking forward to working on that once \nwe solve the energy dilemma here.\n\n\n                        Cosponsorship of S. 911\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of \nthe Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act, S. 911, \nsponsored by my good friend, the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed. I \nwould like to be added as a cosponsor and want to thank Senator Coburn \nfor lifting the hold on that bill so we can actually get it passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator will be added as a cosponsor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6860-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6860-S6863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me add a few thoughts in the next 10 \nor so minutes tonight about this energy debate.\n  The Senator from Idaho just said we must increase production \ndomestically, and he is absolutely right. It is so hard for me to \nunderstand how this Congress can continue to ask OPEC to increase \nproduction, ask our enemies to increase production, and we continue to \nrefuse to increase production in our own country year after year, time \nafter time, whether onshore or offshore.\n  Now, I would know a little bit about this issue because I helped to \nlead, with the actual Presiding Officer tonight,\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\nand many colleagues, one of the most successful efforts to open at \nleast a portion of our area that was under moratoria. We opened, just 2 \nyears ago, 8.3 million acres, which was a tremendous victory. I am very \nproud of the Senators for doing that, and the House Members. It was a \n10-year effort. We passed that bill here by a substantial margin, but \nit passed by one--one--vote in the House of Representatives. It took 10 \nyears, and we just barely won. All we opened in that bill was a \nsliver--if you all can see this map of North America--was literally a \nsliver of land. I am going to have this map blown up so we can see it \nbetter. I hope the camera can see this right here.\n\n  I wish to repeat this, because I know it is hard for people looking \nto believe it, but for 10 years, by 1 vote in the House of \nRepresentatives, we opened 8.3 million acres right out underneath \nAlabama and Mississippi, about 70 miles southeast of Venice, LA. That \n8.3 million acres is being prepared now to drill. It literally took an \nact of Congress that took us 10 years. At that rate, the price of oil \ncould go up, perhaps double or triple or quadruple. I don't know. This \nis a big country. We can see how big it is here. There is oil in many \ndifferent places in this country, and it is time that we strategically \nopen some other places to drill.\n  We should be careful. We should be deliberate. We do not have to open \neverything. So let me say to my Republican colleagues--not the Senator \nfrom Idaho, my friend, who did a beautiful job just now--but others on \nthe Republican side who want to open everything right now: That is a \nfoolish and unnecessary step, and it will do nothing but confuse the \nsituation. It is like saying we are going to launch a space program \nright now. We have not created the rocket, and we don't have all the \ndetails, and we are going to go to every planet right now. It is that \nfoolish. I wish to say directly to the President of the United States \nif that is your starting point, it is not a starting place for me, and \nI am as pro-drilling as you can get on the floor of the Senate, because \nit confuses the issue and it throws up red herrings and it leads the \ncountry into a false frenzy.\n  We don't have to lift the moratoria everywhere, and I am not going to \nvote for lifting the moratoria everywhere, but we can strategically \nlift congressional moratoria, or provide some kind of local option for \nStates. I am kind of open on this. I have come at it many different \nways, including considering some local options for some limited numbers \nof States where we actually think there might be oil and gas to drill.\n  Now, we do know there is a lot of oil and gas, because this purple \nspot right here represents the drilling that the States of Texas and \nLouisiana and parts of Mississippi and Alabama have been doing for \ngenerations, billions and billions of barrels of oil and gas that we \nwere able to get out safely, securely, having less spills. And this is \nsomething that I want too, less spills than what is in the natural \nseepage of oil.\n  I know this is going to be impossible for some people listening to \nthis to actually believe it is true, so I am going to give the \nreference. It is the National Academy of Sciences. This is not Mary \nLandrieu's propaganda poster or Republican propaganda poster or \nDemocrat. This is from the National Academy of Sciences. Now, they have \nNational Academies of Science in England. I think they have them in \nGermany. Maybe you could go ask them, but you can also ask our American \nNational Academy of Sciences. This is what they say: Natural seeps of \noil--just natural, coming out of the formations--represent 63 percent. \nCars and boats and other sources--which we are trying to clean up, but \nwe are not doing a real great job of it but we have made some \nprogress--are 32 percent of all the spills in the oceans. Petroleum \ntransportation, which means the big tankers, the Exxon Valdez, the \ntankers that sometimes run into the bridges in San Francisco Bay \nbecause they won't put in a pipeline, so they have tankers that come \nin. I keep explaining it would be better not to have the tankers, but \nthey want the tankers there in that San Francisco Bay. They keep \nrunning into bridges. They keep spilling. So we have 4 percent of the \nspillage from the tankers.\n  Now, look here: drilling and extraction. Drilling and extraction, \nthis little green sliver, is 1 percent. Why is this? This is because we \nhave gotten so good and clean and strong, the technology has improved \nso substantially since the 1940s and 1950s, that it is not true that \nthis jeopardizes the oceans or the beaches. I will say to be completely \nhonest that when there is a spill, it can look pretty bad and it does \nand it happens, but this is life, and there are risks associated with \neverything we do, but the risk is so minimal to the benefit of this \nNation.\n  I will tell you what the great benefit for me is: that we can stop \nfunding both sides of the war on terror against ourselves, because that \nis what we are doing right now today. We are taking the people's hard-\nearned money and supporting a war at the tune of $348 million a day, \nand then we are paying our enemies to buy missiles and weapons to kill \nour own soldiers that we are sending over there. That is actually \nhappening today because we are afraid. We are afraid that 1 little \npercent might seep into some water that we couldn't quickly go gather \nup and push to the side.\n  This is why America is angry, because America does not like to be \nwimpy. That is one thing about our country. We don't like it, because \nwe are not a wimpy country. We are a smart country. We are a strong \ncountry. We are a bold country. This Congress has the American people \nfeeling as if we are wimps.\n  We don't again have to lift the moratoria everywhere. I am going to \ntell the Republican leadership they are barking up the wrong tree here, \nbecause you don't have to go to every planet, but we have to pick one \nor two. We just have to pick one or two planets we are going to go to. \nWe should let our scientists pick them. We should figure out what is \nthe fastest, best way to get some additional oil.\n  China has already figured this out, because they are going to be \ndrilling closer to our coast than we are. Let me repeat. There are \nleases right here off the coast of Cuba and they are leasing this land \nto China as I speak. So China will be drilling closer to the coast than \nwe allow our own companies to drill, and that is why the American \npeople are angry.\n  How we open a little bit more of Florida to protect what we need, I \nam going to leave that to my colleagues. I have some ideas, but there \nare others who probably have better ideas, but there is a possibility \nhere. I think there is a lot of possibility in Alaska, and thank \ngoodness that both Ted Stevens, the senior Senator from Alaska, and the \njunior Senator from Alaska, Lisa Murkowski, understand this and they \nknow it. If we listen to them, they can help lead us to a way where we \ncan get a great deal more oil out of Alaska. Now, it is going to take, \nbecause it is far away--Alaska is not part of the 48, as you can see \nhere. There are distances that have to be crossed, pipelines that have \nto be laid, transportation infrastructure that can get this oil to \nwhere we need it.\n  Let me tell you where we need the oil. We need the oil in the \nNortheast. If we don't get them some before this winter, there are \ngoing to be people in the Northeast who cannot afford to heat their \nhomes this winter. These prices have never been this high. It is a long \nway from here to here. The industry can do that, but it takes them a \nwhile. It would be a lot easier to get the oil right here, but \npolitically, that seems to be a problem. So we could move it from the \ngulf to there; we could move it from Alaska to there, but it is going \nto take some time. We can also get more oil here.\n  The other part I should not forget to mention is you have different \nkinds of oil. There is sweet and it is light, and then there is heavy \noil and harder to refine, and the refineries are having a hard time \nbecause Congress gives them no direction virtually whatsoever. They \ndon't sometimes know what refineries to build, and I don't blame them, \nbecause we are so schizophrenic about it. So we now have refineries \nthat only can refine a certain type of oil, and they take these big \ngambles, because Congress any day could wake up and say: Oh, we just \ndecided we don't want that kind of oil. I have to learn a little bit \nmore to talk more about it, but the general gist of it is that not only \ndo you have to go get more oil from some places, we have to\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\nmake sure the refineries are there to be able to produce, but we can.\n  Now, that is enough on oil and gas, because for the next 5 minutes I \nwish to talk about not just producing more oil, which we obviously can, \nbut we also have to conserve. I have to say that I have not been the \nbest person on this issue, so I am going to apologize now, and then we \nare going to move--I am going to move on to say I will be happy to vote \nfor even things that I wouldn't have considered in the past because I \nfeel as though it is very important. We have to move our automobiles \noff of gasoline. We have to move them to fuels that we can produce, we \ncan grow such as sugarcane, such as biofuels, cellulosic ethanol, and \nit can't just come from corn. We know we can do this because there are \nautomobiles on the street today, there are just not enough of them \nbecause the mandate is not strong enough, and when you talk about \ndemand, that is where the demand is. It is in fuels for our \nautomobiles. There are electricity problems. There are power generation \nproblems. However, the real stranglehold that our enemies have over us \nnow, and OPEC has over us, is in the fuel sector.\n  So we have to do two things: We have to produce more fuel and we have \nto consume less. I hope our bipartisan energy bill will include some \nstronger mandates for our automobiles in some way that allows people to \ndrive a big automobile if they want, but it can't consume a lot of \ngasoline. It can consume a lot of sugarcane, fuel made from sugarcane, \nor a lot of fuel made from something other than the corn itself, \nbecause that will drive up the price, but the technology is here and we \ncan do it.\n  The bottom line is we don't have to be wimps anymore. We can be what \nAmerica always has been in every generation: bold, strong, decisive. We \ncan protect our people from losing their homes, their jobs, and their \nbusinesses, and their ranches, which the Presiding Officer would know \nsomething about since he comes from a family of ranchers, because that \nis what is happening right now. People are losing the American dream \nwhile we sit and twiddle our thumbs talking about everything else that \ndoesn't have anything to do with the price of gasoline. Let me back up. \nThat is an overstatement. Speculation does have something to do with \nit, but not the fundamentals. So let's get on with speculation; try to \nget speculation out of the market and then talk about some other \nthings.\n  I am not going to put up any more posters tonight. I think that is \nenough for the night, but again, this is going to be a combination of \nexpanding production, perhaps--I know there is an issue in the \nPresiding Officer's home State of oil shale. I am looking at him \nsmiling because we will have this debate. I am learning a lot about \nthat. There is a lot I don't know about the oil shale, which he does \nknow about. I think there is some potential there. How we go about it, \nwe will have to see. But I do know that there is a lot of oil and a lot \nof gas from traditional sources, but we have to let them find it, \nexpedite the leases we already have, and make sure the infrastructure \nis there in this country to produce, and then move as rapidly as we can \nto new freedom fuels of the future, particularly in the areas of our \nautomobiles.\n  I know the people of Louisiana are anxious for this debate. We are \nproud of the production we do. We are very happy that Congress gave us \nnow a percentage of the oil and gas off of our shore, 37.5 percent that \nwe are going to use wisely to secure our coasts and to build some \nadditional infrastructure in our State. I know not every State has the \nsame attitude that Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi have, and I \ndon't expect that.\n  I don't expect that. That is too much to expect. We just have a \ntradition of it. We are happy to do it. But on the other hand, it is \nnot fair for some States and some places to say they don't want to \nproduce anything, and then expect the States of Wyoming and New Mexico \non shore, and Louisiana and Texas to do all the production in this \ncountry. There are other places that can produce, and we most certainly \nneed to do it. We owe it not just to our constituents today, but we owe \nit to future generations of this country to break the back of OPEC, put \nus on a path of independence, get these prices lower, and clean up our \nenvironment at the same time.\n  You can get to the place sometimes--well, the Presiding Officer has \nplayed baseball--when the bases are lined up and the lights in the \nstadium are on, it is a perfect time to hit it out of the ballpark. If \nwe can get the right batter up, with the right pitch, we can hit this \nout of the ballpark.\n  We can do for the American people what they expect, which is to move \nbeyond our comfort zone, from what we are used to, and do something \nthat may actually make a difference in their lives.\n  Thank you so much.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I think it is very appropriate for the \nMembers of this Chamber today to be talking to an issue which is near \nand dear and extremely important to the people of America, and that is \nhow much we are paying for gas and the importance of energy \nindependence for our Nation. It is an issue I know the Presiding \nOfficer has worked on very long and hard, including her efforts in \nwriting the 2005 Energy Policy Act, as well as her efforts in opening \nlease sale 181 on the gulf coast.\n  I know how heartfelt the Presiding Officer also feels, as a Senator \nfrom Louisiana, in terms of having the domestic production that comes \nout of the gulf coast being a significant part of the portfolio that \nfills the supply lines for the United States of America. So I am \nhopeful that as we turn the page from the legislation we were on today \nto move forward and try to address the high price of gas in America, we \nlook at the issue before us with open eyes and try to figure out ways \nof getting to the real answers and solutions to the problem of the \nenergy crisis we face in America today.\n  I think it is important as we do so to constantly remind ourselves of \nwhat is at stake today and what makes 2008 different, perhaps, from \nwhere we were in the 1970s. We all know then it was President Richard \nNixon who came before the Nation and said: OPEC has been formed and, \ntherefore, we as a nation need to move forward to energy independence.\n  Then, not too many years later, we had President Jimmy Carter saying \nwe needed to embrace energy independence, with the moral imperative of \nwar.\n  In those days, in the 1970s, we were importing about 30 percent of \nour oil from foreign countries. What happened through the 1980s and \nwhat happened through the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s? America \nslept. America slept. The result was, in March of last year we were \nimporting 67 percent of our oil from foreign countries.\n  As the Presiding Officer, in her role as a Senator from Louisiana, so \neloquently stated, we have become hostage to those interests of the \nglobe that have the world's oil reserves, and we in the United States \nend up funding both sides of the war on terror. It is important that we \nbreak our addiction to foreign oil and that we take on the national \nsecurity issues of the United States in a bold and aggressive way and \nthat we do that immediately.\n  I believe what changed from the 1970s to today is the issues that \ndrive us, and first and foremost is national security. We need to make \nsure we are not held at the end of a noose by the OPEC countries and \nheld by those countries that hold most of the global reserves of oil.\n  Secondly, we need to be cognizant of the fact that global warming is \na reality. The days of the debate are over. Science tells us that we \nhave to do something about global warming to make sure we protect our \nplanet.\n  Third, if we do this right and embrace a new energy future for \nAmerica, we can create a host of economic opportunities for the United \nStates. In\n\n[[Page S6863]]\n\nmy State of Colorado, I have seen what has happened since 2004 when we \npassed a renewable portfolio standard, and we have gone from a point \nwhere we had almost no alternative energy, where we were not harnessing \nthe power of the wind--we had almost zero energy being produced from \nthe wind--to the point today where we are producing over 1,000 \nmegawatts of power from wind. That is about the equivalent of the power \ngenerated from three coal-fired powerplants.\n  We were nowhere in terms of biofuels and ethanol. Yet because of \npolicies we have passed in this Congress, today we have ethanol plants \nthat have sprouted up across the eastern plains, giving a new potential \nand meaning for that part of rural America which has been so forgotten. \nSo there are economic opportunities that also drive this agenda that we \nare on.\n  I hope as we enter into this debate tomorrow, and perhaps in the week \nahead, we join together to try to set America free. When I look at how \nwe are going to do that, in terms of our overdependence on foreign oil, \nit seems to me there are a number of things that we can do to get rid \nof that overdependence on foreign oil and, at the same time, make sure \nwe are trying to do everything we can within our power to provide some \nrelief to the consumers of America, to the American citizens who are \nsuffering every day when they fill up their cars at the pump. The \nfarmers, who are filling up their John Deere tractors, are having to \npay $1,000 every time they fill up the tractor or the combine; or the \ntrucker, who is having to spend over $1,000--in fact, $5,000 for the \nbig semitrucks--every time they have to fill their truck with diesel.\n  I hope we embrace this and that we can be smart about it. I would \noffer four concepts, in general. First, I think there is a way in which \nwe can produce more oil. We can do it in many areas, including from the \nAlaska petroleum reserve. There are a number of other places where we \ncan embrace the production of more oil for America.\n  Secondly, we need to stay the course in terms of pushing forward an \naggressive agenda on alternative fuels. More can be done, including how \nwe incentivize the production of biofuels.\n  Third is that we continue to look forward to ways of using what we \nhave more efficiently through conservation measures that we know can \nstretch out our supplies in a much more significant way, where we have \nnot done what we should have been doing in the last 30 years.\n  Fourth is research and the development of new technology. We now know \nthe hybrid plug-ins and the new batteries that are being developed can \nhelp us create a national fleet that can be much more productive in \nterms of how we ultimately use this very scarce resource that we call \npetroleum and gasoline.\n  So I hope we can, in fact, come together in a bipartisan fashion to \nput together a package that will make sense. I will make a quick \ncomment about oil shale.\n  Oil shale is a very important resource for our Nation. It is a \nresource that we understand in Colorado has been there for a long time, \nsince the 1920s when it was predicted that oil shale essentially was \ngoing to be the panacea to all of the oil needs of the entire world. I \nrecognize that most of the trillion or so barrels of oil that have been \ncalculated to exist in the reserves of oil shale are actually beneath \nthe lands of my State, beneath the lands of the western slope, one of \nthe most beautiful places and congressional districts in the entire \nUnited States of America.\n  So I believe we are already on a pathway to try to develop the \ntechnology to make sure that oil shale provides an opportunity for \nAmerica in the future. That is why the research and development leases, \nwhich the Department of Interior issued under the authority we have \nprovided to them, have been issued. That is why companies have invested \nto figure out whether the technology is there to be able to develop oil \nfrom the shale in place. That is why they are looking at what the \nrequirements are going to be in terms of electricity that will be \nrequired in order to be able to heat the oil shale in place. That is \nwhy they are trying to figure out if this technology works, how much \nwater it will take to develop this oil from the shale.\n  So I think we have developed a thoughtful way forward, and I am \nhopeful we can support the thoughtful way forward that we have already \ndeveloped. A few months ago, in the Energy Committee, the Assistant \nSecretary testified before the committee. I had questions that I \ndirected to him about oil shale, where he thinks it might be going. He \nsaid to me in the line of questioning that, at the end of the day, \nthere is no way we will be producing oil from shale until, the \nearliest, 2015. That was his testimony, 2015.\n  I have a letter I have talked about before on the floor of the Senate \nfrom Chevron that also said the same thing--that it is a long way off. \nSo I hope as we move forward on the debate about our energy future, we \ncan be bold and aggressive and that we can provide relief as soon as we \ncan to the citizens of America who are hurting so much, and that we can \nalso take the long-term view in terms of what we need to do to set \nAmerica free.\n  As we look at the potential solutions, we need to look at them in a \nrealistic way in terms of the technology we have available to us and \nthe limitations that we also face as Americans.\n  I thank the Chair for serving as the Presiding Officer and allowing \nme to make these comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6863-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR.

Mr. President, I was saddened to learn that Mrs. Geraldine \nTabor Hall has passed away.\n  Gerry, as her friends called her, was the wife of Judge K.K. Hall, or \nK.K. as his friends called him. She was a retired registered nurse, a \ngreat West Virginian, and a very dear friend. My beloved wife Erma and \nI spent many an evening with the Halls. We would often stay with Gerry \nand Judge Hall when we were in Charleston, and always found her to be a \nmost gracious and generous hostess.\n  Over the years, Gerry and Erma became particularly close. They \nenjoyed each other's company immensely. Maybe it was because they had \nso much in common.\n  Both Gerry and Erma were as elegant as they were ``down home,'' and \nboth were perfect partners to their husbands.\n  Both had a lot to put up with in their husbands, busy public servants \nwhose careers required a great deal from their wives. They were both \npatient, deeply kind, and tremendously devoted to the State of West \nVirginia. Neither ever sought the limelight, but each accepted a \ncertain amount of standing in it.\n  Both Gerry and Erma were supremely good listeners. Judge K.K. Hall \ncould be quite a character. He had a grand sense of humor, and Gerry \nwas always sure to laugh at his stories. And when I delivered a speech \nor performed with a good string band back home, Erma listened \nattentively and nodded along. Both women had heard it all time and \nagain, but there they were, always with their warm smiles, hearty \nlaughs, and steady applause, as if it were the first time.\n  Like Erma, Mrs. Hall was a most gracious host. During my long and \nbitter 1982 Senate election, I recall how often she would answer the \ndoor late at night to find myself and my able assistant during that \ncampaign, Jim Huggins, standing on her porch, expecting to spend the \nnight in the comfort and shelter of the Hall home. This often occurred \nwithout warning, and, not infrequently, very late at night. But Gerry\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\nnever complained, never portrayed the slightest annoyance. She not only \nprovided us with a place to stay for the night, she cooked a solid \nbreakfast for us in the morning, and then would send us on our way to \nour next campaign stop.\n  I will miss this lovely and gracious person.

CON. RES. 70\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, section 312(c) of S. Con. Res. 70, the \n2009 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the section 312(b) discretionary spending limits \nand allocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974 for legislation reported by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee that provides a certain level of funding for fiscal year 2009 \nfor four program integrity initiatives. The initiatives are: continuing \ndisability reviews and supplemental security income redeterminations, \nInternal Revenue Service tax enforcement, health care fraud and abuse \ncontrol, and unemployment insurance improper payment reviews.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 3230, the Departments \nof Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, 2009, on July 8, 2008. That bill contains \nprovisions that fulfill the conditions of section 312(c) for \nadjustments related to continuing disability reviews and supplemental \nsecurity income redeterminations, health care fraud and abuse control, \nand unemployment insurance improper payment reviews.\n  In addition, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 3260, \nthe Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2009, \non July 14, 2008. That bill contains provisions that fulfill the \nconditions of section 312(c) for Internal Revenue Service tax \nenforcement.\n  As a result, for fiscal year 2009, I am revising both the \ndiscretionary spending limits and the allocation to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee for discretionary budget authority and \noutlays. The amount of the adjustment is $968 million in budget \nauthority and $892 million in outlays. The revised discretionary limits \nand allocations for discretionary budget authority and outlays are the \nappropriate levels to be used for enforcement during consideration of \nthe fiscal year 2009 appropriations bills.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con. Res. \n70 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009--S.

Madam President, I was saddened by the news of the death \nof our former colleague, Jesse Helms of North Carolina.\n  He was a man of strong convictions, even if it meant being in \nopposition of his own party. He fought for what he believed, and he \nstood by his word. It was a privilege to work with Senator Helms, even \nthough we disagreed on policy matters, we were able to do what we could \nfor the love of our country.\n  Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to \nthis magnificent Senator and a great American, and a true patriot. He \nwill be missed.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nhonorable colleague, Senator Jesse Helms. North Carolina's longest \nserving popularly elected Senator, Jesse was a good friend and a true \nconservative. I join the entire Nation in mourning his passing.\n  Jesse was born in Monroe, NC on October 18, 1921. He attended Wingate \nUniversity and Wake Forest University and had a successful career in \nnewspapers, first as a sports reporter for The Raleigh Times and later \nas the paper's city news editor. He also served as a recruiter for the \nU.S. Navy during World War II and worked in radio and television.\n  In the 1950s, Helms began to pursue his interest in politics, working \non Willis Smith's U.S. Senate campaign and later in his Senate office. \nHelms also worked on Senator Richard Russell's Presidential campaign \nand I. Beverly Lake, Sr.'s gubernatorial campaign. After these efforts, \nJesse went back to journalism serving as the Capitol Broadcasting \nCompany's executive vice president, vice chairman of the board and \nassistant chief executive officer. From these positions, Jesse gained \nlocal celebrity as a conservative commentator on the Raleigh-based \ntelevision station.\n  His notoriety in the area led to a 4-year position on the Raleigh \nCity Council. Jesse remained at the Capitol Broadcasting Company until \n1972, when he became the first Republican elected to the Senate from \nNorth Carolina in the 20th century. Jesse served North Carolina well as \na chairman of both the Agriculture and Foreign Relations Committees. \nWhile in the Senate, Jesse was a conservative leader who worked \ntirelessly for small government, sound foreign policy and strong \ncommunities.\n  After serving five terms in the U.S. Senate, Jesse retired and \nreturned to North Carolina, where he wrote and published his memoir, \nHere's Where I Stand. He also continued his work with the Jesse Helms \nCenter, a nonprofit organization started in 1987 to promote the \nprinciples Jesse felt so strongly about--democracy, free enterprise and \nstrong values.\n  In my time with Jesse in the Senate, I knew him to be honest, \nhardworking and committed to the people of North Carolina and this \nNation. It is fitting that he passed away on Independence Day, as Jesse \nwas certainly an independent man who loved this country and the values \nfor which it stands.\n  Jesse is loved and will be missed by his wife of 66 years, Dorothy; \nhis son Charles; his two daughters, Jane and Nancy; and seven \ngrandchildren. He was an inspiration to many and will be remembered for \nhis dedication and many contributions to North Carolina and this \nNation. I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring \nthe life of Jesse Helms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6864-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6864-S6866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are \nheartbreaking and touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through energy_prices@crapo .senate.gov to the \nCongressional Record. This is not an issue that\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\nwill be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and \nserious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not \nonly detail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thanks for this opportunity. In short:\n       (1) Increase domestic oil production\n       (2) Expand nuclear energy\n       (3) Reduce the speed limit to 65 mi./hr. This alone saves \n     me 15% on my car fuel consumption and is an immediate \n     reduction in oil usage.\n       (4) Do not use our food supply to produce alcohol for \n     additive to the gasoline. It reduces the gas mileage, is \n     harmful to some of the engine parts and has a large effect on \n     the supply and cost of our food. The site did research on \n     this about 20 years ago, and built a plant around Aberdeen, \n     which to my understanding, was not successful. At least it \n     did not stay in operation very long.\n       I have other ideas on energy policies and savings if you \n     would like to discuss them.\n     Ferrol, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, Thank you for the opportunity to share our \n     concerns over the dependence of foreign oil issues that we \n     currently face.\n       My business partner and I own a small construction company \n     in Meridian. We do new residential construction as well as \n     re-modeling in Meridian, Boise, Nampa, Mountain Home, \n     Horseshoe Bend, Star and other Ada, Canyon, Boise and Elmore \n     county towns. As you mentioned in your letter there is great \n     distance between towns here in the great state of Idaho. Our \n     traveling cost, as well as incurring the fee increases by our \n     sub-contractors and suppliers is moving so high--so fast that \n     a bid to perform work which is normally good for 30 days \n     actually is out of date the next week!\n       We are normally not very political guys, but we have \n     actually been affected to the point that we have started a \n     website along with a petition to Congress to authorize \n     drilling here in America www.DrillforAmericanoil.com went \n     online officially last week (June 13, 2008).\n       We truly appreciate your efforts on our behalf regarding \n     this matter and hope that we can work together as a community \n     and nation to resolve this crisis.\n           Respectfully,\n     Ed and Ed, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       We, our families, have been unable to get together to enjoy \n     ourselves because of the high prices of fuel. I do not \n     understand why we have to pay the same price for fuel as all \n     other countries when we have all of the necessary reserves \n     and fuel available here in this country. Everyone keeps \n     telling us that we have save for future generations, I say \n     baloney to that as let us take care of ourselves first and \n     then if anything is left over, give to the future.\n       Nuclear energy is safe now that we better understand how to \n     use it. Wind power is fine except when the wind is not \n     blowing or solar power when the sun shines. With solar, it \n     won't produce much on a sunny day and nothing for wind power, \n     so we have to buy a lot of very expensive batteries and some \n     means to keep them charged when we do not have the wind or \n     sun. What then?\n     Vern.\n                                  ____\n\n       To Whom It May Concern: The cost of fuel today is really \n     beginning to hurt the Idaho consumer. On the national level, \n     most of us here in Idaho are on the poverty level or at least \n     very close to it, and those of us who are retired it is just \n     double hurt.\n       Most of the people who live in my small community are \n     retired and/or very elderly, and this fuel rip-off is very \n     damaging to us. The elderly are forced to keep their \n     temperatures so low in the winter, and still cannot afford \n     $4+ for our heating oil, so we sit around with blankets in \n     winter.\n       The fuel costs are very hard to handle up here in Nezperce, \n     primarily because we are forced to drive long distances to do \n     our shopping. Another problem is fuel costs are even higher \n     in these small communities than it is in larger towns, so we \n     get a double hit with the cost of fuel.\n       For eight years, conservatives had control of Congress and \n     Senate and they did nothing for the conservative voters. \n     There are many voters that tell me they think they will stay \n     home this November because, quite frankly, they feel it does \n     no good to vote for people who will not help us. We have let \n     a few loud far-left people control the future for all of us, \n     not letting us do in new exploration, or any new fuel ideas \n     etc. The effect of fuel prices is passing off to everything \n     we buy, and everything we do.\n       I could go on forever but to no gain; so, to whom it may \n     concern, if we do not do something soon, all we will do is \n     make all our enemies rich, and bring this nation to its \n     knees.\n     John, Nezperce.\n                                  ____\n\n       Like everyone else in Idaho and around the country, our \n     family is feeling the pinch of higher gas prices, but unlike \n     with price hikes of the past, we, along with our neighbors, \n     are making changes in our driving habits that we hope will, \n     over time, drive down those prices. And that is a good thing. \n     Conservation will do more to make us energy independent than \n     drilling in the last pristine places like ANWR ever will. \n     And, of course, the less fossil fuel we burn, the more we \n     help stave off the effects of climate change.\n       Of course, our family does not like having to dig so deeply \n     into our monthly budget to pay for gas at the pump, but it is \n     our hope that the pinch at the pump will be the motivator \n     that catapults our country to the forefront of alternative \n     energy production. If we can put a man on the moon, we can be \n     the innovators who lead the world toward a clean fuel future. \n     Let us pledge our country's attention, innovation and \n     resources to fund research and development in wind, solar, \n     wave and biomass energy. Nuclear energy, though enticing in \n     some ways, is just a different type of ``dirty fuel'' and \n     creates national security concerns as well. It is like \n     settling for a single when we know we can hit a home run.\n       Thank you,\n     Sara and Dan, Ketchum.\n                                  ____\n\n       We live in a large, rural state where things are not close \n     together and there is limited public transportation. My \n     husband works for the Idaho National Laboratory contractor, \n     Battelle, Inc., in Idaho Falls, which is about 50 miles away. \n     The INL does not provide transportation for workers that do \n     not travel to the ``site'' out in the desert. So he drives \n     100 miles a day to work. He does carpool with three others, \n     but the increase in gas prices has really cut into our \n     budget. We spend approximately $60/week between the two of \n     us. I also work full-time, and we have two children who \n     attend daycare so we need two vehicles.\n       Our car is 14 years old, and our family is rapidly \n     outgrowing it. We would love to buy a new car, but cannot \n     afford to at this time. We are extremely frustrated with the \n     terrible fuel efficiency that larger ``family'' cars get. Our \n     little Toyota Corolla gets 30+ mpg, and we cannot find \n     anything close to that in larger sedans. Why would we want to \n     buy a new car that only gets 17-20 mpg? We are extremely \n     frustrated that we see news reports about hybrids, hydrogen \n     cars, ethanol cars, etc., but no real push to mass produce \n     any of them. Why is not Congress mandating this move? If we \n     can mandate digital TV, why cannot we mandate non-gasoline \n     vehicles and/or ways to improve the efficiency of existing \n     vehicles? Gas prices have affected every aspect of our lives, \n     every bill we get has a notice that it is going up due to \n     increased fuel costs, every grocery item costs more, when \n     does it end? Let us end our dependence on foreign oil and \n     help our environment while we are at it!\n     Heather, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo: Rising fuel costs (gasoline) have caused us \n     to cancel driving trips to Seattle from Coeur d' Alene ($150 \n     fuel cost for one round trip) and a trip to Redding, \n     California, (fuel cost estimate for 750-mile round trip = \n     $150-$160). That is over $300 for fuel to take our usual \n     trips to see our relatives and take a vacation. I cannot \n     imagine the total effect on the economy of driving trips not \n     taken, airline tickets not purchased and hotel bills not \n     incurred multiplied by millions of Americans in just 2008 \n     alone.\n       Hey, Legislators: Let's get going on taking some ACTION to \n     develop our own petroleum resources and escape our dependence \n     on foreign sources!\n     William, Dalton Gardens.\n                                  ____\n\n       Because I am a single woman of 58 and live on a fixed \n     income of about $1,000, I have had to cut back on a lot of \n     things. I live in Franklin County, and I see a liver \n     specialist in Salt Lake City, Utah. Since the gas prices have \n     gotten so outrageous, I have had to cancel my last \n     appointment with my doctor. I have since called him and told \n     him since the gas prices are outrageous; I cannot afford the \n     expense to drive down there for my follow-ups. We have agreed \n     that I will continue taking my tests at Logan Regional and, \n     if my tests show a drastic change, then we will make an \n     appointment, which I hope I can afford the cost. I am on \n     strong doses of steroids and other medications that my \n     specialist has to monitor me as well.\n       I do not go anywhere except to the grocery store, pharmacy, \n     and church and collect my mail. When I have to drive to Logan \n     to take my medical tests, I accumulate what errands I have \n     for that day. I cannot afford to visit my children where one \n     lives in Syracuse, Utah, and the other in Smithfield, Utah. I \n     cannot afford cable, a newspaper, a cell phone or anything.\n       I hope this helps.\n     Joyce, Franklin.\n                                  ____\n\n       I own a staffing service and many of our employees can no \n     longer afford the cost of gas to drive to work. Most of these \n     workers drive older, less efficient gas mileage cars. These \n     workers just squeaked by when gas was at $2.00 per gallon. \n     Now with gas at $4.00, they cannot afford the extra cost. To \n     make ends meet many are forced to borrow money, if they can, \n     from the ``stop and rob payday loan'' outfits; or quit their \n     jobs entirely.\n       Many American Families are being forced to go into debt \n     just to put gas into their cars. These high gas prices cannot \n     be sustained and cannot be tolerated, as they are\n\n[[Page S6866]]\n\n     forcing extreme hardships on American families, especially on \n     low wage earners. These high gas prices are single handedly \n     impoverishing many, many Americans and many in congress have \n     vowed to do nothing about it.\n       If you agree with me and you are tired of congress acting \n     totally inept in this matter, and in letting us down ``big-\n     time'' by not taking the bold decisive steps needed to get us \n     out of this ``out of control'' gas crisis--please sign this \n     petition ``Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less.''\n       Our message to Congress--Its time to stop talking and start \n     acting.\n     Tony.\n                                  ____\n\n       Two years ago, my family and I moved from Sugar City where \n     I grew up, four miles north to a home site where my wife was \n     raised. It is a wonderful location, and we love living there. \n     However, the cost of energy has dramatically affected our \n     lifestyle. Our vehicle fuel consumption has tripled, and our \n     propane expense has more than doubled. Some of the price \n     fluctuation used to be seasonal, but I do not believe the \n     seasonal supplies and demands have much to do with it \n     anymore. As a 43-year-old American living in rural Idaho, I \n     have come to realize how dependent we have become on foreign \n     energy sources, and on personal vehicles for transportation. \n     We can plan better and drive less. We can resolve to drive \n     more fuel-efficient vehicles. We can determine to reduce our \n     food consumption and live more frugally. All of these things \n     we have done, but when it comes right down to it, these \n     changes have not made a drop in the bucket difference. There \n     is no way the average middle-class American can keep up with \n     this over the long run. Rising energy prices will prove to be \n     the single most troublesome factor in our economy. New energy \n     technologies are so bogged down and tied up in committees and \n     environmental quagmires that no action seems to ever take \n     place. In the meantime, the Chinese and other foreign \n     countries are teaching us how to drill for oil right off our \n     own shores in the Gulf of Mexico. Alaska seems to be off \n     limits, which is a joke. Coal-to-oil technologies have not \n     been taken seriously. We have made some progress with wind \n     turbine development, but again, wind energy can help certain \n     regions of our country, but is still a drop in the bucket in \n     relation to our energy consumption. I am disgusted that we \n     did not seriously pursue nuclear energy as a legitimate \n     alternative to fossil fuel 40 years ago. Technology is not \n     the problem; we have that. The problem is it takes so long to \n     tool up for nuclear energy that we will be lucky if our \n     grandchildren can benefit from this tremendously efficient \n     and clean alternative, even if it gains traction over the \n     next couple of years. That is one thing the French have \n     definitely showed us up on. To me, nuclear power is the long \n     term answer to our energy problem--please support it any way \n     you can.\n       One last comment on nuclear power--I was talking to a \n     friend just the other day whose father worked for many years \n     at the INEL. His father told him that we really blew it when \n     we started developing nuclear power by keeping the process \n     such a secret. Start with secrecy, add a few mishaps like \n     Three Mile Island, stir it all together and you have a recipe \n     for paranoia and public distrust. What a shame! We have to \n     get over our fear of nuclear power.\n       I love this country. I have increased my earning potential \n     tremendously and have so many freedoms that I am truly \n     grateful for. But I am very concerned that if we do get very \n     serious about this energy problem right now, my real standard \n     of living, even in the greatest county in the world, will \n     decline. I am not anti-environment; I believe that we can \n     protect the environment in a reasonable manner without \n     shutting off access to our God-given natural resources. We \n     are the stewards of our planet, but I believe it was made for \n     our use, not for us to be subject to it. I have a real \n     problem with the extremely radical vocal minority shutting \n     down all of our options. We have got to get smart and inject \n     a large dose of common sense into this energy equation.\n       Thank You\n     Tim, St. Anthony.\n                                  ____\n\n       Hi, I agree with some of what you are proposing but let us \n     stop making futile arguments here! The only way that I will \n     support more domestic production is if you come up with a \n     plan for more efficiency and conservation along with higher \n     building standards. Our state is hooked on cheap fuels, and \n     it only leads to waste, so I am fine with high energy costs \n     because it will lessen our carbon impact on the earth and we \n     will get more creative. Cheap fuel is a thing of the past, \n     and if we do not use the energy that we do have to prepare \n     for the future, I will never support you and will resent your \n     ignorance. Let us see a solid plan backed up with solid \n     implementation!\n     Jim, McCall.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, [I would like to know if the] question \n     of oil speculators [is being addressed]. Speculators are the \n     ones primarily driving up the prices and not so much the oil \n     companies or the oil producing nations. We did address \n     refineries, and exploration and drilling. Clearly the \n     American people and, indeed, citizens of other nations are \n     suffering because of these speculators. It is rather like my \n     grandparents told me about the stock market crash of 1929 \n     when margin buying endangered the entire financial structure \n     of the world. Can Congress force the commodities speculators \n     to put down more than the 5% they now use for their \n     speculations? It would seem that if they had to put up 50% or \n     better, they would be a little more cautious in their \n     ``gambling''.\n       Thank you for your time.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rochelle.\n                                  ____\n\n       Both my wife and I are retired government employees on \n     fixed incomes so we watch our P's and Q's very closely. In \n     spite of our cautious spending practices we have found \n     ourselves unwilling victims of the gas crunch.\n       Here is how we got caught. Our son graduated from college, \n     owing substantially for money loaned to get through four \n     years of very expensive educational expenses. He has sought \n     out and found employment but not enough to pay back his \n     accumulated debt. His monthly income is not at all what he \n     had expected he might be able to get as a college graduate. \n     Currently my son continues to work and at the same time looks \n     for a better paying position . . . Here is where the gas \n     prices come into play: He is living/working in Eugene, \n     Oregon, and attempting to move into a higher-paying position \n     in Portland, Oregon. He has been traveling back and forth to \n     interview for jobs. One trip up and back in his older model \n     vehicle costs him about $60 in gas. On his salary, he cannot \n     afford to make the trip in search of better employment. He is \n     in fact a prisoner of the gas prices unable to travel to \n     further himself financially.\n       As a consequence, he has had to get extensions on his \n     federal educational loan (not a good thing for the \n     government), which continues to charge him interest for the \n     unpaid balance. He is really stuck.\n       We are also stuck because there was an additional $8,000 \n     loan obtained that was not through the federal government, \n     which cannot be put on hold and must be paid now. So, here we \n     are putting out about $200 per month to cover his debt, money \n     we could really use as retired persons.\n       The short of it is he is in a bind and we are in a bind. \n     Gas prices have handicapped him and imposed unnecessary \n     expenses on us. I think everybody is coming up short here \n     including the federal government.\n     Jim and Lola.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Sen. Crapo, From $20 to $48 to fill up my car tank. I \n     think that says it all.\n       Polling data indicates that the majority of people want us \n     to drill for our own oil. I want us to drill for our own oil.\n       I believe that the only reason the Arabs said they would \n     increase the amount of oil that they produce is because they \n     became concerned that we might actually begin drilling our \n     own, and they wouldn't want that.\n       Please, Senator Crapo, we are so tired of living under the \n     EPA's thumb. I urge you and Senator Craig to do whatever it \n     takes so that our oil companies can start producing again.\n           Sincerely,\n     Judy, Burley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6866-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6866-S6867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              HONORING R.C. NORTH PLUMBING & HEATING INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, at a time when people from my home \nState of Maine and throughout the Nation are struggling to cope with an \nunrelenting climb in energy prices, I rise today to recognize a small \nbusiness that sells innovative, technological solutions to families and \nenterprises in Southern and Central Maine. R.C. North Plumbing & \nHeating Inc. of Naples provides energy-efficient heating and cooling \nequipment and expertise, which, in turn, enables Mainers to save money \nand decrease their energy consumption.\n  R.C. North Plumbing & Heating Inc., though less than 5 years old, \noffers years of technical experience in residential heating, cooling, \nand plumbing, which helps its customers remain confident that their \nheating and cooling systems are operating at maximum efficiency, \nthereby saving water, energy, and ultimately money. Furthermore, many \nof the products that R.C. North sells and installs are designated \nENERGY STAR products by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe U.S. Department of Energy because of their energy efficiency.\n  In addition to providing traditional heating and plumbing services, \nR.C. North has a burgeoning solar division that offers customers \ntechnologies to convert the Sun's power into a safe and reliable energy \nsource for heating water. Additionally, R.C. North participates in the \nMaine Solar Energy Rebate Program, founded in 2005, to encourage the \ngrowth of solar energy in Maine by providing rebates to individuals who \npurchase solar energy systems. The firm is also certified by the Maine \nPublic Utilities Commission as an installer of solar thermal heating \nsystems.\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\n  Featured on OurMaine Homes, a local television program highlighting \nlocal businesses in the construction and home maintenance industry, \nR.C. North has received praise from fellow contractors and customers \nalike. The business is also an active member of the State of Maine \nPlumbing Heating Cooling Contractors Association and is engaged in the \ncommunity as a member of the Sebago Lakes Region Chamber of Commerce.\n  Last month, Senator Kerry and I held a hearing in the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship that focused on the \ndevastating impacts that the rising price of home heating oil is having \non homes and small businesses. During that hearing, what has long been \napparent was reiterated for all to hear--namely, that without a \nproactive approach to stem this crisis and achieve real results, the \nunmistakable tsunami that is heading for Maine as winter approaches \nwill be far worse than we have seen. The American people have come to \nrecognize this fact, and companies such as R.C. North Plumbing & \nHeating have filled the demand that Americans have for energy-efficient \nheating and cooling systems. The company's foresight and persistence in \nleading Maine's development of solar heating is commendable. I thank \neveryone at R.C. North for their dedication, and wish them success in \ncontinuing to broaden Maine's exposure to energy efficiency as well as \nalternative forms of energy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6867-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING JON GARREY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Local veterans were invited by the auxiliary which \npublicized the event, registered guests, decorated the school, helped \nserve lunch, and organized the event with school personnel.\n  The Kampeska Marine Corps League presented and retired the colors. \nThe Henry School Band, directed by Mrs. Deanna Martens, played \npatriotic music. Students sang ``Proud of Our Veterans'' and gave a \n``Living Flag'' presentation. Superintendent Brian Sieh welcomed all \nand presented the guest speaker, Army National Guard Chaplain Joseph \nHolzhauser, who addressed the crowd on the topic, ``Why All The \nFighting?''\n  Voice of Democracy winner, student Shantel Gassman, presented her \nwinning essay and was awarded a plaque and a scholarship from Watertown \nVeterans of Foreign Wars Commander Duwayne Mack. Students Matthew Harms \nand Owen Redinger gave a proper flag folding demonstration and \npresented the flag to the guest speaker.\n  The Henry High School choir sang ``God Bless America'' and students \nRandy Owen and Sarah Montgomery played echo taps. A flag retirement \nceremony followed the program under the direction of Marine veteran \nJoel Montgomery.\n  The school technology committee took pictures of all veterans and \ngave prints to each as a thank you. The pictures were taken in front of \na mural that senior students and auxiliary member Jane Green created. \nIt depicts the American eagle with wings made of over 200 stars, each \nnaming a local veteran.\n  Auxiliary members who helped with the activities include Donna Clyde, \nunit president; Veta Aker, unit treasurer; Jean Lian, unit chaplain; \nWanda Clyde, membership chairman; Christy Clyde, junior auxiliary \nmember; Jane Green, unit member and school coordinator for the program. \nViolet Wicks, district III president, was the auxiliary's guest for the \nday.\n  It gives me great pleasure to rise with the Heath-Headley American \nLegion Auxiliary Post No. 0199 and Henry School to thank our veterans \nfor their dedication and service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6867-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       125TH ANNIVERSARY OF SULLY COUNTY AND ONIDA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe national emergency and related measures dealing with the former \nLiberian regime of Charles Taylor are to continue in effect beyond July \n22, 2008.\n  Today, Liberia continues its peaceful transition to a democratic \norder under the administration of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. The \nGovernment of Liberia has implemented reforms that have allowed for the \nremoval of international sanctions on Liberian timber and diamonds, and \nLiberia is participating in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme \nand the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative to ensure that \nits natural resources are used to benefit the people and country of \nLiberia, rather than to fuel conflict. Charles Taylor is standing trial \nin The Hague by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. However, stability \nin Liberia is still fragile.\n  The regulations implementing Executive Order 13348 clarify that the \nsubject of this national emergency has been and remains limited to the \nformer Liberian regime of Charles Taylor and specified other persons \nand not the country, citizens, Government, or Central Bank of Liberia.\n  The actions and policies of former Liberian President Charles Taylor \nand other persons--in particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian \nresources, their trafficking in illegal arms, and their formation of \nirregular militia--continue to undermine Liberia's transition to \ndemocracy and the orderly development of its political, administrative, \nand economic institutions and resources. These actions and policies \npose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the \nUnited States, and for these reasons, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to\n\n[[Page S6868]]\n\ncontinue the national emergency with respect to the former Liberian \nregime of Charles Taylor.\n                                                      George W.

Such \nbilateral agreements provide for limited coordination between the \nUnited States and foreign social security systems to eliminate dual \nsocial security coverage and taxation, and to help prevent the lost \nbenefit protection that can occur when workers divide their careers \nbetween two countries. The United States-Poland Agreement contains all \nprovisions mandated by section 233 and other provisions that I deem \nappropriate to carry out the purposes of section 233, pursuant to \nsection 233(c)(4).\n  I also transmit for the information of the Congress a report prepared \nby the Social Security Administration explaining the key points of the \nAgreement, along with a paragraph-by-paragraph explanation of the \nprovisions of the principal agreement and the related administrative \narrangement.

A bill to require the Secretary of Commerce to establish an \naward program to honor achievements in nanotechnology, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, to introduce the Nanotechnology \nInnovation and Prize Competition Act.\n  As Co-Chair of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus, and former \nChair of the Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Innovation, I \nhave worked long and hard to advance U.S. competitiveness in \nnanotechnology. Nanotech is a rapidly developing field that offers a \nwide range of benefits to the country. It can create jobs, expand the \neconomy, and strengthen America's position as a global leader in \ntechnological innovation.\n  Nanotechnology will redefine the global economy and revolutionize it \nwith an amazing array of technological innovation. There is virtually \nno industry that will not be impacted by the advances we know are \npossible with nanotechnology. But to unlock the full benefits of \nnanotechnology's capabilities, the Federal Government must do more to \npartner with our Nation's innovative entrepreneurs, engineers, and \nscientists. To that end, I am proposing, along with Senator Snowe, \nlegislation that will create an X-Prize competition in nanotechnology.\n  Many people have heard of the X-Prize, a recent and high-profile \nexample of a prize competition like the one Senator Snowe and I are \nproposing today. The X-Prize was established in 1996 and set up a $10 \nmillion prize fund for the first team who could make civilian space \nflight a reality. The award was successfully claimed just 8 years \nlater. But that wasn't the only achievement the X-Prize accomplished. \nDuring that span of time, the $10 million prize stimulated over $100 \nmillion in research and development by the competitors.\n  Successful prize competitions are not limited to the X-Prize. We have \nseen the value of these kinds of competitions before. One of the most \nfamous was the Orteig prize, which was to be awarded to the first \nperson to fly nonstop across the Atlantic Ocean. Claimed, of course, by \nCharles Lindberg in 1927, the Orteig prize stimulated private \ninvestment 16 times greater than the amount of the prize. Imagine what \nkind of explosion in investment and innovation we could achieve in \nnanotechnology with the competition we're proposing today.\n  By establishing this nanotechnology prize competition, the Federal \nGovernment will promote public-private cooperation to accelerate \ninvestment in key areas and help solve critical problems. The very \nfirst prize competition was, in fact, a Government-sponsored \ncompetition that produced a revolutionary technological breakthrough. \nIn 17l4, the British Parliament established a prize for determining a \nship's longitude at sea. At the time, the inability to accurately \ndetermine longitude was causing many ships to become lost. Solving this \ncritical problem by creating a competition to find the answer paved the \nway to British naval superiority.\n  Today, other Government-sponsored prize competitions are driving \ntechnological breakthroughs and successes For example, the DARPA Grand \nChallenge and Urban Challenge have stimulated tremendous advances in \nremotely-controlled vehicle technology.\n  The Nanotechnology Innovation and Prize Competition Act is a vital \ntool to help ensure that public and private resources will be utilized \nin a coordinated way and will be devoted to solving the complex and \npressing problems that America faces today. This bill will also spur \ntechnological investment and create jobs here at home. Through this \nprize competition, the Government will be able to leverage its \nresources and focus the intellectual and economic capacity of our \nNation's best and brightest entrepreneurs on finding the big answers we \nneed in the smallest of technologies--nanotechnology.\n  The Nanotechnology Innovation and Prize Competition Act creates four \npriority areas for the establishment of prize competitions: green \nnanotechnology, alternative energy applications, improvements in human \nhealth, and the commercialization of consumer products. In each of \nthese areas, nanotechnology holds the promise of tremendous \nbreakthroughs if the necessary resources are devoted. This competition \nwill make sure we get started as soon as possible on finding those \nbreakthroughs. We all know that the competitive spirit is one of the \nstrengths of our country. This bill will ignite that spirit in \nnanotech.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Maine for her help and cooperation \nin introducing this bill. I also want to thank the Woodrow Wilson \nCenter and the X-Prize Foundation for their work in helping to develop \nthis bill. I look forward to working with the Commerce Committee, other \nmembers of the Congressional Nanotechnology Caucus, the administration \nand the entire nanotech community to pass the nanotechnology \nreauthorization bill.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support innovation and promote \nentrepreneurial competition by cosponsoring this legislation.\n\n[[Page S6871]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3269\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the definition of commercial motor vehicle \nin section 31101 of title 49, United States Code, to exclude certain \nfarm vehicles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that addresses a \nproblem faced by a number of farmers in my State of Oklahoma and around \nthe country when they drive their goods across State lines. Even though \nthese farmers' trucks are within the weight limits set by their home \nStates and the States to which they are traveling, they are triggering \nan arbitrary Federal weight regulation when they cross State lines in \ntheir farm vehicles. As a result, they are being ticketed and generally \ninconvenienced.\n  This issue has caused quite a stir in Oklahoma, and many are \nproposing solutions to address the problem. For example, two of my \nOklahoma colleagues in the House of Representatives introduced a bill \nlast year that proposes one solution. The president of the Oklahoma \nFarm Bureau, Mike Spradling, discussed a number of options when he \ntestified last week on this issue in front of the House Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure. I met today with Ray Wulf, president \nof the American Farmers and Ranchers Association, and his colleagues \nwho also expressed ideas on how best to resolve this problem.\n  Today, I am furthering the debate with a solution that is both \ncommon-sense and achievable.\n  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration defines a commercial \nmotor vehicle, CMV, as a vehicle which has a gross vehicle weight \nrating or a gross combination weight rating of at least 10,001 pounds. \nHowever, States are allowed to exempt vehicles up to 26,001 pounds from \nthe CMV determination if they are engaged solely in intrastate \ncommerce. Farmers can cross State lines within 150 miles of their farms \nif the States have a reciprocity agreement. However, not all States \nhave these agreements.\n  Once a farmer drives his truck into a State with which his home State \ndoes not have a reciprocity agreement, the 10,001 pound definition for \na commercial motor vehicle kicks in and the farmer is then responsible \nfor all of requirements of an operator of a commercial motor carrier. \nThis is the case even if the States from which and to which the farmer \nis traveling each have weight exemptions for farm vehicles.\n  To illustrate this situation, consider the following example. An \nOklahoma farmer lives ten miles from the Kansas border. He loads up his \ntrailer with grain in order to transport his crop to the nearest grain \nelevator, which is across the State border in Kansas. Both Oklahoma and \nKansas allow trucks to weigh up to 26,001 pounds for intrastate \ncommerce. However, the States do not have a reciprocity agreement.\n  This farmer's truck weighs 24,000 pounds. Therefore, as long as he \ncomplies with the laws concerning farm vehicles in the State of \nOklahoma, he is able to drive within the State without meeting all of \nthe requirements of a commercial motor carrier. Likewise, if he lived \nin Kansas, he would be able to drive within the State without meeting \nCMV requirements.\n  Unfortunately, as soon as this farmer drives across the border from \nOklahoma into Kansas--and becomes subject to the Federal laws for \ninterstate commerce--his truck is considered a commercial motor vehicle \nbecause it weighs more than 10,001 pounds.\n   When a truck is considered a commercial motor vehicle, the driver \nmust comply with the Federal requirements of a professional truck \ndriver. These requirements include possessing a commercial driver's \nlicense and medical examination certificate, having Department of \nTransportation markings on\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\nthe vehicle, documenting hours of service, and becoming subject to \ncontrolled substance and alcohol testing. While these requirements \nserve important purposes for long-haul truck drivers, they are \nunnecessary for farmers who carry these loads only a few times a year.\n   After hearing from many farmers in Oklahoma who are frustrated by \nthis seemingly illogical Federal regulation, today I am proposing \nlegislation to make it so the Federal commercial motor vehicle \ndefinition of 10,001 pounds does not automatically apply when a farm \nvehicle crosses State lines. Instead, my bill states that the weight \ndefinition for a commercial motor vehicle for agricultural purposes is \nthe weight as defined by the State in which the vehicle is being \noperated.\n  Currently, 32 States define a commercial motor vehicle as weighing \n26,001 pounds or more. Under my bill, farmers will be able to drive \nbetween those States, like Oklahoma and Kansas, without triggering the \nFederal CMV definition of 10,001 pounds for interstate commerce and \ngetting ticketed for a weight violation.\n  The second section of my bill states that the Department of \nTransportation cannot withhold grant money from States that choose to \nraise their weight limits above 10,001 pounds up to 26,001 pounds. If \nmy bill passes, States with lower weight definitions may desire to \nincrease them. This section will erase the concern that they may lose \ngrant funding from DOT.\n  This bill is an effort to relieve American farmers from undue burdens \nand regulations when they transport their crops or livestock from one \nplace to another. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nSenate and House to provide relief to farmers on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3271\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE.\n\n       Section 31101(1)(A) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(A)(i) except for vehicles described in clause (ii), has \n     a gross vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight of at \n     least 10,001 pounds; or\n       ``(ii) is primarily engaged in the transportation of \n     agricultural commodities or farm supplies and has a gross \n     vehicle weight rating or gross vehicle weight of at least the \n     minimum weight of a commercial motor vehicle (as defined by \n     the State in which it is being operated);''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PRESERVATION OF GRANTS FOR STATES THAT INCREASE THE \n                   MINIMUM WEIGHT FOR COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLES.\n\n       Section 31102 of title 49, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Preservation of Grants for States That Increase the \n     Minimum Weight for Commercial Motor Vehicles.--The Secretary \n     may not withhold grant funding from a State under this \n     section solely because the State authorizes drivers of \n     vehicles engaged in the transportation of agricultural \n     commodities or farm supplies that have a gross vehicle weight \n     of more than 10,000 pounds and less than 26,001 pounds, to \n     operate without complying with Federal regulations relating \n     to commercial motor vehicles.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 3272. A bill to make emergency supplemental appropriations for the \nNational Institutes of Health for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2008, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the bill that Senator Harkin and I are \nintroducing today would provide an additional $5.2 billion in fiscal \nyear 2008 for the National Institutes of Health--$1.2 billion for the \nNational Cancer Institute and $4 billion for other NIH institutes.\n  The increases that the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nSubcommittee has provided over the past 20-30 years have dramatically \nimproved the survival rates for many diseases--deaths from coronary \nartery disease declined by 18 percent between 1994 and 2004, stroke \ndeaths also fell by 24.2 percent during that same time period. The 5-\nyear survival rates for Hodgkin's lymphoma have increased from 40 \npercent in the 1960s to more than 86 percent today. Survival rates for \nlocalized breast cancer have increased from 80 percent in the 1950s to \n98 percent today. Over the past 25 years, survival rates for prostate \ncancer have increased from 69 percent to nearly 99 percent. So we are \nseeing real progress. But for many other maladies, the statistics are \nnot so good.\n  The remarkable medical advances we have seen thus far did not happen \novernight. It takes a sustained commitment of time, effort and money \nfor research institutions to train and recruit scientists skilled in \nthe latest research techniques, and to develop the costly \ninfrastructure where research takes place. Over the past several years \nSenator Harkin and I have worked hard to find ways to increase NIH \nfunding. We have offered amendments to budget resolutions, encouraged \nour colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to increase the \nsubcommittee's allocation, and undertook what some would call creative \nbudgeting to make more resources available for NIH. As scientists, \ndoctors, and patients can attest, these efforts have paid off; these \nfunding increases have been instrumental in realizing the medical \nbreakthroughs we are experiencing today.\n  The $875,000,000 increase for NIH approved recently by the \nAppropriations Committee is a step in the right direction, but it falls \nfar short of the billions needed to make up lost ground and revitalize \nmedical research in this country. Regrettably, Federal funding for NIH \nhas steadily declined from the $3.8 billion increase provided in 2003--\nwhen the 5-year doubling of NIH was completed--to only $328 million in \nfiscal year 2008. Beginning in 2004--if we would have sustained \nincreases of $3.5 billion per year, plus inflation--we would have $23 \nbillion more in funding for today. The shortfall in the President's \nfiscal year 2009 budget due to inflationary costs alone is $5.2 \nbillion. This funding decline has disrupted the flow of research \nprogress, not just for today, but for years to come. The problem is \nthat an entire generation of research scientists is being discouraged \nfrom going into the field of medical research, due to a lack of NIH \nresearch grants. This breach in Federal support, if it continues, will \nfurther slow on-going research and hamper the ability to fund new \nresearch opportunities for the future.\n  The legislation that Senator Harkin and I are introducing today would \nprovide an immediate infusion of new research dollars, and while it \nwill only make up the $5.2 billion inflationary costs--it is a good \nstarting point. The $1.2 billion contained in this bill for the \nNational Cancer Institute is consistent with the Institute's \nprofessional judgment budget and the recent recommendations of the \ncancer research community.\n  On June 6, 2008, I wrote to Ms. Nancy Brinker, Founder of the Susan \nG. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation; Dr. Richard Schilsky, American \nSociety of Clinical Oncology; Ms. Ellen Stovall, President and CEO, \nNational Coalition for Cancer Survivorship; Dr. Raymond Dubois, \nPresident, American Association for Cancer Research; Mr. Lance \nArmstrong, Lance Armstrong Foundation; and Dr. Ellen Sigal, \nChairperson, Friends of Cancer Research and asked for their estimate \nand timeline on conquering cancer. Their reply was $335 billion or \napproximately $22 billion a year over the next 15 years.\n  While that may seem like a staggering amount of money, it pales in \ncomparison to the savings research breakthroughs would produce in terms \nof lower health care costs and caregiver expenses, savings to business \nand the nation's overall economy.\n  Senator Harkin and I, along with Senator Kennedy and Hutchison are \nlooking for ways to provide not just the $5.2 billion contained in the \nlegislation that we are introducing today, but to provide the billions \nof dollars needed for treatment and cures.\n  The partnership that Tom Harkin and I have had since 1989 is solid \nand together we will find a way to increase this nation's investment in \nbiomedical research.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\n                                S. 3272\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``NIH Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       That the following sums are appropriated, out of any money \n     in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, \n     namely:\n       (1) For an additional amount for the ``Office of the \n     Director, National Institutes of Health'', $4,000,000,000 \n     which shall be transferred to the Institutes and Centers of \n     the National Institutes of Health to be used to support \n     additional scientific research.\n       (2) For an additional amount for the National Cancer \n     Institute, $1,200,000,000 to be used to support additional \n     scientific research.\n\n     SEC. 3. GENERAL PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) Availability of Funds.--No part of the appropriation \n     contained in this Act shall remain available for obligation \n     beyond the current fiscal year.\n       (b) Emergency Designation.--Amounts in this Act are \n     designated as emergency requirements pursuant to section 402 \n     of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), and pursuant to section \n     501 of H. Con. Res. 376 (109th Congress) as made applicable \n     to the House of Representatives by section 511(a)(4) of H. \n     Res. 6 (110th Congress).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. \n        Hagel):\n  S. 3273. A bill to promote the international deployment of clean \ntechnology, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, with every new scientific report, the \nthreat of global climate change becomes clearer. With every new \neconomic report, the energy needs of developing countries continue to \ngrow as millions of their citizens move out of poverty.\n  From the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, we here in the \nUnited States, along with the other industrial nations, grew our \neconomies using cheap energy, building up the stock of greenhouse gases \nnow in our atmosphere. But, today, even as we try to maintain economic \ngrowth with lower emissions, developing nations threaten to overwhelm \nany gains we can make in the fight against climate change.\n  No matter what we in the U.S. do about our own energy use, the \ndeveloping world's demand for energy--in its cheapest form, from fossil \nfuels--will continue to rise. That would be a disaster. According to \nthe International Energy Agency, by 2030 energy demand worldwide will \nincrease by 55 percent, and nearly 80 percent of this rise will be in \ndeveloping countries.\n  To address the threat of climate change, we must steer those \ncountries onto a path of cleaner energy and cleaner development. It is \nin our national interest to reduce the environmental, economic, and \nnational security threat of a changed global climate. But this is not \njust about avoiding threats. This can be an opportunity for the U.S. to \ncapture the markets of the future, the next generation of clean power \ntechnologies.\n  That is why I am joining today with Senators Lugar, Menendez, and \nHagel to introduce legislation to create an International Clean \nTechnology Deployment Fund. This fund will be available to promote the \ninternational deployment of U.S. technology as a new component to our \noverall international economic development assistance. By supporting \nthe market for that technology, it can help to stimulate research, \ninvestment, and job creation in industries with the potential for long-\nterm growth. This can be a win for the planet and a win for our \neconomy.\n  From its beginning in 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change has called for mechanisms whereby the developed, \nindustrialized nations can provide the means for developing nations to \nreduce their greenhouse gas emissions. As recently as the last major \nmeeting of the parties to that convention at Bali last December, that \nprinciple was reiterated as part of the Bali Action Plan.\n  In a similar vein, when President Bush submitted his budget earlier \nthis year, he called for funding to support U.S. participation in a \nClean Technology Fund, to be housed at the World Bank. That is one \napproach for which the resources our legislation authorizes could be \nused. Our allies, including Great Britain, and Japan, are among other \ndonors interested in the establishment of that fund, whose goals are \nsimilar to those of the legislation we are introducing today.\n  The purpose of our legislation is, and I quote, ``to promote and \nleverage private financing for the development and international \ndeployment of technologies that will contribute to sustainable economic \ngrowth and the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \natmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \ninterference with the climate system.''\n  An important goal of our legislation is to add the consideration of \nclimate change more consistently and systematically to our foreign \nassistance strategy. The majority of greenhouse gas emissions in the \nfuture will be coming from the developing countries of the world. The \nchoice is simple--we can ignore the climate impact of our assistance \nprograms, or we can move those programs into a comprehensive strategy \nof clean economic development.\n  In this legislation, we establish an International Clean Technology \nDeployment Fund, to support the export of U.S. clean energy technology \nand expertise to developing nations. The Fund will be administered by a \nBoard composed of relevant executive branch officials. They are \nauthorized to distribute money in a number of ways, provided certain \ntriggers are met. These ways include through multilateral trust funds, \nbilateral initiatives, existing U.S. programs such as USAID and \ntechnical assistance programs.\n  Funds can only go to eligible countries. A country, to be eligible, \nfirst must be a developing country. More importantly, it must take on \nits own climate change commitments, either through an international \nagreement to which the U.S. is a party, or by taking on what the Board \ncertifies are sufficient binding national commitments. Additionally, \nevery distribution of funding will require prior congressional \nnotification.\n  Our bipartisan coalition, in consultation with many interested \ngroups, worked to achieve a structure that will ensure that we have a \nrange of options to help developing countries grow on a cleaner path, \nbut still achieve real reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The Bali Action Plan, which the U.S. agreed to last December, sets \nthe goal of reaching a new global agreement by December 2009, when \nparties will meet in Copenhagen. This is an ambitious schedule, made \nmore complicated by our election schedule here at home.\n  With the time so short, it is our hope that this bill will begin to \naddress some part of the Bali Action Plan, which includes support for \ndeveloping countries in addressing technology deployment, adaptation, \nand deforestation. Our legislation addresses just one part of that \nframework, but it is an important one.\n  It can put the developing countries on a path of clean, sustainable \neconomic growth, protect us and our children from the economic and \nsecurity threats of global climate change, and help us create the \nindustries and jobs of the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 3276. A bill to provide for the application of sections 552, 552a, \nand 552b of title 5, United States Code, (commonly referred to as the \nFreedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act) and the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) to the Smithsonian Institution, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Smithsonian Institution is an \nimportant icon to many Americans. It houses treasures of our national \nhistory in its museums across the country. The Smithsonian Institution \nis not just a museum but also an educational institution and a research \ncomplex. It consists of 19 museums and galleries, 9 research \nfacilities, and has 144 affiliated museums around the world. The \nSmithsonian manages this vast array of facilities and receives 70 \npercent of its funding directly from the federal government through \ncongressional appropriations. There is no debate that the Smithsonian \nis an important part of our country.\n  However, over the last few years I have been critical of the \nmanagement\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\nof the Smithsonian Institution, beginning with story after story \ndetailing the ``Champagne lifestyle'' the former Secretary of the \nSmithsonian enjoyed at institution expense. Through my oversight of the \nSmithsonian as a tax-exempt entity, and investigative reporting by the \nWashington Post, other egregious examples have emerged. These \nrevelations have detailed the Smithsonian's management failures and lax \naccountability over the spending of millions of institution dollars.\n  The former secretary spent millions of institution dollars on the \nredecoration of his office, housing allowances, and household expenses \nincluding chandelier cleaning and a new heater pump for his lap pool. \nHe and his wife enjoyed first-class plane travel and top hotels.\n  Ultimately, Secretary Small resigned on March 26, 2007.\n  The deputy secretary and chief operating officer of the Smithsonian \nInstitution, announced her resignation on June 18, 2007, after earning \nmore than $1.2 million in 6 years for outside duties, including highly \ncompensated seats on corporate boards, and that she and other top \nexecutives were frequently absent from their Smithsonian duties.\n  An independent management report released in June 2007 concluded that \nSmithsonian leaders took extraordinary measures to keep secret top \nexecutives' compensation, expense-account spending, ethical missteps, \nand management failures.\n  In August 2007, the Smithsonian replaced Gary M. Beer as chief \nexecutive of Smithsonian Business Ventures after an inspector general's \nreport found he had abused his institution-issued credit card and \nbilled thousands of dollars in expenditures that were unauthorized or \nlacked evidence of a business purpose.\n  In December 2007, W. Richard West, Jr., who was the founding director \nof the National Museum of the American Indian, retired after \ndisclosures that he spent extensive time away from the museum and spent \nmore than $250,000 in 4 years on trips to places including Paris, \nVenice, Singapore, and Indonesia.\n  In February 2008, Pilar O'Leary, the head of the Smithsonian Latino \nCenter, resigned after an internal investigation found that she \nviolated a variety of rules and ethics policies by abusing her expense \naccount, trying to steer a contract to a friend and soliciting free \ntickets for fashion shows, concerts, and music award ceremonies. \nUltimately, the Smithsonian Inspector General concluded that there were \n14 violations of ethical and conflict of interest policies. The public \ndid not learn of the reason for her resignation until April 15, 2008, \nwhen the Washington Post published a story after requesting under the \nFreedom of Information Act and ultimately receiving a heavily redacted \ncopy of the Smithsonian Inspector General's report on Ms. O'Leary.\n  When Ms. O'Leary's resignation was announced to Smithsonian staff, \nthe Smithsonian's official e-mail did not mention ethical lapses and in \nfact praised her work.\n  Only upon the specter of public disclosure did the Smithsonian's \nacting secretary say in a second e-mail to staff that O'Leary had \n``engaged in behavior that violated our Standards of Conduct and other \nSmithsonian policies between August 2005 and September 2007.''\n  The acting secretary at the time said such reports from the Inspector \nGeneral were not always public, but Smithsonian officials determined \nO'Leary ``held a position of such significant responsibility and public \nvisibility that disclosure . . . was warranted.''\n  This raises a series of disturbing questions. What if a Post reporter \nhad not somehow learned of the O'Leary report and formally asked the \nSmithsonian for a copy? Would the circumstances of Ms. O'Leary's \nresignation ever have seen the light of day? Once the report was \nreleased in a redacted form, was it appropriately redacted or was it \nredacted beyond what is reasonable to protect the privacy of third \nparties? Does the Smithsonian withhold other potentially embarrassing \nreports? If the individual had not been the head of a Smithsonian \nagency, and had a lower stature, would the report ever have been \ndisclosed in any form?\n  If the past is prologue, probably not. The Smithsonian points out \nthat it is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.\n  Many people would naturally think that the Smithsonian is subject to \nFOIA and must comply with requests. I know that I believed it was, \nespecially given that taxpayer funds make up 70 percent of its budget. \nHowever, because the creation of the Smithsonian was different than the \ncreation of other Federal Government agencies, there is an open \nquestion as to what open government and good governance statutes apply \nto the Smithsonian. For example, the Smithsonian's own website states, \n``The Smithsonian Institution is not an executive branch agency and is \nnot required by statute to provide documents to the public.'' However, \nthe Smithsonian does state that it is guided by ``internal policy, and \nby FOIA and other relevant law'' when providing documents to the \npublic. What this highly technical answer means is that the Smithsonian \ndoesn't believe it is required to respond under FOIA but it will as \nlong as its interests are in line with the release.\n\n  The legal status of the Smithsonian is also an open question with the \nprevailing law finding that for purposes of the Privacy Act and FOIA, \nthe Smithsonian is not a government ``agency'' subject to the \nrequirements. Instead, the Smithsonian calls itself a ``trust \ninstrumentality of the United States.'' However, the Smithsonian takes \na different position when it is faced with a lawsuit filed under the \nFederal Tort Claims Act and considers itself a ``federal agency.'' \nTaken together, these decisions have given the Smithsonian the best of \nboth worlds--they are a government entity when information is sought \nthat could embarrass them, but when they are sued, they get all the \ndefenses of a government entity.\n  In light of the oversight findings and the many scandals that have \nraised questions about accountability and mismanagement at the \nSmithsonian, I'm introducing the Open and Transparent Smithsonian Act \nof 2008. This bill simply states that for the purposes of FOIA, the \nPrivacy Act, and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Smithsonian \nshall be considered a Federal Government agency. This is a simple, \nstraightforward way to bring transparency and accountability to the \nSmithsonian without expending additional Federal resources. This is \nespecially important given that the Smithsonian received continual \nincreases in congressional appropriations from fiscal years 1999-2008, \nnow totaling $682 million in taxpayer dollars for fiscal year 2008.\n  On July 1, Wayne Clough took over as only the 12th secretary in \nSmithsonian history. He comes at a critical juncture. Will the \nSmithsonian recover from a series of scandals and regain its sterling \nreputation? Or will it backslide into bad old habits that could lead to \nmore scandals?\n  The new secretary deserves the best possible chance to succeed. One \nof the best tools Congress can give him is a clear, definitive \nstatement through legislative action that the Freedom of Information \nAct does indeed apply to the Institution, and that the Smithsonian's \nbusiness is the people's business.\n  In addition to adding the Smithsonian to FOIA and Privacy Act, \nsection 3 of this bill includes another important transparency fix to \nthe Privacy Act. Currently, the Privacy Act provides that disclosure of \ninformation by a government agency is limited unless an enumerated \nexception applies. One of the most widely used exceptions allows for \nthe disclosure of information to ``either House of Congress, or, to the \nextent of matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee \nthereof.'' However, the Department of Justice has interpreted this to \nonly allow for disclosures to chairmen of committees, excluding \ninformation from ranking minority members.\n\n  In a December 2001 letter opinion, the Department of Justice \nconcluded, ``the Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of Privacy Act-\nprotected information to the ranking minority member.'' The rationale \nfor this decision was that longstanding executive branch practice on \nthis question shows that ``ranking minority members are not authorized \nto make committee requests.'' This opinion clearly looks past the plain \nlanguage of the statute that says that the exception applies to \n``either House\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\nof Congress or to the extent of matter within its jurisdiction, any \ncommittee or subcommittee thereof.'' This interpretation clearly \nbypasses the inclusion of the word ``or'' and instead reads that \nCongress only intended it to apply to committee chairman. Conveniently, \nthis opinion has been repeatedly used to block information requested \nfrom ranking members.\n  Section 3 of the bill corrects this erroneous interpretation by \nclearly adding in that chairman and ranking members may qualify for the \nexception under the Privacy Act. This provision is consistent with the \nintent of the Privacy Act exception and the goals of making the \ngovernment more transparent and accountable under good governance \nstatutes.\n  This bill is a simple, straightforward effort to make our Federal \nGovernment more accountable to the American taxpayers. Further, it will \nhelp ensure that Congress has the necessary access to documents from \nthe executive branch so it can conduct its constitutionally required \nduty of oversight. I am pleased that Senator Specter has joined as an \noriginal cosponsor and urge my colleagues to support swift passage of \nthis important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6875-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6875-S6876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 614--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF AUGUST 2008 AS \n              ``NATIONAL MEDICINE ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. Biden (for himself and Mr. Grassley) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 614\n\n       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines are \n     extremely safe, effective, and potentially lifesaving when \n     used properly;\n       Whereas the abuse and recreational use of over-the-counter \n     and prescription medicines can be extremely dangerous and \n     produce serious side effects;\n       Whereas in a recently sampled month, 7,000,000 individuals \n     aged 12 or older reported using prescription \n     psychotherapeutic medicines for nonmedical purposes;\n       Whereas abuse of prescription medicines, including pain \n     relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives is second \n     only to marijuana, the number 1 illegal drug of abuse in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas recent studies indicate that 2,400,000 children, or \n     1 in 10 children aged 12 through 17, have intentionally \n     abused cough medicine to get high from the ingredient \n     dextromethorphan;\n       Whereas 4,500,000, or 1 in 5, young adults have used \n     prescription medicines for nonmedical purposes;\n       Whereas according to research from the Partnership for a \n     Drug-Free America, more than \\1/3\\ of teens mistakenly \n     believe that taking prescription drugs, even if not \n     prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using more \n     traditional street drugs;\n       Whereas the lack of understanding by teens and parents of \n     the potential harms of these powerful prescription drugs \n     makes raising public awareness about the dangers of the \n     misuse of such drugs more critical than ever;\n       Whereas misused prescription drugs are most often obtained \n     through friends and relatives;\n       Whereas misused prescription drugs are also obtained \n     through rogue Internet pharmacies;\n       Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives \n     teens access to websites that promote medicine abuse;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month promotes \n     the messages that over-the-counter and prescription medicines \n     should be taken only as labeled or prescribed, and that \n     taking over-the-counter and prescription medicines for \n     recreational uses or in large doses can have serious and \n     life-threatening consequences;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month will \n     encourage parents to become educated about prescription drug \n     abuse and talk to teens about all types of substance abuse;\n       Whereas observance of National Medicine Abuse Awareness \n     Month should be encouraged at the national, State, and local \n     levels to increase awareness of the misuse of medicines;\n       Whereas some groups, including the Consumer Healthcare \n     Products Association and the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of \n     America, have taken important steps by creating educational \n     toolkits, including ``A Dose of Prevention: Stopping Cough \n     Medicine Abuse Before it Starts'', which provides guides to \n     educate parents, teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors \n     and healthcare professionals, and retailers about the \n     potential dangers of abusing over-the-counter cough and cold \n     medicines;\n       Whereas the Partnership for a Drug-Free America and \n     community alliance and affiliate partners have undertaken a \n     nationwide prevention campaign utilizing research-based \n     educational advertisements, public relations and news media, \n     and the Internet to inform parents about the negative teen \n     behavior of intentional abuse of medicines so that parents \n     are empowered to effectively communicate the facts about this \n     dangerous trend with teens and to take necessary steps to \n     safeguard prescription and over-the-counter medicines at \n     home; and\n       Whereas educating the public about the dangers of medicine \n     abuse and promoting prevention is a critical component of \n     what must be a multi-pronged effort to curb the disturbing \n     rise in medicine misuse: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of August 2008 as ``National \n     Medicine Abuse Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and \n     activities to educate parents and youth about the potential \n     dangers associated with medicine abuse.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nmarking August 2008 as National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month. The \nintentional misuse of prescription and over-the-counter drugs remains a \nserious problem in this country. This resolution builds on the progress \nwe have made in raising teens' and parents' awareness of the issue, and \nit seeks to expand our educational efforts even further.\n  While recent studies indicate that overall use of illegal drugs has \nremained relatively stable and use among teens has declined since 2002, \nthe misuse of so-called ``legal'' medications is a serious and growing \nproblem. The figures speak for themselves: 1 in 5 teens has misused a \nprescription drug, and more people age 12 or older have recently \nstarted abusing prescription pain relievers than started smoking \nmarijuana.\n  Abuse of over-the-counter cough and cold medicines is also alarming. \nWhile over-the-counter and prescription medicines are extremely safe \nand effective when used properly, the abuse and recreational use of \nthese medicines can be lethal. A study by the Partnership for a Drug-\nFree America indicates that 1 in 10 young people aged 12 through 17, or \n2.4 million kids, have intentionally abused cough medicine to get high \noff its active ingredient, Dextromethorphan, or DXM. In March, I \nchaired a hearing in the Judiciary Crime and Drugs Subcommittee whereat \nMisty Fetko told the tragic story of her son Carl's overdose death from \na combination of painkillers and over-the-counter cough and cold \nmedicine. These tragedies continue and we have got to work to stop this \nabuse.\n  Educating teens and parents about the dangers of medicine abuse is an \nimportant component of solving this multifaceted problem. Too many \nteens think that prescription and over-the-counter medicines are safe \nanytime, in any dose, and even without a prescription or doctor \nsupervision. They are gravely mistaken. Prescription drug abuse, \nwithout a valid prescription and close monitoring by a physician, can \nlead to dependency, overdose, and even death. Misuse of over-the-\ncounter medicines can similarly cause harmful results.\n  Another reason driving this abuse is the fact that these drugs are \ncheap and easy to obtain. A bottle of cough syrup costs a few dollars \nat the local drug store and prescription drugs can often be found in \nunguarded medicine cabinets at home. A February 2007 report released by \nthe office of National Drug Control Policy revealed that a shocking 47 \npercent of youth got their prescription drugs for free from a relative \nor friend. Parents are becoming their kids' drug dealers and don't even \nknow it.\n  But we can turn these numbers around through robust education, \nawareness, and enforcement efforts--and that's just what National \nMedicine Abuse Awareness Month tries to accomplish by promoting the \nmessage that over-the-counter and prescription medicines must be taken \nonly as labeled or prescribed, and that when used recreationally or in \nlarge doses they can have serious and life-threatening consequences. \nThe resolution will help remind parents that access to drugs that are \nabused doesn't just happen in alleys and on the streets, but can often \noccur right in their medicine cabinets at home.\n  A number of groups have proactively worked to curb this abuse and I \nhope this resolution pushes their efforts even further. For example, \nthe Consumer Health Care Products Association and the Community Anti-\nDrug Coalition of America have teamed up to\n\n[[Page S6876]]\n\ncreate educational toolkits, such as ``A Dose of Prevention: Stopping \nCough Medicine Abuse Before It Starts,'' which include guides to \neducate parents, teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors and \nhealthcare professionals, and retailers about the potential harms of \nover-the-counter drug abuse. In addition, the Partnership for Drug-Free \nAmerica and its community alliance and affiliate partners are \nundertaking a nationwide prevention campaign that uses research-based \neducational advertisements, public relations, news media and the \nInternet to inform parents about the prevalence of intentional abuse of \nmedicines among teens. These campaigns empower parents to effectively \ncommunicate the facts of this dangerous trend to their children and to \ntake necessary steps to safely store prescription and over-the-counter \nmedicines in their homes.\n  I have long advocated robust prevention efforts as a key component to \ngetting a handle on any substance abuse problem. As is the case with \nother substance abuse issues, prevention is just as important here and \neducating parents and teens about the realities of medicine abuse is \ncritical. I hope this resolution encourages communities, companies, \nprevention organizations, parents and others to raise awareness about \nthese dangers, talk to our kids, and keep advancing our efforts to \nprevent all types of substance abuse in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/16/senate-section/article/S6876-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5084.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 381, which was \nreceived from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 381) honoring and \n     recognizing the dedication and achievements of Thurgood \n     Marshall on the 100th anniversary of his birth.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this month marks the 100th anniversary of \nthe birth of Justice Thurgood Marshall, a legal giant who left an \nenduring imprint on the Nation. As an advocate, he challenged his \ncountry to live up to its promises of equal justice for all citizens. \nAs a jurist, he served as our collective conscience and articulated our \ndeepest convictions. Today we pay tribute to this American hero, and we \nrecognize that our democracy is stronger because he lived.\n  Justice Marshall was the great grandson of a slave. He attended \nsegregated schools in Baltimore. From these humble origins, he rose to \nbecome the first African American to be Solicitor General of the United \nStates, to sit on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and to serve on \nthe highest court in the land.\n  Justice Marshall, however, was more than a legal pioneer. He worked \ntirelessly to realize his vision of civil rights lawyers acting as \nsocial engineers who would change America for the better. He endured \ncountless hardships and risked his life traveling through the South \nseeking to secure civil rights. Justice Marshall did so because of his \nabiding faith that racial injustice was incompatible with our highest \nideals. He believed America could be more inclusive and our democracy \nmore expansive than the Founders ever imagined.\n  Because of his audacious work and his indomitable spirit, our \nchildren and grandchildren are able to learn and live together. \nMinority candidates can--and have--run for public office, and we are \npart of living history as Senator Barack Obama continues his campaign \nto become this country's first African-American President. The poor and \nthe powerless cannot be compelled to confess to a crime while under \nduress. And all Americans enjoy strengthened privacy and first \namendment protections. These are some of the many achievements of \nJustice Marshall.\n  Despite his enormous contributions, Justice Marshall's work to secure \nbasic rights for all remains unfulfilled. Today, racial bias persists \nand human rights violations continue to challenge our commitment to \nequal justice. Equally disturbing, the current Supreme Court has begun \nclosing the courthouse doors to those Americans\n\n[[Page S6878]]\n\nmost in need of the Court's protection and rolling back decades of \nprogress on civil rights.\n  I recall a 1992 Independence Day speech by Justice Marshall where he \neloquently reminded us that guarding our precious rights requires \nconstant vigilance. He said: ``Democracy just cannot flourish amid \nfear. Liberty cannot bloom amid hate.''\n  As we honor this great man today, let our tribute be a renewed \ncommitment to ensuring that our Federal courts are comprised of men and \nwomen who share Justice Marshall's commitment to protecting our \nfundamental freedoms and securing equal justice for all.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate, and that any statements relating to the concurrent \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con.
