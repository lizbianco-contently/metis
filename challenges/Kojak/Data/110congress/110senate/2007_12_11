Mr. President, we will be in a period of morning business \nfor 1 hour, with the time equally divided as usual, with the \nRepublicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the \nfinal half.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe farm bill. There has been tremendously good movement on that. All \nthe Republican amendments have been offered. Five Democratic amendments \nhave been offered. We are going to set up a program for voting on \nthese.\n  For example, some of the most controversial, the one we thought would \nbe controversial that Senator Domenici has offered regarding the \nrenewable fuel program, I think probably we can take that. So I think \nprogress can be made.\n  We have Senator Coburn who has offered a number of amendments. \nSenator Gregg has offered a number of amendments. But we can set up a \nvoting schedule for those. I think we have every indication that we can \ncomplete this bill before we leave and hopefully have it go to \nconference.\n  I have spoken to the Republican leader about the conference. We have \nan idea of how we can do a conference in this instance. While in some \nothers it could not be done, I think in this instance there is a way we \ncan have a real conference. I hope that is the case.\n  Under an order entered last night, the Senate will debate the Lugar-\nLautenberg amendment for 3 hours. The vote in relation to that will \noccur sometime after the Senate returns from the caucus recess period \ntoday. That will be the first vote today. There could be other votes \nthis afternoon. I will talk to the Republican leader about that. If we \ncannot schedule more votes this afternoon, we will schedule a load of \nthem in the morning.\n\n  A lot of work remains to be done. Members can expect long days as we \ncontinue to work toward Christmas, which is 2 weeks from today.\n  The Senate will recess for the caucus lunch period from 12:30 to 2:15 \np.m.\n  During the next 10 days, we have a lot of work to do. As I have \nindicated, we are going to try to finish the farm bill. We are going to \ntry to make a significant effort to try to complete our intelligence \nlegislation. We have the AMT which is still pending. Although we have \npassed it here, we understand the House is going to give us something \ndealing with that. We have to do our work on that.\n  We have energy legislation. We are trying to work through that, and \nwe also have our spending. I have had a conversation with the \nRepublican leader this morning on that, and while things do not appear \nas hopeful as I wish, I am kind of reminded of President Lincoln. If \nyou go to the Lincoln Memorial, you see on the wall the carved words of \nhis second inaugural address, which is so prophetic and so strong, \nwhere he talks about both sides are praying to the same God, praying \nfor different results.\n  You know, I, of course, am confident we are trying to do the right \nthing on the farm bill, FISA, alternative minimum tax, our spending \nprograms, but I am realistic enough to know there is hopefully some way \nin between to work all this out. Even though we are all hopeful that \nour side is right, I have come over the years to learn there is usually \nsome way of working through these things, although this is pretty \ndifficult duty we have now to complete our work in the next few days. I \nhope we can do that.\n  As the end of 2007 continues to draw near, we have, as I have \nindicated, a tremendously busy work period ahead of us. We hope to \ncomplete action on the appropriations process which will require the \nWhite House, along with House and Senate Republicans, to be responsible \nand reasonable in the pursuit of common ground.\n  We will work to complete the Energy bill with the bipartisan \ncompromise that will take our country toward lower energy prices for \nconsumers and a cleaner environment.\n  We will work to complete FISA legislation to ensure that we have the \ntools to fight terrorism with fair and, yes, constitutional tools, and \npass legislation that will fund this Government. We know we are going \nto have to do a very short CR, continuing resolution, to keep the \nGovernment open. Hopefully that will be for a matter of days and \ncertainly not multiple weeks.\n  I look forward to some bipartisan progress. I hope that can be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/11/senate-section/article/S15084-4", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15084-S15085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DESTRUCTION OF CIA TORTURE TAPES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to speak this morning about another \nissue that concerns not just Democrats but members of both parties and \nour entire country. It is often said that a man has nothing but his \nreputation, his honor, and his integrity. I believe that to be the \ncase. This is true not just for men but for countries.\n  In a thousand years, in a hundred years, when historians write the \nstory of these early days of America, they will, of course, write about \nour great cities, our military and, of course, our economy. But the \nreal story will be of a young Nation, unique among its global peers, \nbecause it has stood for liberty and justice, not just with words but \nwith deeds. The true measure of America is our moral authority. Over \nthe past 7 years, that authority has been significantly damaged: the \nwar in Iraq that did not have to be waged; a CIA agent exposed to harm \nfor telling the truth, Valerie Plame; a Justice Department in shambles \nwith Attorney General Gonzales; the treatment of prisoners held up to \nno standard except the daily whims of a few people, Abu Ghraib, water \ntorture. But now the word is that the CIA destroyed tapes from some of \nthese interrogations. It has been acknowledged that the interrogations \nwere by using water torture, something that originated in 1492 by Queen \nIsabella and King Ferdinand in the Inquisition. Here it is hundreds and \nhundreds of years later, and great America has reverted to what took \nplace in the Inquisition.\n  The damage to our moral authority will matter to history books, but, \nmore importantly, it matters right now. It puts our troops at greater \nrisk if captured, impairs our relationship with nations that ought to \nbe our allies, it impedes our ability to fight an effective war on \nterror, it creates terrorists.\n  This latest news of destroyed tapes raises far more questions than we \nhave answers. For example, who is responsible for destroying these \ntapes? Why? Was something being covered up? The possibility of \nobstruction of justice is very real. The American people deserve a full \naccounting for what took place and answers for all of these questions.\n  Will that eradicate what has gone on over the last 7 years? Of course \nnot. But it will help. Chairman Rockefeller has launched an \ninvestigation in the Senate Intelligence Committee. I am happy that the \nIntelligence Committee has been working on a bipartisan basis. That is \ngood. Senator Bond\n\n[[Page S15085]]\n\nhas been working with Senator Rockefeller, and they have done what has \nbeen good work. There has been very little infighting between them.\n  The Attorney General of the United States, newly selected, has said \nhe will launch an inquiry. We will see what this inquiry will be. I \nexpect both the Intelligence Committee and the Attorney General of the \nUnited States to investigate aggressively the answers to questions \nregarding this coverup.\n  But the CIA, the Justice Department, the Bush White House, every \nAmerican should know that if these investigations encounter resistance \nor are unable to find the truth, I will not hesitate to add my voice to \nthose calling for a special counsel. For example, this weekend, Joe \nBiden, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, called for a \nspecial prosecutor. He may be right. I am willing to wait and see what \ndevelops before I join in that call.\n  We must take every step necessary to protect our country's integrity \nand defend this country's great moral responsibility and authority that \nwe have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/11/senate-section/article/S15085-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me say I share the view of the \nmajority leader that there is clearly a way forward on the farm bill. \nWe are now making substantial progress and should be able to complete \nthat bill in the near future.\n  Also I think there is a way to get a Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act measure out of the Senate that could be signed by the \nPresident.\n  With regard to the remaining efforts here on the spending issues, it \nis, indeed, hard to understand the complaints we are hearing from the \nother side on our supposed lack of compromise on spending. We have \nsought actually compromises all year in dozens of appropriations \ncommittee and subcommittee hearings, which is the normal process. But \nwe are now a quarter of the way into the fiscal year. Responsible \npeople understand the time to get the work done is now. As the majority \nleader indicated, Christmas is 2 weeks from today. We can keep going \nback and forth with the House maybe endlessly. But that would only \nfurther delay our fundamental responsibility of getting these spending \nbills signed into law.\n  So what is the way to do it? The way forward: Let's protect the \ntaxpayers' wallets, fund the troops, and end this otherwise \nunproductive exercise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/11/senate-section/article/S15085-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about an \nissue that should be the first priority of this Congress, and that is \nto fund our troops during a time of war, to make sure they have the \nfunds they need, to have the equipment, to have logistical support and \nother support they need in order to fight this global war on terrorism.\n  There have been a lot of rumors circulating around Congress about \nwhat the way forward is going to be on the appropriations--I can only \ncall it a mess--that confronts us when only 1 appropriations out of 12 \nbills has been signed by the President.\n  Yesterday I heard the reports for the chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee, David Obey, which said he was pulling the \nproposed omnibus appropriations bill because he was upset with \nnegotiations on that.\n  He said this--and this is the one part I do agree with--\n\n       I want no linkage whatsoever between domestic [spending] \n     and the war. I want the war to be dealt with totally on its \n     own. We shouldn't be trading off domestic priorities for the \n     war.\n\n  I would rephrase that that we should not be doing anything to tie the \nfate of our troops to wasteful pork projects or excessive Washington \nspending.\n  I am glad to see the distinguished majority whip on the floor because \nI do have a unanimous consent request that I know he will be interested \nin.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 2340\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 484, S. 2340. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid on the table, and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at this point in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the remarks I am about to make not be taken from the time allotted \nto the Senator from Texas in terms of morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object--and I will object to this \nrequest--let me say at the outset that what the Senator has asked for \nis to return to a bill which was considered by the Senate on November \n16, 2007. There was a failure of a cloture vote, which is a vote \nrequiring 60 Senators to vote affirmatively before the bill goes \nforward. The final vote was 45 to 53. In fact, three Republican \ncolleagues of the Senator from Texas joined in opposing that cloture \nvote. This is a Senate appropriations bill. As the Senator from Texas \nknows, the Constitution requires that spending bills originate in the \nHouse. So the House would either object or ignore this bill or blue \nslip the bill in a way that would mean that whatever we would do here \nwould not achieve the result asked for by the Senator from Texas.\n  As of today, we have lost 3,888 American lives in Iraq. The amount of \nmoney which we have provided, according to the administration, would \nallow them to continue the war at least to the end of March and perhaps \nbeyond. So the troops are not without the resources they need. What the \nSenator from Texas has proposed is an approach which is on its face \nunconstitutional and has been rejected by the Senate on November 16, \nincluding three Republican Senators. For that reason, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I differ with the distinguished Senator from Illinois. \nObviously, the bill that was voted on earlier contained numerous \nrestrictions and deadlines on deployment of our troops in Iraq. For \nthat reason, cloture was denied. It is not that there wasn't support. \nIndeed, I would hope there would be unanimous support to make sure our \ntroops get the emergency funding they need in order to continue \nmilitary operations until such time as Congress can appropriate the \nremainder of the President's request of $196 billion.\n  It is important to note that this is emergency bridge funding for the \ntroops. While I don't disagree with the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois that the military can borrow from Peter to pay Paul and move \nfunds around within their budget to avoid disaster up until about mid-\nFebruary, the fact is, the White House has now warned that 100,000 \ncivilian jobs depend on this emergency funding.\n  Here is a story from the Army Times dated December 10, 2007, that \nsays the Department of Defense is sending notices of layoffs this \nweek--2 weeks before Christmas--to 100,000 civilian employees warning \nthem, unless Congress\n\n[[Page S15086]]\n\nacts, they are going to be out of a job. This is not the way to show \nour support for the troops. In fact, this is nonsupport for the troops.\n  It is important to note what is included in this emergency funding \nthat should be voted on today and decoupled from the debate over the \nOmnibus appropriations bill or any other continuing resolution. Here \nare the most notable provisions: One, operation and maintenance \nfunding--this finances a broad range of activities, including combat \noperations, transportation of personnel and equipment, fuel, equipment \nmaintenance, and general base support for our troops.\n  It also funds the Iraqi security forces and Afghanistan security \nforces. If we have any hope of bringing our troops home sooner rather \nthan later, it is because we have succeeded in training the Iraqis to \ntake our place, to provide that security so we can bring our troops \nhome as soon as possible. By not providing the funding, we are delaying \nthat prospect, not advancing it.\n  The third general category is funding for the Joint Improvised \nExplosive Device Defeat Organization--the Joint IED Defeat \nOrganization--which is dedicated to finding new ways to neutralize the \nprimary threat to our troops in Iraq, which is improvised explosive \ndevices. We ought to be providing the funding for this Joint IED Defeat \nOrganization so they can save the lives and limbs literally of American \ntroops.\n  This emergency funding being blocked by Senate Democrats would go to \nrepair, replace, and upgrade military equipment. It also provides for \nmilitary personnel funding, special pay and benefits, including \nhazardous duty pay for our troops, as well as the Defense Health \nProgram. Those are the categories of items being blocked by today's \nobjection by the Democratic leadership.\n  I am disappointed by the decision to block this emergency funding for \nour troops in Iraq. This is the material support we can provide to show \nour troops we are behind them, regardless of our differences on the war \nor how the war is being conducted. We see time and time again how this \nCongress, egged on by special interest groups such as Moveon.org, has \nbeen willing to use our troops as part of their political debate. This \nis particularly appalling when we are the ones who first asked and \nvoted--by a vote of 77 to 21, I believe, 77 affirmatively--for the use \nof force in Iraq. We are the ones who voted and have the responsibility \nfor authorizing that use of force. For us now to deny the funding they \nneed to foster a situation where money has to be moved around from \naccounts just to get by and 100,000 civilian employees are being put on \nnotice that they are going to be out of a job unless Congress quits \nplaying a game is simply unsustainable.\n  Last January, of course, we unanimously confirmed GEN David Petraeus \nto lead our forces in Iraq. As we all know, there was serious concern \nabout the way the military operations in Iraq were being conducted, and \nmany, if not all, of us called for a new way forward. We unanimously \nagreed that General Petraeus was the right man for that job. In fact, I \nam proud to say that vote to support General Petraeus's nomination and \nthat vote of confidence in the new strategy, the so-called surge of \nforces in operations in Iraq, proved to be a correct one.\n\n  General Petraeus, with his counterinsurgency strategy and with the \nhard work and dedication of our men and women in the military, has \nbrought us closer to a stable Iraq that many had simply given up and \nthought not possible. Reports are appearing daily in the newspaper and \non the electronic media showing that violent attacks continue to \ndecline in Iraq and communities across that country. Reports show \npeople not only feel safer, they are safer. Refugees who have left Iraq \nto go to Syria and other places to protect their lives and their \nfamilies are now returning to Iraq because Iraq is safer. Taxi drivers \nhave resumed their old routes in neighborhoods without regard for \nwhether predominantly Shiite or Sunni, and neighbors and families \npreviously separated by the war are reuniting as refugees are returning \nby the busload.\n  My colleagues have had a chance to show their support for the troops. \nUnfortunately, we see that support sorely lacking. The call of groups \nsuch as Moveon.org seems to be so loud and has such command on the \nother side of the aisle that it drowns out these positive reports about \nthe improved security situation in Iraq. It leads some, unfortunately, \nto block emergency funding that our troops need in order to carry out \ncontinued security operations and training for Iraqis to take our place \nso we can bring our troops home. Unfortunately, they end up being part \nof the partisan political games that tend to dominate Washington, DC. \nMy colleagues who continue to insist that Iraq is lost and that the \nsurge has failed or that Iraq is not making political progress are not \ntalking about the Iraq of today.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again: Betting against the \nmen and women of the U.S. military is always a bet you will lose. When \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle said that all is lost \neven before the surge started, frankly, they have been proven wrong. \nThey lost that bet by betting against the men and women of the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  Michael Totten, a reporter embedded in the once volatile region of \nFallujah, wrote last week in the New York Daily News:\n\n       There's a gigantic perception lag in America these days. \n     The Iraq of the popular imagination and the Iraq of the real \n     world are not the same country.\n\n  Secretary of Defense Gates said on Saturday that:\n\n       Civilian deaths across Iraq are down about 60 percent.\n       Recently, there was the lowest number of single-day attacks \n     across the nation in three and a half years.\n       The progress is real. But it is also fragile.\n\n  Why in the world, given this progress and given the fragility of the \nconditions in Iraq, would my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ndeny the emergency funding that our troops need? What possible \nrationale could there be for making that part of the political games \nand dysfunction that seems to dominate the Congress?\n  We have to make our policy decisions based not on the Iraq many have \nremembered from the past but the situation on the ground today which is \nimproving, rebounding, and growing. Yet we still hear the doomsayers \nand those admonishing General Petraeus and his strategy. I am reminded \nof something a professor once told me when he said speaking louder \ndoesn't make you any more right. We need to listen to the facts and not \nthe loudest voices.\n  We all have an important question to ask ourselves. It is not about \nshould we have gone into Iraq or why we went into Iraq. Those questions \nare now relegated to the history books. The fact is, we are there. The \nquestion we must ask now is, Given the current situation in Iraq and \nthe Middle East, what is the best course of action for the United \nStates? We should ask ourselves, Will withdrawing troops from Iraq \nbefore securing it make us any more or less secure at home? I have no \ndoubt--and history will agree--that the more stable we can make Iraq, \nthe better chance they have of becoming a fully functioning partner in \nthe Middle East, a democracy governed by Iraqis.\n  A precipitous withdrawal, whether caused by deadlines imposed by \nCongress or by cutting off funding or by leaving funding in doubt, as \nour Democratic colleagues have done by objecting to this unanimous \nconsent request today, would be detrimental to the security and \nstability of Iraq and would endanger American lives at home.\n  How could that be? The intelligence community tells us that a power \nvacuum in Iraq left by a rapid American withdrawal would create a \nfailed state and an opportunity for al-Qaida to reassemble and \nreorganize.\n  It would create an opportunity for a training ground and an \norganizing location for al-Qaida and Islamic extremists to launch \nfuture terrorist attacks against the United States or our other allies \nor American forces in the Middle East. Such action would also likely \nnecessitate future American military operations in the region that \nwould put us behind where we are today, not advance where we are today.\n  I think we can all agree that kind of scenario is completely \nunacceptable and certainly not in the best interest of the United \nStates. The situation in Iraq, as it stands now, needs a continued \nmilitary presence with a force large enough to handle potential \nproblems until the Iraqis are able to govern and defend themselves. The \nmore capable the Iraq military and police forces\n\n[[Page S15087]]\n\nbecome, the fewer of our troops are necessary to assist them in that \neffort. But it does not help them to cause them to question whether we \nare going to provide the financial support for our troops and for the \ntraining of Iraqi military and police forces. But that is exactly what \nthe Senate is doing today by blocking this unanimous consent request.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, still now, are \nleft to claim that the lack of Iraqi political reconciliation is the \nreason they are dissatisfied with the outcome in Iraq, having lost the \nargument by the improved security arrangements as a result of the surge \nand the counterinsurgency strategy of General Petraeus.\n  I have to wonder whether we are holding the Iraqi Government--Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, by now moving the goalposts, saying first \nthe surge would not work to now having to declare the obvious, that the \nsurge is working and the military situation is better, our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle and the naysayers are saying: Well, \nreally the problem is a lack of political reconciliation. But I have to \nask whether we--a Congress that has proven itself to be dysfunctional \nover the last 8 months or 11 months now--whether we are holding the \nIraqis to a different standard than we would actually hold ourselves \nto. We have not exactly been a model for how Congresses should \nfunction.\n  I think it is unfair for us to continue to move the goalposts and say \nthat the significant reconciliation efforts that are occurring in \ntribal areas, in the provinces, and local areas do not count because \nclearly they do count, with things like the Anbar awakening and the \nwork being done around Iraq now from the bottom up, as opposed to the \ntop down, which is helping to make for a more secure Iraq, and making \nsure that Iraqis, rather than Americans, are principally responsible \nfor maintaining security and safety in Iraq, in conjunction with \nAmerican military troops.\n  I am discouraged and disappointed that our colleagues have blocked \nthis emergency funding for our troops, putting 100,000 civilian \nemployees of the Department of Defense in doubt during this Christmas \nseason as to whether they are actually going to have a job come \nFebruary and causing our troops to question our commitment to support \nthem during a time of war. That is not the message this Senate ought to \nbe sending, and I urge my colleagues to reconsider.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, is it my understanding I am recognized for \n15 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fifteen minutes, without objection.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, to start this discussion about what to do \nin Iraq, I think we need to sort of take inventory of where we are, \nwhat common ground we do have. I do believe there is a vast, wide, and \ndeep support for the men and women in the military by the average \nRepublican and Democrat and Independent citizen and Members of \nCongress, and that is indeed good news for our country. It is not one \nof those situations where people came back from Vietnam and were not \nwell received by their fellow citizens. For that, we should all be \ngrateful.\n  I would like to put this debate in a little different context. As my \ncolleague from Texas said, whether we should have gone into Iraq is \nsort of a matter for historical discussion. The question for us as a \nnation is winning and losing, and can you put Iraq in terms of winning \nand losing? I think you have to because our enemy has. Our enemy, al-\nQaida and other extremists groups, looks at Iraq very much as a \nbattlefront and a battle they want to win and us to lose. That is why \nbin Laden has rallied the jihadist and al-Qaida sympathizers to go to \nIraq and go to the Land of the Two Rivers and drive the infidel out, \nbecause I think they understand pretty clearly that if Iraq can \nreconcile itself, become a stable, functioning democracy, with an Iraqi \nspin to it, where a woman can have a say about her children, where the \nrule of law would reign over the rule of the gun, and be a place that \nwould absorb religious tolerance, it would be a nightmare for their \nagenda. So our enemy is very certain in their own mind about what would \nhappen if we won in Iraq.\n\n  Again, winning to me would be a stable, functioning democracy, \ntolerant of religious differences, where all groups would have a \npolitical say, where a woman would have a meaningful role in society \nregarding her children and their future. And it would contain Iran. It \nwould be a buffer to Iranian ambitions. It would deny extremist groups, \nsuch as al-Qaida, safe haven. That, to me, is winning, and that, to me, \nis very possible. The reason I say it is very possible is because it is \nin the best interests of the Iraqi people themselves to achieve that \ngoal. There is a Shia majority in Iraq, but they are Iraqi Shia. They \nare Arabs. The Persian Shia majority--there has been a war between \nthese two countries in the past decades and a lot of animosity. So the \ngeneral feeling on the streets that I have found from many visits to \nIraq is that, generally speaking, the Iraqi population does not want to \nbe dominated by anybody, including Iran.\n  Now, the biggest news of the surge that is not being reported enough, \nin my opinion, is that given a choice and an opportunity, a Muslim \npopulation, the Iraqi Sunni Arabs, rejected the al-Qaida agenda in \nAnbar. The al-Qaida movement in Iraq was formulated and inspired by \noutside forces. Leaders from al-Qaida internationally came into Iraq to \nrally people to the al-Qaida cause. They played a very heavy hand in \nAnbar, which was brutal--from the small things such as banning smoking \nto burning children in front of their parents who did not cooperate. \nThey imposed a way of living on the Iraqis in Anbar Province for which \nthe Anbar Iraqi Sunni Arabs said: No, we don't want any more of this. \nAnd the sheiks and all the tribes came to our side because al-Qaida \noverplayed their hand. So the real good news for me is that given an \nopportunity and being reinforced, the al-Qaida agenda will not sell, \nand people within the region will turn it down and reject it. That \nwould not have happened without the surge.\n  I think most of us do not appreciate what life is like in a country \nwhere if you raise your hand to be a judge, let's say, not only do you \nbecome personally at risk, they try to kill your family--the forces \nthat do not want to reconcile Iraq.\n  Political debates and discourse in this country can be very \ncontentious, but on occasion we find that middle ground to solve our \nproblems. It is hard and difficult to compromise in an environment \nwhere the people who want you to fail literally will kill your family. \nSo the lack of security in the past has been our biggest impediment to \nreconciliation. Thank God for General Petraeus, General Odinero, and \nall under their command. You have done a wonderful job.\n  This we should all agree upon: that the surge, as a military \noperation, has been enormously successful and I think will be the gold \nstandard in military history for counterinsurgency operations. Instead \nof bleeding it dry of funds and putting it at risk, we should reinforce \nit politically, monetarily, and in every other way.\n  A political leader can reinforce a military leader. Our military, \nbecause of our system of government, depends on us, those of us in \nelected office, to give them the resources to execute the mission they \nhave been assigned. Who among us believes we understand Iraq better \nthan General Petraeus militarily? Who among us advocated the surge as \nproposed by General Petraeus? Who among us understands \ncounterinsurgency operations better than the general and his staff? \nNone of us, if we would be honest with ourselves. He is the expert in \nthis area. He has been given an ability to engage in military \noperations with a completely new theory, and it is working--undeniably \nworking.\n  Security in Iraq is better. Anbar has literally been liberated. If \nyou told me a year ago, this time last year, we would be moving marines \nout of Anbar because the security environment\n\n[[Page S15088]]\n\nwould justify it, I would have thought: That is optimism beyond what I \ncan muster. But it has happened. And all throughout this country called \nIraq, people are beginning to reconcile themselves because of better \nsecurity. Quite frankly, they are war weary.\n  But I am not going to reinvent history. The blame is across the board \nand across the aisle. How many times did Republicans go to Iraq after \nthe fall of Baghdad, for maybe 3 years, and say: It is really going \nwell, it is just the media's fault. It was not going well, and it was \nnot the media's fault. The strategy was failing. So people on my side \nof the aisle were cheerleading for a strategy that, if we followed it, \nwe would have been hopelessly lost in Iraq. So there is plenty of blame \nto go around. Finally, we now have adjusted. We have a new general with \na new strategy. It is a lot more complicated than just 30,000 new \ntroops. We are deploying them differently. We are going after the \ninsurgency in a different way.\n\n  The biggest nightmare for al-Qaida has been the surge. If you ask to \npick winners and losers of the surge, it would be extremist groups. At \nthe top of the list would be al-Qaida, and it is soon going to be the \nShia militia aligned with Iran. There is an offensive about to take \nplace in Iraq that is going to put the nail in the coffin of extremist \ngroups. They are not defeated yet, but they are greatly diminished.\n  Now is not the time, colleagues, for us to put this surge in \njeopardy. Our troops are in a political crossfire here at home. They \nare not in the middle of a heated sectarian war. Security does exist in \nIraq now to get business done. There are extremist groups, and it is \nstill dangerous, but the military has done its part to allow the Iraqi \npeople to reconcile themselves.\n  We have not done our part. We are still fighting a battle as if \nnothing new has happened. We are still holding on to positions stated \nin April and May as if nothing has changed, and that is not fair to \nthose who sacrificed to make it change. I took this floor for a very \nlong time with Senator McCain and a handful of others arguing that the \nDepartment of Defense had a strategy doomed to fail. Thank God the \nPresident changed course. Thank God for General Petraeus and all under \nhis command.\n  Now, to my colleagues on the other side, please let us allow General \nPetraeus to finish the job he started. Within a few months, the troops \nbegin to come home based on the surge being successful. They will \nreturn with victory at hand. Victory is not yet achieved, but it is \npossible. The only way to roll back the security gains is to change the \nmission and have the Congress start running the war.\n  The political crossfire I speak of is that some people want to give \nthe money to support the surge only if they get $11 billion of domestic \nspending unrelated to the military. Some people will not give any money \nfor the surge, continued operations in Iraq, unless we change the \nmission and withdraw troops by the end of the next year. That is a \ncrossfire politically that is doing more harm than good that should \nend.\n  Beginning in March, General Petraeus will come back. He will tell us \nthe situation as it exists on the ground. I am here to tell you, in \nDecember, that I am disappointed in the progress at the central \ngovernment level in Baghdad. They have passed a budget in Iraq--$48 \nbillion. All revenue being shared among all groups is a great step \nforward, but it is not a permanent solution to the problem.\n  We need a permanent law, a national law, that will tell every group \nin Iraq: As to the wealth of the country, part of it will come to your \narea, and you do not have to worry about it budget by budget. Political \nreconciliation in Iraq has to happen for the surge to be successful. I \nhave said on numerous occasions that if there is not some major \nbreakthrough on the benchmarks by January, I will look at reconfiguring \nthe aid we give to the Iraqi Government, not changing the troop \nmissions or the troop numbers. I am going to leave that up to the \nmilitary. It is in our national security interest to maintain the gains \nwe have achieved on the ground to keep Iraq from going into chaos. But \nwe are giving this Government hundreds of millions of dollars of aid, \nand if they cannot reconcile themselves, we may find other places to \nspend that money and other ways to spend that money.\n  So I urge my colleagues to allow the troop funding that is required \nto complete the surge, to allow it to go forward. Stop this political \ncrossfire of trying to extract from this necessary funding event more \nmoney to spend domestically here at home or trying to take the mission \naway from the military commanders. That is not where our troops need to \nfind themselves in this crucial moment in time.\n  I can promise you, as we go into next year, if the central government \nin Baghdad has not done a better job reconciling themselves, I will sit \ndown with anyone, Republicans and Democrats alike, to find a way to put \npolitical pressure, economic pressure, on this government.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

Mr. President, I want to acknowledge my colleagues who \nhave been helping on S. 2045. These are in alphabetical order, not in \nthe order of work done. Everybody has worked a lot on different parts \nof this bill. They are Senators Brown, Casey, Durbin, Harkin, Inouye, \nKlobuchar, Menendez, Bill Nelson, and Schumer. They have all helped \ncraft this legislation relating to the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission.\n  Because we are now in the holiday season, naturally, public attention \nis focused on consumer product safety. I had come today prepared to ask \nunanimous consent to try to move to this legislation. However, last \nweek, Thursday, I met with Al Hubbard at the White House in a very \nconstructive meeting to talk about some of the areas of disagreement on \nthe legislation, as it came out of the Senate Commerce Committee. It \nwas a very constructive meeting, very frankly. I hope, in the end, we \nwill consider that a very productive meeting. We don't know yet if \nthere is a meeting of the minds, but I am cautiously optimistic that \nthe White House is starting to engage in this very important issue to \nthis country and to the families of America.\n  Let's talk for a moment about the Consumer Product Safety Commission. \nFor a lot of people, the CPSC is just one of these ``alphabet soup'' \nagencies, and they don't know what the CPSC does. But I will tell you, \nit touches every American's life every day. It is in the small things \nthat we use, such as batteries, coffeemakers, lawnmowers, toys, and \nbaby cribs.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission is there to make sure these \nproducts are safe for people in my State of Arkansas to buy and for \npeople all over this country to buy and use. One of the things the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission should do is give people in this \ncountry--including parents, when it comes to toys--peace of mind to \nknow the toys they purchase and other products they purchase meet \nAmerican safety standards.\n  This bill we are talking about today, S. 2045, was called recently by \nthe Wall Street Journal ``the most significant consumer safety \nlegislation in a generation.'' I think that accurately sums up the \nnature of our legislation. It is consumer safety reform legislation. It \nis very significant, very comprehensive.\n  Our efforts in reforming the CPSC predate a lot of the recalls we \nheard about this summer. We have been working on this all year in the \nsubcommittee. Basically, the CPSC now looks after 15,000 separate \nconsumer products. Every year, there are about, roughly, 27,000 deaths \nin this country caused by consumer products that are faulty. There are \n33.1 million people injured every year through consumer products that \nthe CPSC regulates. So this is an agency that is a public safety \nagency, a good Government agency.\n  Unfortunately, the CSPC is completely overwhelmed today. I believe \nthe Senate, the House, and the President should all work together to \nreauthorize this agency and put it back together again.\n  Let me give some examples from this year alone. This year there have \nbeen 37 million products recalled. Some people may say: Gosh, it is \nworking because all these products have been recalled. First, a lot of \nthose products should never have been imported in the\n\n[[Page S15089]]\n\nfirst place. A lot of them were recalled by the manufacturers, not the \nGovernment. In any event, we have seen stories about lead-coated Big \nBird, Elmo, and Barbie accessories, and we have seen collapsing cribs \nand kerosene-filled toy eyeballs. We have seen building toys with \nsmall, very powerful, magnets that, when kids ingest them, cause \nproblems. We have seen craft toys that contain the date rape drug. That \nis unbelievable, but we have seen in this country a craft set, or a \ncraft toy, that contains the date rape drug. These products should \nnever be in the marketplace to begin with.\n  Let me talk about the status quo for a moment. The status quo today, \nwith this flood of imports coming into this country, is completely \nunacceptable. We should not stand idly by and allow these products to \nsaturate our markets. There have been stories in the last few days \nabout charities and charitable giving. One of the great organizations \nduring this time of year is the U.S. Marine Corps. They do the Toys for \nTots Program. They have been doing it for many years. Even when I was a \nkid, it was a big deal because there were always kids in the community \nless fortunate than I was. We would gather our toys around our house \nand take them down to a drop station, wherever it may be, and the \nMarines would sort them out and deliver them to kids who needed toys on \nChristmas morning or during the holiday season.\n  One of my staff members, Jason Smedley, is a marine. Yesterday, he \nwent to DC to volunteer on the Marine Corps Toys for Tots, the big \ndisbursing office. Unfortunately, what he found was that the donations \nto Toys for Tots are way down this year because parents and other \ndonors don't have confidence in the toys they are giving because there \nmight be something wrong with them.\n  Also, you find, as Jason told me, at the Toys for Tots location in \nWashington, DC, they have three-ring binders with all kinds of toy \nrecall information in them. Every toy that comes in, they go through \nthat book to make sure that toy hasn't been recalled. Does that sound \nefficient to anyone? No. That means the CPSC has not been able to do \nits job and protect our marketplace from these dangerous toys.\n  There was another story in our local paper, the Arkansas Democratic \nGazette, yesterday where toy recalls have hurt instate charities, the \nlocally based charities. You see the same story there, where donations \nare down. It has been a very hard season for those people who are in \nthat toy distribution operation during the holiday season.\n  There is a great leader in Arkansas, Hezekiah Steward. He is a \nreverend, and he runs something called the Watershed Human Development \nCenter. People in our State call it the Watershed Project. He tries to \nmeet the needs of the most needy in the Little Rock area. He does a \ngreat job. When I was Attorney General, we had a program and we tried \nto donate as many toys as we could to Watershed and also to Toys for \nTots. We tried to help the Watershed because they are touching people \nin the community that a lot of times fall through the cracks. Again, \nHezekiah Steward is in that article yesterday in the Arkansas \nDemocratic Gazette, saying the donations were down and they are having \nto screen the toys. It is basically a big mess.\n  In addition to that, I have talked to parents and grandparents in \nArkansas, and they are telling me the same thing. They are saying: This \nholiday season, when we want to buy toys, we don't know what to trust \nanymore. If it says ``made in China,'' we don't buy it. That is not a \ngood screening process. Hopefully, most of the toys in the marketplace \nare safe today, but the public has lost confidence in the system we \nhave now, and we in the Senate, in the U.S. House, and also in the \nWhite House need to do a much better job of giving the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission the tools it needs.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nand help lay out the problem. Here on this chart we see something that \nis very revealing. We see on the top chart the imports coming into this \ncountry. What we see on the bottom chart is the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission's staffing level year by year. One thing you will notice--\nthis is very clear, and the numbers are unmistakable--is that starting \nin 1974, you see the general trend; it goes up and down a little bit, \nbut the general trend is for imports to increase coming into this \ncountry. We all know that. Everybody in this body knows we have seen \nimports increase dramatically in the United States in the last few \nyears. This is borne out on the chart.\n  Unfortunately, as the imports are going up, the staff at the CPSC is \ngoing down. You can see these numbers. Again, they are unmistakable. \nThis is an agency in distress. If you look at what it was at its high \nversus what it is today, the numbers are unmistakable. The problem with \nthe numbers is, when you see the low numbers like this on the staffing \nlevel, when you understand the situation their lab is in, where it is \ndilapidated and antiquated, and they are losing many people through \nattrition, you understand all the problems the agency has and that it \nis totally overwhelmed. When you look at this number, which is at an \nall-time low, and imports are at an all-time high, you know we have a \nproblem.\n  In this body, we need to address that problem. There is no better \ntime to address it than right now. Let me talk for a moment about what \nI think we need at the CPSC. We need a robust and proactive watchdog \nagency. We need to prevent toxic toys from ever landing on our shores \nand on our shelves. We need to be able to respond very quickly when \nthere is a problem. We need to have a system in place where we can \npunish the bad actors and punish the repeat offenders.\n  Again, I have been talking to the White House, and I want to be \ncautiously optimistic about what the White House told me on the phone \nand in meetings, but we all need to work together to try to get this \ndone.\n  Let me run through some of the things that S. 2045 does. Basically, \nwhat we are doing is taking this agency that needs an overhaul, and we \nare overhauling it. What we are trying to do is increase the staff by \nnearly 20 percent over time. We are trying to upgrade their testing \nlabs. We are trying to increase their agents at ports of entry, again, \nso the dangerous products never enter this country. We are trying to \nallow the States' attorneys general to be more like cops on the beat \nand help the CPSC enforce the laws in all 50 States, not just in one \ncentralized location at the CPSC itself. We want to increase the civil \nfines and the criminal penalties. Also, as part of this, we want to do \nour dead level best to streamline the recall process. It takes too \nlong, it is too secretive, and there are many examples of people dying \nas discussions are going on between the manufacturers and the CPSC on \nhow a recall will be conducted. This is very important.\n  This bill bans lead in children's products. I think that is very \nimportant for the American public to understand. Right now, there is \nnot a ban on lead in children's products. We know it is dangerous, and \nthat is well documented. Our doctors, medical researchers, and \nscientists have told us that. So we need to ban lead in children's \nproducts.\n  This bill also allows the CPSC to select recall remedies. It doesn't \nleave it up to the manufacture or the bad actors. Not all manufacturers \nor retailers are bad. In fact, the supermajority of them are not. They \nare trying to do what is right.\n  At the end of the day, the CPSC needs to make decisions that are in \nthe public interest--not some of these manufacturers and retailers and \ndistributors, et cetera, and what is in their own corporate interests. \nWe need a watchdog agency that will be there to protect the public \ninterest.\n  This bill increases public disclosure. That is important because most \nparents have heard something on the news or read a little something in \nthe paper, but they really don't have an easy way to know what is being \nrecalled or exactly when it gets recalled. We want more public \ndisclosure, and we want it to happen quicker.\n  Also, regarding children's products, we want a third party process, \nwhere a third party will certify that those products meet U.S. safety \nstandards. We have that in a lot of other areas, such as electronics.\n\n  There are a lot of third-party certification processes that exist in \nthe marketplace. We need that for children's products.\n  The last two or three things the bill does is it improves the \ntracking labels\n\n[[Page S15090]]\n\non children's products. When we get a toy, and they say there is a \nrecall, say, on a certain kind of doll, there may be 10 varieties of \nthat doll. We may have bought a doll made a year ago and it has been in \na warehouse. We don't know. We want a better labeling and tracking \nsystem.\n  We want to provide whistleblower protections. If there are people out \nthere who know there is wrongdoing and somebody is covering it up--we \nsee this in other contexts--we want to allow that whistleblower to come \nforward and not be punished for doing what is right.\n  The last point I wish to mention is the bill prohibits the sale of \nrecalled products. Again, a lot of people in this country may be \nshocked to know that in many circumstances--not all--but in many \ncircumstances, we see recalled products still for sale on the open \nmarket. Parents would be shocked to know that fact, but it is true.\n  We are trying to do our best, give our best effort to have a serious \nand fundamental reform of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n  One more point in closing, and that is, there are two major goals we \nare trying to accomplish with this legislation. First, we are trying to \nrebuild the agency. That is very important for the functioning of that \nagency. As I said before, it is overwhelmed. I showed some charts. \nThere are many others I can point out to show how overwhelmed this \nagency is. First and foremost, we want to rebuild the agency. And \nsecond--and this point flows from the first point--we want to restore \npublic confidence in the marketplace. We don't want to be at the next \nholiday season and moms and dads are coming up to me in Arkansas and \ncoming up to my colleagues all over the country saying: Should I buy \ntoys for my children and grandchildren this year? That is what I hear \nwhen I go back home.\n  People are concerned, they are scared, they are uncertain about the \nAmerican marketplace, and that is too bad. We do not need that to \nhappen. We need our people to have confidence in the marketplace in \nthis country.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in the House as \nwell and in the White House, I ask everyone to give this legislation a \nserious look. We would like to move it forward this month, before the \nend of this year, during this holiday season. I know there are some \nfolks who expressed interest in trying to help get that done. I am \navailable any day, any night. My staff is available. We definitely want \nto work with whomever is willing to work to get the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission reauthorization done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as Senators are well aware, we are now \nback on the farm bill. I again thank both leaders, Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell, for last week working together to reach an agreement \nwhereby we will have 20 amendments, a maximum of 20 amendments. We \ndon't have to have 20 amendments but a maximum of 20 amendments on each \nside. We now have a list, and we do have the amendments in order on the \nRepublican side. There are 20 listed. I hope that maybe not all of them \nwill require a vote. Maybe we can work some of those out so we will not \nrequire votes or much time on any of those amendments. Senator \nChambliss and I are working together to try to get some hard-and-fast\n\n[[Page S15091]]\n\ntime agreements on these amendments so we can move ahead expeditiously.\n  Right now we have seven amendments listed on the Democratic side, and \nI hope that might be the limit of those amendments. Republicans have \nabout 20, and we have about 7 amendments that I know of right now.\n  Also, we know yesterday the Senate entered into a unanimous consent \nagreement that beginning at 11 a.m., the Senate will begin 3 hours of \ndebate on the Lugar-Lautenberg amendment No. 3711 and the time is to be \nequally divided, so an hour and a half on each side. Of course, we will \nbreak at 12:30 p.m. for our respective weekly party conferences. We \nwill resume at 2:15 p.m. and will resume debate on amendment No. 3711, \nthe Lugar-Lautenberg amendment, and that when all time is used or \nyielded back, we will vote on or in relation to that amendment.\n  Senators should be aware the first vote that will occur on an \namendment to the farm bill will be on the Lugar-Lautenberg amendment at \nsome point this afternoon, and then hopefully we will move ahead after \nthat on other amendments. I don't know exactly what the next amendment \nwill be. We will work that out.\n  Hopefully, we can work out some more votes today. I don't know how \nlate the leader wants to keep us in tonight. I am prepared to stay here \nvery late tonight--very late tonight--to move these amendments forward. \nWe are reaching a point where I know everyone wants to get out of here \nfor the holiday season, for Christmas and New Year. We are approaching \nthe end of Hanukkah. I know people would like to leave and get together \nwith their families. I think if we put in a couple long days, we can \nreach pretty good agreements on these amendments to the farm bill.\n  I hope we will have a long day today and get some amendments offered \nand debated and disposed of, one way or another. I wished to lay that \nout. I see my colleague and good friend, the former chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Lugar, is on the floor.\n  So I will at this time yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3711\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment No. 3711 is pending \nunder a 3-hour time limit.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, is it appropriate to commence the debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished chairman \nof the committee.\n  Mr. President, let me start by thanking Senator Tom Harkin, the \ndistinguished chairman of our committee, and the ranking Republican \nleader, Saxby Chambliss, for their leadership. It is not an easy task \nto be chairman or ranking Member of the Senate Agriculture Committee \nduring the farm bill. Having served in both capacities, I know well of \nthe challenges that both have faced in putting together a bill.\n  Let me point out, as I have during the debate in committee, some \nachievements have occurred. Both the chairman and ranking member have \noutlined a number of these in the areas of conservation, rural \ndevelopment, research, nutrition, and energy.\n  I am also pleased by the effort to provide interested farmers with \nthe revenue-based program which should be an improvement over the \nstatus quo.\n  However, the farm bill before us does not provide meaningful reform. \nOur current farm policies, sold to the American public as a safety net, \nactually hurt the family farmer. In the name of maintaining the family \nfarm and preserving rural communities, today's farm programs have \nbenefited a select few, while leaving the majority of farmers without \nsupport or a safety net.\n  Let me review the history of these farm bills.\n  The genesis of our current farm policy began during the Great \nDepression as an effort to help alleviate poverty among farmers and \nrural communities. At that time, one in four Americans lived on a farm \nand the rural economy's vitality was largely dependent upon farmers. \nFarm programs were instituted that stifled agricultural productivity in \norder to raise commodity prices through a federally administered \nsupply-and-demand program. Supply-control programs cost U.S. taxpayers \nhandsomely in higher food costs and job loss, and now about half of the \nNation's farmers are essentially prevented from growing other crops, \nsuch as fruits and vegetables.\n  To date, this same antiquated idea is promoted even though farm \nincome is higher on average than other industries. Times have changed \ndramatically since then. Today, 1 in 75 Americans lives on a farm, and \nonly 1 in 750 lives on a full-time commercial farm. Furthermore, nearly \n90 percent of total farm household income comes from off-farm sources--\n90 percent.\n  In response to these ongoing changes, in 1996, Congress finally \nrecognized farmers, not the Government, could best ascertain what crops \nare profitable and granted roughly half our farmers flexibility in \nplanting choices, the so-called Freedom to Farm bill, and began to \ntransition away from federally controlled agriculture programs.\n  But in 2002, Congress and the Bush administration reversed these \nreforms and created the so-called three-legged stool which, in addition \nto other farm programs, has helped to place us in violation of our WTO \ncommitments.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee farm bill before us today \nperpetuates and even expands these defective policies without regard \nfor the fact that the majority of farmers do not have a safety net.\n  The first leg of this so-called three-legged stool is direct payment \nsubsidies to specific farmers who grow certain crops. Direct payments \nare fixed annual taxpayer-funded subsidies that are based on a farm's \nhistoric production and a federally set payment rate. For the five \nmajor subsidized crops, the average payment rate is roughly $15 per \nacre for wheat, $24 per acre for corn, $33 per acre for cotton, $11 per \nacre for soybeans, and $94 per acre for rice.\n  These subsidies were originally called transition payments. They were \nmeant to be a temporary bridge from supply management-based subsidies \nto free market-based agriculture. They were never intended to be a \ncontinuing entitlement.\n  Direct payment policies are particularly irresponsible because the \ntaxpayer-funded subsidies go out to farmers regardless of whether cash \nis flowing in or out of their farms or whether they farm at all.\n  Although many subsidized farmers are projected to receive record crop \nprices and earn record farm incomes over the next 5 years, the Senate \nfarm bill, as agreed to by the Senate Agriculture Committee, doles out \nup to $26 billion in direct payments from taxpayers, much of which will \ngo to some of the largest and wealthiest farming operations in America. \nIn fact, over 50 percent of these subsidies will continue to go to \nfarmers in seven States, for a grand total of $13.1 billion.\n  Some may find these statistics surprising, but this is simply a \ncontinuation of ``business as usual'' when it comes to farm subsidies. \nKeep in mind, in the years 2000 to 2005, the farm sector received $112 \nbillion in taxpayer subsidies, but only 43 percent of all farms \nreceived payments. This is because the majority of the payments go to \njust five row crops--corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and rice. The \nlargest 8 percent of these farms receives 58 percent of these payments. \nIn fact, the top 1 percent of the highest earning farmers claimed 17 \npercent of the crop subsidy benefits between 2003 and 2005.\n\n  Smaller farms that qualify in the current system and that could \nbenefit from additional support did not do as well. Two-thirds of \nrecipient farms received less than $10,000, accounting for only 7 \npercent of their gross cash farm income. Minority farmers fared even \nworse, with only 8 percent of minority farmers even receiving Federal \nfarm subsidies. Furthermore, half of the Federal crop subsidies paid \nbetween 2003 and 2005 went to only 19 congressional districts out of \n435.\n  Each one of these statistics illustrates that our direct payment \nsystem is inequitable and in conflict with claims we hear on the Senate \nfloor that our current farm policies are a safety net for the family \nfarmer.\n  The second leg of the stool is ``countercyclical payments,'' or \nhaving the taxpayer pay farmers when prices fall below a \ncongressionally set price. The third leg is a marketing loan program \nthat allows farmers to put their crops\n\n[[Page S15092]]\n\nup as collateral to receive operating capital. However, provisions \nallow farmers to go ahead and sell the crop and repay the Government at \na lower rate, leaving taxpayers to make up the difference.\n  Because these two programs do not appropriately correspond with \nmarket forces, they have the effect of creating artificial markets for \ncrops, even when markets do not exist. Yet neither program provides any \nhelp to farmers when they arguably need it most--during disasters, such \nas drought. Of greater concern, these programs have been ruled to \nviolate our trade agreements. But this new farm bill actually increases \ntarget prices for at least five crops, loan rates for seven crops, and \nadds a number of new subsidized crops.\n  Now, some Senators may wonder why we should be concerned that we are \nin violation of our World Trade Organization--or WTO--commitments. They \nmight think this situation is simply limited to agriculture, or \nspecific crops, with little impact on our overall economy. Others might \neven suggest we are better off building more barriers to trade; that \nthis farm bill is about American farmers and not farmers in Brazil or \nelsewhere. However, if Senators look further down the line, they will \nsee that our WTO violations could cost the United States billions in \nrevenue, intellectual property, and lost trade opportunities. And \nfailure to move toward compliance will invite retaliatory tariffs that \nlegally can be redirected at any U.S. industry.\n  In fact, as is happening now, Brazil will soon have the authority to \nretaliate in kind against United States products, whether they be \nagricultural products or intellectual property, due to our \nunwillingness to fix our farm policies. It is unclear if Brazil will \nfollow through with these threats, but what is clear is that the WTO \nhas repeatedly found the United States cotton program to be in \nviolation of our commitments. As a result, a host of challenges to \nother agricultural commodities has ensued, including a case brought \nforth by Brazil and Canada in November that targets all of our \ncommodity programs.\n  Upon the initial findings of the WTO, Congress did repeal some \ncotton-related programs found to violate these agreements, namely, the \nso-called Step 2 Program, which was a program that used taxpayer money \nto pay companies to use U.S. cotton. However, the farm bill we are \ncurrently considering makes virtually no attempt to bring the rest of \nthe cotton program into compliance.\n  The administration earlier this year put forth a number of policy \nchanges that they argued would have fixed our trade problems with the \nWTO, including a revenue-based countercyclical program, marketing loans \nthat respond to market prices, and eliminating planting restrictions \nfor fruits and vegetables. None of these proposals were incorporated \ninto either the House bill or the Senate farm bill before us today. In \nfact, this farm bill significantly increases the likelihood that other \nprograms will be further challenged by the World Trade Organization.\n  Specifically, the WTO found that countercyclical payments and \nmarketing loans are trade distorting, and the direct payments argued to \nbe trade neutral are a trade violation as long as planting restrictions \nare retained. Astonishingly, the farm bill increases payments made \nunder these trade-distorting programs almost across the board, further \nexacerbating our trade situation.\n  In the midst of all of this, the chief economist for the Department \nof Agriculture projects that exports of agricultural products for this \nyear are likely to reach $79 billion, nearly 30 percent of all farm \ncash receipts in 2007. Nearly 40 percent of soybeans, half of our \nwheat, and over 90 percent of our cotton produced in the United States \nthis year will be exported.\n  Clearly, trade and our trading partners are important to American \nfarmers now and will continue to be in the future. U.S. action to \ncomply with WTO rulings against cotton subsidies as well as U.S. policy \nregarding subsidies in general will be closely monitored by the world's \nexporters. Should the WTO determine that other United States farm \nsubsidy programs, as challenged by Brazil and Canada, do not comply \nwith WTO rules, the potential for retaliation by other countries is \nimmeasurable.\n  The farm bill before us today establishes a new permanent disaster \ntrust fund at the Department of the Treasury to provide an additional \n$5 billion in spending for commodity crop farmers. Our amendment does \nnot touch this provision nor any of the other provisions related to the \nFinance Committee package. Of this $5 billion, it is estimated that \nnearly half of the money will be given to farmers in counties \ndesignated as disaster counties by the President and the other half \nwill go to crop insurance companies as a subsidy to administer higher \nlevels of crop insurance coverage.\n  The idea of a permanent disaster program may have merit, especially \nwhen you consider that Congress has passed legislation to fund ad hoc \ndisaster payment assistance nearly every year for the last 20 years, \nbut we should ask ourselves, if the current expensive farm bill is \nfailing to provide a safety net to farmers when these devastating \nevents do happen, then what is the purpose of the farm bill? Why do we \nneed a new program administered by a separate Federal agency to fulfill \nwhat most Americans believe is the core purpose of the legislation \nbefore us? We should fix the root problem, namely that the current \nsubsidy system does not work and wastes taxpayer dollars.\n  If you are now a farmland owner in America, it is highly probable \nyour land will increase in value. Why? Because a land-owning farmer or \nagricultural business can count upon receiving substantially more money \nthrough subsidies. As a result, you are able to leverage your land and \ncrops to expand. If you are one of hundreds of thousands of farmers in \nthis country who rents land as opposed to owning land, you face a very \ntough set of circumstances. Your rents are likely to go up each year as \nthe value of the land goes up. Worse still, if you are a young farmer \nwho hopes someday to own land, then your prospects diminish year by \nyear.\n  As a result, there are young members of farm families who are hopeful \nthat with the reduction or repeal of Federal estate taxes that they \nmight inherit the land. Other young people who are interested in \nfarming are simply out of luck, as it is too difficult to get into the \nbusiness. As a result, it is predictable that the average age of \nfarmers in this country will continue to increase, as it has been \nincreasing in recent decades. Consider the fact that 6 percent of \nfarmers are younger than 35, while 26 percent are over 65 years of age.\n  Furthermore, elderly farmers who may be land rich but cash poor will \nbe more inclined to sell their farms as their retirement nest egg. The \nmost likely buyer of that farm is an owner of a larger farm who is in a \nposition to expand, thanks to Government subsidies.\n  In spite of all the rhetoric and all of the attempts to talk about \nperpetuating the small family farm or even the medium-sized farm, the \nfacts are that consolidation is increasing, and this bill will \nperpetuate that cycle. I want to emphasize this point because it \nreflects the inequity of this entire bill. Our farm policies transfer a \ngreat deal of money from ordinary taxpayers to a few farmers. If this \ntransfer from the many to the few produced a stable farm economy, with \nprospects for greater trade success, perhaps one could argue this \napproach is more justified. Further, these policies could be justified \nif they truly did support the lower to middle-class farmer and reduce \nthe number of farm consolidations. I am arguing that our policies \npromote the exact opposite.\n  For all of these reasons, Senator Frank Lautenberg and I, along with \nSenators Hatch, Reed, Menendez, Cardin, Collins, Domenici, McCain, and \nWhitehouse are introducing an amendment today that would provide a true \nsafety net for all farmers regardless of what they grow or where they \nlive. For the first time, each farmer would receive, at no cost, either \nexpanded county-based crop insurance policies that would cover 85 \npercent of expected crop revenue, or 80 percent of a farm's 5-year \naverage adjusted gross revenue.\n  These subsidized insurance tools already exist, but our reforms would \nmake them more effective and universally used while controlling \nadministrative costs. Farmers would be able to purchase insurance to \ncover the remainder of their revenue and yields.\n\n[[Page S15093]]\n\nThe 85 percent county level-based policy simply looks at the expected \nrevenue annually in each county in the United States for crops such as \ncorn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and rice, but it can be expanded under \nthis bill to any commodity so long as adequate market information is \navailable to satisfy actuarial concerns.\n  The USDA uses prices from the futures market in late February and \nmultiplies them by past county average crop yields collected by the \nNational Agricultural Statistics Service, which keeps detailed data on \nvirtually every agricultural product produced in the United States. \nThis creates a target price that adjusts either up or down each year to \nmarket conditions and yield trends. Farmers receive a safety net \npayment when the actual county revenue for a crop they are growing \nfalls below 85 percent of the target revenue.\n  This program ensures that the only incentive to grow a crop is the \nmarket, not federally set prices under the farm policies before the \nSenate today.\n  For example, in Marion County, IN, where my farm is located, expected \nyields for corn in 2006 were 146 bushels an acre; the future price for \ncorn in late February 2006 was $2.59 a bushel. So target revenue for \ncorn was $378 an acre. After the harvest, USDA found that actual corn \nyields in Marion County were 140 bushels an acre and that harvest \nprices were $3.03 a bushel, producing average revenue of $424 an acre. \nActual revenue exceeded target revenue so that no additional subsidies \nwere paid to corn farmers in Marion County in 2006.\n  By contrast, corn farmers in Baca County, CO, experienced poor \nweather. Expected yields were 161 bushels an acre and the future price \nfor corn was $2.59 a bushel, so expected revenue was $418 an acre. \nAfter the harvest, USDA found that actual yields were much lower at 116 \nbushels an acre and even though the harvest prices of $3.03 a bushel \nwere higher than expected, the actual average revenue was $350 an acre. \nSince actual revenue was 83 percent of target revenue, corn farmers in \nBaca County would have received $5.30 per acre under the safety net, or \nthe difference between actual revenue in that county and the 85 percent \nguarantee.\n  The other choice would allow farmers to protect against adverse \nchange in their own historic average revenues. This program looks at \nthe whole farm, recognizing the same risks exist for an apple orchard \nas the soybean field on the same farm. A farm's 5-year average adjusted \nrevenue is calculated using annual tax forms. The adjusted revenue is \nessentially a farm's overall revenue minus expenses as indicated on \ntheir tax forms. When a farm's adjusted revenue falls below 80 percent \nof that 5-year average, a safety-net payment makes up the difference. \nThis program is currently operating as a pilot program in a number of \nStates but has been limited to the amount of revenue that can be \ncovered for some agricultural products such as livestock and forest \nproducts. Our bill expands the program nationwide and allows the USDA \nto include more agricultural products. It also requires the USDA to \nminimize double payments under situations where farmers may also have \nproducts covered by remaining farm support programs, namely the sugar \nprogram and the Milk Income Loss Program.\n  In addition, this bill creates optional risk management accounts that \nwould be available to every farmer and rancher and would work in \nconcert with crop and revenue insurance. Producers who are eligible for \ndirect payments would receive transition payments, phased out over the \nnext 5 years, which would be deposited into their accounts. They would \nthen be eligible to withdraw from their available balance to supplement \ntheir income in years when their gross revenue falls below 95 percent \nof their rolling 5-year average gross revenue. They could invest in a \nrural enterprise, purchase additional revenue or crop insurance, or \nupon retirement, utilize it as a farmer retirement account. These \naccounts provide farmers who are generally asset rich and cash poor \ngreater incentive to save for the future, and will help maintain family \nfarms by providing retirement benefits without forcing a liquidation of \nfarm assets.\n  The FRESH Act amendment is important because savings from these \nreforms will allow us to provide an additional $6.1 billion more than \nthe underlying bill in new investments to assist farmers with \nconservation practices, encourage rural development, develop renewable \nenergy, expand access to healthy foods for children and consumers, and \nassist more hungry Americans.\n  Our amendment provides an additional $1 billion for important \nenvironmental and conservation programs. I am pleased that we were able \nto expand and improve USDA's voluntary conservation incentives \nprograms, which provide financial and technical assistance to farmers, \nranchers and forest landowners who offer to take steps to prevent soil \nerosion and improve water quality, air quality and wildlife habitat.\n  Since 2003, roughly two-thirds of farmers seeking assistance through \nUSDA conservation programs have been rejected due to insufficient \nfunding. Most of these conservation programs are cost-share programs. \nThat means that farmers are offering to put their own money into \nenvironmental improvements from which the public benefits. We are \nmissing an opportunity to utilize private dollars to produce \nenvironmental benefits such as cleaner water and cleaner air when we \nunderfund cost-share conservation programs.\n  One of the most popular of these programs, the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, EQIP, has had an application backlog that has \naveraged $1.6 billion a year over the past 4 years. Yet the farm bill \nbefore us provides no increase in funding for this popular conservation \nprogram.\n  The current farm bill also provides no increase in funding for the \nFarmland Protection Program. This program is critical because in many \nareas our working farms and ranches are under tremendous development \npressures. From 1992 to 1997, this country lost more than 6 million \nacres of agricultural land--an area the size of Maryland--to \ndevelopment. And yet this bill doesn't provide the funding needed to \nassist State and local governments and private land trusts in the \nimportant work they do to conserve our Nation's farmland.\n  Increasing funding for the farm bill's conservation programs also \nprovides another way to make our farm policies more equitable. All \nproducers can be eligible to participate in conservation programs, \nregardless of what they grow or where they grow it. By contrast, only \nproducers of a handful of commodity crops can participate in commodity \nprograms.\n  While discussion of commodity policy dominates much of the farm bill \ndebate and discretionary funding, production agriculture remains a \ncomparatively small and shrinking part of the rural economy.\n  Farm employment has fallen from just over 14 percent of total \nemployment in 1969 to 6 percent in 2005. The number of counties with \nfarm employment accounting for 20 percent or more of total employment \nhas shrunk dramatically from 1,148 in 1969 to 348 in 2005. Furthermore, \nonly 1 in 75 Americans lives on a farm today, and nearly 90 percent of \ntotal farm household income comes from off-farm sources.\n  Despite this fundamental shift, the 2002 farm bill committed 69 \npercent of total spending to commodity payments, plus another 13 \npercent to conservation payments. In all, four-fifths of total funding \nwent to a select few farmers, while only 0.7 percent went to rural \ndevelopment initiatives aimed at boosting rural economies.\n  We now have evidence which suggests that direct payments to farmers \nhave little positive impact on rural economies. A recent study revealed \nthat most payment-dependent counties did not even match the national \naverage in terms of job growth from 1992 to 2002. In fact, many \nexperienced losses during that time.\n  Furthermore, most of these payment-dependent counties experienced \npopulation losses during that same 10-year period. Such job and \npopulation loss figures suggest that our current system of support for \nrural communities, which relies on subsidies like direct payments, does \nnot work.\n  I am also pleased that the amendment we are offering expands \nagricultural markets and decreases oil dependency by dramatically \nincreasing\n\n[[Page S15094]]\n\nresearch and development efforts for cellulosic ethanol and other \nrenewable fuels, and expanding clean renewable energy opportunities to \nall of our rural areas. This is an area of considerable interest to the \nchairman who has been a stalwart supporter.\n  Today's growth in ethanol production is creating jobs and bringing \nnew sources of revenue into our communities. Because of our energy \ndemands, we are witness to a palpable sense of optimism in rural \ncommunities for economic growth in areas that have stagnated under the \ncurrent farm bill. Failure to give clear and strong Government \ncommitment in the farm bill to developing biofuels from diverse \nfeedstocks has unnecessarily confined new markets to midwestern States \nrich in corn. Spreading the economic benefits of biofuels nationwide \nwill require breakthroughs in technologies and agricultural techniques \nto make more fuels from farm, municipal, and industrial wastes \navailable from coast to coast. Strong support in the farm bill will \nhelp galvanize private investment and bring jobs across the country.\n  Yet the opportunity before us involves more than economic growth. \nDramatic advancements in biofuels will help build a more secure and \nself-reliant America by reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Global \ncompetition for oil continues to grow as demand soars and oil-rich \nStates tighten their control over supplies. Already, we have witnessed \nRussia cut its exports to selected countries for political gain, and \nthe Governments of Iran and Venezuela have threatened to do the same. \nEach year, Americans spend hundreds of billions of dollars to import \noil. Some of that money enriches authoritarian governments that \nsuppress their own people and work against the United States. \nMeanwhile, oil infrastructure is being targeted by terrorists. In \ntoday's tight oil market even a small disruption in oil supplies could \ncause shortages and send prices much higher than the $90-plus per \nbarrel prices Americans have paid in recent weeks.\n  Biofuels will not make America completely independent of energy \nimports, but they can strengthen our leverage over oil-rich regimes \nhostile to the United States, give greater freedom to our policy \noptions in the Middle East, help protect our economy, and foster rural \ndevelopment.\n  Reaping the economic and energy security benefits of biofuels and \nother rural, renewable energy requires breakthroughs in research and \nincentives for infrastructure development. Our amendment provides an \nadditional half billion dollars to transform renewable energy's \nopportunity into reality.\n  During the markup in the Agriculture Committee, I offered an \namendment to increase nutrition funding in the farm bill by about $1.6 \nbillion through cuts to direct payments.\n  Unfortunately, my amendment was defeated 17-4. However, the amendment \nsparked constructive, bipartisan debate on the importance of strong \nfunding for the nutrition programs that provide a safety net for people \nacross our country who are on the cusp of poverty. I am thankful to \nSenators Harkin and Chambliss for taking that discussion seriously, and \nas a result, using the savings generated from a committee change to the \nunderlying bill to provide additional funding for the nutrition title \nof this farm bill.\n  But even as I applaud the efforts of Agriculture Committee members \nfor their attention to nutrition programs, I have serious concerns that \nthe nutrition program in this bill is essentially only authorized for 5 \nyears. At the end of the 5 years, funding for nutrition programs drops \ndramatically. In 2012, we would then be faced with having to manipulate \nthe budget to find additional funding for these programs or vulnerable \nAmericans would lose this much-needed assistance. This is because the \nagriculture bill before us is ``front-loading'' spending during the \nfirst 5 years and then virtually zeroing out nutrition spending for \nyears 6 through 10 so that the bill will come out budget neutral, on \npaper, but will cost taxpayers handsomely in reality. This is just one \nof many budgetary tricks performed so that the scoring works out \nfavorably without regard to the practical application of such \nmaneuvers.\n  In our amendment, nutrition programs would not end. In fact, we \nincrease funding for these important programs by $2 billion over the \nunderlying farm bill and make these funding increases permanent. We \ncannot and should not build a safety net with holes.\n  This leads me to another benefit of our reform proposal. Our \namendment provides critical funding for each of these priorities and \nyet pays for itself from the existing agricultural budget passed by \nCongress without employing deceptive budgetary maneuvers. In fact, our \nbill will save taxpayers $4 billion.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the case with the underlying bill, and if \nyou take a thorough look, you realize just how precarious that bill's \nbudget situation truly is. In fact, the Bush administration's Statement \nof Administrative Policy highlighted a number of budget gimmicks used \nto make the farm bill pay-go compliant, at least on paper.\n  The FRESH Act amendment is fully paid for, fiscally responsible and \nprovides a framework for growth for farmers and rural communities. \nFurthermore, the long-term budgetary savings from our proposal will \nallow for us to make considerable investments in key priority areas.\n  There is an inappropriate political assumption that agriculture \npolicy is impenetrable for consumers, taxpayers, the poor, and the vast \nmajority of Americans who are being asked to pay for subsidies, while \ngetting little in return. Even if only a small number of farmers in a \nState raise a program crop or one of the protected specialty crops like \nmilk, sugar, or peanuts, their focused advocacy somehow has more \npolitical influence than the broader well-being of consumers and \ntaxpayers. In short, those who benefit from current agriculture \nprograms are virtually the only participants in the debate.\n  This fact is probably best illustrated by the fact that one of the \nmost contentious debates on this bill has been whether farmers with \nincome of over $1 million, after farm expenses have been paid, should \ncontinue to receive subsidies. I have even seen media reports that \nindicate that if a payment limitation amendment were passed, the farm \nbill could be filibustered. Keep in mind that the median household \nincome for Americans for 2006 was $48,200 and the average income of a \nfood stamp recipient is less than $10,000.\n  There is also an ongoing reluctance to consider change. Members will \nsay, ``Farming is conservative by nature. You can't demand too much \nchange.'' In 2002, I offered a similar type of reform proposal and \nopponents argued that the proposal was ``too new, too radical, and \nrequired too much change.''\n  You will hear that same baseless argument today. Mr. President and \nMembers of the Senate, when is the time for reform? When will we fix \nthis broken system? When will we act on the clear evidence before us?\n  As Senators, we clearly must understand our responsibility. Whether \nwe understand all the complexities of our current farm programs, we \nknow where the money goes. The bulk of the money in the underlying farm \nbill goes to a very few farmers, a very few. That has been clear \nthroughout. This is not a great humanitarian effort. This does not save \nthe family farmer, the low-income farmer, or even the middle-income \nfarmer.\n  This bill is about making choices. And it is incredible to me that \nwith all of the budgetary pressures that we are facing to fund critical \nneeds such as providing better health insurance coverage for Americans, \nprotecting Social Security and pension savings, improving education, \nincreasing border security, and providing our men and women in the \nArmed Forces with appropriate pay and equipment that we would consider \na bill which enriches so few individuals.\n  I believe that this year's farm bill debate is a good time to begin \nchanging these dynamics.\n  This year an unconventional alliance of conservation, humanitarian, \nbusiness and taxpayer advocate groups has entered the fray with success \nin framing the issue and building support for the FRESH Act. They \nrepresent the broadest ever political support for change.\n  Newspapers in at least 41 States have written editorials in support \nof changing our farm programs to a fair, trade\n\n[[Page S15095]]\n\ncompliant and fiscally responsible system. I have distributed these \narticles to my colleagues.\n  Perhaps more importantly, there has never been a better time for \nfarmers to change. Thanks to strong foreign and domestic demand for \nenergy crops, net farm income is forecast to be $87 billion, up $28 \nbillion from 2006 and $30 billion above the average for the previous 10 \nyears and setting a new record for new farm income.\n  As a result, average farm household income is projected to be almost \n$87,000 in 2007, up 8 percent from 2006, 15 percent above the 5-year \naverage between 2002 and 2006, and well above median U.S. household \nincome. Farm revenue may be high today but this will not always be the \ncase. It is critical that we have an appropriate safety net in place to \nassist these farmers during times of need.\n  Agriculture policy is too important for rural America and the \neconomic and budgetary health of our country to continue the current \nmisguided path. Our amendment provides a much more equitable approach, \nproduces higher net farm income for farmers, increases farm exports, \navoids stimulating overproduction, and gives more emphasis to \nenvironmental, nutritional, energy security and research concerns. More \nimportantly, this proposal will protect the family farmer through a \nstrong safety net and encourage rural development in a fiscally \nresponsible and trade compliant manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey.)

Mr. President, more than 200 years ago, Richard Whately, \nan English logician, said:\n\n       A man is called selfish not for pursuing his own good, but \n     for neglecting his neighbor's.\n\n  Not only does our current Cuba policy make it difficult to pursue our \nown good, we are also guilty of neglecting the good of one of our \nclosest neighbors.\n  Today I am offering an amendment to enable America's farmers and \nranchers to sell their wheat, potatoes, and dairy products to a \nneighbor only 90 miles away and a market of 11 million consumers. That \nmarket, of course, is Cuba.\n  In the year 2000, Congress authorized limited sales of food and \nmedical goods to Cuba under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export \nEnhancement Act, otherwise known as TSREEA. That law permitted United \nStates farmers and ranchers to engage in cash-based sales of their \ngoods to Cuban buyers.\n  Under this new law, our agricultural trade with Cuba prospered. At \nits peak, American farmers and ranchers, including those from Montana, \nsold over $400 million worth of peas, beef, and wheat to Cuba in 1 \nyear. In fact, in the year 2003, I led a trade mission to Cuba and \nwalked away with a $10.4 million deal for Montana. Cuba bought $10.4 \nmillion of Montana wheat, beans, and peas. I went back a year later for \n$15 million worth of Montana goods. But then things changed. In 2005 \nthe Treasury Department issued rules to stymie such sales. Under the \nguise of clarifying the intent of Congress, the Treasury Department \ninstead undermined the express will of Congress by restricting the \nability of U.S. farmers and ranchers to engage in cash-basis sales. \nSpecifically, the new Treasury rule requires Cuban buyers to pay for \ntheir goods before they leave U.S. ports. What is the effect of that? \nThat converts the goods to Cuban assets, which makes them vulnerable to \nseizure in American ports to satisfy unrelated American claims against \nthe Cuban Government.\n  In order for American farmers and ranchers to sell their wheat, beef, \nand pork to Cuba, they must work with foreign banks, and surrender a \nportion of their profits to costly fees. Not surprisingly, since \nTreasury's rule, cash-basis sales of agricultural products to Cuba have \nslowed to a trickle. It made implementation of Montana's 2004 agreement \nwith Cuba virtually impossible.\n  I think I know the intent of Congress. I was here when that act was \npassed. I can assure you that we do not need Treasury's \n``clarification.'' Congress did not approve legislation to expand trade \nwith Cuba with the expectation that the administration would seek to \nrestrict it. Congress does not approve legislation to enable the sales \nof products by our farmers and ranchers, while at the same time making \nit impossible, by the Treasury Department, for them to receive payment.\n  These rules have continued to stifle the ability of farmers to sell \ntheir products to Cubans on a cash basis. They have encouraged foreign \nbanks to take a cut of every United States ag deal with Cuba. They have \nrequired farmers and ranchers to wait weeks and months to get a license \nto travel to Cuba to meet potential buyers. They prevent Cuban buyers, \nwho want to come to this country to meet with producers, who are going \nto buy the American products, from entering our country.\n  This amendment would change that. It restores the true intent of \nCongress. It simplifies the cash transactions, and expands \nopportunities for U.S. farmers and ranchers. It enables direct \ntransfers from American banks to Cuban banks. It allows American \nfarmers and ranchers to travel to Cuba to sell their products, and it \nencourages Cuban buyers to come to the United States to see our first-\nclass products for themselves.\n  These provisions are plain, simple, common sense. These provisions \nare sound policy. I had hoped we could have a discussion and a vote on \nthis amendment. But, unfortunately, some Members of this body have \nthreatened to hold up the farm bill if we include, or even vote on, \nthese important provisions.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 3660 to Amendment No. 3500 Withdrawn.\n\n  In the interest of moving the farm bill forward, it is with deep \nregret that I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of FLORIDA. Mr. President, Senator Baucus and I see eye to \neye on about 95 percent of the issues in front of the Senate. This is \none we do not agree on.\n  I thank Senator Baucus for withdrawing his amendment. He has been an \noutspoken and very articulate spokesman for his point of view of \nwanting agricultural products to go to Cuba. And coming from his State \nof Montana, I certainly understand that.\n  There is a greater issue here, in this Senator's opinion, and that is \nthe issue of the foreign policy of the United States.\n  This Senator believes this issue ought to be a foreign policy debate \non the future of the relationship of the United States with Cuba. There \nwill be an appropriate forum in which we can engage in that debate. I \nbelieve that debate will come sooner than later because there is change \nin the air and change on the island of Cuba. Fidel is transitioning \nout. Raul is transitioning in. There is a great deal of unrest among \nthe people, increasingly in a police state that has been so effective \nin tamping down any dissent over the course of the last four decades. \nIncreasingly we are seeing the people of Cuba start to resist, to \ndissent, and to do it openly. We are right on the cusp of the Castro \ngovernment starting to disintegrate and being unable to cow the people \nby imprisoning them as they have in the past.\n  What, therefore, should be the foreign policy of the United States \nwhen we are right at this moment of change? I think we ought to have a \ndeliberative discussion about that issue, instead of on the farm bill. \nThat is why I am thanking the Senator from Montana for withdrawing the \namendment. I look forward to that debate. I look forward to this \nextraordinary change that is occurring on the island of Cuba so that \nultimately those people will be able to break the shackles of bondage \nthey have been in, and we can have a normal relationship between the \nGovernment of Cuba and the Government of the United States when that \ncountry finally does become free. That is our\n\n[[Page S15097]]\n\nhope, our prayer. That should be the goal of the foreign policy of the \nUnited States. It is within our grasp shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I join with my senior colleague in \nthanking the distinguished Senator from Montana for withdrawing this \namendment which was ill-timed on this farm bill. Much important farm \nlegislation and related items are in this bill. To now inject into it \nthe very difficult issue, as my senior colleague well described, of a \nvery fine-tuned policy, a foreign policy issue with Cuba into this bill \nwould be a grave mistake.\n  I want to speak in a little broader context about the relationship \nbetween the United States and Cuba. It is one that is rooted--and the \nreason this proposed amendment would be so wrong--in the steps the \nCastro government took against U.S. economic interests on the island \nalmost a half century ago, all uncompensated, never accounted for, and \nnever taken care of. It is a debt that still exists. Legitimate \nbusiness interests had their property taken from them without just \ncompensation. That is why we have the policy we have today.\n  The question is, how can we influence events, how can we better help \nthe Cuban people to overthrow the shackles that have held them in \nprison for 47 years?\n  The fact is, there is an awful lot happening on the island. People \nare increasingly saying enough is enough. It is time for change. \nCimbio, the Spanish word for change, on this little bracelet that the \npeople around the island are wearing increasingly represents the desire \nof the Cuban people. The Cuban regime, true to its nature, continues to \nrepress the people. Here is why we should not reward the Cuban \nGovernment with a change in U.S. policy.\n  Yesterday, Human Rights Day around the world was celebrated in Cuba \nby a small group of people seeking to simply peacefully march to Ghandi \nPark, a park where Ghandi, that peaceful icon of the world, is \nrepresented. On their way there, Government thugs beat and arrested \nthem, took them into unmarked sedans, and removed them from the area. \nSo threatened is that Government that they also arrested 70 young \npeople a month or so ago for wearing this simple bracelet. But that is \nnot all. The most unheard of human rights abuse has taken place in \nrecent days. In addition to the illegitimate detention of political \nprisoners in the most unspeakable conditions is the fact that the Cuban \nGovernment thugs entered a Catholic Church just a few days ago and \narrested 18 young people who were there exercising the very limited \nright they have to at least attend church and to hear a sermon and to \nmaybe have conversations about their hopes and dreams. The Cuban \nGovernment invaded that sacred space, took the people and arrested \nthem. These are just a few examples of why this Government so \nillegitimately each day loses a little more of its grip on the people.\n  I believe the time will come when we can trade with Cuba, when we can \nhave open relationships, and when we can see the fruits of that \nrelationship benefit the people of Cuba, not just the Government \nstructure with which America's farmers are dealing. We should not give \ncredit to the Cuban Government. We know these cash sales are the only \nway we can be sure our people will be paid, and we should not enhance \nor increase the opportunity for the Cuban Government, which is the only \nowner of anything in Cuba. No one owns any property in Cuba but the \nCuban Government. To trade with Cuba does not mean trading with Cuban \nfarmers. It means trading with the Cuban Government apparatus. The \nCuban people only see the meager droppings from the table of the \ntourists who go to Cuba with whom they are not allowed to even have a \nconversation.\n  Oftentimes people say: If we only opened the opportunity for people \nto freely travel, if we only allowed for the contact Americans would \nhave with ordinary Cubans, everything would change. There are Canadian \ntourists, British, Italian. Their impact upon the Cuban people has not \nchanged a thing because the tourists are prohibited from interacting \nwith the people themselves. The people are just their servants. The \npeople are the people who facilitate a fun time in the sun, but they \nare not allowed to have any political influence upon the people of \nCuba.\n  I know there was a hearing this morning. I would love to comment \nfurther on that because much was said there which I believe to be \ncompletely wrong. But I thank the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, \nwho, in this hearing this morning, spoke about his 5 months in Cuba. I \nsaw Senator Bunning when he was in Cuba during that time as a young \nboy. I had the pleasure of going to a stadium and watching him pitch, \nwhich was a thrill to me. Little did I know I would have the honor of \nserving with him in the Senate. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nhis very good words and his clear understanding of the Cuban situation \nas it is today.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for withdrawing an ill-timed and \nill-advised amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent that whatever time is used \nduring the quorum be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3720 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I may call up my amendment and that the time \nI use to describe my amendment not be charged against the time for the \nSenators from New Jersey and Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3720 to amendment No. 3500.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nSenator Harkin's substitute amendment to the farm bill. I commend \nChairman Harkin, Senator Chambliss, and all the members of the \nAgriculture Committee for their hard work during the drafting of this \nfarm bill.\n  I particularly thank the committee for its commitment to making this \nbill the most fair in our country's history. The committee's farm bill \nincludes all agricultural producers, not just growers of commodity \ncrops. With new programs for specialty growers and expanded protections \nfor dairy and livestock producers, this bill is truly a winner for all \nparts of the country.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa once again, now that he is in the \nChamber, for his great work and for being inclusive as he always is.\n  I am here this morning offering an amendment I believe builds on the \nspirit of the committee's bill. This amendment increases funding for \nvital conservation programs that are important to all working farmers. \nIt provides an additional $480 million over 5 years to the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP; an additional $65 \nmillion over 5 years to the Farmland Protection Program; and an \nadditional $60 million to the Grassland Reserve Program.\n  To offset these increased payments, the amendment makes small \nreductions in the Federal subsidies of crop insurance. It increases the \ncut in administration and operations payments to 4 percent, above the \ncommittee's 2 percent, and retains the important snap-back provision \nSenator Roberts introduced.\n  The amendment also raises the underwriting gain share to 12.5 \npercent. That is the level to which the House raised it.\n  Working farmers are the most important stewards of our natural \nresources. Farmers and ranchers own 70 percent of the land in the \ncountry. They deserve help from the Government preserving these \nresources because all Americans benefit from them.\n  I would also like to add, I am in full support of the amendment--I am \na cosponsor, in fact, of the amendment--the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nBrown, has offered. This amendment is along the same lines, and I will \nnot ask for a vote on it if his amendment succeeds because I think it \nis an outstanding amendment.\n  With that, I yield back the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/11/senate-section/article/S15098-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 41 minutes on the Republican side and \n84 minutes on the majority side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wish to be alerted by the Chair when I have consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will be happy to do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to respond to the proposal by \nSenator Lugar and Senator Lautenberg to substitute the Food and Energy \nSecurity Act of 2007 with the so-called FRESH Act.\n  Senator Lugar and Senator Lautenberg are senior Members of this body, \nvery much respected by Members on both sides. I have enormous respect \nand admiration, and I even have affection for both of them. But I must \nsay, when it comes to farm policy, we have a stark disagreement. \nSenator Lugar believes we would be better off if we simply disposed of \nthe current farm safety net in favor of a revenue program with no price \nfloor. Savings would be invested in conservation, nutrition, and \nspecialty crop agriculture. I believe those are good priorities, in \nterms of where the money would go, but I remind Members of the Senate \nthat the work of the committee--by the way, the bill came out of \ncommittee without a single dissenting vote. It is true we didn't have a \nrollcall, so I don't know how members might have expressed themselves, \nbut nobody asked for a rollcall or asked to be recorded in the \nnegative.\n  The fact is we increased each of those areas that is addressed in the \nFRESH Act. We increased conservation over the baseline by $4.5 billion. \nWe increased nutrition by $5.3 billion over the baseline. We increased \nspecialty crop resources by $2.5 billion. Those are all very large \nincreases. The biggest percentage increase went for conservation.\n  When it comes to investing in the things Senators Lugar and \nLautenberg care about, the committee did a good job. So if this is not \nabout investments in those areas, what is the real difference? I don't \nthink this bill is about resources for other areas; I think it is \nlargely about finding a way to gut existing commodity programs.\n  I have heard statements in support of the FRESH Act that amount to \nbroadsides against existing policy. So let me respond to some of the \narguments we have heard from the other side. Let's examine the attacks \non the distribution of farm program benefits.\n  The critics say only 43 percent of all farms received payments. The \ncritics say that 57 percent of farms unfairly operate without a safety \nnet. The critics say the largest 8 percent of all farms receive 58 \npercent of the farm program benefits. All of those statements have some \nelement of truth, but they don't tell the whole story. They don't come \nclose to telling the whole story. In fact, taken alone, I think they \ncompletely misrepresent the reality of the farm program. Let's look at \neach of these claims in turn.\n  According to the Economic Research Service, farming operations \nreceiving no Government payments had an average household income of \nover $77,000 per year. But the farm income portion of that was only \n$1,000. So when the assertion is made that almost half of the\n\n[[Page S15099]]\n\nfarms get no farm program benefits, guess what. Those people are not \nfarmers. They have an average income of $77,000, and only a thousand of \nit comes from farming operations. Those people are not engaged in \nfarming in any meaningful way. What this tells me about the 57 percent \nof farms operating without a safety net is that a big chunk of them \naren't much into farming at all. The largest portion of them farmed \nonly marginally, or do so as a hobby.\n  Our own son is in that category. They have a little farm, with over \n$1,000 in receipts. So they are counted in all of the statistics as \nbeing a farmer, because that is all it takes--$1,000 of receipts--and \nyou are counted as a farmer. But he has a job in town, a full-time job. \nHe is basically a hobby farmer. Yet they are saying he should be \ngetting farm program benefits; that it is unfair because he is not \ngetting farm program benefits. No. That applies to the first argument.\n  The absurdity of trying to claim that these producers are terribly \nmistreated is the fact that the FRESH Act's own risk management \naccounts would not allow them to participate either. So I guess what is \ngood for the goose is good for the gander. That is because the eligible \nparticipant is someone with an AGI from farm operations of $10,000 or \nmore. They would not count them as farmers at all. If the proponents do \nnot call the majority receiving Government payments farmers, why should \nthey be clamoring to find support for them in the commodity support \nprovisions?\n  Part of the problem is the way farmers are defined for statistical \npurposes. To quote from the Economic Research Service:\n\n       Most establishments classified as farms are too small to \n     support a household because the official U.S. farm definition \n     requires only $1,000 of sales to qualify as a farm.\n\n  So the first criticism we hear is without merit. I would like to \nthink of farm households as those that actually obtain a significant \nportion of their income from a farming operation. When you look at \nthose households, you get a completely different picture.\n  This chart shows where Government program payments go when compared \nto gross receipts of farming operations. You see a very different \nreality. If you look at all of the farms with gross farm receipts above \n$50,000, you will see that only 23 percent of roughly 2 million total \nfarms are responsible for 90 percent of farm receipts. But their share \nof Government payments is actually somewhat less, totaling just over 81 \npercent.\n  So here is the reality. Those with receipts of over $50,000 account \nfor only 23 percent of farms, but they do 90 percent of the business \nand they get 81 percent of farm program payments. Actually, it is \nsomewhat less than their percentage of actual production.\n  The group signified on the left, with sales less than $50,000, \nconstitutes nearly 77 percent of farms, but produces about 10 percent \nof gross farm receipts. Yet their share of Government payments is \nnearly double their percentage of those gross receipts. Let me \nemphasize that: 77 percent of farms, as tallied by the USDA, are below \n$50,000 in receipts. They do about 10 percent of the production and get \na disproportionate share of the benefits.\n  It is amazing what different conclusion one reaches when one actually \nresearches the underlying facts.\n  I will repeat that first statistic again. Farms with gross receipts \nof over $50,000 account for only 23 percent of our farms, but they \nproduce 90 percent of the foodstuffs we consume, and they receive 81 \npercent of Government payments.\n  When you drill deeper into the data, farms with receipts of less than \n$10,000 constitute 58 percent of total farm numbers. Yet they produce \nless than 4 percent of total farm production and still receive 7 \npercent of Government payments.\n  So the conclusion one reaches, if one actually examines these data, \nis totally different than the story being told by the critics. These \nstatistics from USDA's Economic Research Service clearly show how \nGovernment payments go to those actually producing the food. That is \nwhat is happening. You get farm program benefits roughly in \nrelationship to your share of production. That is the way it is \ndesigned to be. That is the way it is. Don't let anyone try to tell you \nsomething different.\n  To the extent there are farming operations that don't participate and \nyet provide a great deal of sales, this farm bill seeks to help them \nthrough investments in specialty crop agriculture and a broad-based \ndisaster assistance program. But to suggest that the vast majority of \nfarms is being mistreated by the farm program is simply false. It is \nnot true; it is not fair; it is not accurate. In fact, the smallest \nproducers get a bigger share of Government payments relative to \nreceipts than do the largest producers.\n  Also, I seriously question how replacing the marketing loan, \ncountercyclical, and direct payment programs with area and farm revenue \nprograms would change how payments are distributed.\n  In fact, these free ``revenue'' programs would almost certainly \nfollow production, and they don't have any internal payment limitations \nor adjusted gross income limitations provided in the titles being \neliminated. They would concentrate payments even more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 11 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask to be alerted when I have taken another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The FRESH program would actually concentrate payments \neven more. Wouldn't that be ironic? The proponents of the bill are \ntrying to make the case that the policy contained in the committee bill \nviolates our trade commitments. All of this talk of trade violations or \npotential actions against the United States on trade can be a bit \nconfusing for Members. Let me attempt to reduce the confusion.\n  First, the current WTO rules limit our trade-distorting domestic \nsupport to $19 billion a year. The Congressional Budget Office says \npayments under this farm bill will be less than that. When it comes to \npotential actions against the United States by countries such as Brazil \nand Canada, it appears they are throwing the kitchen sink at us, hoping \nto make something stick. It has gotten so ridiculous that Brazil even \nclaims that excise tax exemptions on off-road fuel are a trade \nviolation. You have to admire them for their creativity. We cannot \nwrite a farm bill based on some agreement that has yet to be written. \nSometimes we do a pretty good job of predicting the future here, but I \ndon't know how we can direct what a future trade agreement might look \nlike. To say we are violating an agreement that has not been written, \nmade, or passed is an empty exercise. It is our responsibility to write \na policy for agriculture that is in the best interests of America, not \nin the best interests of those who want to be critics.\n  The reductions in support to crop insurance that are contained in \nthis alternative proposal could destroy the program. Cutting $25 \nbillion from the crop insurance program will lead to companies simply \nwalking away and crop insurance not being available when it is \ndesperately needed.\n  I believe crop insurance needs a serious look, needs reform, but \ntaking an axe to it is simply, I believe, simplistic and \ncounterproductive. I would rather we do a serious study on how to \nreform crop insurance and follow those results, rather than an ad hoc \nvote here on the floor.\n  I want to direct colleagues' attention to the potential catastrophic \nimpacts this bill would have on farm income if this amendment were \nadopted.\n  Texas A did an analysis by actually going to farms across America \nand looking at their books and records and determining the effect of \nthis amendment on those farms and their incomes.\n  Twenty-four of the twenty-five representative crop farms would see \nmore than a 25-percent reduction in their cash income. Seventeen of the \nrepresentative crop farms would experience more than a 25-percent \ndecline in ending net worth by the end of the period.\n  With lower commodity prices the ``provisions do not come close to \nproviding the same amount of support as the programs in the 2002 farm \nbill, and should such a low price scenario occur in the future, most of \nthe farmers and ranchers would not be able to survive the erosion in \nfarm income without some additional Government support.''\n\n[[Page S15100]]\n\n  This is a bankruptcy proposal for rural America if prices turn down. \nLet's be clear about the consequences of this amendment. It can be \nsummed up in two words: mass bankruptcy. That will be the result if a \nproposal such as this is adopted and, God forbid, prices decline, and \ndecline sharply, and we have seen that repeatedly in agriculture.\n  Essentially, what this study says from Texas A is, if prices remain \nhigh, the impacts of this bill would be substantial, but when low \nprices return--and they have a bad habit of returning in agriculture--\nproposals such as the FRESH Act would pull the rug out from under our \nproducers and result in financial ruin for them. That is what the \nexperts at Texas A have concluded.\n  I don't think the American people are interested in mass bankruptcy \nin rural America. For those who would like you to believe that our farm \npolicy has not benefited the people of our country and, indeed, the \npeople of the world, I will leave my colleagues with the words of a \nrecent Wall Street Journal article.\n  I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. This is what the Wall Street Journal said:\n\n       The prospect for a long boom is riveting economists because \n     the declining real price of grain has long been one of the \n     unsung forces behind the development of the global economy. \n     Thanks to steadily improving seeds, synthetic fertilizer and \n     more powerful farm equipment, the productivity of farmers in \n     the West and Asia has stayed so far ahead of population \n     growth that prices of corn and wheat, adjusted for inflation, \n     had dropped 75 percent and 69 percent, respectively, since \n     1974. Among other things, falling grain prices made food more \n     affordable for the world's poor, helping shrink the \n     percentage of the world's population that is malnourished.''\n\n  We never hear it from the critics, but the Wall Street Journal is \nreporting that one of the key reasons for the economic boom in the \nworld is the increase in productivity in agriculture led by the West, \nled by our country. That amazing increase in productivity has in real \nterms dramatically reduced the cost of corn and wheat by 75 percent and \n69 percent since 1974. I think those words should be taken to heart.\n  U.S. agricultural policy has provided enormous advantages to all of \nour citizens and to the world. I cannot imagine what would happen \nwithout it.\n  I conclude by reviewing the distribution of funding for this package \nand the investments made in nutrition and conservation.\n  Under the bill proposed by the Senate Agriculture Committee, the \namount for commodity programs is reduced more than 11 percent, to 13.6 \npercent of total outlays, while establishing many new programs to \nbenefit speciality crop producers.\n  Spending for nutrition programs remains at about two-thirds of total \noutlays. Let me repeat that. Where is most of the money going in this \nbill? Where is most of the money going? It is going to nutrition. That \nis the bill that came out of the committee. Sixty-six percent of the \nmoney is going for nutrition. We don't hear that from the critics, but \nthat is a fact. Less than 14 percent is going for commodity programs, \nand that is an 11-percent reduction from the previous bill.\n  This bill, the bill out of committee, represents a significant \nredirection of resources in areas we all know is necessary. And we \ndidn't need to gut farm programs to make these investments.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this proposal and support the \ncommittee package that is before us. It is responsible, it is good for \ntaxpayers, it is good for farmers and ranchers, it is good for the \neconomy, it is good for nutrition, it is good for conservation. It \ndeserves our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I wish to propose a unanimous consent \nrequest. First, I wish to let everybody know where we are. A vote was \noriginally scheduled for sometime around 3:45 p.m. It is likely to be a \nlittle bit before that. My understanding is that Senator Lautenberg has \nsome comments he wants to make on this amendment. I will make some \ncomments. Senator Lugar may have additional comments he wishes to make \nbefore the vote.\n  Following the vote on the Lugar-Lautenberg amendment, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Gregg be allowed 1 hour equally divided on his \namendments Nos. 3671, 3673, and 3674; that following Senator Gregg, \nSenator Alexander have 1 hour equally divided on his amendments Nos. \n3551 and 3552; that following Senator Alexander, Senator Coburn have 90 \nminutes equally divided on his amendments Nos. 3530, 3632, and 3807. \nSenator Harkin may have some Democratic amendments that we may place \namong those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I discussed this with my colleague \nearlier, but we are also working on a unanimous consent request. There \nis another amendment we might want to insert. If my friend will \nwithhold, I think we can work this out in a discussion, and then we can \npropound the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. That is fine. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the amendment have 41 \nminutes remaining, and for the opponents of the amendment, there is 62 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I again ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the vote, which I understand is going to be at approximately \n3:30 p.m., the following amendments be called up in this order: Senator \nGregg's amendments Nos. 3671, 3673, and 3674; that debate be 1 hour \nequally divided; then following that debate, Senator Alexander on \namendments Nos. 3551 and 3553 for 1 hour equally divided; and Senator \nCoburn on amendments Nos. 3530, 3632, and 3807, with 90 minutes equally \ndivided; and that these votes will be stacked for sometime tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, reserving the right to object, I, first of all, \nthank my colleague for working out this agreement. This is great \nprogress. We have great time agreements. I appreciate his work in that \nregard.\n  I wish to make it clear, was it the intention of my friend to have \nthem all in that order? Can they be in a different order when they come \nup or when people are here?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The request does not pretend to set the order, the \nvote of the respective amendments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Further reserving the right to object, I ask my friend, \nhe said earlier if, in fact, a Democrat comes with an amendment on this \nside--I don't have one right now--that they could at that time work it \nin. We have at least one I know we might want to call up later today.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Sure. We will be happy to amend it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. With that, I have no objections.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois will state his \nreservation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Do I understand the unanimous consent request calls for \nspecific amendments after the pending amendment is voted on?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I followed this in my office. May I ask the Senator from \nGeorgia if he would be kind enough to tell me, I understand amendment \nNo. 3671 is on his list, Senator Gregg's amendment.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What are those amendments?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Amendment No. 3671 is striking the farm stress \nprogram, and amendment No. 3673 is the OB/GYN liability reform.\n\n[[Page S15101]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is there another request?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Amendment No. 3674, the mortgage forgiveness \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the Senator's unanimous consent request, is there any \ntime limit on the amendments?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Yes, 1 hour equally divided for all three.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 3711 occur at 3:50 p.m., with the time \ndivided 45 minutes for Senators Lugar and Lautenberg and 15 minutes in \nopposition, with the remaining provisions of the previous order \nremaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before I speak to the amendment \nSenator Lugar and I have offered, I wish to express my thanks to \nChairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss and the entire Agriculture \nCommittee for the weeks of work that represent the foundation of this \nlegislation.\n  I also particularly thank Senator Lugar for bringing his experience \nand knowledge to the development of our amendment. His background \ncarries the tradition of generations of family farming in Indiana, \nwhere over 600 acres of theirs are still under production, and he calls \nfor farming to be continued as a significant part of America's culture. \nHe understands how critical it is to our national well-being that \nfamily farms exist independently to produce the nutritious foods that \nhelp America maintain a healthy population.\n  Although I didn't grow up on a farm, I do have experience in the \nbusiness world, and our alliance on this issue brings together two \nviews on the farm bill and what we ought to do in the interest of our \ncountry. That business experience I had matches up well with Senator \nLugar's experience in this amendment because I learned in my business \nexperience that fair and balanced competition for all products will \nresult in quality products at low prices, and we ought not to be \nsubsidizing the extremely well-off producers at the expense of family \nfarmers who need help to continue to be able to offer their produce in \nthe marketplace.\n  Writing a law such as the farm bill is no simple task, with the \nvaried views on how we put nutritious food on family tables at costs \nthat are affordable. I believe the bill on the floor helps farmers and \nmillions of Americans in several ways that fulfill our responsibility \nas public servants. For example, it imposes limits on the amount of \ntaxpayer money that can be used to subsidize our already profitable \nfarms. It offers opportunities to produce more renewable fuels to \nconserve energy and conservation to keep farmlands in existence.\n  Despite these improvements, we need more changes for serious reform. \nI know many of my colleagues agree with Senator Lugar and me on the \nneed to do more to encourage all farmers to continue to produce food \nand nourishment at the best quality and lowest possible price while \nthey earn a livelihood.\n  America grows thousands of crops, but the bill before us includes $42 \nbillion in subsidies for only five--corn, cotton, rice, soybeans, and \nwheat. Most of that money goes not to struggling farmers who are \nspending long hours in the fields away from their families toiling to \nbring enough crops to market to merely get by and resisting the \nseduction of selling their land at high prices to developers for \ncommercial purposes, but the money is going to those who are already \nraking in record profits, and I want to demonstrate what I mean.\n  This chart says it all: 10 percent of farms receive nearly 75 percent \nof the subsidies. Think of it--10 percent receive nearly 75 percent of \nthe subsidies. The 10 percent of the farms we talk about from this \nchart are those well-off farmers and agribusinesses--the ones that are \nbringing in giant profits. As a matter of fact, they received $120 \nbillion in subsidies in the last 10 years. In fact, our current farm \npolicy funnels subsidy checks into the mailboxes of millionaire \nlandowners and agribusinesses across the country. Even someone who \nmight have just become familiar with this situation in front of us \nwould tell you that it doesn't make sense to fund huge farms and \nbusinesses while failing to help farmers continue producing crops \nessential to our national well-being on smaller farms that preserve the \ntraditions that made America strong and independent.\n  We all recognize that the Agriculture Committee wants America's farms \nto thrive, our economy to be strong, and Americans to eat healthy \nfoods, but I ask, if every farmer is helping to feed America, shouldn't \nAmerica be helping every farmer? The answer is, without question, of \ncourse. We need a farm bill that helps farmers across the country \nregardless of where they farm or what they grow. We need a farm bill \nthat invests in more than just crops. It must invest in nutrition and \nin healthier foods, such as fruits and vegetables, so that our children \nare not burdened with obesity, diabetes, and other serious illnesses \nthat are the side effects of poor nutrition. It must provide more in \nfood stamps so that modest, hard-working parents who face tough times \ncan still prepare quality, nutritious foods for their families to eat. \nAnd it must invest in conservation so that our green spaces do not fall \nvictim to highrises and commercial buildings and so that we don't \ndestroy the Earth that our children and grandchildren call home by \nturning it into concrete highways and buildings.\n  The Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, and I have offered a plan for \nreform. We are from different States and different experiences. My \ncolleague, Senator Lugar, grew up on a farm, whereas I grew up in the \ncity, but when it comes to the farm bill, Senator Lugar and I see eye \nto eye on the challenges America and its lands face, and we have a \nshared vision for the path forward. We see that our subsidies are for \nonly a handful of crops in our country and are going to the giant \nagribusinesses instead of smaller farms. The taxpayer-funded handouts \nwe turned over to those businesses in the last 5 years totaled $72 \nbillion. We gave them $72 billion. Think about that. The profits of \nfour out of the five largest crops that get subsidies will set alltime \nrecords this year.\n  This has been a prosperous year for a lot of people who run the large \nagribusinesses and the large profit-making farms. As I said, alltime \nrecords are being set this year, according to the Department of \nAgriculture. At the same time, crops such as fruits and vegetables and \nother nutritious foods we want to see on American tables do not get the \nsame kind of help. My State of New Jersey, for example, has many farms \nin our densely populated State. We are called the Garden State for a \nreason. We have major growers of blueberries, cranberries, and lettuce, \nfor example, near the marketplace. Those nutritious fruits and \nvegetables go directly from our farms to markets in the cities, saving \nunnecessary fuel and transportation costs while improving the health of \nour residents at the same time. But the current farm bill fails to aid \nand encourage these farmers across the country, and that is why the \nLugar-Lautenberg amendment makes so much sense.\n  Our plan for reform will help every farmer in America grow their \ncrops and feed the Nation. I demonstrate here what I mean.\n  As we refer to here, our amendment provides for free crop insurance \nto protect all farmers from major losses. Our plan replaces the current \nsystem of subsidies with smart and free insurance programs to protect \nall farmers from catastrophes such as drought or pest infestation. \nWhether farmers grows corn or cranberries, soybeans or squash, their \nlivelihoods are protected so they can continue to provide nutritious \nmeals that are essential for the health of children and families across \nthe country.\n  Our plan guarantees that the income of farmers will not fall so \nseverely that\n\n[[Page S15102]]\n\nthey stop farming. It protects all farmers, most of whom will be \ncovered against losses of 15 percent or more in any year whether they \ngrow and harvest 20 acres or 2,000 acres.\n  This approach is not only more equitable for every farmer, but it is \nfar less expensive--for them and for every American taxpayer. With the \nmoney we save, we are going to be able to invest $2.5 billion more in \nnutrition programs, food stamps, and specialty crops such as potatoes, \ntomatoes, and oranges. With more support for nutritional foods such as \nfruits and vegetables, Americans can provide healthier meals and fight \nhealth problems such as diabetes and obesity, and more money for food \nstamps will help the 26 million Americans who rely on food stamps to \nstay alive and keep their heads above water, to feed themselves and \ntheir families.\n  It is shocking to note that some of the food stamp recipients are \nexpected to survive on $10 a month--think about that, $10 a month. It \nis a paltry sum by any standard. We checked prices at a local \nsupermarket recently, and if you add up the cost of a loaf of bread, a \ngallon of milk, a pound of cheese, and a dozen eggs, you are already \nover $10. How is it possible for people to sustain themselves with that \nsmall amount of funds at their disposal? Helping those with the least \nis exactly what America is about. By increasing money for food stamps, \nour amendment goes in the right direction.\n  Our plan invests $1 billion more than does the bill on the floor in \nconservation programs that assure farmers they can protect their land \nfrom pollution and urban sprawl. All of us see what is happening now to \nfarmland, to the green areas. They are falling prey to development at \npaces that frighten us. Cities across the country are beginning to say \nno more development here. And the best way to stem the tide is to give \nfarmers the ability to preserve and conserve their land. Right now our \nfarmers who want to participate in these programs are limited because \nthey do not have the funds.\n  Our plan invests a half billion dollars more into alternative \nenergies. With oil prices and concerns about global warming on the \nrise, this investment addresses both of these urgent problems.\n  Finally, our reform plan does what the public wants us to do: to be \ngood stewards of the taxpayers' money by putting $4 billion toward \npaying down the Federal deficit. Think about it, our national debt is \ngrowing out of control, our deficits are growing, and we are constantly \nlooking for ways to fund domestic programs. At least we will begin to \narrest in significant part the growth of the annual deficit with $4 \nbillion at the same time we accomplish the goal of helping those who do \nfarming, those who have modest pieces of land and have businesses that \nare difficult to maintain in this day of competition.\n  Every State in America has agriculture, so we need a farm policy that \nhelps every State. The plan that Senator Lugar and I have offered is in \nthe best interests of every American farmer and thus every American \nfamily. The men and women whose labor, sweat, and toil feed the Nation \ndeserve nothing less, and we hope it will be recognized on the floor of \nthis Chamber that we want to encourage farmers to stay on the farms; \nthat we want to encourage the availability of products that are \nnutritional and will aid the health of our population.\n  I yield the floor and ask the remainder of my time be reserved for \nSenator Lugar as he indicated he desired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill) The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my good friends, Senator Lugar and Senator Lautenberg.\n  The purpose of this amendment is supposedly to ``serve more farmers \nmore fairly and be responsive to regional and national crises that \nendanger the continuing success of America's farmers.''\n  For farmers in my region and in my State, this amendment does the \nopposite of that: if enacted, it would seriously endanger the success \nof my farmers.\n  This amendment removes the safety net that producers support, most of \nit immediately and the rest over a period of time. Here is what it \ndoes:\n  phases out nontrade distorting direct payments that are critical for \nfarmer financing and support;\n  removes the availability of a nonrecourse marketing loan that \nproducers rely upon to market their crops;\n  removes countercyclical support that is necessary in times of low \nprices;\n  allows, without the limitation contained in the committee-approved \nbill, production of fruits and vegetables for processing on any base \nacreage, which is a serious concern to the specialty crop industry.\n  Madam President, 26 agricultural organizations have signed a letter \nurging Senators not to support this amendment because it eliminates the \nsafety net provided to producers and shifts significantly more funding \nout of the commodity title.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge you NOT to co-sponsor \n     or support S. 2228, the Farm, Ranch, Equity, Stewardship and \n     Health (FRESH) Act, as either a stand-alone bill or as an \n     amendment to the Farm Bill.\n       The FRESH Act eliminates the current safety net provided to \n     U.S. producers and shifts considerable funding to \n     conservation, nutrition, energy and other programs. It is \n     easy to look at current high prices for most agricultural \n     commodities and assume it is a ``good time'' to lower \n     government supports. It is critical to remember that farm \n     bills are written for the long-term rather than short-term \n     and that there is no assurance high prices will continue over \n     the next 5-10 years.\n       Additionally, the commodity title of the farm bill has \n     already taken a $57 billion cut. In 2002 Congress committed \n     $98.9 billion to commodity programs. According to the March \n     2007 CBO baseline, commodity title outlays are projected at \n     only $42 billion over the life of the new farm bill. All \n     told, the commodity programs are projected to be about 10% of \n     total farm bill spending, while more than 80% of the farm \n     bill spending is already slated for nutrition and \n     conservation programs.\n       Our organizations support the safety net provided in the \n     bill which was unanimously approved by the Senate Agriculture \n     Committee. The stringent requirements placed on the risk \n     management accounts that replace this safety net in the FRESH \n     Act would not provide producers with the necessary \n     flexibility to effectively manage their operations. Aside \n     from crop losses, producers can face a wide range of \n     challenges, including dramatically increasing input prices.\n       Our organizations believe the farm bill can live up to our \n     current WTO obligations without gutting the critical safety \n     net needed by producers. U.S. farm policy should continue \n     toward a more level playing field in the global market by \n     providing assistance to America's farmers. However, this goal \n     is not achieved by writing a farm bill that complies with \n     what someone assumes will be the potential outcome of the WTO \n     negotiations.\n       Finally, while we support strong conservation, nutrition, \n     and energy programs, additional support for these programs \n     should not come at the expense of adequate funding for the \n     safety net for American farmers.\n       We ask that you do not sign on as a cosponsor or support S. \n     2228 as a stand-alone bill or as an amendment to the Farm \n     Bill.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Farm Bureau, National Farmers Union, National \n     Association of Wheat Growers, Southern Peanut Farmers \n     Federation, USA Rice Federation, American Soybean \n     Association, Peanut Growers Marketing Cooperative, North \n     Carolina Peanut Growers, Virginia Peanut Growers, American \n     Beekeeping Federation, Rice Belt Warehouses Inc., United \n     Dairymen of Arizona, American Association of Crop Insurers, \n     National Sorghum Producers.\n       US Rice Producers Association, Crop Insurance Professionals \n     Association, American Sheep Industry Association, National \n     Council of Farmer Cooperatives, Western Peanut Growers \n     Association, National Cotton Council, American Sugar \n     Alliance, National Barley Growers Association, National \n     Sunflower Association, USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council, US \n     Canola Association, and American Honey Producers Association.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Senator Lugar's amendment replaces the current safety \nnet with several measures--two of which are related to crop insurance \nand revenue protection.\n  I greatly appreciate Senator Lugar's interest in expanding crop \ninsurance coverage, because there are very few farmers in my State who \nare even eligible to purchase the coverage Senator Lugar uses as a \ncomponent of his safety net. I appreciate his interest in expanding the \nGroup Risk Income Protection--GRIP--and Group Risk Protection--GRP--\nwhich are county-level revenue plans of insurance, but I have serious \nconcerns about building the safety net around these programs as a \nreplacement to traditional commodity programs.\n\n[[Page S15103]]\n\n  While GRIP and GRP may be popular, workable programs in Indiana, they \nare not in Georgia. Of the 159 counties in my home State, these \npolicies are only offered in: for soybeans, 7 counties; for corn, 9 \ncounties; for wheat, 4 counties; for cotton, 16 counties; for peanuts, \nabout 25 counties.\n  In Georgia in 2006, only 47 of these policies were sold and earned \npremium; 47 for the whole State out of over 13,000 total policies sold \nand earning premium. Only seven of those triggered indemnity payments. \nOne of those 47 producers called my office and said he wished he had \nnever taken it because it did not provide individualized coverage.\n  Let's look at participation in States in which this coverage is more \nwidely available. Nebraska in 2006 sold 576 GRIP and GRP policies of \nthe 90,896 total policies sold and earning premium. That is less than 1 \npercent of all policies. Kansas in 2006 sold 110 GRIP and GRP policies \nout of a total of 117,984. Again, less than 1 percent of all policies. \nSouth Dakota in 2006 sold 20 GRIP and GRP policies out of a total of \n59,648 policies. Again, less than 1 percent of all policies. North \nDakota in 2006 sold 9 GRIP policies and 0 GRP policies out of a total \nof 69,539 policies. Again, less than 1 percent of all policies. \nIllinois and Indiana have a different experience: 20 percent in each of \nthese States were GRIP/GRP policies.\n  I am very glad these products are viable risk management tools in \nIllinois and Indiana and possibly other States, and I want those folks \nto continue to use them. But I wonder why producers in these other \nStates aren't purchasing these products. And I question how prudent it \nis to include these products as a significant component of a \nreplacement so-called safety net when few producers are voluntarily \npurchasing them in most places except Illinois and Indiana.\n  Again, while I appreciate Senator Lugar's interest in expanding this \ncoverage, I do not support it as a replacement to the safety net \nprovided in the committee-approved bill, which contains a safety net \nthat producers have voiced support for and works especially for my home \nState.\n  Crop insurance has experienced tremendous growth and success since \nthe enactment of the 2000 reform bill. In 2007, farmers insured more \nthan 271 million acres, with an estimated crop loss liability of $67 \nbillion. In my home State in 1994, only 38 percent of eligible acres \nwere insured; and in 2006, 89 percent of eligible acres were insured.\n  In the committee-approved farm bill, over $4.7 billion has been taken \nout of the crop insurance program to fund other farm bill priorities. \nThese savings were achieved to answer criticisms of the program and \nimprove operational efficiency. We have tried to manage these funding \nreductions in a way that will not unduly harm the program or the \ndelivery system.\n  Because crop insurance is a Federal program that is supported through \na blend of private and Federal reinsurance and delivered through \nprivate insurance providers and a network of agents nationwide, we have \nto be careful in making any changes to the program. There must be \nsufficient financial incentives for providers and agents to provide \nappropriate service to their customers yet not so lucrative as to waste \ntaxpayer dollars. The financial strength of the insurance providers is \ncritical to the reinsurance community providing financial and risk-\nbearing support to the insurance providers. Commercial reinsurance \nhelps assure the economic stability and continuity of the insurance \nproviders in delivering and servicing the crop insurance policies.\n  By requiring a ceding of 30 percent of risk by companies to USDA and \na much deeper cut in the administrative and operating--A \nreimbursement to providers than the committee-approved bill and the \nHouse-passed bill, Senator Lugar's amendment will have serious negative \neffects on the delivery system that could impact service and the \navailability of coverage in many States.\n  After the House passed its farm bill this summer, the reinsurance \ncommunity sent me a letter expressing concerns about significant cuts \nthe House made to the A expense reimbursement as well as the required \nincreased quota share by USDA. For reference, the House cuts were \ngreater than those in the committee-approved bill but less than what \nSenator Lugar proposes.\n  Specifically, the letter signed by 13 reinsurers states that the \nHouse's proposed reduction in A will further strain the insurance \nproviders' ability to properly deliver and service the crop insurance \nprogram.\n  The letter notes that there is a justifiable and widespread concern \nthat even fewer insurance providers will exist in the future. There are \n16 approved insurance providers nationwide. That does not mean 16 \nproviders in every State--some States have as many as 16, others have \nless. This issue raised by the reinsurance community should be \nconcerning, especially for those of us whose States have fewer \ninsurance providers than the current nationwide total.\n  The letter states that if reinsurers sense that insurance providers \nwill be unable to subsidize further the costs of processing and claims \nsettlements, reinsurers will likely exercise extreme caution in \nproviding private reinsurance. Creditworthiness is paramount for \nreinsurers, which do not need and do not want to support thinly \ncapitalized and/or overleveraged insurers.\n  The letter also maintains that allegations about the insurance \nproviders earning excessive profits in recent years are unwarranted and \ninaccurate.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Crop Insurance\n\n\n                                        Research Bureau, Inc.,\n\n                            Overland Park, KS, September 18, 2007.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n         Forestry,Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition \n         and Forestry, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss: The \n     undersigned represent a cross section of the private \n     reinsurance community engaged in the Federal Crop Insurance \n     program. Private reinsurers are a critical element in a \n     successful program because they afford standard reinsurance \n     contract holders the ability to offer it on a truly national \n     basis. Our continued presence is predicated upon the overall \n     strength and viability of the program. The provisions in the \n     House version of the Farm Bill give us considerable pause for \n     concern.\n       The crop insurance program has enjoyed unqualified success \n     since the private sector was introduced in 1981. This success \n     is measured in terms of the percentage of eligible acres \n     insured today versus those acres insured in 1981. Today \n     roughly 80% of eligible crops are insured versus less than \n     20% in 1981. Furthermore, the numbers of crops that are \n     eligible for insurance coverage today have also increased \n     significantly since 1981. This success in insuring over 242 \n     million acres has created an economical safety net for \n     America's farmers--and a safety net for the entire rural \n     community that depends upon a strong agricultural economy.\n       Discussions on the crop insurance program usually focus on \n     the farmers and those companies that deliver crop insurance--\n     the Approved Insurance Providers (AIP). However, a critical \n     component to an AIP's operation is the reinsurance, which the \n     AIP purchases from the private sector.\n       Many legislators seem to assume the only reinsurance that \n     is needed is that which is provided by the Standard \n     Reinsurance Agreement (SRA). The crop industry needs, and \n     relies upon, so-called commercial reinsurance to supplement \n     the reinsurance provided to the AIPs under the SRA. \n     Commercial reinsurance provides two essential benefits to an \n     AIP:\n       1. This reinsurance provides financial and risk-bearing \n     support to the AIP whereby the AIP can deliver crop insurance \n     over a greater geographic area and/or assist the AIP in \n     delivering a greater number of insurance policies than the \n     AIP could normally provide on their own.\n       2. This commercial reinsurance provides a vital economic \n     backstop to the AIP.\n       Therefore, the commercial reinsurance helps assure the \n     economic stability and continuity of the AIP in delivering \n     and servicing the crop insurance.\n       As Congress continues its review of various aspects of the \n     crop insurance program, the commercial reinsurance industry \n     has noted certain aspects that may have an undesirable impact \n     on the crop insurance industry if these various aspects are \n     implemented.\n\n\n        Reduction in Administrative and Operating expense (A):\n\n       The proposed reduction in A will reduce the income to the \n     AIPs and will further strain their ability to properly \n     deliver and service the crop insurance program. From a \n     reinsurer's perspective, there is a justifiable and \n     widespread concern even fewer AIPs will exist in the future. \n     There were some 55 AIPs in the late 1980s. Today there are \n     only 16 AIPs. The reduction in the number of AIPs is directly \n     attributable to the historical reduction in the A \n     percentage. Quality, accurate and timely service is of utmost \n     importance in order that policies are processed\n\n[[Page S15104]]\n\n     properly and that insurance claims are settled properly. If \n     reinsurers sense that AIPs will be unable to subsidize \n     further the costs of processing and claims settlements, \n     leading to a heightened perception of their financial \n     vulnerability, reinsurers will likely exercise extreme \n     caution in providing private reinsurance. AIP \n     creditworthiness is paramount for reinsurers, which do not \n     need and do not want to support thinly capitalized and/or \n     over leveraged insurers.\n\n\n                     Increased quota share by FCIC:\n\n       Certain legislators have alleged that the crop industry \n     AIPs have made ``excessive'' profits in recent years. These \n     statements are simply unwarranted and inaccurate. The time \n     span used to support this allegation is too short in its \n     duration and simply ignores all statistical principles of \n     insurance. Because loss experience always reverts to the \n     mean, in the coming years droughts, excessive moisture, \n     disease, e.g. Asian soybean rust, and a multitude of other \n     perils will erode the profits that have been earned in recent \n     years. Profits are needed to balance the inevitable losses; \n     hopefully the resulting balance will result in, appropriate \n     long-term profits in order that the crop insurance industry \n     can continue to provide returns on equity adequate to \n     continue to attract the support of the reinsurance community.\n       The foremost consideration of the reinsurance community is \n     the financial viability of the AIPs. Erosion in the financial \n     strength of the AIPs will cause the reinsurance industry to \n     reconsider their support of the industry and will negatively \n     impact this vital aspect in the delivery of the crop \n     insurance program. Excessive budget balancing at the expense \n     of the crop insurance industry is short sighted. The crop \n     insurance program has provided--and must continue to \n     provide--farmers, lenders, and rural constituents a known, \n     predictable economic safety net.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to share our thoughts with \n     you and urge you to continue your support of the crop \n     insurance program.\n           Sincerely,\n         AON Re; Collins; Cooper Gay Intermediaries, LLC; \n           Endurance Reinsurance Corporation of America; Farmers \n           Mutual Hail Insurance Company; Fireman's Fund Insurance \n           Company.\n         Guy Carpenter & Co., LLC; Mapfre Reinsurance Corporation; \n           Munich Re Group; Partner Reinsurance Company of the \n           U.S.; Swiss Reinsurance Company; Totsch Enterprises \n           Inc.; Western Agricultural Insurance Company.\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. An independent study was recently shared with my staff \nabout the profitability of the Federal crop insurance community. \nNational Crop Insurance Services, NCIS, is an international not-for-\nprofit organization representing the interests of more than 60 crop \ninsurance companies. Representatives of NCIS recently shared the \nresults of an independent study of the Federal crop insurance program \ncompared to the Property & Casualty, P, insurance industry for the \nperiod of 1992-2006. Key findings include:\n\n       The Federal crop insurance program is not as profitable as \n     the P industry and writing Federal crop insurance entails \n     greater risk;\n       under the current standard reinsurance agreement, SRA, \n     which is the contractual agreement between USDA and approved \n     insurance providers for delivering the program, A \n     reimbursements continue to be below actual Federal crop \n     insurance expenses incurred by private insurers.\n\n  Although the latter finding indicates crop insurance companies' costs \nare not fully covered by the Federal Government, the committee-approved \nbill contains an A reduction of 2 percentage points below the rates \ncurrently in effect for policies except in a State in a year in which \nthe loss ratio is above 1.2. The policy basis for this was to answer \ncriticisms concerning costs of A reimbursements while providing an \nexception in cases where loss adjustments and claims processing will be \nmuch greater. We believe this is a balanced approach to reducing A \nexpenditures.\n  The crop insurance industry and the crop insurance program make a \nsignificant financial contribution in the committee-approved bill, but \nnot to the detriment of the delivery system as under Senator Lugar's \namendment.\n  While there are parallels between conservation provisions in this \nbill and those in the committee bill, there are important differences.\n  The committee bill is more comprehensive and incorporates important \nnew emphases on forestry, specialty and organic production, wildlife, \nand pollinators, among others.\n  The committee bill addresses the significant challenges in existing \nprograms that stakeholders have identified, such as the appraisal \nprocess in WRP and FPP, CSP scope and delivery, third party eligibility \nin GRP, and delivery of technical assistance.\n  The committee bill includes new flexibilities to improve and \naccelerate program delivery through improvements to technical service \nprovider provisions, producer group participation, and partnerships and \ncooperation.\n  For all the above reasons, I respectfully request that my colleagues \nvote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I wish to acknowledge the importance of \nthe arguments that have been forwarded by my colleagues, especially \nthose comments most recently by the distinguished ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee and earlier by Senator Conrad, the Chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and also a very valued member for a long time of \nthe Agriculture Committee.\n  I think it is important in response, as the Senator from North Dakota \npointed out, as he described the situation, that we have to take his \ncommon sense that farms that produce much more are likely, under the \ncurrent farm legislation, to receive more in subsidy and payments of \nvarious sorts.\n  There have been certainly comments made on our side of the question \nthat a disproportionate amount of money goes to a very few farmers. \nSenator Conrad attempted to rebut that by pointing out that these very \nfew farmers may very well produce, in some States, the bulk of all that \nis produced.\n  So as a matter of common sense, if payments are being made, they \nwould receive a very large share of those payments. Certainly, that \nlogic is impeccable. The point the Lugar-Lautenberg amendment tries to \nbring to the floor is that leaving aside specific farmers, we are \ntalking about the interests of all the American people, all the \ntaxpayers who make these payments, in fact, to a very few.\n  We are making the point that farmers who do produce a lot of corn or \nwheat or soybeans or cotton are very likely to be more successful. I \npointed out in my opening statement how farms have grown, how \nsuccessful farmers have purchased the farms of those who were elderly \nor from the estates or from young people who have moved away from the \nStates or from young people who do not have the wherewithal to buy \nproperty.\n  In short, what I describe is the consolidation of agriculture in \nAmerica, which is a pretty strong trend and which I believe the \nunderlying farm bill we are discussing today would accelerate. I think \nthat would be regrettable. Therefore, the point I am making with our \namendment is not to discuss whether, proportionately, subsidies go to \nthose who are most successful and produce the most but, rather, to say \nwe should not have these payments at all.\n  What we should have is a safety net for all farmers, including large \nand the wealthy as well as those who are not very wealthy and not very \nlarge, an underlying safety net of crop insurance based upon each \ncounty in America, so it is not a broad-gauge situation, it is a very \nlocally specific situation, taking into consideration presumably the \nsoil, the weather pattern, the history of crops in that particular \ncounty in America, or the farmer could choose to take the last 5 years \nof net farm income and have crop insurance based upon that farm \nhistory, a whole farm history, not simply of a specific crop, although \nthe farmer would have the option under our plan of choosing a specific \ncrop.\n  The farmer could choose whole farm income across the board, including \na great number of items that are not now covered in these specific crop \nsituations. The bill we are talking about now provides that insurance. \nIt literally pays the premiums for all farmers, so in the event that in \nany particular area of America, by county, by State or by region, there \nis difficulty created by the weather or conceivably by world trade \ndistortions, elements that are well beyond the ability of any one \nindividual farmer's management to control, that farmer is going to \nreceive compensation that will keep that farmer in business.\n  Now, furthermore, the farmer would have the option of buying \nadditional crop insurance, as each of us as farmers now do, to cover \nthe other 15 or 20 percent, depending upon the plan chosen, so that, in \nfact, you could ensure you were going to at least receive the same \nincome as you have received over the\n\n[[Page S15105]]\n\nlast 5 years, on average, or receive at least the computed predictions \nof what the price ought to be for soybeans or for corn.\n  Let me say, as a practical example, that I take our own experience on \nthe Lugar farm indicative of how this might work. We have had a profit \non our farm for the last 50 years. Every year. Now, one reason we have \nhad those profits is because we have had crop insurance and we have \nbought the highest level of crop insurance that was possible. We paid \npremiums for it. It was not given to us. We paid money for it.\n  A good many farmers who are neighbors said: I do not want to put that \nexpense into insurance. I will let the Lord provide, sort of hope it \nwill all work out. But it does not always work out, given the weather \npatterns.\n  On our farm, in this soybean season, we had very adverse weather. We \nhad drought during many of the weeks of the summer coming up toward \nharvest. Fortunately, it did not injure the crop totally. We had at \nleast a 41-bushel yield, and we could have anticipated normally more \nlike 51, about a 20-percent deficiency. But that is the way things move \nin this world. We understand that.\n  The antidote has been crop insurance. So if you have a productive \nfarm operation, you are not penalized because of acts of God, \nliterally, through the weather.\n  Now, that is what we are proposing for all farmers in America and \ncovering all the crops that are associated with our amendment. I think \nthis is a very important discrepancy.\n  The distinguished ranking member of the Ag Committee, Senator \nChambliss, has described the current three-legged stool proposition I \ndiscussed earlier today. Direct payments. Direct payments historically \non my farm, once again, we receive now under the bill that is being \nproduced, the underlying bill, direct payments whether we have the same \nnumber of acres or even the same crops. It is a historical record from \nwhich these payments come.\n  Furthermore, we could, under the so-called marketing loan situation, \ntry to game the system, trying to borrow money from the Federal \nGovernment and pay it back in lesser amounts, depending upon the crop \nmoving upward, moving downward. We do not lose.\n  I would say this is not a fair system with regard either to \nagricultural competition or with regard to the rest of the public. The \npublic, as a whole, wants to make certain farmers stay in business, \nwants to make certain small farmers have a shot at it, wants to pay at \nleast for the insurance premiums so if there is an adverse situation, \nit could not be controlled, the income will come in and the farm stays \nalive. This is what the argument is about.\n  Now, let me simply indicate, as the distinguished ranking member has \npointed out, 26 farm groups have endorsed the underlying bill. I have \nno doubt that is true. I would say there are a good number of \nagricultural interests deeply involved in this bill, and that has \nusually been the extent of the argument. Those are the groups that are \nheard in the hearings, are heard sometimes by Senators.\n  But this time we have had a different situation. I have cited that \nover 40 major newspapers in the United States of America have taken \ntime in their editorial policies, and furthermore in supporting \narticles, to point out the deficiencies of farm legislation as it has \nevolved.\n  But this represents, I would submit, a much larger group than 26 \nagricultural groups or even members of our committees who believe they \nare advocates for specific groups in American agriculture. This time a \nvery broad number of Americans have spoken out in a humanitarian way, \nas people who respect the Federal budget, as people who respect general \nfairness, in terms of group and Federal support for those situations.\n  I think that is very healthy. I hope that will be reflected in the \nvote we are about to have. I am convinced a large majority of \nconstituents in every State of our Union would favor the Lugar-\nLautenberg FRESH amendment if they had any idea of the argument that is \nbeing presented today. Thank goodness through our newspapers and \neditorials, a lot more people do have such an idea, and they are \nexpressing themselves.\n\n  Let me make a technical point, and that is that an argument has been \nmade that if we are so reliant, as I have pointed out, on crop \ninsurance, that the Lugar-Lautenberg amendment will hurt crop \ninsurance. I want to recite some specifics about the technicalities of \ncrop insurance. For the moment, crop insurance companies are reimbursed \nby the Federal Government as a percentage of the cost of the policy. So \nas commodity prices have increased, so has the reimbursement of private \ncompanies, even though the workload has not changed. If, in fact, there \nis huge demand now for corn, huge demand for soybeans, the prices have \ngone up, in the case of soybeans, to record levels, exceeded only last \nin 1973. The compensation to the crop insurance people moves right \nalong with it, without any of the risk involved changing. The GAO \ndescribed this as ``a kind of windfall.'' Our amendment reduces the \nreimbursement to a rate that is still well above historical averages \nand, furthermore, we create a safety net through crop insurance \nprograms dramatically increasing business opportunities for private \ncrop insurance companies.\n  As has been cited by the distinguished Senator from Georgia, many \ncrop insurance policies may not be available in certain counties in his \nState and in others, but under our amendment, crop insurance is \navailable everywhere, every county, every State. That is a very \nimportant consideration in terms of a national safety net as opposed to \na crop-specific or State-specific safety net.\n  The GAO has reported crop insurance underwriting profits of $2.8 \nbillion over the last decade, three times the insurance industry \naverage. The amendment I am offering today with Senator Lautenberg also \nreduces underwriting profits by requiring companies to share 30 percent \nof their accumulative underwriting gain back with the taxpayers, back \nwith the Federal Government, so there is not an undisguised windfall. \nWe have estimated this will save taxpayers more than $1.4 billion and \nreduce the outlays in the 10 years this bill covers.\n  I point this out because I think it is important to say our amendment \nis going to be a remarkable boon for crop insurance. It is going to be \nvirtually universal. A lot of money is going to be made. But before we \nget into that, we had better change the terms of reference with regard \nto what taxpayers are paying for and the underwriting risks that are \ninvolved.\n  I point out one further argument; that is, that we have been talking \nabout the relative merits of our amendment when it comes to \nconservation. We have not discussed differences with regard to \nresearch. We might have talked more about development in rural areas. I \ntried to make the point in an earlier statement that only about 14 \npercent of the people now living in rural America live on farms. Only \nabout 1 out of 750 individuals actually does farm. The need for \ndevelopment in our rural counties is obvious. The population flight \nfrom so many counties is very apparent. If we are talking about rural \nAmerica, we have to be talking about ways in which new jobs will come \nto counties in America, and that is not going to come through a normal \nfarm bill situation, rewarding specific farmers and specific crops and \nnot all of those. I point out that our amendment tries to focus on \nrural America, on the opportunities for jobs for people in county seats \nall over our country.\n  I also point out that we have tried to think through the problems of \nthe young. We have tried to talk about resisting the trend toward \nconsolidation of agriculture by truly providing support for the small \nfarmers who do not receive much support. And, as has been pointed out, \nthey don't produce as much, and they never will under the circumstances \ncurrently in American agriculture. We think it is very important that \nyoung people coming out of college have this choice and, furthermore, \nthat families who do have a tradition of farming not be entrapped by \ncurrent circumstances that are driving clearly toward much more \nconcentrated management and ownership of American agriculture.\n  I would say that the reason why a farm such as we have in the Lugar \nfamily in Marion County, IN has great hopes for the future is that some \ngreat things have occurred in agricultural research. It is a small \npoint in all of this\n\n[[Page S15106]]\n\ndebate, but I touched upon this a moment ago in describing the soybean \nprice. I could have discussed the evolution of prices of corn in the \nlast 3 or 4 years. The fact is corn and soybeans are now being utilized \nfor energy. The demand for these grains for energy is controversial all \nby itself. There are some outside of this Chamber as well as inside \nthis body who would say there is a danger that food supplies are going \nto be converted into energy. Some have even theologically said this is \nnot what God suggested. It should not be energy, it should be food. \nOthers have suggested that the price of corn, because it is going up \nabnormally, some would say, to provide ethanol is driving the rest of \nAmerican food costs up. Ditto for soybeans. Some even make the case \nthat it is driving world food prices upward, that residents of very \npoor countries are now forced to pay more for food because of our \npolicies of using food for fuel.\n  I appreciate this is an argument that will go on in many circles well \nbeyond this one for a long time. But I also point out that the \nPresident of the United States and the leaders of both of our major \npolitical parties have for some time said this Nation is now two-thirds \ndependent upon foreign oil in terms of our petroleum needs. That \npercentage is increasing. Those sources of supply are more and more \nprecarious and sometimes very unfriendly. The fact is, despite all of \nour conservation efforts, we are still using more oil each year. If we \ndo not have a policy that even moves toward a slight bit of energy \nindependence--not total, which I would agree is not within the cards as \nwe now see life in our country--if we don't move at least to eliminate \na portion of that vulnerability, we are going to have very severe \nconsequences in terms of our own jobs, our competitive ability in the \nworld, quite apart from the ability to drive our cars and heat our \nhomes. We understand that.\n  I point out that the agricultural research that got ahead of the \ncurve here has made possible huge changes in agricultural income in \nthis year as well as in the last year, and will continue to do so, if \nwe continue our research on cellulosic ethanol, if we continue our \nresearch on all of the ways in which agricultural food and fiber might \nplay a role in this and then how we increase the yields. To believe \nthat somehow because we have increased the acreage of corn this year \nand we are running out of land, that that is the end of the story, is \nto deny a fact I remember from boyhood onward. My dad was receiving \nabout one-third as much yield out of our cornfields as we are getting \nnow. I have seen that in the last 60 years of time. There are many who \nwould point out that on our farm we could do a whole lot better. I am \nall ears for that, as are most productive farmers. In short, we are at \nthe threshold of potential for income. Therefore, to have a debate \nmired in the thought that we must maintain all the subsidies and the \nprograms that as a matter of fact have been so expensive, have brought \nabout concentration, have led even to a loss of jobs in rural America \nmakes no sense at all, in my judgment. We have to talk about the \nfuture.\n\n  I would say furthermore that, speaking about those abroad, 10 bishops \nfrom a church in Africa came to visit with me and I suppose with others \nin this body. They pointed out specifically that the cotton programs we \nsupport debilitate their hopes of coming into self-support in many very \ntough situations in their countries. They suggest, leaving aside the \nWorld Trade Organization criticism of the cotton program specifically \nand perhaps the opportunities Brazil may have to extract $4 billion out \nof somewhere in our economy that may be hitting other crops under the \norder they may receive, that we need to have reform, that the specific \npolicies that are now a part of that program for cotton, they could \napply it likewise to corn or to beans, are simply not going to work in \na world that also has a humanitarian focus on feeding people, on humane \nresults, on foreign policy that has at least some public diplomacy that \nworks.\n  I agree with them. I would say to cotton farmers or to soybean \nfarmers or corn farmers, let's make sure we do have an underlying \nsafety net. Let's make certain there cannot be catastrophe to hit any \nof our groups. Let's do it by State, by county, by local circumstances, \nby history. Let's do it right. But it is another thing to demand, as a \ncotton farmer or a corn farmer or a soybean farmer, payments upfront, \nregardless of what happens, and likewise the ability to game the \nGovernment with regard to these marketing loans. I would say on the \nface of it, taxpayers generally, persons of humane quality in our \ncountry, are not going to like the looks of that kind of program. That \nhas been the nature of our program in the farm bill that we have been \nexperiencing and in the one that is about to continue.\n  I add finally the situation this year in this debate. I agree it is \nalways oversimplified, but let me try to tell it as I saw it. In the \nHouse of Representatives, the farm groups, whether it was the 26 \nSenator Chambliss referenced or others, came in. They saw their \nMembers, and they said: We want every penny, every penny of what we got \nin the past and more. We want those farm programs and we don't want \nthem touched. However, the Members also began to hear from humanitarian \ngroups, groups that wanted to feed Americans, interested in Food \nStamps. Oxfam came in. People in conservation came in in numbers. \nPeople in energy research came in. And so pragmatically, the House \ncommittee said: Fine, we will do more for each one of you, a whole lot \nmore, as a matter of fact. We are going to add to programs. And they \ndid. So they took the whole block of the farm subsidies as they were \nand added on all of these additional programs. Then at the end of the \ntrail, they said: We have a pay-go system, and so they added a tax bill \noffered by Representative Doggett who was outside the farm community \nbut at the same time had an idea over in Finance as to how some money \nmight be raised with regard to certain commercial foreign interests he \nsaw. So you pay for it that way and ship the whole thing along, hoping \nthat many constituencies will be pleased now and that the basic farm \nsubsidies will not be touched, might even be enhanced.\n  In our situation in this body, we had an even more curious situation. \nThe distinguished Senator from North Dakota who spoke earlier was a \nproponent, along with others, of a disaster relief program, a huge one. \nThat went over to the Finance Committee, had the Finance Committee \ndiscussing the farm bill; as a matter of fact, making a huge \ncontribution to the farm bill.\n  That particular disaster relief, as I can best fathom, would be run \nby some bureaucrats in the Treasury Department, that somehow would be \nsignalled when there is a disaster and would send the money over by \nelectronic means.\n  It is an unusual situation in which we have no idea how much this \nmight cost, and actuarially I think the assumptions are not very sound. \nBut it was an interesting way of meeting at least one particular \nobjective and trying at least to find some other way of paying for it \nthrough an unusual clause in tax law.\n  I mention all of this because this kind of legislation is not good, \nis not necessary. I hope Members will, in fact, know there is a strong \nalternative--the FRESH Act, the Lugar-Lautenberg amendment--that they \nwill vote for that, and they will make a sizable difference in the \nhistory of farm legislation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask that the vote originally set at \n3:50 p.m. be moved to an immediate vote.\n  Have the yeas and nays been requested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3819\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, on behalf of Senators Sununu, McCaskill, \nDurbin, and Schumer, I am proud today to offer the reduction of excess \nsubsidies to crop underwriters rescue amendment to the farm bill.\n  The rescue amendment is based on a simple premise. When resources are \nlimited, we cannot afford to waste them. We cannot afford to overpay \ncrop insurance----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is the Senator talking about his amendment on crop \ninsurance, the one the Senator laid down the other day?\n  Mr. BROWN. Yes, it was laid down on Friday.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator if he would yield, without losing his \nright to the floor, for Senator Chambliss to make a unanimous consent \nrequest, at the end of which time the Senator would regain the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Of course.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I request of the Senator from Ohio, \nhow long does he intend to speak?\n  Mr. BROWN. Five minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the 5 minutes for the Senator from Ohio, the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, be recognized for 30 minutes, equally divided, on \nthree amendments: Nos. 3671, 3672, and 3674.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, Madam President----\n  Mr. HARKIN. Does that include the medical?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wanted to ask the Senator for whom \nthe 30 minutes is being reserved, and the managers, if they would grant \nme 6 minutes before they start to inform the Senate about the status of \na project that I think is vital and they should know about.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I have no objection. I want to make sure \nwe are working off the same page on amendments to be offered. I will \nreserve the right to object to make sure we are on the same page.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, let me try this one more time. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Ohio have 5 minutes to discuss \nhis amendment, the Senator from New Mexico be recognized for 6 minutes, \nand then the Senator from New Hampshire be recognized for 30 minutes, \nequally divided, to debate three amendments. The first is No. 3671, the \nfarm stress program; No. 3672, which is to strike the asparagus \nprovision; and No. 3674, which is the mortgage forgiveness amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I would be happy to do that approach. In \ntalking to the Senator from Michigan, who has an interest in the \nasparagus program, if this is not a convenient time for her, I will \nsubstitute the amendment on the emergency funding, which is No. 3822, \nfor the asparagus one, No. 3672, unless the Senator is ready to go.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I believe she said she is ready to go. So the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire will be recognized for 30 minutes, equally divided, \non those three amendments.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just a minute. I have now been informed \nthere is objection on our side to including No. 3674, which has to do \nwith the mortgage crisis.\n  The Finance Committee has informed me they want to take a look at \nthis amendment on the mortgage crisis before we agree to a time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I suggest I be recognized \nto offer those three amendments and set a time limit at the convenience \nof the managers. I am agreeable to a time limit. I can proceed to offer \nthem and my colleagues can work out the time agreements.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from New Hampshire, there is an \nindication from some on our side that a couple of those amendments, \nNos. 3674 and 3673, I am now informed, will both perhaps require 60 \nvotes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, let's try this one more way. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Ohio be recognized for 5 \nminutes, the Senator from New Mexico be recognized for 6 minutes, and \nthen the Senator from New Hampshire be recognized to discuss his \namendments, whatever they may be; that following him, the Senator from \nTennessee, Mr. Alexander, be recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I am wondering, does this \nmean we are not going to have votes on the amendments I am offering?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. There will be no more votes today.\n  Mr. GREGG. No, but is it the understanding that at some point, we are \ngoing to get to votes on the 5 amendments that are part of the original \n20 amendments that were agreed to?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3819\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, our bipartisan amendment, on behalf of \nSenators Sununu, McCaskill, McCain, Durbin, and Schumer, takes dollars \nfrom where they do not belong--that is, heavily subsidized crop \ninsurers--and invests them in priorities with a return to the United \nStates, as nutrition programs, conservation programs, and initiatives \nthat create sustainable economic development in other countries which, \nafter all, is the key to strong export markets.\n  Our amendment does not increase the cost of crop insurance for any \nfarmer. That is an important point. It merits repeating. Our amendment \ndoes not increase the cost of crop insurance for any farmer. Instead, \nit reduces the excessive taxpayer-funded fees that crop insurers \nreceive for servicing their customers.\n  The savings from this amendment will be invested in programs that \nwork--programs such as McGovern-Dole which provides school lunches to \nthe over 100 million children around the world who suffer from hunger.\n  There is a reason the House provides $800 million in mandatory \nfunding for this program; the Senate provided none. There is a reason \nthis program was developed by and is named after two of the most \nnotable Members of this body. The reason is this program stands out. It \nmelds compassion with common sense, feeding the hungry and building \nsustainable economies in the developing countries, making our country \nsafer.\n  We responded to a hostile Communist threat in Europe with the \nMarshall Plan. Our best response to a hostile threat overseas is to \nprovide help in nutrition and education to people who desperately need \nit.\n  This amendment is also about ensuring the appropriate funding levels \nfor conservation programs. We have done a\n\n[[Page S15108]]\n\ngood job with conservation in the Senate farm bill and much of that \ncredit goes to Chairman Harkin. We can do better, and it will pay off \nfor our Nation to do so.\n  The Farmland Protection Program received no increase in funding from \nthe committee-passed bill. Yet it is crucial to the protection of \nfamily farms.\n  The Environmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP, protects water \nquality and provides farmers and ranchers with the tools they need and \nwant to be good environmental stewards. Yet three out of four \napplications go unfunded.\n  Our amendment invests in these resource conservation programs.\n  Importantly, it invests in human decency. It invests in preventing \nAmericans from going hungry. How, in the wealthiest country in the \nworld, can we let too many of our people be hungry? More Americans are \nstruggling to make ends meet, and with the savings from our amendment, \nchildren who rely on food stamps will not have to go to bed hungry.\n  It is a smart amendment.\n  I know some of my colleagues are skeptical about the amendment's \n``pay-for.'' Some of my colleagues don't want to take money from crop \ninsurers. That is why we must take a serious look at the excessive \nsubsidies in the Federal Crop Insurance Program.\n  Federal crop insurance is an essential part of the farm safety net \nand will continue to be in the future. However, billions of dollars \nthat are intended to benefit farmers are instead siphoned off by large \ncrop insurance companies.\n  Since 2000, farmers have received $10.5 billion in benefits from crop \ninsurance, but it has cost taxpayers $19 billion: $10 billion in \nbenefits, it has cost taxpayers $19 billion to deliver those benefits.\n\n  Where does the difference go? According to a GAO report, crop \ninsurance companies take 40 cents out of every dollar that Congress \nappropriates to help farmers manage the risk of agricultural \nproduction. What kind of good business sense is that?\n  In the same report, GAO finds crop insurance company profits are more \nthan double industry averages. Private and casualty insurance has 8.3 \npercent; Federal crop insurance is literally more than double the rate \nof profit.\n  Over the past 10 years, crop insurance companies have had an average \nrate of return of 18 percent compared to just over 8 percent for the \ncomparable private property and casualty insurance companies.\n  Let me repeat, no farmer under the Brown-Durbin-McCaskill-McCain-\nSununu amendment, no farmer will pay more for crop insurance because of \nthis amendment. The Federal Government sets Federal crop insurance \npremium rates. This amendment does not change any of that.\n  This amendment will require that crop insurance companies share a \ngreater portion of their underwriting gains with taxpayers. It is only \nright in a true public-private partnership that both sides benefit \nfairly.\n  This amendment also reduces the exorbitant--and I mean exorbitant--\nadministrative fees that crop insurers receive for each policy they \nsell. A GAO report shows that per-policy subsidies to insurance \ncompanies will be triple what they were less than 10 years ago.\n  This amendment will reduce administrative subsidies for each policy \nto the national average from 2004 to 2006. It is not a huge cut. It \nsays to the crop insurance companies: Let's go back a couple years. You \nwere getting well compensated and well subsidized. Why should we do \nmore than that? With high commodity prices, this is still well above \nevery year prior to 2006.\n  This amendment provides commonsense reforms to a system of subsidies \nthat has simply spun out of control.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, first, I regret I had to ask for time \nin the middle of debate on such a serious subject. I will talk about an \nissue that is not related.\n  It looks to me as if the Senate, once again, will be forced to \nconsider a tax package we know is likely to be vetoed. We considered an \nenergy tax increase in June on the Senate floor, and the Senate \nrejected it. We considered an energy tax increase on the Senate floor \nlast Friday, and the Senate rejected it. Now we will be forced again to \nconsider what I understand is a $21 billion tax increase that is likely \nto be vetoed. I hope that, once again, the Senate will reject it.\n  But while we delay in playing these games, we jeopardize the passage \nof the CAFE standards and a real increase in much-needed renewable fuel \nstandards should be able to be put to work, and we will be reshaping \nthe flawed amendment that was sent to us by the House on that score.\n  I urge the majority to reconsider this attempt to force another vote \non taxes, and that provision we have been told by the President will be \nvetoed.\n  I cannot answer the question why is it going to be vetoed, why can't \nwe do it another way, why can't we negotiate, why can't we have part of \nthe taxes. All I know is the President says: If you send me this tax \nbill, no matter how good it is, with $21 billion in taxes, it is dead; \nI will veto it.\n  I wish to tell my colleagues, I have been in this Senate for 36 \nyears, and for 20 years of it, we have been trying to change the CAFE \nstandards on automobile fleets in the United States. Increasing the \nCAFE standards to 35 miles by 2020 will be the biggest conservation \ninitiative for transportation fuels in years.\n  Additionally, increasing the renewable fuel standard will bring \nthousands of jobs to rural America and help reduce our increasing \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  All this good work will be put at risk by the inclusion of the $21 \nbillion tax increase. I urge my colleagues on the other side to stand \nback from this risky decision and let us pass a bill and send it to the \nHouse that does not include these taxes, and we will get one of the \nmost important amendments we could ever do for saving transportation \nfuel.\n  Let me start over: The most important area where we abuse the use of \nfuel--that is, fuel that comes from crude oil--is in the transportation \nsystem. What we are trying to do is to modify the CAFE standards to \nforce the production of higher mileage cars in the fleets of America.\n  We are told by the best expert in the world, who testified before one \nof the committees, there is nothing else we can do that will increase \nour savings of crude oil and diesel than this particular provision of \nCAFE modification.\n  I say to everyone, the fact is, you think you need taxes, you know \nyou want taxes, you say when are you going to get these taxes, and you \nsay they ought to be on this bill. I say to you: If you put them on \nthis bill, you don't get the taxes and you don't get the big energy \nsavings part of this bill. What do you say? You are going to do it \nanyway? What are you going to do it for? We might as well throw the \nbill in the basket here. We don't have to fool around and waste time. \nPut it in the basket and throw it away, because if you insist on \nputting the $21 billion on and sending it back to the House so they can \nplay games, they will keep the $21 billion and then the President will \nsay: I told you not to do it. Here it is. Goodbye.\n  I urge that the best opportunity to get major energy-saving \nlegislation is with CAFE standards modification, and with it this other \nprovision which will give us ethanol 2, which will be for rural America \nto begin producing not by corn but other than corn, producing ethanol \nfor transportation fuel.\n  I believe I cannot say it any better. It is wasted time and effort to \npass a bill with $21 billion worth of taxes. We will not get either the \ntaxes, which will lose, and we will not get the energy savings portion.\n  I thank my colleagues for giving me an opportunity to speak to the \nSenate. I hope those proposing this legislation will understand it \ncannot be done. I cannot fix it. I cannot help it. It is the President. \nWho will get him to change his mind? He will not do it. I have asked \nhim. He will not do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 3671, 3672, and 3674\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to speak about amendments which I \nhave pending to the agriculture bill. I hoped they would be voted on \ntoday. I guess there is a fundraiser this evening on the Democratic \nside of the aisle which allows us to not have any more\n\n[[Page S15109]]\n\nvotes. Certainly, I hope most will be voted on tomorrow.\n  There are five amendments which I have proposed to the bill to try to \nmake it a better bill, although it is a bill that has very serious \nproblems. Let me talk about that quickly.\n  This agriculture bill comes forward every 5 years. It is a \nreauthorization of the farm programs. The practical effect is every \nyear consumers get sort of taken to the woodshed behind the barn and \nget fleeced. This is no change from that historic activity under the \nfarm bill. Only this time the fleecing is happening by the use of \njiggling numbers and gamesmanship of numbers.\n  There is $34 billion of spending in this bill which is done through \ngimmicks--gimmicks to avoid what is euphemistically called pay-go \naround here, gimmicks to avoid budget points of order, gimmicks to make \nthis bill cost less than it actually costs--$34 billion, with date \nchanges and things such as that.\n  Then there is another game that is played, which is money which has \nhistorically been spent by direct mandatory spending is taken from the \nmandatory spending accounts and moved over to the tax accounts. \nBasically, in the conservation area, where we used to have, I think, $5 \nbillion or $3 billion of mandatory accounts spending, we now have $5 \nbillion or $3 billion of what is known as tax credits.\n  What is the practical effect of that? What it does by moving that \nspending over to the tax side is you free up that amount of money on \nthe spending side, on the mandatory side to be spent, with the \npractical implication that the bill jumps in its cost by that amount of \nmoney. So you have a fairly significant increase by doing that. In the \nend, that adds to the deficit, of course, because you have ended up \nincreasing spending by that amount of money.\n\n  In addition, the bill adds a large number of new programmatic \nactivities through the subsidy realm. We already subsidize a lot of \nfarm products around here in a questionable way. Sugar is a good \nexample of that. We basically subsidize sugar so that the price of \nsugar in this country is about 75 percent higher than it is on the \nworld market. That has an effect not only on the cost of sugar but it \nalso has an effect on things such as the production of ethanol, because \nethanol can be produced from sugarcane.\n  In addition, we subsidize all sorts of different commodities. As we \nknow, the farm bill is the classic example of what you learned in \nschool called log rolling. That is where you say, if you will vote for \nmy subsidy, I will vote for yours, and down the road we go. You vote \nfor wheat, I will vote for corn, corn will vote for soybeans, soybeans \nwill vote for peanuts, peanuts will vote for cotton, and so forth and \nso on. So although none of these subsidies could stand on their own, \nwhen they get in this sequential support effort, they build a very \nsolid wall of support for a lot of programs which are of questionable \nneed, and certainly of questionable value when you look at a market \neconomy, and we are supposedly a market economy. Of course, in the farm \narea we are not a market economy, we are a throwback to a commissar \neconomy.\n  Well, in this bill they add a number of new programs. They add an \nasparagus payment, they add a chickpea payment, they add a camellia \nsubsidy, and they create new programs in the area of a national sheep \nand goat industry. They create a new program to look at the stress \nfarmers are under. So they add a panoply of new programmatic activity \nin this bill, most of which is of questionable value, but it obviously \nhas some interest group which promoted it and, therefore, it gets put \nin the bill.\n  What I have done is I have lined up five amendments here which I \nthink are fairly reasonable and address a number of issues--policywise \nbig issues, and from a farm standpoint some of them address fairly \nnarrow and concise issues.\n  The first amendment which I have offered--which has been offered on \nmy behalf by Senator Thune, but which I will call up and ask for a vote \non as soon as we can get to it, as soon as we can get people to give us \nvotes around here--is the mortgage forgiveness amendment. What we are \nseeing in America today, whether it is in farm America, rural America, \nor in urban America, is obviously a huge meltdown in the subprime \nlending markets. The effect of that meltdown is that many people are \nfinding their mortgages foreclosed on, which is obviously an extremely \ntraumatic event, to have your house taken in a mortgage foreclosure. I \ncan't think of too many more traumatic physical events than that. \nObviously, there are more traumatic health events, but not too many \nmore physical events or economic events.\n  Well, when you have a mortgage foreclosed on, you have a second \ntotally incomprehensible event. The IRS assesses you a tax on the \namount of the money which you owed to the bank, or to the lender, which \nyou couldn't repay and which was wiped out in the foreclosure.\n  For example, if you have an obligation to a bank of $150,000 and your \nhome is foreclosed on, and it is sold for something that recovers \n$100,000 of that, then that $50,000 difference becomes personal income \nto you and the IRS sends you a tax bill for it, even though you got \nforeclosed on. Well, can you think of anything worse than that? I \ncan't, from the standpoint of economics happening on a daily basis--a \nperson loses their home and then the IRS collection agents come by and \nsay you owe us X number of dollars because your home was foreclosed on.\n  Well, this amendment would put an end to that. It would say that will \nnot be deemed income to the taxpayer, so that a taxpayer whose home is \nforeclosed on does not receive the double whammy of having a tax bill \nsent to them. It seems pretty reasonable to me. I can't imagine anybody \nis going to oppose this amendment. I would hope it would get a very \nlarge vote. It is not subject to a point of order, because the cost of \nit is within what is left on the pay-go scorecard, to the extent there \nis anything left on the pay-go scorecard, it having been shredded. But \nSenator Conrad said last week there was $670 million left on the pay-go \nscorecard, which my staff confirms, as ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, and this amendment costs less than that. So it is in order, \nand I hope it will be supported. I think it is only the fair and right \nthing to do. I mean, this is a quirk of tax policy which, \nunfortunately, if you are caught in it as a citizen of America it is \nnot a quirk, it is a devastation, and it is not right. Nobody, because \ntheir home gets foreclosed on, should suddenly get a tax bill for the \namount the bank didn't recover from the home they sold.\n  The second amendment I am going to call up, and hope I can call it up \nvery soon and get a vote on it, is already pending, and it is what I \ncall the ``baby doctors for farm families'' amendment. Today, in rural \nAmerica, there is a crisis in the area of health care. There are a lot \nof problems in health care across this country, but especially in rural \nAmerica there is a significant crisis. The crisis is this: If you are a \nwoman of childbearing age, or a woman, period, you are going to have a \nlot of trouble finding an OB-GYN. Why is that? Because baby doctors are \nbeing sued out of existence in rural America. As a result of the \navariciousness of the trial lawyers in this country, and their constant \nattack especially on the practice of obstetrics and delivering babies, \nit is virtually impossible, it is extremely difficult for OB-GYNs to \npractice in rural communities, whether they are farm communities or \nrural communities.\n  Why is that? Because the base of practice, the number of people they \ncan see, the number of babies they deliver never creates enough revenue \nto simply pay the cost of their malpractice insurance. And it is a \ncrisis.\n  If you are a woman in a farm community and you have to drive 2, 3, 4 \nhours to see a doctor when you are having a baby, that can be a serious \nproblem, obviously. It can be a serious problem on the face of it, but \nit is especially a serious problem in a place such as New Hampshire, \nwhere you are probably driving in a snowstorm or sleet or something \nelse that is not very easy to drive in, and you shouldn't have to go \nthat sort of distance.\n  We have suggested that simply in the area of baby doctors in rural \nAmerica that we put in place something to support the women in those \ncommunities and make sure they have proper access to those doctors. \nEssentially, we are following the Texas and the California\n\n[[Page S15110]]\n\nproposal, where we limit pain and suffering liability in a manner which \nallows these doctors to have affordable malpractice premiums. It \ndoesn't mean somebody who gets injured doesn't get recovery. They do. \nThey get full and total recovery in the area of economics. They get \nsignificant recovery in the area of pain and suffering. But what we do \nnot have are these explosively large verdicts which essentially make it \nimpossible for someone to pay the cost of the premium to support an \nobstetrics practice in a rural area.\n\n  This proposal, which is very narrow and very reasonable, will serve a \nvery large need in our country. It is to make sure that women get \nproper health care, and especially during their childbearing years, in \nrural America. Again, I can't imagine this being opposed, but actually \nthis one is being opposed aggressively by the trial lawyer lobby. They \nare opposed to anything that limits their income in any way, even when \nit is something as reasonable as saying in an area where we have a \nclearly underserved population, which is rural America and doctors \nserving women in rural America, doctors who deliver babies. They are \ngoing to stop any sort of reform that tries to make it possible to \nimprove that situation.\n  We know this reform works. Why do we know it works? Because Texas has \ntried it. The language here mirrors Texas. Texas tried it, and what \nTexas has seen during this period when they put in this law is a huge \ninflux of doctors who deliver children, who are baby doctors. So there \nis a track record. This isn't some sort of theoretical exercise. We \nknow in practice that this works. I know if it were in place, it would \ngive a lot of women in this country the comfort of knowing they were \ngoing to have a decent doctor, or any doctor--it would be a decent \ndoctor, obviously--to care for them as they decide to have children.\n  I hope we can get to this amendment. But again, I am interested in \nthe fact that this amendment is being stonewalled by the other side of \nthe aisle. They are telling me, well, we can't vote on this amendment. \nWhy? Because we have a fundraiser tonight. I wonder who is at that \nfundraiser, by the way? There wouldn't be any trial lawyers there. We \ncan't vote on this amendment because we don't have our people here. \nWell, there ought to be enough votes to take care of women in this \ncountry so you wouldn't have to have extra people here to defeat a \nproposal which is fairly reasonable and which tracks a major State's \ndecision and which has been proven to work when it comes to caring for \nwomen who want to have children. It is very narrow. Again, it only \napplies to rural communities, only applies to doctors who deliver \nbabies in rural communities, only gives women an opportunity to get \ndecent health care.\n  I have another amendment which I hope to call up, which I would like \nto have voted on fairly soon. And by the way, I am agreeable to voting \non all these tonight. I am agreeable to a half-hour timeframe. I am \nagreeable to voting them all tomorrow. So I am not holding this bill \nup. I am offering these amendments. They are pending and they are ready \nto go.\n  Another amendment I have says this new program of creating a farmers \nstress network should not be created. This is more of a statement. I \nmean how many new programs can we create in this bill? This is an \nunauthorized program. It is not funded. But I suspect it will be \nappropriated before we get too far down the road. But why do we need a \nstress program for farmers? Granted, farmers are under stress. I used \nto work on a farm, so I understand that farming is a stressful \nactivity. But running a shoe store during an economic downturn is a \nstressful activity, running a restaurant is a stressful activity, \nrunning a garage is a stressful activity. There are a lot of activities \nin America that involve stress. Are we going to set up a stress network \nfor every activity in America that has stress? And are we going to \nexpect the Federal Government to fund it? Yeah.\n  My goodness, think of what we would have to do for our wonderful \nstaff here. My goodness, we would have to have such a program it would \nbe incredible, because we really give them a lot of stress. The simple \nfact is, you can't keep throwing these programs out there because they \nmake good press releases. There are 51 new programs in this bill. Let \nus at least pick one of them that is so far off the ranch when it comes \nto being anything rational that the American taxpayer should have to \npay for and say, no, we are not going to go this way. That would be a \nnice gesture. A gesture to the American taxpayer, I would call it. Kill \nthe stress network.\n  Then I have an amendment which says the money in here for the \nasparagus program shouldn't be in here. I like asparagus. I have been \naccused of not liking asparagus, and that is why I am being bringing \nthis forward. That is not true. I actually like asparagus. In fact, I \nhave even grown asparagus. It is very easy to grow, after you get it \ncultivated. It takes 2 or 3 years to get a good asparagus bed, and you \ncan grow a lot of asparagus, as long as you don't rototill over it. \nThen you kill it, which is what I did to my asparagus. But as a \npractical matter, there is no reason we should set up a new program for \nasparagus. This is going too far.\n  A lot is going too far in this bill, but this is another example of \ngoing too far. Now, granted, it is only $15 million, but, again, I like \nto think of it as a statement on behalf of the American taxpayer that \nwe are not going to spend that money on a brandnew asparagus program.\n  There are some others we should also throw out. The camellia program \nwe should throw out, the chickpea program--these are all new programs. \nThey should go out too. But I was only allowed five amendments, and so \nI picked out the ones I think are most egregious and the ones I think \nwe should make a little attempt to try to put some fiscal discipline \ninto this bill.\n  Then there is one that is fairly big, which is my last amendment. \nThere is $5 billion in this bill which is the ultimate earmark. It is \n$5 billion alleged to be an emergency fund for when emergencies strike \nfarm communities. You have to understand how this works. Essentially \nthis is a slush fund. It is a ``walking around money'' fund for about \nfive States. It is, purely and simply, an earmark and a classic \nporkbarrel initiative.\n\n  We know that when we have an emergency in this country we will fund \nit, especially if the emergency is in farm country. We do it every \nyear, and I believe historically it has averaged about $3.5 billion. I \nthink that is the number. It is off the top of my head as a budgeter. I \nthink that is the number we usually spend on emergencies in farm \ncommunities. If it is bigger than that, we spend more than that; if it \nis less than that, we spend less. But when you put in place a program \nwhich exists before the emergency occurs, all you are saying is: Here \nis a bunch of money folks, come and get it. For every big windstorm \nthat occurs in North Dakota, somebody is going to declare an emergency \nand try to get reimbursed for their mailbox that got blown over because \nthe money is sitting there. It is that simple. It really is terrible \npolicy to put this forward. You have absolutely set a floor. You know \nyou are going to spend every year in this account, and you know it is \ngoing to go to four or five States because that is where the claims are \nmade.\n  Much better is the approach we presently use, although not perfect, I \nadmit to that. Much better is to identify it when the emergency occurs, \nknow what the costs were when the emergency occurred, and then pay \nthose costs in order to reimburse the farm community which has been \nimpacted, which is what we do. And we do it in a fairly prompt and \nefficient way around here whenever there is such an event.\n  There is one emergency out there today, and that is the price of oil. \nThe price of oil has jumped radically. As a result, the cost of heating \nin this country has jumped radically. People who are of low income, in \nStates from the northern tier especially--places such as Minnesota, New \nHampshire--people of low income are in dire need of additional funds in \norder to meet their heating bills or else, literally, they are going to \nbe in the cold. They are going to spend this winter, as we head into \nFebruary, in serious straits. In New Hampshire, we have already seen a \nsignificant increase in the number of people applying for low-income \nhome energy assistance. This is not going to wealthy people. This \ndoesn't even go to middle-income people. It just marginally goes to \nlow-income people. It really goes to people in the lowest of low\n\n[[Page S15111]]\n\nincomes, people who really need that in order to make ends meet and \nkeep their heat on in the winter.\n  What I am suggesting is if we are going to declare emergencies around \nhere and spend money, let's use the money on a real emergency, \nsomething that actually exists where people are actually feeling the \npain right now, today--in the area of paying for heating for low-income \nfamilies.\n  In addition, I have suggested that we reduce the deficit because that \nis a pretty big emergency, in my humble opinion, getting this deficit \ndown. So this amendment essentially says let's take $1 billion and add \nit to the low-income heating assistance program and let's take the \nother $4 billion and reduce the deficit with it. That is a pretty \npractical approach. That is addressing a need that exists today and a \nneed that is going to exist tomorrow, which is to reduce the deficit, \nrather than adding to the deficit and creating an emergency spending \naccount which basically ends up being a slush fund and walking-around \nmoney for folks in four or five States that traditionally declare \nemergencies.\n  Those are the five amendments. I regret quite honestly that we cannot \nget an agreement to vote on all of them right now. I would be willing \nto say: OK, let's debate all of them for half an hour and then go to a \nvote, in seriatim vote them--bang, bang, bang, bang. Obviously, I have \nserious reservations about this bill. I think it is very bad policy in \na lot of areas. But I recognize that the votes are there to pass the \nbill, so I am not trying to delay it in some tactical or procedural \nway. I am suggesting just the opposite, that we proceed to vote on \nissues which are important, which include making sure people whose \nhomes are foreclosed on do not end up with the tax man showing up the \nnext day and saying they owe money on money they didn't ever see as a \nresult of their home being foreclosed on; making sure that women who \nare having children can see a doctor in a rural community, that farm \nfamilies have adequate access to baby doctors; making sure that people \nwho are very low income have enough to be able to meet the heating \ncosts of this winter, which we know are going to be 30 percent to 40 \npercent higher than they were last winter; making sure that we reduce \nthe deficit; suggesting we eliminate a couple of programs which are not \nthat big but which are sort of examples of an underlying problem, which \nis that there is a lot of new programmatic activity here that probably \nshould not be here and there are a lot of new subsidies in here that \nshould not be in here--the asparagus program and the farmers stress \nnetwork program.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3673\n\n  Madam President, at this time I would like to call up amendment No. \n3673. I am not calling it up for a vote because I understand it is not \nagreed to, but I do want to call it up and send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to making this the pending \namendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry, I didn't hear?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am calling up the medical malpractice amendment, not for \na vote but because I want to second-degree it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, but I \nthink the Senator has a right to that--I object for the moment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask for the regular order relative to \namendment No. 3673.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3825 To Amendment No. 3673\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the second-degree \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3825 to amendment No. 3673.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       ``This title shall take effect 1 day after the date of \n     enactment.''\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, at this point I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee will be recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, may I ask that I be notified when I \nhave 5 minutes remaining?\n  First, I would like to congratulate the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor his, as usual, eloquent remarks, but I would like to congratulate \nhim especially.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much time is allocated? How much time was \nagreed to for the Senator?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I believe I am recognized for up to 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from New \nHampshire. He is usually eloquent, and he was again today. But the \nsubject matter is not just eloquent, it is critical in the State of \nTennessee.\n  There is a medical liability crisis, especially for women who live in \nrural areas. The fact is, as the Senator from New Hampshire has said, \nwomen who live in rural areas do not have access to doctors for \nprenatal health care. They do not have access to doctors to deliver \ntheir babies.\n  According to data from the Health Services and Resources \nAdministration, in 2004, in 45 of Tennessee's 95 counties, pregnant \nmothers had to drive for miles to get prenatal care or to deliver their \nbabies. In 15 of those counties, pregnant mothers have no access \nwhatsoever to any prenatal health care within their counties.\n  The Tennessean newspaper, on July 20, 2004, reported that only 1 of \n104 medical students graduating from Vanderbilt University Medical \nSchool chose OB/GYN.\n  Dr. Frank Boehm said that:\n\n       We must not lose sight of the fact that one of the side \n     effects of our current medical malpractice crisis in OB/GYN \n     is the steady loss of medical students who are choosing not \n     to practice one of our most important medical specialties. If \n     the decline continues, patients having babies or needing \n     high-risk care will be faced with access problems this \n     country has not yet seen. The same story is true at the \n     University of Tennessee Medical School in Memphis.\n\n  On any given day, there are more than 125,000 medical liability suits \nin progress against America's 700,000 doctors.\n  There is a way to fix this. The State of Texas has shown us how, and \nit is similar to the way Senator Gregg has suggested. Put a reasonable \ncap on punitive damages, but let there be unlimited liability for any \nreal damages. That was done in Texas in the year 2005, and in the \nfollowing year, last year, more than 4,000 doctors applied for licenses \nto practice in Texas. OB/GYNs and other doctors are pouring back into \nTexas--up 34 percent from the previous year--because of a change just \nlike the one the Senator from New Hampshire has suggested.\n  I am happy for Texas, but I would like Tennessee and the rest of the \ncountry to experience the same thing. Senator Gregg is exactly right to \npoint out the medical crisis that is caused when women who live in \nrural counties cannot have access to prenatal health care and care for \ntheir pregnancy and for their babies.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3551 And 3553\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of \namendments Nos. 3551 and 3553, which were previously offered on my \nbehalf.\n  The first amendment is No. 3551. This is an amendment which would add \n$74 million to the last 3 years of the farm bill for agricultural \nresearch at land grant colleges or universities. Specifically, it would \nprovide mandatory funding for the Initiative for Future Agricultural \nand Food Systems as follows: $24 million in fiscal year 2010, $25 \nmillion in 2011, and $25 million in 2012. It would be fully offset by \nstriking section 12302 of the tax title in the Harkin substitute \namendment to the farm bill, which basically says that taxpayers in \nGeorgia and in Tennessee, for example, will pay for transmission lines \nfor ratepayers in North Dakota and South Dakota and in other States who \nwant to build transmission lines through rural areas, primarily for \nwind energy.\n  I am here today to talk primarily about farm incomes, and I am \ntalking about America's secret weapons for farm incomes in the day in \nwhich we live, which are the land grant universities of America. Iowa \nState is a great\n\n[[Page S15112]]\n\nland grant university. I imagine the University of Minnesota is a great \nland grant university in Minnesota. I know I was president of the \nUniversity of Tennessee, which is our land grant university, and I \nconfess to some bias because I think I am the only former president of \na land grant university in the Senate.\n  Why is that so important? Earlier this year, we unanimously passed, \nafter 2 years of work, a bill we called the America COMPETES Act. What \nit did was recognize America's brainpower advantage is what has given \nus our incredibly high standard of living.\n  In this last year, our country, the United States of America, \nproduced about 30 percent of all the wealth in the world for about 5 \npercent of the people in the world--that is, our population. How did we \ndo that? There are a variety of reasons, but primarily, since World War \nII, we have taken our brainpower advantage to create new jobs that have \ngiven us that great high standard of living. This amendment is about \nmaking sure we take advantage of that in the agriculture community. It \nwill provide more competitive grants to our land grant universities so \nthey can create value-added agricultural products, of which I have an \nexample right back here.\n  Congress recognized the importance of this brainpower advantage our \nland grant universities have when it authorized the 1998 farm bill. It \ncreated something called the Initiative for Future Agricultural and \nFood Systems. In addition to farm income, this research was to be for \nfuture food production for environmental quality, for natural resource \nmanagement, as well as, as I said, farm income.\n  Here is a specific example of the value-added opportunity I am \ntalking about. There is a weed, I guess people would call it, called \nthe guayule weed that grows out in the Southwest. Research that was \ndone at the University of Arizona led to the development of a non-\nallergenic rubber product that is made from that plant that is as \nuseful as latex rubber, for example, for gloves that we use with which \nto work. But it does not cause allergic reactions, as latex does, in 10 \npercent of our Nation's health care workforce. That is an example of \nthe brain power advantage.\n\n  The University of New Mexico and the University of Tennessee are \ntaking opportunities to use manure as sources of energy and as ways to \ncreate nursery crop containers. At Texas Tech University, the research \nthat has come directly from the program I described that was started in \n1998 has led to the development of a less toxic version of the castor \nseed created by using genetic modifications. This means we can grow \nmore castor oil in this country instead of having to import it.\n  Now, one might say: Well, what is the big deal about castor oil? It \ntastes bad. It is what you take when you are sick. Not anymore. On the \nDefense Department's Critical Needs List there are multiple uses of \ncastor oil for military purposes, including lubricants, adhesives, \npharmaceuticals, waxes and polishes and inks.\n  The Senator from Georgia and from Iowa will know very well the value-\nadded advantage to our country of all the products that have come from \nsoybeans. Our great land grant universities have led the way to create \nthese extra farm incomes, these new jobs for our country.\n  There are 76 land grant universities in America. During the 2 years \nwhere this program that was passed in 1998 worked well, 2001 and 2002, \nthis grant program I am describing awarded 183 different grants, one \ngrant at least in every State and in the District of Columbia.\n  So these land grant universities, created in Abraham Lincoln's \nadministration, have been at the forefront of our agriculture in \nAmerica for a long time. If we want to keep high farm income, they are \na major part of our ability to do that.\n  We have had some experience now since 1998 with this grant program I \nam describing, which has a long name, called the Initiative for Future \nAgriculture and Food Systems. First, when it was appropriated, and the \nSenator from Georgia mentioned this to me, the appropriators got to the \nmoney and they canceled the appropriation and then increased another \naccount and earmarked the money for their favorite university.\n  That practice stopped in 2001 and 2002. Basically, we went through a \nperiod where the research grants were awarded in the way they are \nsupposed to be, the way most of our research grants are awarded. One \nreason our great higher education system works so well is because it is \na large marketplace; students may choose their school, Government money \nfollows them to the institution of their choice, public, private, \nnonprofit, and the billions of dollars we spend on research to create \njobs, giving us the brain-power advantage, is competitively awarded, \nusually peer reviewed.\n  So in a couple years, that worked for this program. But then, the \nauthorizers looked at what the appropriators had done and they said, in \neffect: We are going to earmark some of this money to our favorite \nuniversities. That happened for a while.\n  Then, in 2005, we got into a budget crunch, and those trying to \nbalance the budget said: Here is a place to get some money. They took \nthe money that was dedicated for agriculture research and used it for \nthe 2005 budget reconciliation. So only in 2 years since 1998 has this \nexcellent competitive grant program worked very well, 2001 and 2002.\n  Now, in the current House version of the farm bill we are debating \ntoday, they try to put it back on track. In the first 2 years of the \nbill, they appropriate the money to deal with the budget deficit that \nwas dealt with in 2005. But in the last 3 years, they authorize money \nfor this kind of research, $200 million in each of 2010, 2011, 2012, \n$600 million, amounts to about two-tenths of 1 percent of the total \ncost of the House version of the farm bill.\n  The Senate version, unfortunately, well, fortunately in the first 2 \nyears, does pay the money to deal with the budget problem. The decision \nwas made a few years ago. But in the last 3 years, during the time when \nthe House put in 600 million, the Senate puts in zero.\n  So my amendment would restore $74 million of the $600 million, and in \nconference, hopefully, the conferees could decide this is an important \nprovision. Since both Houses had provided money, we can put the program \nback on track.\n  How do we pay for it? Well, by striking section 12302 from the tax \ntitle. Now, section 12302 of the tax title provides new tax breaks for \nlarge transmission towers that transmit electricity, primarily from \nwind farms, in remote and rural areas.\n  In my part of the country, Tennessee, for example, wind farms barely \nwork at all because the wind does not blow. But where they do work a \nlittle bit is up on top of some of our most scenic mountains. So what \nthe effect of this provision would be is to say: We are going to give \npeople who own the land an ability not to pay income tax on the income \nthey get from running these big transmission towers from the top of our \nscenic mountains all the way down to where the electric grid is.\n  That is unnecessary in the first place because the provision, as \nwritten, is retroactive. In addition to applying to future deals that \nwill be made with landowners, it seems to apply to current and existing \ndeals.\n  No. 2, it provides tens of millions of dollars, about $55 million, in \nmy computation, of new subsidy for wind. Wind already is, in my \njudgment and in the judgment of many others, over-subsidized in terms \nof an energy source.\n  Third, and perhaps the largest objection, is transmission towers \nshould be paid for by the utilities that build the transmission towers. \nIf the Tennessee Valley Authority builds a transmission tower for \nwhatever purpose, those of us who buy our electricity from TVA ought to \npay the bill. We should not send the bill to the Colorado taxpayer or \nto someone who lives in southern Georgia or someone who lives in Iowa \nor New York, and neither should they send their bills to us.\n\n  So I think it is inappropriate for all those reasons, to subsidize \nfurther the ability to build transmission lines, primarily from wind \nfarms to the grid. What it tends to do is to create such extravagant \nsubsidies for wind that investors see an opportunity to make a lot of \nmoney, and they build wind farms in places where the wind does not \nblow.\n  That might sound to some like a ridiculous statement. But we have one \nof those in the Southeastern United States. It happens to be in east \nTennessee. It is a TVA experimental farm.\n\n[[Page S15113]]\n\nIt is up on top of Buffalo Mountain, 3,500 feet up. It ought to be a \nparticularly good place for it. You can see the big white towers and \nflashing lights, instead of seeing the mountain tops, which we prefer \nto see.\n  What does it do? Not much. It cost $60 million over 20 years to TVA \nratepayers to pay somebody to provide this energy. But during August, \nwhen we were in a drought and we needed to turn our air-conditioning \non, it was operating 10 or 15 percent of the time.\n  So there is a much better solution to the need for new electricity in \nour part of the world and in many parts of America than to encourage \ninvestors through extravagant subsidies to build huge transmission \nlines through rural areas to connect wind farms with grids that are a \nlong distance away.\n  If the market supports that sort of electricity investment, let it \nsupport it. That will usually mean, if you are going to build big wind \nfarms, you will build them fairly close to the electric grid so you \nwill not have to spend a million dollars a mile on the transmission \nline.\n  That is the first amendment. We would take the $74 million from this \nunnecessary expenditure that causes people to pay, in one part of the \ncountry, for what should be an electric ratepayer's bill in another \npart of the country; gives an unnecessary amount of money to wind \ndevelopers. It, in fact, takes an example of wasteful Washington \nspending and uses it for higher farm incomes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter to Chairman Harkin from organizations stating their support \nfor increased funding for research at land-grant universities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 November 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n         Forestry, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss: As you \n     know, the committee reported Food and Energy Security Act \n     proposes to eliminate mandatory funding for the Initiative \n     for Future Agriculture and Food Systems (IFAFS). Currently, \n     $200 million per year in IFAFS funds are scheduled to become \n     available in FY2010. The House Farm Bill protects IFAFS \n     funding so that it becomes available as scheduled and \n     provides additional mandatory research dollars.\n       Elimination of IFAFS funds will severely limit integrated \n     agriculture research and extension programs at America's \n     land-grant universities, at a time when such efforts are ever \n     more necessary to help solve pressing national and \n     international problems. We urge you to allow IFAFS funds to \n     become available as allowed for in the baseline.\n       The IFAFS program was, as you know, created in 1998 to \n     provide a source of mandatory funding for integrated \n     competitive programs sponsored by the land-grant \n     universities. Since its inception, however, IFAFS funds have \n     been captured in all but two years by the Appropriations \n     Committees, the Office of Management and Budget and \n     Committees on Agriculture via the budget reconciliation \n     process. Nonetheless, the land-grant system has worked hard \n     to reverse this situation in light of the tremendous unfunded \n     needs--in areas as diverse as human nutrition and biofuels--\n     that must be addressed through programs where scientific \n     research is directly linked to public outreach.\n       Without IFAFS the agricultural research, education and \n     extension baseline is diminished substantially, something \n     that is harmful to every single stakeholder this bill is \n     created to serve. Agricultural production, healthy, abundant \n     and safe foods, conservation, rural development, biofuels, \n     specialty crops, aquaculture and countless other areas \n     impacted by this legislation are reliant on research, and the \n     application of the results of that research via education and \n     extension.\n       While we appreciate the new mandatory funding for bio-\n     fuels, specialty crops and organics contained in this bill, \n     we are still facing a net cut to research, education and \n     extension as a result of eliminating IFAFS funds. Therefore, \n     we respectfully urge you to ensure the IFAFS funding becomes \n     available for the nation's agricultural research, education, \n     and extension needs as scheduled. We sincerely believe that \n     we should not shortchange the future for short-term gains. \n     Please utilize the IFAFS funds in the Research Title, as \n     that is where the future lies.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Association of State Colleges of Agriculture and \n     Renewable Resources, American Dietetic Association, American \n     Feed Industry Association, American Sheep Industry \n     Association, American Society for Horticultural Science, \n     American Society for Nutrition, American Society of Plant \n     Biologists, Cherry Marketing Institute, Coalition on Funding \n     Agricultural Research Missions (CoFARM), Crop Science Society \n     of America, Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, and \n     Federation of Animal Science Societies.\n       Institute of Food Technologists, National Association of \n     State Departments of Agriculture, National Association of \n     State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, National \n     Association of Wheat Growers, National Cattlemen's Beef \n     Association, National Coalition for Food and Agricultural \n     Research (NC-FAR), National Corn Growers Association, \n     National Sorghum Producers, Soil Science Society of America, \n     The American Society of Agronomy, United Egg Producers, and \n     US Rice Producers Association.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator has used 18 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Please let me know when there are 5 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3553\n\n  Here is my second amendment. It is amendment No. 3553. I say it with \nall due respect to the Senator from Colorado because he and I discussed \nthis. I am sure he will have more to say about this. But here is what \nthis amendment is about.\n  The question is whether every Member of this body--I hope a lot of \nSenators are watching or their staffs are watching, because you do want \nto help your Senator if you are a staff member go home and explain, \nwherever you may live in America, why you took $4,000 of their tax \nmoney and gave it to their neighbor to build a 12-story tower in that \nneighbor's front yard with a flashing red light on top.\n  That is the question. The farm bill tax title, as reported by the \nSenate Finance Committee, says it is called a small wind tax credit. \nNow, I would ask those who can see this picture whether they would \nconsider this tower an example of a small wind turbine? I think you can \nsee the large crane next to it. You can see the telephone pole by it. \nImagine if that is in your neighborhood, in the front yard of your \nneighbor. What the proposal in the tax title as reported says, that a \nsmall wind tax credit would give you up to $4,000 toward building a \nturbine of up to 100 kilowatts. That is a 100-kilowatt wind turbine.\n  Now, you might build a smaller one, and the cost would vary--a 0.5 \nkilowatt turbine might cost about $1,900 and receive a $570 tax credit, \nwhich is 30 percent of the total cost. A 1 kilowatt turbine might cost \nabout $4,000 and receive a $1,200 credit, which is also 30 percent of \nthis turbine's cost. A 2.5 kilowatt turbine costs about $15,000 and \nwould receive a $4,000 credit, which is 27 percent of the turbine's \ncost. But you could build one as big as the 100 kilowatt turbine \ndepicted here with taxpayer funds under the provisions of this bill.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues to think about whether they think \nthat is an appropriate use of tax money. My view is the puny amount of \nelectricity produced by these wind turbines is not worth ruining the \ncharacter of our neighborhoods.\n  So what my amendment would do is simply say: This is a farm bill. If \nthe Members of this body and this Congress want to subsidize the \nbuilding of 12-story white towers in rural areas for farms and \nbusinesses, then do that in the farm bill. But do not allow that to go \ninto residential neighborhoods across America, which the bill, as \npresently written, does.\n  Now, when I say a puny amount of electricity, what do I mean by that? \nWell, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, which has examined \nthis provision of the proposed farm bill, it would encourage the \ninstallation of 12 megawatts of electricity.\n  Electrical generators have something called rated capacity. The rated \ncapacity is the power that an electrical plant generates when operating \nat its full capacity. A nuclear power plant, for example, in Tennessee \non average operates at 90 to 95 percent of rated capacity. That is why \nso many Americans are beginning to understand that nuclear power is the \nway you deal with climate change, if you are serious about it, because \nthey produce 1,100 or 1,200 megawatts of power 92 percent percent of \nthe time, and that is clean power. That has no nitrogen, no sulfur, no \nmercury. It has no carbon. Nuclear power produces 20 percent of our \nelectricity and 80 percent of our carbon-free electricity.\n\n[[Page S15114]]\n\n  The idea here is that by putting 12-story towers or up to 12-story \ntowers in our neighbor's front yard or in our front yard, we could \nproduce under this proposal an estimated 12 Megawatts of electricity. \nProbably turbines like that would operate 20, 25, 30 percent of the \ntime. So it wouldn't be 12 megawatts of electricity, it would be 3 or 4 \nmega-\nwatts on average. This is equivalent to two-tenths of 1 percent of the \nenergy from a nuclear reactor or six-tenths of 1 percent of the energy \nfrom a single coal plant.\n  My appeal is that we respectfully use our common sense as we think \nabout how to deal with the various challenges we have with clean air, \nwith climate change, with our need for energy. Common sense does not \nsay we ought to subsidize the building of 12-story towers or up to 12-\nstory towers in our front yards. For example, we would get a much \nbetter bang for the buck--$5 million is what is estimated to be spent--\nif we simply bought energy-efficient light bulbs and gave them to our \nneighbors. Spending $5 million on $2 energy-efficient light bulbs would \nsave eight times the electricity generated by these ``small wind \nturbines.'' So why should we ruin the character of our neighborhoods \nwhen we could do eight times as much good with the same amount of money \nby changing our light bulbs? That would be common sense.\n  I am very much aware of the concern about climate change. Ever since \nI have been a Member of this body, I have had legislation in the \nSenate--first with Senator Carper, then with Senator Lieberman--to \nestablish caps on utilities which produce a third of all the carbon in \nthe country. That legislation, which I introduced with those two \nSenators over the last 5 years, also would establish more aggressive \nstandards for nitrogen, mercury, and sulfur than the administration \ndoes. In addition, last week when we were debating climate change, the \nEnvironment Committee adopted my proposal for a low-carbon fuel \nstandard which would be one of the most effective ways, probably the \nmost effective way, to reduce quickly the amount of carbon in the fuel \nwe use. In the last Congress, I was the principal sponsor of the solar \nenergy tax credit. So I, like most Americans, am looking for ways for \nus to continue to power our huge economy but to do it in a clean way. I \nmake a plea for common sense while we do this.\n  I suppose it would be possible for us to give $4,000 to a homeowner \nand say: Build a big bonfire in your backyard, and then we will give \nyou more money to sequester the carbon and bury it under the ground. \nThat would be possible. But would it make common sense? No, it wouldn't \nmake common sense. There are better ways to use the money. Why would we \ndestroy the environment to save the environment, which is precisely \nwhat we are doing in residential neighborhoods with this proposal. I \nregret not that it allows farm families and farm businesses a small \nsubsidy to build large wind turbines. I regret that we would extend \nthat to residential neighborhoods at the same time.\n  Let me say something else about the number of subsidies for wind \npower that exist today in our country. Sometimes the need for wind has \nbecome nearly a religion. Instead of looking carefully at whether we \nshould use more efficient light bulbs or smart meters on utilities or \nsolar panels or efficient appliances or green buildings, a whole \nvariety of things we can do as a country to be green--instead of doing \nthat, I think we have gone overboard on the idea of wind.\n  Let me give a couple of examples of that, if I may. There are a great \nmany subsidies already in existence for wind. The biggest, of course, \nis the renewable electricity production tax credit. Through that \nrenewable production tax credit, according to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, the United States taxpayer will spend $11.5 billion on wind \nenergy over the next 10 years. Let me say that again. The United States \ntaxpayer is committed, through the existing renewable electricity \nproduction tax credit, to spend $11.5 billion on wind energy over the \nnext 10 years. That doesn't count the value of various other Federal, \nState, and local subsidies for wind. There are the clean renewable \nenergy bonds to help build the wind turbines. There are Department of \nEnergy grants and incentive programs. There are Department of \nAgriculture renewable energy and energy efficiency grants and loans. \nThere are various State subsidies for wind.\n  Texas is appropriating billions of dollars for transmission lines for \nwind. That is their decision. It is not as if this were a form of \nenergy which lacked support. I am afraid the result is that the \nextravagant subsidies for wind are causing people to build wind farms \nand to use wind where they otherwise would not. In testimony before the \nEnvironmental and Public Works Committee recently, one utility manager \nfrom Oklahoma said he is tripling the amount of wind they are using.\n  I said: Why are you doing that? Can you use it as baseload power; \nthat is, can you use it as reliable power all day long?\n  He said: We can only use it when the wind blows.\n  I said: Can you use it for peaking power?\n  He said: No, we can't use it for that because the peaking power, the \nbusiest time of the day or year, might come when the wind is not \nblowing.\n\n  I said: Why are you doing it then?\n  He said: To make the legislators happy.\n  So we are not letting the market decide. We have become obsessed with \nthe idea that this needs to be done. How big is that obsession? I think \nmost Senators would be surprised to learn that by fiscal year 2009, the \nrenewable electricity production tax credit will be the single largest \ntax expenditure for energy: $1.9 billion of that in 2009 would go for \nall renewable sources, but $1.3 billion would be for wind. We hear a \nlot about oil and gas and the subsidies for oil and gas. One might \nthink that would be true since we have this massive economy. We use \nabout 25 percent of all the oil and gas in the world. But according to \nfigures from the Joint Tax Committee--and perhaps somebody will point \nout that the Joint Tax Committee is wrong, but this is what they say in \nthe year 2009, the subsidies for oil and gas tax expenditures will be \n$2.7 billion from the taxpayers. The production tax credit for wind \nwill be $1.3 billion. Wind, $1.3 billion; oil and gas, $2.7 billion. \nThe reason I mention that is because of the disproportionate \nrelationship between the value of oil and gas to an economy that uses \n25 percent of all of it in the world and the amount of electricity \nproduced by wind.\n  In 2006, wind energy produced seven-tenths of 1 percent of the \nelectricity we consumed in the United States, yet it is the largest \nsingle energy tax expenditure by the taxpayer. Something is wrong \nthere. The Energy Information Administration estimates that by the year \n2020, after we have spent presumably tens of billions of dollars of \nsubsidies for large wind turbines in your front yard and backyard and \nside yard and our national forests, along our beaches, our most scenic \nmountaintops, after we have done all of that, according to the Energy \nInformation Administration, wind is projected to produce about 1 \npercent of our electricity needs.\n  I am skeptical of that figure. I think the Energy Information \nAdministration is too conservative. It might be 2 percent. It might be \n3 percent. Maybe it is 4 percent. But should the largest energy \nexpenditure be to encourage the building of such towers, or should we \nbe spending our money in different ways?\n  We have other ways to produce electricity: 49 percent of our \nelectricity is produced by coal. Would it be wise to spend money in \nfinding a way to sequester that coal, perhaps through algae, perhaps \nthrough enzymes, so we can use it to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil? I think it would. But the largest single energy tax expenditure is \nfor wind. Twenty percent of our electricity is produced by nuclear \npower, 80 percent of our clean power. In my view, if we are serious \nabout climate change in this generation, climate change is an \ninconvenient truth, the inconvenient solution is nuclear power and \nconservation. But the largest single energy tax expenditure is for \nlarge wind turbines. Hydropower is clean as well. It is only about 7 \npercent of the electricity in the United States. It will drop a little \nby 2020. But wouldn't there be ways to encourage that as well?\n  It may be said that this is only a small matter. It is only $5 \nmillion. But\n\n[[Page S15115]]\n\nit won't be a small matter in residential neighborhoods in Knoxville \nand Denver and Los Angeles, all across the country, when a neighbor \ncomes in and says: I just got $4,000 of your tax money, and I am going \nto put up a 12-story white tower with a blinking red light on top \nbecause I want to do what I can for climate change.\n  I think the proper answer is to say that is not the most commonsense \nthing we can do. There are many ways we can conserve. Efficient light \nbulbs would save eight times as much as this proposal would generate. \nWhy don't we do that instead?\n  If you think this is not going to happen in your neighborhood, I ask \nunanimous consent to print in the Record following my remarks a story \nfrom CNN.com about neighbors in Atlanta who are already squabbling \nabout someone who has built a wind turbine in their front yard in a \nhistoric neighborhood. It makes no difference that the wind doesn't \nblow very much in Atlanta. The neighbor is just making a statement. \nThat is the kind of thing that this will encourage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It would be my hope that this amendment would be \naccepted by the Senate. The effect of it would be to leave in place up \nto $4,000 support for building a tower that could be as large as that \none, a 100 kilowatt turbine, in rural areas or for rural business. That \nwould still be in place under my amendment. What would not be in place \nis the ability to use that in residential neighborhoods. The amendment \nwould also make clear that nothing we are doing in this legislation \npreempts any local decision about the kind of decisions people will \nmake. I am for caps on utilities. I am the sponsor of the solar credit. \nI am for cleaner air, more aggressively than the administration has \nbeen. I am ready to use smart meters. I am ready to try geothermal, \nalmost anything, the low-carbon fuel standard. But I hope we will use \ncommon sense.\n  Common sense says to me, with all due respect, that we should not \nencourage using other people's tax money for your neighbor to build up \nto a 12-story white tower in his front yard as a solution to the \ncurrent concern about climate change. There are other, better ways to \ndo it, starting with energy efficiency, other ways that make much more \ncommon sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           Neighbors Fight, States Scramble Over Clean Power\n\n                          (By Thom Patterson)\n\n       Atlanta, Georgia (CNN).--Curt Mann's neighbors are livid, \n     accusing him of erecting an ugly wind turbine among their \n     historic homes for no other reason than to show off his \n     environmental ``bling.''\n       The 49-year-old residential developer is remodeling his \n     1920's house to be more environmentally friendly, including \n     installation of a 45-foot-tall wind turbine in his front \n     yard. ``It's really none of their business how I spend my \n     money,'' Mann said.\n       The towering turbine, which overlooks majestic trees and \n     Victorian rooftops, pits preservationists in Atlanta's Grant \n     Park Historic District against a property owner and his \n     individual rights.\n       ``It's unattractive and it's a nuisance,'' said Scott \n     Herzinger, whose home is three doors down. Mann ``invaded the \n     public view . . . when he put that tower up.''\n       In blustery regions, home turbines can cut power bills by \n     up to 80 percent. But opponents claim Mann's wind turbine \n     needlessly threatens neighborhood property values because \n     Atlanta's low winds don't produce enough speed to make the \n     device worthwhile.\n       At a cost of $15,000, Mann said the turbine will shave at \n     least $20 per month off his power bill--hardly a windfall. A \n     proposed federal tax credit would bring Mann $3,000. \n     Acknowledging it could be decades before his investment pays \n     off, Mann said, ``even if it was a 50-year payback, at least \n     we've done something to reduce our dependency on fossil \n     fuels.''\n       Herzinger blames Atlanta, which ``let us down miserably'' \n     when zoning officials sided with Mann.\n       Said Mann, ``If regulations for historic preservation don't \n     address modern-day issues, then they're not very sound.''\n       But Herzinger, 48, who shares Mann's support for wind \n     power, said Mann could have considered many alternatives \n     which would have helped the environment more than the \n     turbine. ``After looking at the facts, it doesn't seem \n     unreasonable to think of Mann's wind turbine as eco-bling.''\n       Although opponents filed a lawsuit in Fulton County \n     Superior Court against both Atlanta and Mann, the squabble \n     poses larger, far-reaching questions about how communities, \n     states and the nation as a whole should tackle the ongoing \n     shift toward cleaner energy.\n       ``I don't think we're going to revolutionize the utility \n     industry through wind turbines in the front yard,'' said \n     longtime California energy consultant Nancy Rader, ``To \n     really make a dent in the power sector we've got to have the \n     big, central, bulk-generating facilities.''\n       At least 21 states and the District of Columbia have set \n     deadlines or goals for utilities to obtain electricity from \n     clean renewable sources instead of fossil-fuel burning \n     plants.\n       The scramble has triggered construction of large-scale wind \n     farms throughout much of the nation, including proposals for \n     the first U.S. offshore facilities.\n       Delaware and Galveston, Texas, have offshore projects in \n     the works, although a farm proposed off New York's Long \n     Island was shelved this year due to high projected \n     construction costs.\n       Top New York energy official Paul Tonko said the push \n     toward renewable energy became more urgent as oil prices hit \n     a record $80 a barrel September 13.\n       ``We have precious little time to adjust,'' said Tonko, \n     president of New York State Energy Research and Development \n     Authority. ``We are behind the curve of several leading \n     nations who have moved forward with very aggressive \n     outcomes.''\n       In Massachusetts, where utilities are under the gun to \n     obtain four percent of electricity from renewables by 2009, \n     builders await federal approval of a hugely controversial \n     wind farm off historic Cape Cod.\n       The Cape Wind project envisions 130 wind turbines each \n     rising 440 feet above Nantucket Sound by 2011. State \n     officials said the farm will eliminate pollution equal to \n     175,000 gas-burning cars.\n       Like Mann's neighbors, Cape Wind opponents are rallying to \n     protect historic properties. The Massachusetts historical \n     commission said the wind farm's ``visual elements'' would be \n     ``out of character'' and would have an ``adverse effect'' on \n     more than a dozen historic sites, including the Kennedy \n     family residential compound in Hyannis Port.\n       James E. Liedell, director of Clean Power Now, a grass-\n     roots group that supports the project, said he once asked \n     Sen. Edward Kennedy, during a random encounter in 2003, what \n     he thought of Cape Wind. ``It's the sight of wind turbines \n     that bothers me,'' Liedell said Kennedy said, reminding \n     Liedell that, ``that's where I sail, and I don't want to see \n     them when I sail either.''\n       According to polling in northern Europe where wind farms \n     are flourishing, residents eventually have come to accept \n     turbine towers dotting the landscape, said Dr. Mike \n     Pasqualetti, who has done much research on the topic. \n     Communities near many California wind farms, which were built \n     in the 1980s, have largely come to accept the turbines, said \n     the Arizona State University professor.\n       As the nation's fastest growing form of new power \n     generation, wind-born electricity may soon fuel commutes for \n     millions of Americans.\n       ``If we power electric hybrid cars with electricity that \n     comes from wind farms, it means you aren't polluting on \n     either end of the equation,'' said Dr. Robert Lang, director \n     of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech. ``It doesn't \n     make sense to power electric cars with electricity from \n     fossil fuel burning plants.''\n       Governments should consider offering property owners \n     reduced energy rates or other incentives to win their support \n     for green energy projects, suggested Lang.\n       Washington state utilities are racing to obtain 15 percent \n     renewable energy by 2020--much of that from wind. When the \n     Kittitas County Commission unanimously rejected placing a 65-\n     turbine facility near residential property, Gov. Chris \n     Gregoire overruled the commissioners in a move that Chairman \n     Alan Crankovich called disappointing and unprecedented.\n       ``To have a land-use decision overturned by the governor, \n     that scares me,'' Crankovich said. ``I'm concerned about it \n     because this is the first step in weakening local authority \n     and I hope she understands that.''\n       Bertha Morrison, 89, a lifelong resident whose property \n     abuts the proposed site applauded the governor's decision. \n     ``There'll be money coming from it to the county and that \n     will keep our taxes down a little bit.''\n       Individuals such as Morrison, Mann and Herzinger can \n     influence public energy policy, said energy consultant Rader, \n     by participating in local government and casting votes on \n     statewide initiatives.\n       ``We're going to have to bite the bullet,'' said Rader. ``I \n     think we need to do every damn thing we can to save this \n     planet and everybody on it.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a unanimous consent \nagreement in terms of the order of speakers. I ask unanimous consent \nthat after Senator Barrasso speaks for 7 minutes, that I be recognized \nfor 10 minutes, Senator Klobuchar for 10 minutes, Senator Sanders for \n10 minutes, and Senator Crapo for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S15116]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, agriculture is one of the most trusted, \nrespected, and revered ways of life in America. It is the farmers and \nthe ranchers who feed this country.\n  Wyoming agriculture is a billion-dollar industry, and livestock \nproducers are at the heart of our State's prosperity.\n  I am privileged to represent more than 9,100 farm and ranch \noperations in the State of Wyoming. That is why I fight every day to \nensure that our farm and our ranch businesses continue to thrive.\n  This generation of farmers and ranchers faces more challenges than \nour parents ever did. We need agricultural policy that adapts to this \nchanging world. Frankly, following the same old farm bill paradigm is \nnot getting us there. Agriculture is critical to Wyoming. We produce \nover a billion dollars of agricultural products each year. Agriculture \nprovides more than 10 percent of the jobs in our State.\n  I am coming to this debate with a real interest in seeing American \nagriculture succeed. To do that, we need to change our thinking and \nchange our policy.\n  I commend the Senate Agriculture Committee for producing bipartisan \nlegislation that addresses the important issues of conservation, rural \ndevelopment, and agricultural disaster. But let's not forget this bill \nalso carries a huge pricetag. And let's not forget that cost is for \nprograms targeted at the old ways of agriculture.\n  I believe we need to spend our taxpayer dollars wisely. We should \nfocus our efforts on smart growth in agriculture. We should sunset \nthose programs of the past that fail to address the real issues facing \nagriculture today.\n  I support conservation programs. I believe providing incentives for \nfarmers and ranchers to make improvements to their operations and to \nbenefit the environment--both of those--serves all of our interests.\n  In Wyoming, we have seen smart growth spurred by conservation \nprograms. Wyoming producers have implemented almost 3,000 Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program contracts over the past 5 years. We have \nprotected over 34,000 acres in our State through the Grassland Reserve \nProgram. Conservation programs, provided for in this farm bill, will \ncontinue the real, on-the-ground results we have seen in Wyoming.\n  Our conservation policies should give incentives to ranchers, \nincentives that will help ranchers to operate at maximum efficiency and \npromote good business and a healthy environment.\n  I support business-friendly policies that help our farmers and \nranchers succeed in marketing their products. It is a victory that this \nbill contains meaningful implementation guidelines for country-of-\norigin labeling. We raise exceptional beef and exceptional lamb in this \ncountry. Our producers deserve the opportunity to label their product \n``born and raised in the USA.'' Consumers demand it, and they will buy \nit.\n  I am also pleased this farm bill will end the prohibition on the \nshipment of Wyoming beef and lamb products to other States. Our State \ninspection program is more stringent than Federal programs, and yet we \nhave faced a limit on our product for years. I am very pleased this \nfarm bill will change that. Eliminating this restriction will help spur \nnew small business opportunities for all. I hope to see more livestock \ncompetition reforms included in this farm bill.\n  In addition, I have offered an amendment promoting veterinary \nresearch. This amendment authorizes the Minor Use Animal Drug Program. \nThis amendment helps the American sheep industry be competitive in the \nworld market. I am proud to sponsor it on behalf of Wyoming's 900 sheep \nproducers. I am pleased the bill's sponsors have included this \namendment in the managers' package.\n  Animal disease research is of the utmost importance in Wyoming. Our \nrugged landscape is a real challenge to ranchers trying to keep their \nlivestock healthy. To meet this need, I have cosponsored an amendment, \nalong with my neighbors from Montana and Idaho, to promote brucellosis \nand pasturella research. I hope my colleagues will join us in support \nof this much needed work.\n  One of the amendments we are likely to consider on this legislation \nwould expand the renewable fuels standard enacted in 2005. This \nexpansion is concerning both to Wyoming's livestock producers and to \nWyoming's energy producers. I am troubled by the food versus fuel \ndebate. When we use so much corn to make ethanol, there is less corn to \nfeed our cattle. The price of corn is rising, and ranchers are \nstruggling to keep their businesses profitable.\n  This afternoon the Presiding Officer and I attended a meeting of the \nEnergy Committee. We heard testimony from Pat O'Toole, a former Wyoming \nlegislator and a rancher from Savery, WY. He told the committee that as \nhe was testifying, his wife was driving a truck along I-80 in southern \nWyoming--a truck of corn--and the corn this year costs twice as much as \nit did last year.\n  I strongly support policies that advance the development of \nalternative and renewable energy: Solar energy, wind, geothermal, coal-\nto-liquids, biofuels. We need all of the energy. But we cannot forget \nthe cost if we trade food for fuel.\n  There is a great opportunity before this Congress to meet the \nchanging needs of agriculture. We need to set a standard that improves \nour industry for the future. That is why the people of Wyoming want to \nsee farm policies that use common sense. Let's put an end to farm \npolicies that are outdated. Let us embrace the agriculture markets of \ntoday and of tomorrow.\n  Now we can do this with on-the-ground conservation programs. This \nfarm bill can provide profit incentives and market-based agricultural \nresearch. That is what the American farmers and American ranchers \ndeserve. It is also what the American taxpayers deserve.\n  I thank my colleagues for the hard work that has gone into this bill. \nI now call on the Senate to make real commonsense reforms for American \nagriculture.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise, first of all, to indicate again \nmy strong support for the bill that is in front of us, the Food and \nEnergy Security Act, and to thank one more time our leader, Senator \nHarkin, and his partner in this, Senator Chambliss, for their \nleadership and great work, and for all the support of the committee in \nbringing forward a unanimous bill, bipartisan bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3672\n\n  I specifically today, though, want to touch briefly on two amendments \nthat have been proposed by my good friend from New Hampshire. I really \ndo mean that. He is somebody whom I enjoy working with very much, \nalthough I must rise to oppose him on an amendment dealing with the \nasparagus growers of this country.\n  As a background to this, the U.S. asparagus industry was and \ncontinues to be economically injured, unfortunately, by an agreement \nback in 1990, the Andean Trade Preferences Act, which extended duty-\nfree status to imports of fresh Peruvian asparagus. This particular \nagreement eliminated the tariffs on a wide variety of products, \nincluding asparagus, coming into this country.\n  Unlike most trade agreements, ATPA provided no transition period for \nAmerican growers to allow our producers to prepare or adapt to an \nunlimited quantity of Peruvian asparagus coming in with a zero tariff. \nThe recently approved Peruvian Trade Promotion Agreement actually \ncodifies that particular situation for American asparagus growers.\n  Following the enactment of this original agreement in 1990, imports \nof processed asparagus products surged 2,400 percent into the United \nStates, from 500,000 pounds of asparagus in 1990 to over 12 million \npounds in 2006--with a zero tariff--coming into the United States to \ncompete with American asparagus.\n  Our domestic asparagus acreage dropped 54 percent from 90,000 acres \nin 1991 to under 49,000 acres in 2006. That is American farmers losing \nacreage, losing their farms, being placed in a very difficult \nsituation, a very difficult situation economically.\n  Michigan asparagus acreage has dropped from 15,500 acres in 1991 to \n12,500 acres in 2006.\n  In Washington State, asparagus decreased from 31,000 acres in 1991 to \n9,300 acres in 2006. The value of Washington\n\n[[Page S15117]]\n\nasparagus in 1990 was approximately $200 million. The present value is \n$75 million.\n  This is a huge drop for any area of American agriculture. This is a \nhuge drop and has created great hardship for our asparagus growers.\n  Asparagus acreage in California decreased from 36,000 acres in 1990 \nto 22,500 acres in 2006.\n  What we have in this bill is some small effort to help those growers \nwho have found themselves--because of our policy, our trade policy--in \nan immediate situation of facing an unlimited supply of asparagus \ncoming in with no tariff and with no ability to have any kind of a \ntransition.\n  Unlike other areas that have been hit by trade, they did not qualify \nfor trade adjustment assistance. So the Asparagus Market Loss Program \nis a relatively small program compared to other parts of this farm \nbill. It is a $15 million effort that is critically important to \ncompensate American asparagus growers across the country for the loss \nto this industry that resulted from the ATPA.\n  This program is based on a similar market loss program for apples and \nonions back in 2002, where cheap Chinese imports harmed those American \ngrowers, and that program provided $94 million for apple and onion \ngrowers. I might add, I say to my friend, the author of this amendment, \nthe State of New Hampshire received over $1 million from this \nparticular market loss program for apples. That was done in 2002. So \nwhat we are doing is patterning this program after the very same \nmarketing loss program that helped our apple growers.\n  Market loss funds will be used to offset costs for American asparagus \nproducers to plant new acreage and invest in more efficient planting \nand harvesting equipment. It is a very small fraction of, in fact, what \nthey have incurred, as well as a result of the policy that was enacted \nback in 1990.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Gregg amendment and to \nsupport the effort of the Agriculture Committee to help alleviate an \nindustry that has received dramatic losses as a result of our Federal \ntrade policy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3674\n\n  On a different note, Senator Gregg has offered an amendment that, in \nfact, is a reflection of a bill I have introduced regarding the \nmortgage industry. Senator George Voinovich is my Republican cosponsor. \nWe have a number of colleagues who have joined us in this effort. I \ncertainly support the intent of that amendment. I know there is a \nstrong understanding of support coming from the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee about the need to make sure people who find themselves losing \ntheir home because of a foreclosure situation or a short sale or some \nother situation regarding the housing crisis--that they do not also end \nup with a big tax bill after possibly losing their home. I know there \nis a commitment from the Finance Committee, of which I am a member, to \naddress this issue and, in fact, to make sure people do not end up with \nthis tax liability.\n  The real question is how we do this in terms of this particular \namendment. Certainly, substantively I support it, but the farm bill \nwill not be done before the end of this year, and if we don't have \nsomething in place by the end of this year, people who have found \nthemselves in the middle of a mortgage crisis with this kind of an \nunforeseen tax liability will have an additional tax bill. I know it is \nour desire not to have that happen. It would be a real tragedy, in \nfact, if that did happen.\n  So I know we have to work out what will happen on that amendment, but \ncertainly I think there is very broad support for the substance of it. \nIt is a question of whether we are able to get relief to people quickly \nenough. The farm bill will not be done and passed into law by the end \nof the year, and we need to have that provision done by the end of the \nyear. So I know the Finance Committee leadership is making \ndeterminations about the best way to approach this, but certainly I \nappreciate the issue being raised because no one wants to see people \nwho have found themselves in a potential situation of losing their home \nor their home going into foreclosure or some kind of a refinancing for \nless than the mortgage price, to find themselves also in a situation \nwhere they have a new tax bill. That certainly is no one's intent.\n  I am pleased the White House is supporting our legislation to fix \nthis. The House has, in fact, acted as well and has sent a bill to us \nto address this issue. It is my hope--my sincere hope and urgent hope--\nthat we will have this done by the end of this year rather than placing \nthis policy into the farm bill because there is a sense of urgency \nabout getting this done right now. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as has been previously agreed, I ask \nunanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I first again wish to commend Senator \nHarkin, Senator Chambliss, and our entire Agriculture Committee for the \nwork we are doing on this farm bill. I am excited that it is moving \nahead. As you know, I am hopeful that we will get some more reform in \nthe bill, including my amendment to make sure the hard-working farmers \nin this country are at the receiving end of the help from the farm bill \nas opposed to multimillionaires from across this country. I look \nforward to debating that in the next few days.\n\n\n                               Toy Safety\n\n  I am here to talk about another topic, and that is that across \nMinnesota and across the country, families are making their annual \ntrips to stores and to malls for their holiday presents. Kids are \nmaking their wish lists. I know my daughter has her own. Parents are \ncombing the ads for the best prices. But this year, parents are \nthinking about something a little more than the price, a little more \nthan the wish list. They are also wondering if the toys they are buying \nare safe.\n  In fact, just this weekend, I visited Morehead, MN, in 20-below-zero \nweather, and I can tell you there were a number of parents who turned \nout, as well as people who work in this area, to talk about their \nconcerns about the safety of toys. They told me they are shocked that \nin this day and age that we have these toxic toys on our shores and in \nour stores and we have to put an end to it.\n  This year, almost 29 million toys and pieces of children's jewelry \nhave been recalled because they were found to be dangerous and, in some \ncases, deadly for children. In many cases, the reason for these recalls \nhave been truly horrific. Who would believe that a parent would buy \nsome Aqua Dots, a very popular toy for their children, and find out the \nchild swallowed this little dot, which normally you wouldn't think \nwould become a disaster, but in fact this toy had morphed into the date \nrape drug and put their child into a coma. That is what happened in \nthis country.\n  Another 9 million toys have been recalled this year for containing \ntoxic levels of lead. The lead levels in these toys can lead to \ndevelopment delay, brain damage, and even death, if swallowed.\n  As a mom and as a former prosecutor and now as a Senator, I find it \ntotally unacceptable that these toys are in our country. As my 12-year-\nold daughter said when her famous Barbies were recalled: Mom, this is \nreally getting serious.\n  It is clear that the current system we have in place to ensure the \nsafety of products for our most vulnerable consumers--our children--\nneeds to be fixed, and we need to fix it now.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee on which I serve has taken strong \naction to stem the tide of these recalls. The Consumer Product Safety \nCommission Reform Act of 2007, which was passed by the Commerce \nCommittee under the leadership of Chairman Inouye and Chairman Pryor \nand with my help, as well as the help of Senator Bill Nelson and \nSenator Durbin, represents some of the most sweeping reforms that we \nhave seen in 15 years for the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The \nbill would finally take the lead out of children's products, establish \nreal third party verification, simplify the recall process, and make it \nillegal to sell a recalled product. It also gives this long forgotten \nagency the resources it needs to protect our children.\n  The recent action by the Commerce Committee sends to the Senate floor \nan\n\n[[Page S15118]]\n\nopportunity to reform our consumer protection laws and effectively ban \nlead from kids' products. I am hopeful that we will act quickly, that \nwe will work out any details that need to be worked out, and that when \nwe adjourn for the holidays, this reform will be passed.\n  To me, the focus is simple. We need to make sure there is a clear \nmandatory standard--not just voluntary, not just a guideline, but with \nthe force of law. I think it is shocking for most parents when they \nrealize there has never been a mandatory ban on lead in children's \nproducts; instead, we have this voluntary guideline that involves a \nbunch of redtape that makes it hard to enforce. As millions of toys are \nbeing pulled from the store shelves for fear of lead contamination, it \nis time to make crystal clear that lead has no place in kids' toys.\n  The need for this ban was crystallized for me in Minnesota when a \nlittle 4-year-old boy named Jarnell Brown got a pair of tennis shoes at \na store in our State. With the pair of shoes came a little charm, and \nthis little boy was playing with the charm and swallowed it. He didn't \ndie from choking or from some kind of blockage of his airways. No, he \ndied from the lead in that charm. The lead that should never have been \nin that charm went into his bloodstream over a period of time. When \nthey tested that charm, it was 99 percent lead. It came from China. \nThis little boy died.\n\n  What is most tragic about this death is that it could have been \nprevented. He should never have been given that toy in the first place. \nIt shouldn't take a child's death to alert us that we need to do \nsomething about this problem in this country. The legislation I \noriginally introduced to address this problem is included in our bill. \nThere is a lead standard in the bill that effectively bans lead, \nallowing for trace levels for jewelry and allowing for some trace \nlevels for toys.\n  For 30 years we have been aware of the dangers posed to children by \nlead. The science is clear. It is undisputed that lead poisons kids. It \nshouldn't have taken this long to figure that out, but we know it and \nknow we can do something about it.\n  As we all know, the Consumer Product Safety Commission's last \nauthorization expired in 1992, and its statutes have not been updated \nsince 1990. During that time, since 1990, we have had billions of \ndollars' worth of toys coming in from China and other countries that \nhave essentially been unregulated because of a lack of resources for \nthat agency. It is a shadow of its former self. It is half the size \nthat it used to be in the 1980s. Here we have billions of dollars' \nworth of unregulated toys coming into this country, and there has been \nno response from this agency, no requests for a big increase. Nothing. \nMeanwhile, these toys are coming on to our shores.\n  The inspection effort for toys at the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission is led by a man named Bob, and he has an office that is kind \nof messy in the back of the CPSC and he is retiring at the end of this \nyear. We need to get more toy inspectors in the field. We need to give \nthis agency the tools it needs to do its job.\n  The legislation sitting before the Senate today goes a long way in \nmodernizing the Commission. The legislation more than doubles the \nCPSC's budget by the year 2015--something we wish the CPSC asked for \nitself, but we went ahead and did it ourselves. The CPSC Reform Act \nwill actually make it illegal to sell a recalled toy, finally taking \naction against those bad actors out there who are knowingly leaving \nrecalled products on their shelves.\n  I do at this moment wish to thank some retailers that have worked \nwith us on this bill. The CEO of Toys 'R Us testified. We worked with \nTarget, a Minnesota company. They want to get some legislation passed, \nand they want to actually increase the budget of this agency so there \ncan be more inspection. This bill will also--and this is the piece of \nthe bill that I worked on--make it easier for parents to identify toys \nwhen they are recalled.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, when most parents get their toys and \ntheir children open them on Christmas morning, they don't keep the \npackaging. My mother-in-law keeps the packaging, but most people don't. \nSo you have this packaging, and then you have the toy. What we are \nsaying is, the batch number should be on the toy if it is practical. \nYou can't do it on Pick Up Sticks, but you can do it on the foot of a \nBarbie or on SpongeBob Square Pants, so that when a parent knows about \na recall--and we know there are more to come, although we hope they \nlevel off soon--the parent can actually figure out which toy to throw \nout and which toy to keep in their toy box. This is good practical \nreform to which everyone has agreed.\n  The other piece of this is that the batch number should be on the \npackaging. That is because, unlike some of the big retailers where it \nis easy for them to pull these recalled toys from their shelves and to \nzero them out on their computer system, some people buy toys on eBay, \nthey buy them at garage sales, and that is why we think it is very \nimportant these toy numbers be on the actual packaging as well as on \nthe toy.\n  We have seen too many headlines this year to sit around and think \nthis problem is going to solve itself. As a Senator, I feel strongly it \nis important to take this step to protect the safety of our children. \nWhen I think of that little 4-year-old boy's parents back in Minnesota \nand think about all of those other children who have been hurt by these \ntoys--the one who just went into a coma over the date rape drug--they \nare just little kids. We can do better in this country. We can put the \nrules in place and make it easier for them to do their job. We can't \njust sit around bemoaning the results anymore. We have to act. We have \nthe opportunity. We must pass this bill before we go home for recess.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and that the Gregg amendment No. 3822 be the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what is \nthe nature of this amendment?\n  Mr. SANDERS. What the Gregg amendment does is take $5.1 billion from \nagricultural disaster assistance for farmers, and it puts $924 million \ninto LIHEAP. What my amendment does is put $924 million into LIHEAP but \ndoes not affect agriculture disaster assistance.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. It is a second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. SANDERS. It is a second-degree, yes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Then I do not object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3826 to Amendment No. 3822\n\n(Purpose: To provide for payments under subsections (a) through (e) of \n section 2604 of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistant Act of 1981, and \n    restore supplemental agricultural disaster assistance from the \n                Agriculture Disaster Relief Trust Fund)\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I come from a State where the weather \ngets 20, 30 below zero.\n  I send to the desk a second-degree amendment to the Gregg amendment \nNo. 3822 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3826 to amendment No. 3822.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SANDERS. As I mentioned a moment ago, I come from a State, as do \nmany others in the Senate, where the weather gets cold--sometimes 20 or \n30 degrees below zero. I come from a State, as do many other Members, \nwhere many folks are finding it extremely difficult this year to pay \nfor their home heating fuel costs because, as we all know, costs are \nsoaring. It is not unusual when I walk the streets of Burlington, VT, \nor other towns in the State of Vermont, that people are appalled and \nfrightened about the rapidly escalating costs of home heating oil, and \nthey are in need of help.\n\n[[Page S15119]]\n\n  As you know, Mr. President, the LIHEAP program has been an enormously \nsuccessful program in providing help to many Americans in paying their \nheating bills, especially the senior citizens.\n  So what this amendment would do--and I will talk at greater length \nabout it tomorrow--is provide $924 million in increased LIHEAP funding \nbecause we need that funding now.\n  We need to see LIHEAP significantly increased beyond where it is \nright now if for no other reason than to simply keep pace with the \noutrageous increase in costs for home heating.\n  Further, it is my view, and why I am offering this amendment, that it \nis wrong to be cutting into agriculture disaster assistance for \nfarmers. There are disasters and there will be disasters. If we are \nserious about maintaining family-based agriculture in America, it is \nimportant those provisions be maintained. That is essentially what that \namendment is about.\n  I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment and call \nup an amendment that I send to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MENENDEZ). Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \ninquire of the Senator, is this an amendment that was not on our list \nthat we have already received unanimous consent on?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I believe that is the case.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Senator Harkin and I have worked diligently over the \nlast 4 weeks to get where we are today, and we have winnowed this list \ndown to 20 amendments on each side. If we make an exception on one \nside, I obviously have a lot of folks who would like to add an \namendment to the list. We simply cannot do that. We have to cut it off. \nRegrettably, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I seek recognition under the unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I come today to speak in general about the \nfarm bill, which we are debating, more correctly called the Food and \nEnergy Security Act of 2007, and also to speak about some of the \namendments proposed to it.\n  This is an essential piece of legislation. I am proud to have been \npart of both committees that have brought separate parts of this \nlegislation forward and to have been able to work together in a \nbipartisan fashion to craft a bill in the Senate I believe very \neffectively addresses the food and fiber needs of our Nation as we move \nforward.\n  This legislation impacts the lives of families across this Nation and \naround the world through providing food security, enabling global \ncompetitiveness, and ensuring a better environment. I have been pleased \nto work with my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee, the \nSenate Finance Committee, and others in Congress to craft a bill that \nbuilds upon previous farm bills for a stronger Federal farm policy.\n  The legislation includes essential provisions, such as the new \nspecialty crops subtitle that strengthens the specialty crop block \ngrant and other important programs. I thank Senator Stabenow, Senator \nCraig, and others for working with me on this effort. I also thank the \ncommittee for its commitment to helping us be sure that these new \nspecialty crop provisions have been included in the legislation. There \nhas been confusion because, although we have included specialty crops \nin the legislation this year, they have not been included as a \ncommodity crop, in those crops that are covered by the commodity \nprograms. Instead, they are included in ways that will help them to \nobtain better technical assistance and grant programs so they can \nfacilitate and enhance their development, the growing of these crops, \nand the marketing of them; but they don't technically, under this bill \nor in any way, participate in the commodity programs.\n  I also thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley on the \nFinance Committee for helping to craft a tax title for the farm bill \nthat, in addition to its many other strong provisions, includes \nimprovements to the Endangered Species Act, through tax incentives for \nlandowners, to help them with species recovery. This is a piece of \nlegislation Senators Baucus and Grassley have agreed to cosponsor with \nme, as well as many other Senators, both Republicans and Democrats in \nthe Senate. It is one we have worked on for years to try to find a \nbipartisan path forward, where those who are concerned about the \npreservation and recovery of species, as well as those who are \nconcerned about the impacts of our efforts on private property owners, \ncan come together with a proposal that will help us to facilitate the \nrecovery of endangered species.\n  One little-known fact is approximately 80 percent of the threatened \nor endangered species in the United States are located on private \nproperty. It is critical we bring forward the assistance of private \nproperty owners and incentivize their involvement in the recovery of \nthese threatened and endangered species. That is what this legislation \nwill do.\n  I wish to take some time to talk more about other important aspects \nof the farm bill and some changes being proposed. In order to do so, I \nwish to explain what many people don't understand when we talk about \nthe farm bill. We discuss the farm bill as though it were a bill that \nfocused on production agriculture, and certainly it does.\n  The commodity title I referenced and the conservation title I will \nreference in a minute both focus closely on production agriculture but \nnot solely on it. What goes unnoticed in these debates is the farm bill \nis a very broad bill that deals with a multitude of critical issues in \nour Nation relating to the production of food and fiber. It has 11 \ntitles--titles on commodities and conservation, as I have indicated; \ntitles on trade, nutrition, rural development, credit, research, \nforestry, energy, livestock, and other miscellaneous provisions.\n  One other little known or little focused on fact relating to the farm \nbill is the commodity title, which we most often talk about, represents \nonly 14 percent of the funding allocated in the bill. The conservation \ntitle, which is another one of those we talk about a lot, only \nrepresents about 9 percent of the funding in the bill. The nutrition \nportion of the farm bill includes almost two-thirds--in fact, a little \nover two-thirds of the funding in the bill, 67.2 percent, is allocated \nto the nutrition program. I will talk about those as well as I go \nforward.\n  My point is this is a very broad-based bill. It is one that impacts \nrural and urban areas. It deals with the importance of food and fiber \nin many different contexts, from feeding a nation and clothing a nation \nto engaging in international trade, to our security as a nation, and to \nmany other aspects of our lives. As I said earlier, it literally \nimpacts people not only throughout this country but throughout the \nworld.\n\n  Let me move on and talk about a couple of those titles. The first one \nI will go to is the commodity program and the commodity title.\n  I am concerned with efforts that have been introduced in some \namendments to the bill on the floor that would lower selected loan \nrates, including the rates for barley, wheat, oats, wool, and honey \nloan rates--reduce them back down to the 2002 farm bill levels and then \ndivert the funding saved by that reduction into the nutrition title and \nother titles of the bill.\n  I certainly understand and don't question the importance of our \nnutrition programs and other programs being targeted for this diverted \nfunding. But it is important to note that under this farm bill, \nnutrition funding already accounts for over two-thirds of the funding \nin the bill, with only 14 percent allocated to commodities.\n  Much work has been done in this bill to try to provide adequate \nsupport for farm families across our Nation, while carefully balancing \nthe limited funding available to each title of the bill.\n  Additionally, adjustments or corrections have been made to loan rates \nto better ensure the loan rates don't distort planting decisions. That \nis very critical in our World Trade Organization negotiations. Under \nthe 2007 farm bill, we have the rates established in a way that will \nassist us in our global trade negotiations. Specifically, the\n\n[[Page S15120]]\n\nadjustments in the Senate bill increase the loan rates for wheat, \nbarley, oats, and minor oilseeds to 85 percent of the Olympic average \nfor prices between 2002 and 2006. For those who don't pay attention to \nwhat all that means, the bottom line is it is important, as we move \nforward in the commodity program, that we not establish programs that \ndistort planting decisions by farmers; otherwise, we will be accused of \nimproper subsidy or improper trade-impacting decisions and policies \nthat will be challenged in world trade negotiation arenas.\n  Loan rates for crops that compete for acres must be set at similar \npercentages of recent market prices or they can affect production \ndecisions when prices are expected to be near or below loan levels.\n  Farmers and their lenders take price support from the loan program \ninto consideration in making planting decisions. Current loan rates \nunder the 2002 farm bill were heavily skewed in favor of and against \ndifferent crops, ranging from 69 percent to 111 percent of the Olympic \naverage during the years 2002 through 2006. It is these variations that \ncreate planting decision distortions we need to avoid.\n  Efforts to strike the changes we have made and divert the funding \nwill prolong the existing disparity in the current farm bill, a policy \nwhich has been a factor of loss of wheat, barley, oats, and minor \noilseeds to increased production in other commodities.\n  Our producers work to feed our country and people of nations across \nthe world, while also dealing with high levels of regulation and \ntaxation, labor shortages, droughts, and other natural disasters and \never-increasing input costs, substantial foreign market barriers, and \nother factors that put them at a disadvantage in a very competitive \nworld market.\n  We have to ensure our farm families have the necessary support as \nthey continue to work to remain successful, while factoring in and \nfacing these increased challenges.\n  I ask other Senators in the Chamber to stand with me in supporting \nthis careful balance we have reached in the bill and to vote against \namendments or other efforts to eliminate the loan rate rebalancing and \nother commodity program support.\n  I also wish to talk about, in the commodity title, the importance of \npulse crop support.\n  As amendments are being considered to strike portions of the farm \nbill, I wish to discuss the history and importance of support for pulse \ncrops in this farm bill.\n  Pulse crops are cool season legumes that can withstand the cool \ntemperatures of the northern tier of the United States. Pulse crops are \nsuch things as dry peas, lentils, small chickpeas, and large chickpeas. \nThese cool season, nitrogen-fixing legumes are grown across the \nnorthern tier of the United States in rotation with wheat, barley, and \nother minor oilseeds.\n  In the late 1990s, when agriculture prices for commodities struggled, \nbankers steered growers away from raising pulse crops because they did \nnot have the farm program safety net provided to other crops in their \nrotation.\n  In 1999, dry pea acres dropped by 55 percent. The pulse industry \nresponded by requesting full program crop status for pulse crops as a \nway to keep the nitrogen-fixing legumes in the crop rotation with other \nprogram crops. Again, as we worked with issues in the previous farm \nbill, this was an area that needed adjustment and attention.\n  In 2002, I worked with the industry and other Members of Congress to \ninclude dry peas, lentils, and small chickpeas in the 2002 farm bill. \nSpecifically, the industry was granted a marketing assistance loan \nprogram for dry peas, lentils, and small chickpeas.\n  Pulse crops are very good for the environment and for the overall \nsoil health. The citizens of our country demand that our farm programs \nprotect the long-term sustainability of our agricultural production. \nThese legumes generate their own nitrogen and require no processed \nfertilizer to produce a crop.\n  Pulses fix nitrogen in the soil, which supplies a 40-pound-per-acre \nnitrogen credit to the following crop in the rotation, such as wheat, \nbarley, and other minor oilseeds. Pulse crops and soybeans are the only \nfarm program crops that do not require nitrogen fertilizer.\n  The carbon footprint of pulses and soybeans is lower than any other \nfarm program crop because of their ability to generate their own \nnitrogen.\n  The farm bill provides us with the opportunity to encourage our \nNation's farmers to protect the long-term sustainability of our soils. \nIncluding pulse crops in farm programs provides a safety net to other \nprogram crops and, therefore, encourages crop diversity and \nsustainability. Once again, it is an issue of favoring one crop over \nanother with the unintended impact on the soils of our Nation.\n  Stripping pulse crops out of the farm programs, as some are \nproposing, would encourage farmers in the northern tier to shift \nproduction to those crops with a safety net in periods of low prices. \nThis shift in production would upset the delicate environmental balance \nthat pulse crops provide to overall soil health and sustainability and \nwould result in acreage loss.\n  I encourage my fellow Senators to oppose amendments that would strip \npulse crops and support for them from the farm bill.\n  Let me shift for a moment to the conservation title. As the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Rural Revitalization, Conservation, and \nForestry, I wish to take a few minutes to evaluate and discuss the \ncritical importance of the conservation title.\n  The programs authorized through the conservation title of the farm \nbill provide landowners with both financial and technical assistance \nnecessary to bring real environmental results. In fact, I have said \nmany times that of all the legislation we consider in these Chambers \nyear in and year out, it is the farm bill that provides the most \nsignificant protection and support of our environment than any other \nlegislation we consider. Conservation programs are the backbone of the \nFederal conservation and environmental policy.\n  The farm bill before us provides $4.4 billion in new conservation \nspending. The legislation builds on current successful conservation \nprograms and needed enhancements to make them work better for our \nproducers. It provides $1.28 billion in new spending for a program \nnamed the Conservation Stewardship Program. Funding is provided for \ncontinuation of the Wetlands Reserve Program and the Grasslands Reserve \nProgram.\n  The Wetlands Reserve Program would be provided with funds to enroll \n250,000 new acres per year through 2012, and the Grasslands Reserve \nProgram would have sufficient resources to work in a similar fashion \nfrom 2008 through 2012.\n  As of fiscal year 2006, more than 9,000 wetland reserve sites have \nbeen enrolled and improved on more than 1 million acres of land in the \nUnited States. There are more than 900,000 acres enrolled in the \nGrasslands Reserve Program, providing habitat for more than 300 \nmigratory birds species that rely on this prairie habitat.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program would be maintained at its 39.2 \nmillion acres. This program has reduced cropland soil loss by about 450 \nmillion tons. It has restored 2 million acres of wetlands, protected \n170,000 miles of streams, and sequestered 48 million tons of carbon \ndioxide through 2006.\n  The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program would be continued with $85 \nmillion per year through the year 2012.\n  The Farmland and Ranchlands Protection Program would also be \nauthorized at $97 million per year. Easements on nearly 2,000 farms and \nranches have been enabled through this program. It is estimated that \nalmost 384,000 acres of prime, unique, and important farmland soil on \nthe urban fringe have been or will be permanently protected from \nconversion to nonagricultural uses with these easements.\n  These are just some of the programs that are included in the \nconservation title of the farm bill. I understand and share the \ninterest of many who want to increase funding for conservation \nprograms, and as a strong supporter and proponent of these programs, I \nbelieve we will all benefit from these investments in conservation. \nHowever, I think we should be very careful where we look to obtain \nthese funding increases. A strong farm bill is one that carefully \nbalances each of the items, as I have indicated before.\n  I have indicated that the nutrition title represents almost or little \nmore\n\n[[Page S15121]]\n\nthan two-thirds of the funding in the bill. Nutrition in our schools \nremains an issue of critical importance for all Americans. As a father, \nI understand the positive effects that good nutrition has in helping a \nchild develop and learn throughout the course of a schoolday.\n  In addition, I am troubled by the fact that the percentage of \noverweight young Americans has more than doubled in the past 30 years. \nI have been a strong proponent of programs that increase access to \nhealthy foods for our children in schools. One example is the Fresh \nFruit and Vegetable Program. The farm bill would expand this existing \nlimited program to every State in the United States and the District of \nColumbia and would require that at least 100 of the chosen \nparticipating schools be located on Indian reservations.\n  I applaud the members of the Senate Agriculture Committee for working \ntoward these commonsense solutions and programs to support positive \nsteps in nutrition for our children and others across our Nation. But \nas I said earlier, I also must express my concerns with proposals that \nseek to regulate food and beverage choices in schools from the Federal \nlevel.\n  I am wary of Federal policies that interfere with the local autonomy \nof State and local schools in this matter. In addition, studies have \nshown that parents and educators need to work with our youth to educate \nthem about the right choices they can make for dietary health. The best \nway to get a child to do something different is to tell them they \ncannot do it sometimes. Instead of dictating to our children, we have a \nresponsibility to teach them about their choices and encourage them to \nmake the right choices for themselves.\n  The rural development title also has much assistance for America. \nThroughout the farm bill debate, there has been much discussion \nregarding investing in rural communities across our Nation, and I am \npleased to have had the opportunity today to highlight just a few of \nthe ways in which this farm bill helps us to further invest in rural \nAmerica.\n  One of the things we have noticed, as we have seen economic decline \nin rural America, is that we must build the infrastructure in our rural \ncommunities so they can have access to the increasing markets overseas \nand nationally. It has become apparent to me that the effect of our \nFederal environmental rules and regulations is also felt most heavily \nin small and rural communities. These communities do not have the \neconomies of scale because of the small population for very expensive \nupdating required for their water and wastewater systems that they must \ndo in order to comply with Federal law. Something a large urban \ncommunity could handle can literally bankrupt a smaller community \nseeking to comply with our clean water and safe drinking water \nstandards. Because of that, I have fought for years to promote a \nprogram called Project Search which we established in the 2002 farm \nbill to provide small rural communities with financial assistance to \nhelp them comply with these regulations.\n\n  Through the changes made to Project Search's model, small, \nfinancially distressed communities in Idaho and across the Nation will \nnow have increased and more streamlined access to Federal assistance in \nthe early stages of water, wastewater, and waste disposal projects. \nThis will help them keep their water clean and help them do so in a way \nthat allows the community to avoid financial ruin.\n  This farm bill has also made critical reforms to the Rural Broadband \nLoan Program ensuring that broadband access is provided to those \ncommunities with the greatest need.\n  The Connect the Nation matching grant program will be added to \nbenchmark current broadband access programs and build GIS service maps \nto promote greater accuracy and understanding of our Nation's broadband \nnetworks.\n  I am also pleased that this farm bill will reauthorize the National \nRural Development Partnership.\n  There are many other important programs included within the rural \ndevelopment title that will have a major impact on our rural \ncommunities. Again, I thank my colleagues for working with us to make \nthis part of the title effective.\n  There are only two more titles about which I want to talk. One is the \nenergy title. The largest energy reserves in our Nation reside in the \nfarmland and forests across this country. Let me say that again. The \nlargest energy reserves in our Nation reside in our farmland and \nforests across this country.\n  In order to provide for national energy security, it has become clear \nthat agriculture is a part of the solution. For far too long we have \nbeen dependent almost entirely on petroleum as our major source of \nenergy in this Nation. We are far too dependent not only on petroleum \nbut on foreign sources of petroleum. And as anyone working with a \nportfolio would say, we must diversify. That is why I have supported \nmany of the provisions in this farm bill to move our Nation into more \ndiverse forms of alternative and renewable fuels.\n  Let's take, for example, biomass. The stored energy in biomass \nworldwide amounts to approximately 50 billion tons of crude oil \nequivalent units every year, over five times our current energy needs.\n  Using 17 million tons of biomass a year for energy could produce up \nto 7,000 new primary jobs, displace 6.8 million tons of CO2 \nfrom natural gas-fired powerplants, and generate renewable carbon \ncredits that might eventually be worth more than $200 million.\n  Through research, we can expand and harness a good part of that \nastronomical potential, and that is why we included biomass provisions \nin this bill, provisions such as the Crop Transition Program, that will \nstimulate production and ease transition toward perennial biomass \ncrops. Mr. President, $172 million would be provided over 5 years for \nthis program.\n  There would be competitive research grants of $75 million for biomass \nto bioenergy programs, focusing on increasing process efficiency and \nutilization of byproducts, and providing for a regional bioenergy \nprogram that is awarded competitively to land grant universities.\n  I also support a strong focus in this bill on biofuels. We have long \nrecognized the value in providing homegrown fuel in the form of \nethanol. It is cleaner, it is renewable, and it reduces our dependence \non foreign oil.\n  As we move forward, it is also clear that as we approach the maximum \nproduction limits of our starch ethanol, we also need to move into \ncellulosic ethanol which must be a primary component of our Nation's \nethanol portfolio. America's energy demand will increase 30 percent \nover the next 22 years, and biofuels are critical to that increase.\n  Finally, I wish to talk about the trade portion of our bill. As \nCongress moves forward in a farm bill debate, we often wonder what is \nthe future of American agriculture. I wish to discuss one very \nimportant piece of it because it is very clear to all of us that a \nmajor part of our future in American agriculture lies beyond our \nborders. Agriculture production in the State of Idaho is a great \nexample.\n  According to statistics from the Idaho State Department of \nAgriculture, if Idahoans had to consume all the farm products produced \nwithin the State, every day each resident would have to eat 52 \npotatoes, 240 slices of bread, 38 glasses of milk or 1.9 pounds of \ncheese, two quarter-pound hamburgers, two onions, and the list goes on \nand on. The point being, we depend on other markets for our successful \nagricultural programs, and trade support must be a critical part of our \nagricultural programs in this farm bill.\n  This farm bill contains a number of programs such as the Market \nAccess Program, the Foreign Market Development Program, and the \nTechnical Assistance Program for Specialty Crops, which I talked about \nearlier, to name a few.\n  One final point. Senator Baucus and I have offered an amendment with \nregard to trade with Cuba. The future success of our agricultural \nprograms and the ability of this Nation to remain globally competitive \ndepend on our ability to have access to markets beyond our borders. \nThere is a huge debate in this country about whether we should continue \nto refuse or to limit our trade with Cuba or whether to open trade with \nCuba, and I am one of those who believes we should open it.\n  I recognize we face in Cuba and in the Castro Government a brutal \ndictatorship, one in which human rights and\n\n[[Page S15122]]\n\ncivil rights are not recognized or honored in any way realistically. \nBut for us to refuse to trade with them, in my opinion, does nothing to \nsolve that problem and does everything to reduce the opportunities of \nthe United States to influence Cuba, both on economic levels, as well \nas political levels.\n  If we look at the economic impact on the United States, our refusal \nto sell our agricultural products to Cuba does not mean that Cubans \ncannot eat or they cannot gain these agricultural products. They simply \nbuy them from somewhere else--Canada, Europe, or other places.\n  Yet if we were to open our trade with Cuba and allow more aggressive \nU.S. marketing of agricultural products there, a recent study by the \ntrade commission says that exports of fresh fruits and vegetables would \nlikely increase by $37 million to $68 million in exports; milk powder \nexports would more than double; processed food exports would see a $26 \nmillion increase; wheat exports would be doubled to $34 million; and \nexports of dry beans would increase by $9 million, up to $22 million, \nto give a few examples.\n  The point is, there are markets in Cuba for our goods which our \nproducers need to be able to take advantage of, and we will do nothing \nbut increase our ability to work with the people of Cuba to address the \npolitical issues they face by doing so.\n  If we want to have a positive impact on the people of Cuba and the \npressures they face under the regime in which they live, then we should \nopen trade, open travel, and open communication so we can take to them \nan opportunity to see the freedom we experience here and to experience \nthe power of open and free markets.\n  That is why Senator Baucus and I have introduced this legislation, \nand I hope the Senators here will support this amendment to this \ncritical bill to help the United States in this one area move forward.\n  When we have significant trade with a nation such as China across the \nPacific Ocean, yet we will not open significant trade with a neighbor \nsuch as Cuba, 90 miles off our shore, we need to reevaluate the \neffectiveness of our foreign policy, not only in terms of its impact on \nU.S. producers but in terms of its impact on our ability to truly reach \nout and cause the kind of positive change in Cuba that will help them \nachieve the kind of political freedom and avoid the kinds of oppression \nand human rights pressures they now face.\n  I have talked about a number of the portions of the farm bill. There \nare other very critical portions as well. The bottom line is we have an \nopportunity in the Senate this month, if we will deal with the \namendments that are pending, to move forward on a very critical piece \nof legislation, a piece of legislation that, as I indicated, deals with \nthe food and fiber of our Nation and the ability of our people and of \npeople globally to have a better diet, to have a better opportunity to \nparticipate in global markets, and a stronger and cleaner environment.\n  I hope that as we move through this process, we will not make changes \nto the bill that will make it worse, that instead we will simply adopt \nthose improving proposals and then hopefully soon send on to the House \nthis very significant and important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3736 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n (Purpose: To modify a provision relating to bioenergy crop transition \n                              assistance)\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 3736.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3736 to amendment No. 3500.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, November 15, \n2007, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is my intention to be brief. I am \noffering this amendment with the distinguished chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, and I have had a chance to visit \nwith the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss. It is our \nintention to work very closely with Senator Chambliss in hopes that we \ncan work out the amendment I am going to offer now.\n  This amendment is an important one because it gives us a chance to \npromote the use of biofuels to reduce our Nation's dependence on \nforeign oil. We have worked hard to try to build a broad coalition of \norganizations, ranging from the National Association of Wheat Growers \nto the League of Conservation Voters, in an attempt to ensure this \nproposal would have broad support in the Senate.\n  From an oil standpoint, I think we all understand the value of \npromoting biofuels. Our country now imports roughly $1 billion a day of \noil. The fact is--and Senator Chambliss and I serve on the Intelligence \nCommittee--I have come to believe our dependence on foreign oil is a \nnational security issue. When you pull up at a gas pump in this \ncountry, whether it is New Jersey or Oregon or Alabama, you, in effect, \npay a terror tax. A portion of what you pay at the gas pump in our \nStates, in effect, eventually finds its way to a government in the \nMiddle East, such as Saudi Arabia, which consistently ends up, through \ncharitable groups and others, back to terrorist organizations that want \nto kill patriotic Americans. So our dependence on foreign oil has very \nclear consequences, and it is important for wheat growers and \nenvironmentalists and others to come together, as Senator Harkin and I \nhave sought to do in our amendment with respect to biofuels. It is \nimportant as a national security issue, and it is important from an \nenvironmental standpoint.\n  In my view, our proposals can reduce the amount of CO2 and \nother greenhouse gases that are being released into the atmosphere and \ncontributing to global warming. Our amendment will provide an \nopportunity for new sources of income for our farmers and our \ncommunities. What Senator Harkin and I and the wheat growers and the \nenvironmental folks have sought to do is to make sure we can get these \neconomic benefits for our farmers in a way that will ensure we protect \nthe land and water and air for the longer term.\n  The amendment Senator Harkin and I offer is built on four key \nprinciples: We want to promote growing biofuels stocks with sustainable \nagricultural practices, we want to protect native ecosystems, we want \nto protect biodiversity, and we want to encourage this biofuels \nproduction on a local basis so as to promote local economies. That \nmeans assembling enough farmers, growing enough feedstocks, and being \nin a position to fund a new bioenergy fuel or conversion facility. We \ngive a boost to that effort with some small planning grants in order to \nhelp those farmers get off the ground. In addition, we think our \nproposed amendment is going to set realistic kinds of conservation \nobjectives, again to promote soil and wetlands, avoid the untouched \nnative grasslands and forests, and warrant the investment our country \nshould be making in this exciting area.\n  At the end of the day--and then I will yield to my friend, the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee--we think bioenergy production \ncan be done in a way that protects threatened ecosystems. The two are \nnot mutually exclusive. It is not a question of bioenergy production or \nprotecting our treasured lands and air and water. We can do both, and \nthat is what the distinguished Senator from Iowa, the chairman, and I \nhave sought to do.\n  I am really pleased--I think the chairman may not have been on the \nfloor--that we have the National Association of Wheat Growers in \nalliance with the League of Conservation Voters. It doesn't happen \nevery day. I had a chance to visit with the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Chambliss, and what I was trying to do was to talk\n\n[[Page S15123]]\n\nabout the fact that this is an exciting coalition that adds a lot of \nenergy and passion for the future to this bill.\n  Mr. President, I wish to yield at this time to my friend, the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee. It is our intent to work with \nthe Senator from Georgia in hopes that we can all work this out. We had \na good conversation before we got on the floor, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Iowa for all his assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, are we under a time limitation here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague and friend \nfrom Oregon for sponsoring this amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor \nof it.\n  Quite frankly, this amendment brings us to where we initially started \nwhen we started talking about biomass production for biofuels. If we do \nit right--if we do it right--I predict that 5 years from now, by the \nend of the life of this farm bill, we will see cellulosic ethanol \nplants springing up like mushrooms all over the country--in the far \nwest, in the Plains States, the southeastern part of the United States, \nall over America, using different inputs such as wood pulp, fast-\ngrowing poplars, pine, switchgrass, Buffalo grass, miscanthus, and \nvarious other species depending upon the area of the country you are \nfrom.\n  In order to get there, we have to merge two things. Right now, I say \nto my friend from Oregon, we have a classic chicken-and-egg situation. \nYou can't get investors to invest in biorefineries for cellulose \nbecause they ask a very important question: Where is the feedstock? \nWell, then you go to farmers and say, we would like you to grow biomass \nfor cellulosic ethanol, and they ask a very important question: Where \nis the market? So on the one hand you have investors saying where is \nthe feedstock, and then the farmers saying where is the market, and we \nhave to get these two together.\n  Well, in the farm bill before us--and my friend knows this very \nwell--we have very good provisions for loan guarantees for \nbiorefineries. So on the investor end, I think we have done a really \ngood job with this bill of looking at that. On the other end, providing \nthe transition payments and support to farmers to grow biomass \nfeedstocks, this amendment fills in that gap. This says to farmers: \nLook, you can go ahead and transition some of your land to producing \nbiomass crops, such as perennials, and you can do it without having a \nlong-term financial commitment to a biorefinery, and you can do it by \nadhering to conservation goals.\n  Now, that is the other part of this amendment that is so important. \nWhat this amendment basically says is: Look, we will be glad to give \nyou--an individual farmer--financial support for establishment. Because \nif you are going to transition from row crops to perennials for biomass \nproduction, that may cost some money. You may have to buy some new \nequipment or change your practices or that type of thing. Maybe you \nhave to separate out a certain section of your land. Well, that is a \ntransition cost, and this provides for 50 percent matching money for \nthose transition costs.\n  The other thing is to provide for a rental payment, a rental payment \nto a farmer to make up the revenues lost on the land while the crop is \nbeing established. For example, if you have a row crop or something \nnow, but you want to, say, take a certain part of your land and you \nwould like to start growing biomass, well, your income from that will \nprobably be a little less for the first few years. So what the Wyden \namendment does is it provides for a rental payment for that period of \ntime.\n  The other key thing is it provides for a preference for enrollment in \nthe Conservation Stewardship Program. Now, again, in order to get this, \nthe contract the farmer would sign would require them to limit their \nplantings to noninvasive species, enroll only land that was previously \nused for agricultural purposes, potentially including grazing and CRP \nlands. In other words, you couldn't take lands out of the WRP program \nor that type of thing. You have to meet the stewardship threshold of \nthe CSP program by the end of the contract period, and you have to \nlimit the harvest of your biomass crops to time periods outside the \nmajor brooding and nesting season for wildlife and avian species in \nyour area.\n  So again, this is a very good amendment, I say to my friend from \nOregon. It is very well thought out and very well tailored. And the \nSenator from Oregon is absolutely right, we have a lot of groups \nsupporting this amendment. I may be repeating what the Senator said--I \ndidn't hear all of his remarks--but we have a letter here from the \nNational Wildlife Federation that includes 94 different groups that \nsupport the Wyden amendment, everything from the American Corn Growers \nto the Audubon Society, the Center for Rural Affairs, Defenders of \nWildlife--basically, a lot of wildlife groups all over this country \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Did the Senator ask consent to put those in the Record?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman for all his assistance in this. We \nhave not put it in the Record, so if you would do that, that would be \nvery helpful.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the letter and the signatories of the groups from the \nNational Wildlife Federation supporting the Wyden amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 6, 2007.\n     Re Wyden-Harkin Amendment to the Senate Farm Bill\n\n       Dear Senator Wyden: The organizations signed onto this \n     letter urge you to support the Wyden-Harkin Amendment to the \n     Senate farm bill which provides critical improvements to a \n     new Bioenergy Crop Transition Assistance Program in the farm \n     bill's Energy Title.\n       Sustainable bioenergy production from agriculture holds \n     substantial promise for promoting rural economic development, \n     reducing dependence on imported fuels, enhancing the \n     environment and reducing greenhouse gases. While the farm \n     bill Energy Title contains several programs for research and \n     development of the next generation of bioenergy refineries, \n     the Bioenergy Crop Transition Assistance Program is the only \n     measure designed to assist farmers and foresters who want to \n     start producing cellulosic bioenergy crops.\n       The Bioenergy Crop Transition Assistance Program was \n     originally designed to provide incentives to farmers and \n     foresters to plant and grow bioenergy crops in a sustainable \n     manner. Many bioenergy crops--particularly perennial native \n     species--will be grown for production for the first time in \n     regions across the country. The goal of the original measure \n     was to give farmers and foresters financial assistance and \n     incentives to use good conservation measures with new \n     bioenergy crop systems and to generate information that other \n     farmers can use to grow sustainable bioenergy crops.\n       The current Senate farm bill language, however, will not \n     achieve these original goals. A farmer or forester cannot \n     participate unless there is a formal financial commitment \n     from a biomass energy facility. This prevents farmers and \n     foresters from undertaking trial plantings of bioenergy crops \n     and would exclude bioenergy facilities under development from \n     participating. Adequate conservation goals are missing and \n     funding could be used to support agricultural or forest \n     practices that harm wildlife and destroy native habitat. The \n     limited funds are not targeted to perennial systems which can \n     increase soil quality and carbon sequestration and decrease \n     soil erosion and field run-off.\n       The Wyden-Harkin Amendment would help ensure that the farm \n     bill's incentives for bioenergy production to increase the \n     nation's energy security and achieve substantial economic \n     gain for rural communities at the same time improve the rural \n     environment and conserve the nation's natural resources. It \n     would help accelerate the challenging transition from \n     traditional row crops to more sustainable perennial \n     feedstocks for bioenergy.\n       The Amendment would provide modest grant funding for groups \n     of farmers or foresters and local entities to join with the \n     bioenergy sector in conducting feasibility studies for \n     bioenergy crop production. It allows participating farmers \n     and foresters to undertake trial plantings of bioenergy crops \n     at the planning stages for biorefinery development. The \n     Program's limited funding is targeted to perennial crop \n     systems that can increase soil quality and carbon \n     sequestration and decrease erosion and field run-off. The \n     Amendment restores conservation goals to ensure that funding \n     under this Program does not increase environmental \n     degradation, harm wildlife or destroy native habitat.\n       The emerging bioenergy sector provides a unique opportunity \n     to create an industry that supports agriculture, \n     environmental goals, energy security, and local economic \n     development.

Mr. President, I also have a letter here, also from a \ncoalition of conservation organizations, the American Sport Fishing \nAssociation, Ducks Unlimited, Izaak Walton League of America, Pheasants \nForever, Quail Forever, Trout Unlimited, and again a number of groups \nsupporting the Wyden amendment. So I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the letter and the signatories thereto.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 December 7, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: As the coalition of America's leading \n     conservation organizations, we urge your support for the \n     Wyden-Harkin Amendment to the Farm Bill. This amendment \n     provides needed improvements to a new Bioenergy Crop \n     Transition Assistance Program (BCTAP) within the bill's \n     Energy title that would make the program work better for both \n     farmers and wildlife.\n       The BCTAP was originally designed to provide financial \n     assistance and incentives to farmers and foresters to get \n     started growing next generation bioenergy crops in a \n     sustainable manner. It is the only farm bill program that is \n     designed specifically to help farmers and foresters establish \n     cellulosic bioenergy crops. Many of these bioenergy crops--\n     particularly perennial native species--will be grown for \n     production for the very first time in many regions across the \n     country. The goal of the original measure was to give farmers \n     and foresters financial assistance and incentives to use good \n     conservation measures with these new bioenergy crop systems \n     and to generate information that other farmers could use to \n     grow sustainable bioenergy crops.\n       However, the current Senate Farm Bill language will not \n     achieve these original goals. As presently written, \n     participation by a farmer or forester is dependent upon a \n     formal financial commitment from a biomass energy facility. \n     This would prevent farmers and foresters from undertaking \n     trial plantings of bioenergy crops and would exclude those \n     growing crops for bioenergy facilities still under \n     development. Conservation goals are also missing from the \n     current Senate bill and funding could be used to support \n     agricultural or forest practices that harm wildlife, \n     introduce invasive species, destroy native habitat, or \n     convert perennial grasses that have been restored for \n     wildlife and other conservation purposes (such as has been \n     done in the CRP) to fast-growing trees. Moreover, these \n     limited funds are not targeted to promoting development of \n     perennial systems. Developing perennial systems is vital \n     because of their strong promise in serving as future sources \n     of energy, while improving soil quality, increasing carbon \n     sequestration, and decreasing soil erosion and field run-off. \n     And because farmers have little experience with such systems, \n     development assistance will be key to achieving the great \n     potential of perennials.\n       The Wyden-Harkin Amendment would improve the BCTAP within \n     the Farm bill and address the existing deficiencies found in \n     the current language. Specific improvements include: Offers \n     matching grants of up to $50,000 to farmer groups, counties, \n     or other local entities for feasibility studies and planning \n     including outreach to farmers about bioenergy crop \n     production; stipulates that a letter of intent from an \n     existing or planned facility is sufficient to allow farmers \n     to apply for assistance in planting and maintaining bioenergy \n     crops, allowing farmers more flexibility to field test new \n     perennial bioenergy crops for proposed and existing bioenergy \n     facilities encourages participating farmers to meet \n     reasonable conservation goals in return for financial \n     assistance and incentives to establish and maintain \n     perennial bioenergy crops under a 5-year contract with \n     USDA; limits eligible land to that which has already been \n     used for production, such as previously cultivated land, \n     managed pasture, or clear-cut forest land--ensuring that \n     public subsidies do not promote the loss of native \n     habitats; and restricts harvesting of bioenergy crops \n     until after bird nesting and brood rearing seasons, which \n     is typically not a problem for the harvesting dates sought \n     by most bioenergy companies anyway.\n       Bioenergy production from agriculture holds substantial \n     promise for promoting rural economic development, improving \n     energy independence, enhancing habitat for some species of \n     fish and wildlife, and reducing greenhouse gases. As this \n     burgeoning industry and the technologies developed to support \n     it continue to grow, it is vital that all these factors be \n     considered to ensure its long-term sustainability. The Wyden-\n     Harkin Amendment does just that and we encourage you to \n     support it in the Farm Bill.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Sportfishing Association; Association of Fish and \n     Wildlife Agencies; Ducks Unlimited; Izaak Walton League of \n     America; Mississippi Fish and Wildlife Foundation; National \n     Wildlife Federation; Pheasants Forever; Quail Forever; Quail \n     Unlimited; Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership; Trout \n     Unlimited; and The Wildlife Society.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Lastly, the National Association of Wheat Growers and \nIOGEN Corporation together have sent a letter in support of the Wyden \namendment. I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Saxby Chambliss,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n         Forestry, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss: We wish \n     to express our support for the efforts both in your chamber \n     and in the House of Representatives to provide appropriate \n     incentives for agricultural producers interested in producing \n     non-traditional biomass crops as feedstock for commercialized \n     cellulosic ethanol.\n       We appreciate your co-sponsorship of a substitute amendment \n     offered by Sen. Ron Wyden that would, in part, establish a \n     Bioenergy Crop Transition Assistance Program within the \n     Senate's 2007 Farm Bill. We also recognize and commend House \n     Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson for including \n     similar provisions in the House-passed version of H.R. 2419.\n       Both of these programs recognize that, for the potential of \n     cellulosic ethanol to be fully realized, there is a need to \n     encourage growers to begin establishing crops for which no \n     market, as of yet, exists. As you know, farmers operate in a \n     business environment with a multitude of risks and, \n     therefore, tend to avoid risk wherever possible. Committing \n     to grow crops for a yet-to-arrive market qualifies as an \n     easily avoided risk. Yet commodity crop residues can carry \n     cellulosic\n\n[[Page S15125]]\n\n     ethanol only so far, and dedicated energy crops will be \n     needed before long. Encouraging producers to begin \n     experimenting with crops that may require innovative agronomy \n     and for which there is no market will require just the type \n     of transition program both House and Senate provisions are \n     attempting to provide.\n       We are in wholehearted support of your and Chairman \n     Peterson's goals, and hope to continue working with you to \n     refine the legislative language. In both the House and Senate \n     versions there are provisions that we find commendable and \n     others which we believe can be improved through further \n     collaboration with you and your colleagues. For example, we \n     would encourage you to consider including in the final \n     legislation a small plot pilot program as outlined in the \n     attached document. We are currently in the process of \n     creating a side-by-side comparison of the House and Senate \n     language including our comments on specific provisions, which \n     we will share with you shortly.\n       The future of the cellulosic energy industry is predicated \n     on the ability and willingness of growers to produce biomass \n     feedstock. We appreciate your ongoing support of measures \n     that would provide for an effective transition into \n     commercial production of these crops, and look forward to \n     continued work together on these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Thaemert,\n       President, National Association of Wheat Growers.\n     Brian Foody,\n       President and CEO, Iogen Corporation.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, this amendment is broadly supported. This is an \namendment that is good for the entire country, not just Oregon but also \nfor Iowa, for the plains States, and for the southeastern part of the \nUnited States. This is good for America. This is good for our farmers.\n  It will get us moving on the right path toward biomass production, \nand at the same time protecting our environment, protecting our \nwildlife habitats, and making sure that cellulosic ethanol from biomass \ngets a firm foothold, as I said, within the life of this farm bill. \nProbably by the end of this farm bill, as I said, if we do it right--\nand the Wyden amendment is the amendment that makes sure we do it \nright--then we will see the cellulosic plants springing up all over the \ncountry. We will have better wildlife, we will have more ducks, more \npheasants, more geese. We will have more hunting grounds for hunters \nand fishermen. We will have better and cleaner water. We will have the \nenergy we need in America growing in this country.\n  I applaud the Senator from Oregon. It is a very thoughtful amendment, \nvery farsighted, very meaningful, and I hope we can adopt it \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am going to wrap up very briefly, and I \nknow the Senator from Alabama was waiting, but the Senator from North \nDakota wanted to do a very brief unanimous consent request, and I think \nthat is acceptable to all Senators.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his assistance. What the Senator \nfrom Iowa essentially described, by way of bringing together people \nsuch as wheat growers and corn growers and conservation groups and the \nWildlife Federation, the League of Conservation Voters--this is the \nfuture of modern agriculture: bringing all these folks together so we \ncan take steps that will ensure that farmers grow their incomes. We \nwant farmers to prosper on the land. We want to make sure their kids \nhave a future in agriculture. To do it, we are going to have to adopt, \nas the Senator from Iowa has pointed out, an approach that encourages \nmore sustainable agriculture.\n  We think this is a winner for farmers' income. We think this is good \nfor the environment. We think it is going to promote conservation.\n  The Senator from Georgia has left the Senate floor, but it is my \nintent, with the Senator from Iowa, to work closely today and over the \nnext day or so to make an agreement that will be acceptable all around. \nI think we are capable of doing it. I thank the Senator from Iowa, once \nagain, for his support and that of his staff on some other issues as \nwell--the illegal logging question, where the chairman has been so \nhelpful.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 3695\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if it will be permissible, I ask unanimous \nconsent to modify an amendment. I have cleared this with Senator \nChambliss and Senator Harkin. I ask for the regular order on my \namendment No. 3695 for the purpose of modifying it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to call for regular \norder.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The modification is at the desk. I ask the amendment be \nso modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       (C) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2012;\n       (7) the improvements to the food and nutrition program made \n     by sections 4103, 4108, 4208, and 4801(g) (and the amendments \n     made by those sections) without regard to section 4908(b);\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3596\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I call up amendment No. 3596.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be once \nagain the pending question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe I will have an hour debate on \nthis, 30 minutes on each side. I ask I be recognized for 10 minutes \ntonight and be notified when that 10 minutes has run.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, first I would like to share in the gist \nof the remarks of Senator Wyden, that OPEC is a cartel. They meet to \ndecide how much production they will allow. The reason they do that is \nto control the price of oil in the world marketplace. By controlling \nthe amount they produce, they control the price. It is a cartel price, \nit is not a free market price. They call themselves a cartel. In \neffect, they meet to decide how much they are going to tax the American \nconsumer. That is because the value of the oil on the global \nmarketplace is disconnected to the cost of its production throughout \nthe world.\n  I think we should do what we can with ethanol and other alternative \nfuels to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, both for our economy, as \nwell as for our national security.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for his leadership as chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee. He has been courteous to me and other Senators \nin any number of ways. I thank Senator Chambliss for his leadership and \nhis expertise, particularly concerning matters in our region of the \ncountry.\n  My amendment has to do with crop insurance. I truly believe it is an \namendment that will be a good-government amendment that will allow us \nto test an idea that came from farmers themselves and could, indeed, \ncreate a situation in which crop insurance works better in America than \nit currently does.\n  Crop insurance alone has not worked as well as we expected. Many \nfarmers don't sign up, one farmer told me today. That alone should tell \nyou something. He said farmers are pretty clever. They know a good deal \nwhen they see it. If they are not signing up, usually there is a \nreason.\n  But crop insurance is a critical component of farming in America \ntoday. We need more farmers signed up. We need more farmers insured. \nHow we get there is the question. The farm insurance program that the \nGovernment funds and helps support has not ended the periodic disaster \npayment bills that Congress has considered. Since the year 2000, $1.3 \nbillion per year has been appropriated by this Congress as disaster \nrelief, indicating that the crop insurance is not yet covering the \nlosses that farmers are sustaining. In addition, we are supporting crop \ninsurance premiums to the tune of $3.25 billion a year. That is a lot \nof money.\n  What can we do? I suggest we should listen to the farmers. In 1999, \nthe Alabama Farmers Federation held a conference and formed a committee \nto see what could be done to improve crop insurance. That committee was \nled by Ricky Wiggins, a cotton and peanut farmer in south Alabama, and \nconcluded that farm savings accounts could do that. That is what they \nrecommended. My amendment would create and allow the Department of \nAgriculture, in fact, to create farm savings accounts for farmers. The \nFederal Government subsidy that has been going to insurance premiums \nwould go into this account, and the farmers' part of the premium would \ngo into this account. It\n\n[[Page S15126]]\n\nwould be their controlled insurance fund.\n  I talked to Secretary Johanns about this when he was our Secretary, \nand he liked the idea. He thought it was premature to try to mandate \nthis around the country. We discussed a pilot program and he thought \nthat was a good idea and that is what I am proposing in this amendment.\n  The concept would be for the Department of Agriculture to create and \nimplement regulations for a pilot program. It would be limited to just \n1 percent of farmers throughout the country. That is only approximately \n20,000 farmers nationwide. It would create a whole farm risk-management \naccount for all the farming activities, not just on a commodity-by-\ncommodity basis. The combination of two and three failures of a small \nnature can put a farm in critical condition, and often they are not \nable to collect on their crop insurance because no one particular crop \nhas been badly damaged. Farm savings accounts would overcome this by \nproviding more flexibility.\n  The Federal Government would contribute, the farmer would contribute, \nand when a disaster occurs, a farmer would be allowed to withdraw the \nmoney from his emergency fund. If his income fell below 80 percent of \nhis 3-year farm income average, unless there was change in his \nactivities, he would be able to draw money out of that account. But the \nfarmer also must have catastrophic insurance through an insurance \ncompany because it is still possible that there would be a catastrophe \nand he would have a total loss and would need the kind of coverage this \nfarm savings account does not provide. The pilot program would be \ntotally voluntary. No farmer would be required to participate.\n  I believe the results of this pilot program could be substantial. It \nwould certainly save overhead. It would create a situation where the \nfarmer could decide how to utilize his resources. Today, if a farmer \nbelieves his crop is a total loss, he calls in an adjuster. The \nadjuster has to look at the crop and has to certify that this crop is \nlikely to be a failure at the time it is harvested and would not be \nworth carrying forward. This will allow farmers in many circumstances \nto plow under that crop and replant another crop. Until he gets the \ncertification that his insurance is going to pay, he is delayed from \ndoing the replanting. This can be crucial because as the weeks go by \nthe season gets shorter and the farmer has less and less ability to \nreplant.\n  Those are things I hear about a lot. They come to me and complain. I \ncalled insurance companies on behalf of farmers. It is a difficult \nsituation for both sides. The insurance companies have legitimate \nreasons to be cautious and responsible with their money. Farmers have a \nlegitimate reason to seek prompt payment so they can move forward.\n  Farm savings accounts could reduce the amount of disaster relief that \nour Nation is paying out each year. I believe it is an amendment that \nmy colleagues should sincerely consider.\n  In conclusion, let me say this about it. We will talk about it more \ntomorrow. This is a farmers plan. They came forward with it. The \nAlabama Farmers Federation is an affiliate with the American Farm \nBureau. They strongly support it. The Farm Bureau itself has not taken \na position on it. They are not opposing this legislation.\n  It would apply only to 1 percent of farmers. It would be voluntary. \nNo farmer would have to sign up for it. The decisionmaking for how to \nutilize the money when a disaster occurs would be given to the farmer \nand not an insurance adjuster. And we can see how it works. Maybe it \nwill not work, and maybe we will realize this is not the way to go. \nBut, then again, it might work. In fact, I think it will work. In fact, \nI think our farmers were very smart when they asked for this.\n  I believe quite a number of farmers may find this is far more \neffective for them than the present system we are utilizing. One can \nconjure up objections that might occur. Certainly, for some farmers \nthis would not be something they would want to opt for, but I believe \nthe Department of Agriculture can work through this and create some \nguidelines and regulations that would work.\n  So I say, let's try. Let's give this idea a chance. Let's see if we \ncan create a better way of handling insurance for a number of farmers. \nAfter a few we will have learned something. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this legislation as we go forward with this farm bill. We will \nprobably have a vote on it tomorrow. I truly urge them, let's try this. \nIf you have any objections, I would be pleased to try to address them, \nand we will speak in more detail about the amendment tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3830 to Amendment No. 3500\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and I have an amendment that I send to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 3830 to amendment No. \n     3500.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it looks as though we are wrapping up here \nfor the day. I do not know of other speakers who want to come to the \nfloor.\n  We are now working, I might inform fellow Senators, on a unanimous \nconsent agreement that we hope to propound shortly that will set up \nsome votes for tomorrow, I think hopefully about five votes that have \nbeen agreed upon. We are working on the consent to get those lined up \nright now so we can have those first thing tomorrow.\n  Quite frankly, I am very optimistic. I thank all of the Senators who \ncame here today, debated their amendments. I thank the ranking member, \nSenator Chambliss. We have been working together on this. If we get \nthese amendments agreed to, to dispose of them early tomorrow, and then \nwork through other amendments tomorrow--hopefully we can work a little \nbit later than perhaps we did today--I can see that we can have a lot \nof votes tomorrow.\n  We have two or three amendments on the farm bill that we, by mutual \nagreement, were going to bring up on Thursday. The end may be in sight. \nThe end actually may be in sight on this farm bill. I am hopeful this \nweek, if we continue on the pace we are going, we can do that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent on the amendment I just placed \nat the desk to add Senator Gregg as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to say a few words \nabout a couple of amendments that are offered and are pending that we \nmay have votes on tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3553\n\n  First, the Alexander amendment No. 3553 that the Senator from \nTennessee discussed earlier. The tax package that was added to the farm \nbill includes a small wind tax credit of up to 30 percent, or $4,000, \nfor small wind turbines installed at a residence or a business. A small \nwind turbine is one with generation capacity of less than 100 \nkilowatts. The amendment offered by the Senator from Tennessee, \namendment 3553, would limit the eligibility of this to only wind \nturbines installed on farms or at a rural small business.\n  Well, you might say: What is wrong with that? At first blush that \nsounds all right, except that we have new technologies coming on line, \nsmall wind turbines that are very effective, cost effective, that will \nbe used on farms, will be used at some small businesses. But I can also \nsee some of them being used for plain old residences. They may be \nrural, they may be in rural areas, but they would be on farms. They may \nnot be a business or a farm, but they will be rural residences. They \nought to be allowed also to have access to this.\n\n[[Page S15127]]\n\n  I think the amendment unduly restricts the number of people who can \nbe eligible for purchasing these small wind turbines. Also, it says ``a \nrural small business.'' Well, a rural small business has a rather \ndefinite definition, a restricted definition. So there may be a lot of \nsmall businesses that would want to put up a wind turbine for their \nsmall business, but they may not be classified as a rural small \nbusiness.\n  It could be in a small town, it could be in the suburbs, it could be \nin metropolitan areas, but they are on the outskirts of a metropolitan \narea, but they may not be listed as a ``rural small business.'' So why \nwould we want to say to a small business that might be in a rural area, \nclassified in a rural area, but 10 miles away, you would have a small \nbusiness that might not be classified as rural, but they would not be \neligible for it even though they could use and would be inclined to \nconstruct or buy a small wind turbine?\n  Again, I think we want to keep the amendment open to a broader \npopulation. It means more wind power installations, more clean and \nrenewable power. Again, the Senator from Tennessee is probably correct, \nand the majority of these may well, I hope, be put in rural areas, on \nfarms, or at rural businesses. But why would we want to restrict that \nif we want clean, renewable energy in this country? We want to get off \nthe oil pipeline.\n\n  It would seem to me we would continue to encourage this wherever we \ncould. I think the Finance Committee had it right. They had it right, \nand they drafted it right. I hope we will keep the amendment as written \nand defeat this Alexander amendment on wind power.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3551\n\n  Again, Senator Alexander also has an amendment No. 3551, much along \nthe same lines. Right now, rural landowners receive an easement payment \nwhen electric transmission lines are sited on their property.\n  Well, the Finance tax package in the farm bill includes a section \nwhich would allow property owners to exclude these easement payments \nfrom their gross income when calculating their tax payments if the \ntransmission property meets certain requirements, including high \nvoltage and used primarily to transmit renewable energy.\n  Again, do we not want to encourage renewable energy? Do we want to \nget off the pipeline? We want to encourage rural landowners to be more \nprone to let a transmission line be constructed across their property \nif it is renewable electricity.\n  That is what the amendment does. It allows them to exclude the \neasement payment if it meets the voltage and renewable use \nrequirements. So, again, this is another small thing to do to help \nencourage the development of wind power and wind farms or solar energy \nor geothermal energy; it could be any of those.\n  Since a lot of these will be located in rural areas, they are going \nto need to build transmission lines across the farms in rural areas, so \nthe Finance Committee added this to the farm bill. It can help support \ntransmission access development for renewable energy and expand and \nmodernize the transmission grid, and benefit consumers nationwide by \nbringing down the cost of renewable electricity. But it is often the \nfarmers and ranchers who see the actual infrastructure on their \nproperty. This is, again, another way of encouraging, as rapidly as \npossible, the building of more renewable energy systems in the country.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3671\n\n  Lastly, Mr. President, Senator Gregg today offered amendment No. 3671 \nto strike the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network from the farm \nbill.\n  I listened a little bit to what the Senator had to say. I want to \nmake it very clear for the record that this is not a mandatory program. \nThis is only an authorization. It is fully discretionary. It is up to, \nof course, the Agriculture Appropriations Committee to appropriate \nmoney for it. Senator Grassley, and a lot of other members are \nsupportive of this provision. The Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance \nNetwork provision is a bipartisan part of the farm bill. We included it \nto respond to an increase in the incidences of psychological distress \nand suicide in rural areas.\n  Farmers and rural residents often lack affordable health insurance, \nand they lack any close proximity to any mental health treatment \nservices. So this program we included would provide telephone help \nlines, Web sites, support groups, outreach services to farmers, \nranchers and rural residents who need this help.\n  Again, it is an authorization only. There are no mandatory funds. I \nfind it odd this provision is singled out when there are no mandatory \nfunds involved. Farmers increasingly face a lot of stress. They have no \ncontrol over many factors such as drought, blizzards, floods, ice \nstorms, as we are having in Iowa right now, financial difficulties \nbeyond their control, foreign markets, imports, disease, different \nthings that happen. A lot of times farmers have no control over these. \nIt can be compounded if a farmer or rancher has some poor physical \nhealth problems, in addition, and they lack insurance coverage. So \nagain, it is trying to establish some rural help lines so a farmer out \nthere, rancher out there who feels stressed might want to call and seek \nsome help and assistance.\n  Farmers and ranchers pride themselves on being rugged individuals. \nThat they are. But that doesn't mean they are not subject to stress. \nThat doesn't mean they don't commit suicide. They do. That doesn't mean \nthey sometimes get so stressed out they act out in violent ways. It \nhappens to the best of people and the most rugged of individuals. I \nhave been approached--I am sure others have--by a lot of farm groups \nasking that we do something more to assist farmers and farm families \nwho have had stresses. That was why we set up the Farm and Ranch Stress \nAssistance Network. It had never been done before. We wanted to test it \nout and see if it might work and might help save a few lives, keep a \nfew families together, cut down on spousal abuse, cut down on maybe \neven some child abuse in some cases. It is a good part of the farm \nbill. I hope Senators will oppose the Gregg amendment and keep the \nrural stress assistance network as part of the farm bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Enzi pertaining to the introduction of S. 2448 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, it was 8 degrees in Manchester this \nmorning. Home heating oil costs $3.27 per gallon. These are the cold, \nhard facts of winter in New England--8 degrees; $3.27 per gallon. As we \ncontinue debate this week on a comprehensive energy bill, let's keep \nthese numbers in mind, and let's not pass energy policies that increase \nthe cost of heating our homes in the winter.\n  The Federal Government has limited power to reduce energy prices in \nthe near future. Taxes and regulations can greatly increase them, but \nCongress is in poor position to affect the laws of supply and demand. \nSo what are we to do to help those most in need during the long, cold \nwinter?\n  Fortunately, there is a program in place to help low-income \nhouseholds pay to heat their homes; a program that does a good job \ngetting assistance to those who need it; a program that I have \nconsistently supported during my 11 years here in Congress: the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.\n  LIHEAP works. It is administered by the States and by local agencies \nthat know the people receiving assistance. Congress passed the \nprecursor program back in 1980, and the program has grown over the \nyears, to $3.2 billion nationwide in 2006.\n  Last year, under the continuing resolution, LIHEAP funding was \nroughly a billion dollars less. Because we have provided less money for \nthe program, Health and Human Services is providing less money to \nStates. So far, HHS has only been able to release 75 percent of each \nState's traditional allocation under LIHEAP.\n  Since my first year in Congress, I have consistently supported \nfunding for LIHEAP. I have asked President Clinton and President Bush \nto support\n\n[[Page S15128]]\n\nLIHEAP. I have asked Republican appropriations chairmen and Democratic \nappropriations chairmen to increase support for LIHEAP. I have asked \nHealth and Human Service Secretaries to release contingency funds in \nresponse to heat waves in the summer and cold snaps in the winter. And \ntoday, I have joined the senior Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, \nas a cosponsor of an amendment to the farm bill that would provide an \nadditional $924 million for LIHEAP this year. The Senator from Vermont, \nMr. Sanders, has introduced a bill that would provide a billion dollars \nin emergency funds for LIHEAP, and I am a cosponsor of that legislation \nas well.\n  I have joined colleagues from both parties in requesting additional \nsupport of LIHEAP in the Omnibus appropriations bill that is now being \ndrafted, and I have joined colleagues from both parties in seeking a \nmeeting with Director Jim Nussle at the Office of Management and Budget \nin order to press for support for this vital program.\n  The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program has broad bipartisan \nsupport in the House and the Senate. We are pursuing a number of ways \nto get this increased assistance out to people who are having trouble \nheating their homes.\n  Quite frankly, these folks don't really care how we go about it. They \njust know that it was 8 degrees this morning in Manchester and that \nheating oil costs $3.27 per gallon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 6\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any cloture \nfiled on Wednesday, December 12, with respect to H.R. 6, the Energy \nbill, be considered as having been filed on Tuesday, December 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Dorgan-Grassley amendment No. 3695 occur at 9:15 a.m. \non Thursday, December 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nresumes H.R. 2419 tomorrow, December 12, it proceed to vote in relation \nto the following two amendments in the order listed, with no amendments \nin order to the amendments prior to the votes, and that there be 2 \nminutes of debate prior to each vote, equally divided and controlled: \nGregg amendments Nos. 3671 and 3672, with the second vote 10 minutes in \nduration; further, that on Wednesday, December 12, the following \namendments be debated for the time limits specified, with all time \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form, with no amendments in \norder to any of the amendments covered under this agreement prior to a \nvote in relation to the amendment: Alexander amendments Nos. 3551 and \n3353, with 30 minutes divided as follows: 10 minutes each for Senators \nAlexander, Bingaman, and Salazar; Cornyn amendment No. 3687, 30 \nminutes; Dorgan-Grassley amendment No. 3695, as modified, 2 hours; \nKlobuchar amendment No. 3810, 60 minutes; Gregg amendment No. 3673, 2 \nhours; Sessions amendment No. 3596, 40 minutes; Coburn amendments Nos. \n3807, 3530, and 3632, a total of 90 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I will add, Senator Coburn, even though I get upset at \nhim for offering all these amendments, some of which I think are not in \nthe best interests of the Senate, is always very agreeable to work \nwith. He is a very pleasant man. I like him a lot. Here is an \nindication on these amendments, about which he feels strongly. He \nagreed to a short period of time and rarely takes all his time. A \nlittle side comment.\n  Continuing the unanimous consent request, provided further, that the \nfollowing amendments be subject to a 60-vote threshold, and that if the \namendment achieves 60 votes, then it be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that if the amendment fails to \nachieve 60 votes, then it be withdrawn: Dorgan-Grassley amendment No. \n3695, Gregg amendment No. 3673, and Klobuchar amendment No. 3810; \nfurther, that in any vote sequence, there be 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to each vote, and that after the first vote in any sequence, the \nremaining votes be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue that is very \nimportant to Americans, especially during this holiday season: the \nsafety of consumer products.\n  The string of recalls of toys and other children's products we have \nall read about in the news over the past 6 months has created \nuncertainty and anxiety among parents shopping for their children for \nthe holidays.\n  Parents now come to toy stores armed with shopping lists, as well as \nlists of toy recalls from the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web \nsite.\n  Their concern is understandable. This year has seen an unprecedented \nnumber of unsafe toys recalled this year--more than 25 million so far, \nand counting.\n  They include some of the most popular children's characters: Thomas \nthe Tank Engine, Elmo, Dora the Explorer, Polly Pockets--even Curious \nGeorge and SpongeBob SquarePants.\n  The list of dangers range from high lead content and toxic chemicals \nto choking hazards and dangerously powerful magnets that can rip open a \nchild's intestines if they are swallowed.\n  What is going on with all these recalls?\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission is responsible for overseeing \nthe safety of more than 15,000 consumer products--everything from toys \nto power tools.\n  That agency has suffered deeper staffing and budget cuts than any \nother Federal health and safety regulator.\n  Here are some numbers that ought to worry every American:\n  In 1974, its first year of operation, the CPSC had a budget of $146 \nmillion in today's dollars. Today, its budget is less than half that \namount: just over $62 million.\n  In the last 3 years, the CPSC has suffered its deepest staff cuts \nsince the Reagan administration--from 471 full-time employees down to \njust 401.\n  Today, with imports at an all-time high, the CPSC employs 15 port \ninspectors for the entire country.\n  In addition, CPSC does not have the authority or tools it needs to \nprotect American consumers.\n  The CPSC cannot require premarket testing, cannot order a recall when \nit knows a product poses a hazard to consumers, and can't quickly \nnotify the public of product hazards.\n  In some instances, the combination of lack of funding and lack of \ntools has led to unnecessary, preventable injuries and fatalities \nsuffered by children.\n  It is hard to imagine that our lead product safety agency does not \nhave these tools.\n  Fortunately, there is a set of proposals pending in the Senate that \nwill aid consumer safety by restoring the CPSC to a functioning agency \nand requiring manufacturers of children's products to test and certify \nthe safety of their products.\n  The Senate Commerce Committee has reported a bill by voice vote, \nauthored by Senator Pryor, that would fix many of these problems.\n  Commerce Committee Chairman Inouye and Senator Pryor, chairman of the \nConsumer Affairs Subcommittee, deserve credit for a balanced, \nresponsible plan.\n  The bill would more than double CPSC's current budget, to $141 \nmillion, and increase the agency's staff by 20 percent over the next 7 \nyears.\n  It would also eliminate the use of dangerous lead in toys; require \nindependent, third-party safety tests of toys before they can be sold \nin this country; give the CPSC new powers to regulate the marketplace, \nincluding more authority to force the recall of dangerous products more \nquickly; give State prosecutors the authority to enforce Federal \nconsumer safety laws;\n\n[[Page S15129]]\n\nand increase the maximum fines for willful violation of consumer safety \nlaws from $1.8 million to $100 million.\n  I expect the Senate to move important legislation in this area before \nthe holiday. The House, led by Congressman Bobby Rush, is engaged in a \nsimilar effort on the House side.\n  If we are going to pass stronger consumer product safety legislation, \nit is vital that we have bipartisan cooperation and pursue this \nlegislation in a bipartisan fashion. I support the effort led by \nSenators Inouye and Pryor to reach out to Senators Stevens and Sununu \nof the Commerce Committee to do just that.\n  I encourage these efforts to continue in order to produce a robust \nbill that will improve consumer safety and the functioning of the CPSC.\n  It is a noncontroversial, bipartisan idea that the American public \nexpects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/11/senate-section/article/S15129-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MAGGIE LAINE WEBB\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, in Moline, IL, Maggie Laine Webb \nwill be buried.\n  A promising career took Maggie away from Moline. Sadly, gun violence \nhas brought her home.\n  Maggie Webb was working at the Van Maur department store in Omaha \nlast Wednesday when a 19-year-old man opened fire with an AK-47 assault \nrifle, killing eight people and wounding five more before taking his \nown life.\n  Maggie Webb was the youngest of the gunman's victims. She was just \n24; she would have turned 25 in 2 weeks.\n  She had transferred to Omaha from another Von Maur department store \njust 6 weeks earlier. In Omaha, Maggie was a store manager--a position \nof unusual responsibility for someone her age. But then, Maggie Webb \nwas, by all accounts, an unusually responsible, talented young woman.\n  At Moline High School, where she graduated in 2001, Maggie was a \nsoftball standout, she ran track, and she was involved in student \ncouncil and many other activities. She went on to graduate in 2005 from \nIllinois State University.\n  News of her death has hit many of her former teachers at Moline High \nSchool hard. Bill Burrus, the school principal, said one teacher \nremarked of Maggie, ``She was one of the good ones,'' paused, and then \nsaid, ``No, one of the great ones.''\n  Maggie Webb is survived by her parents, Dave and Vicki Webb, of Port \nByron, IL, and her two older sisters.\n  Our thoughts, prayers, and condolences are with the Webb family and \nall of the families affected by this senseless violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/11/senate-section/article/S15129-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S.

Res. 21, the 2008 \nbudget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto revise the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels for \nlegislation, including one or more bills and amendments, that \nreauthorizes the 2002 farm bill or similar or related programs, \nprovides for revenue changes, or any combination thereof. Section 307 \nauthorizes the revisions provided that certain conditions are met, \nincluding that amounts provided in the legislation for the above \npurposes not exceed $20 billion over the period of fiscal years 2007 \nthrough 2012 and that the legislation not worsen the deficit over the \nperiod of the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012 or the period of \nthe total of fiscal years 2007 through 2017.\n  I find that Senate amendment No. 3711 offered by Senator Lugar to \nSenate amendment No. 3500, an amendment in the nature of a substitute \nto H.R. 2419, satisfies the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve \nfund for the farm bill. Therefore, pursuant to section 307, I am \nadjusting the aggregates in the 2008 budget resolution, as well as the \nallocation provided to the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \nCommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, in the 8 months since the horrific incident \nat Virginia Tech that resulted in the tragic deaths of 32 students, we \nhave witnessed a barrage of new incidents involving threatening conduct \nand, too often, deadly acts of violence at our schools and college \ncampuses nationwide.\n  Just this past Saturday, police arrested a student at Loyola \nMarymount University in Los Angeles on suspicion of posting an \nanonymous online threat to kill people on campus. The threat appeared \non a blog used primarily by college students. It said: ``I am going to \nshoot and kill as many people as I can until which time I am \nincapacitated or killed by police.'' Fortunately, police got to this \ntroubled student before he could make good on his threat. But I urge \nthe Senate not to sit back and wait until the next time, when police \nmay not be able to stop a deadly event before it occurs. We must act \nnow to protect our schools and college campuses.\n  Those who perpetrate these terrible crimes know no boundaries. No \ntargets are off limits. This past Sunday, a man killed two people in \nArvada, CO, after being refused lodging at a Christian missionary \ncenter. Later that day, in Colorado Springs, the same man opened fire \noutside the New Life Church, taking the lives of two teenaged sisters \nand leaving a third victim in critical condition. These recent \nincidents make clear yet again that we must do all we can to ensure \nthat law enforcement is prepared and equipped to respond to such \nincidents.\n  I urge Congress to take prompt action to help stem this tide of \nviolence. The full Senate can begin to address this terrible and \nrecurring problem by taking up and passing the School Safety and Law \nEnforcement Improvement Act of 2007, a legislative package that \nresponds to the Virginia Tech tragedy and the ongoing problem of \nviolence in our schools and in our communities.\n  The Judiciary Committee passed this important bill out of committee \nover 4 months ago. In passing the bill out of the Judiciary Committee \nthis past September, the committee attempted to show deference to \nGovernor Kaine and the task forces at work in Virginia and to \ncomplement their work and recommendations. Working with several \nSenators, including Senators Boxer, Reed, Specter, Feingold, Schumer, \nand Durbin, the committee originated this bill and reported it before \nthe start of the academic year in the hope that the full Senate could \npass these critical school safety improvements this fall.\n  Regrettably, the bill has been stalled on the Senate floor. I urge \nthose holding up its passage to consider that this administration has \nspent more than $15 billion to equip, train, and build facilities for \nthe Iraqi security forces. Surely Congress can stand up for American \nkids who face unrelenting school violence by authorizing just a \nfraction of this money to reduce deadly violence in our schools and \ncommunities right here at home.\n  I do not think the Senate should continue to stand by and wait for \nthe next horrific school tragedy to make the critical changes necessary \nto insure safety in our schools and on our college campuses. The risk \nof school violence will not go away just because Congress may shift its \nfocus. Since this bill passed out of committee, we have seen tragedy at \nDelaware State, University of Memphis, SuccessTech Academy in \nCleveland, OH, as well as incidents in California, New York, \nPennsylvania, and Oregon, to name just a few. I urge the Senate to move \naggressively with the comprehensive school safety legislation. It \nincludes background check improvements, together with other sensible \nyet effective safety improvement measures supported by law enforcement \nacross the country. If we are prohibited by objection from doing so by \nunanimous consent, then let us move to it and let those with objections \nseek to amend those provisions to which they object.\n  There are too many incidents at too many colleges and schools \nnationwide. This terrorizes students and their parents. We should be \ndoing what we can to help.\n  Several weeks ago, a troubled student wearing a Fred Flintstone mask \nand carrying a rifle through campus was arrested at St. John's \nUniversity in Queens, NY, prompting authorities to lock down the campus \nfor 3 hours. The day after that incident, an armed 17-year-old on the \nother side of the country in Oroville, CA, held students hostage at Las \nPlumas High School, also resulting in a lock-down. The incidents have \ncontinued with the arrest a few weeks ago of an armed student suspected \nof plotting a Columbine-style attack on fellow high school students in \nNorristown, PA. More recently, in Happy Valley, OR, police arrested a \n10-year-old student who brought a semi-automatic weapon into his \nelementary school. The students in these situations were lucky and \nescaped without injury.\n  University of Memphis student Taylor Bradford was not so lucky. He \nwas killed on campus on September 30 in what university officials \nbelieve was a targeted attack. He was 21 years old. Shalita Middleton \nwas not so lucky. She died on October 23 from injuries she sustained \nduring the Delaware State incident. She was 17 years old. Nathaniel Pew \nwas not so lucky. He was wounded at Delaware State. High school \nteachers Michael Grassie and David Kachadourian and students Michael \nPeek and Darnell Rodgers--all of whom were wounded by a troubled \nstudent at SuccessTech Academy on October 10--were not so lucky.\n  The School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act responds \ndirectly to incidents like these by squarely addressing the problem of \nviolence in our schools in several ways. The bill enlists the States as \npartners in the dissemination of critical information by making \nsignificant improvements to the National Instant Background Check \nSystem, known as the NICS system. The bill also authorizes Federal \nassistance for programs to improve the safety and security of our \nschools and institutions of higher education, provides equitable \nbenefits to law enforcement serving those institutions including \nbulletproof vests, and funds pilot programs to develop cutting-edge \nprevention and intervention programs for our schools. The bill also \nclarifies and strengthens two existing statutes--the Terrorist Hoax \nImprovements Act and the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act--which are \ndesigned to improve public safety.\n  Specifically, title I would improve the safety and security of \nstudents both at the elementary and secondary school level, and on \ncollege and university campuses. The K-12 improvements are drawn from a \nbill that Senator Boxer introduced in April, and I want to thank \nSenator Boxer for her hard work on this issue. The improvements include \nincreased funding for much-needed infrastructure changes to improve \nsecurity as well as the establishment of hotlines and tip-lines, which \nwill enable students to report potentially dangerous situations to \nschool administrators before they occur.\n  These improvements can save lives. After the four students and \nteachers\n\n[[Page S15131]]\n\nwere wounded at SuccessTech Academy, the press reported that parents \nhad been petitioning to get a metal detector installed and additional \nsecurity personnel added, and that the guard who was previously \nassigned to the school had been removed 3 years ago. In fact, the \nentire city of Cleveland has just 10 metal detectors that are rotated \nthroughout the city's more that 100 schools. Title I of the bill would \nenhance the ability of school district to apply for and receive grant \nmoney to fund the installation of metal detectors and the training and \nhiring of security personnel to keep our kids safe. Over the past 4 \nyears, this administration has spent over $15 billion to equip, train, \nand build facilities for the Iraqi security forces. Surely, Congress \ncan stand up for American kids who face unrelenting school violence by \nsupporting just a small fraction of this figure for much-needed school \nsafety improvements.\n  To address the new realities of campus safety in the wake of Virginia \nTech and more recent college incidents, title I also creates a matching \ngrant program for campus safety and security to be administered out of \nthe COPS Office of the Department of Justice. The grant program would \nallow institutions of higher education to apply, for the first time, \ndirectly for Federal funds to make school safety and security \nimprovements. The program is authorized to be appropriated at \n$50,000,000 for the next 2 fiscal years. While this amounts to just $3 \nper student each year, it will enable schools to more effectively \nrespond to dangerous situations on campus.\n  Title II of the bill seeks to improve the NICS system. The senseless \nloss of life at Virginia Tech revealed deep flaws in the transfer of \ninformation relevant to gun purchases between the States and the \nFederal Government. The defects in the current system permitted the \nperpetrator of this terrible crime to obtain a firearm even though a \njudge had declared him to be a danger to himself and thus ineligible \nunder Federal law. Seung-Hui Cho was not eligible to buy a weapon given \nhis mental health history, but he was still able to pass a background \ncheck because data was missing from the system. We are working to close \ngaps in the NICS system. Title II will correct these problems, and for \nthe first time will create a legal regime in which disqualifying mental \nhealth records, both at the State and Federal level, would regularly be \nreported into the NICS system.\n  Title III would make sworn law enforcement officers who work for \nprivate institutions of higher education and rail carriers eligible for \ndeath and disability benefits, and for funds administered under the \nByrne grant program and the bulletproof vest partnership grant program. \nProviding this equitable treatment is in the best interest of our \nNation's educators and students and will serve to place the support of \nthe Federal Government behind the dedicated law enforcement officers \nwho serve and protect private colleges and universities nationwide. I \ncommend Senator Jack Reed for his leadership in this area.\n  Title IV of the bill makes improvements to the Law Enforcement \nOfficers Safety Act of 2003. These amendments to existing law will \nstreamline the system by which qualified retired and active officers \ncan be certified under LEOSA. It serves us all when we permit qualified \nofficers, with a demonstrated commitment to law enforcement and no \nadverse employment history, to protect themselves, their families, and \ntheir fellow citizens wherever those officers may be.\n  Title V incorporates the PRECAUTION Act, which Senators Feingold and \nSpecter asked to have included. This provision authorizes grants to \ndevelop prevention and intervention programs for our schools.\n  Finally, Title VI incorporates the Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of \n2007, at the request of Senator Kennedy.\n  Let us go forward and act now on this important bill. The Virginia \nTech Review Panel--a body commissioned by Governor Tim Kaine to study \nthe Virginia Tech tragedy--recently issued its findings based on a 4-\nmonth long investigation of the incident and its aftermath. This bill \nwould adopt a number of recommendations from the review panel aimed at \nimproving school safety planning and reporting information to NICS. We \nmust not miss this opportunity to implement these initiatives \nnationwide, and to take concrete steps to ensure the safety of our \nkids.\n  I recognize that there is no solution to fully end the sad phenomenon \nof school violence. But the recent tragedies should prompt us to \nrespond in realistic and meaningful ways when we are presented with \nsuch challenges. I hope the Senate can promptly move this bill forward \nto invest in the safety of our students and better support law \nenforcement officers across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/11/senate-section/article/S15131-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15131-S15132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FEDERAL CRACK COCAINE SENTENCING POLICY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, nothing is more fundamental to our system \nof justice than the tenet inscribed in Vermont marble on the supreme \ncourt building, that all people should receive ``equal justice under \nlaw.'' For more than 20 years, however, our Nation has tolerated a \nFederal cocaine sentencing policy that treats crack offenders more \nharshly than cocaine offenders. This policy has unacceptably had a \ndisparate impact on people of color and the poor--without any empirical \njustification.\n  Today, the U.S. Sentencing Commission took yet another important step \nin addressing the wide disparity in our Federal cocaine sentencing \nlaws. By voting to change our Sentencing Guidelines to reduce the \nsentences of crack offenders currently incarcerated, the Commission \ntook a moderate but significant step to reduce unwarranted sentencing \ndisparities in Federal crack and powder cocaine laws. Their unanimous \nvote is consistent with the goals of the Sentencing Reform Act, \nincluding ``the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among \ndefendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar \nconduct'' and brings our Nation one step closer to a drug policy that \nis fair and equal for all Americans.\n  The good news does not stop there. Just yesterday, in the landmark \nruling of Kimbrough v. United States, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates expanded the power of our Federal trial courts to address the \nunfair disparity in our Federal sentencing laws between crack and \npowder cocaine. By a vote of 7 to 2, the Court ruled that Federal \njudges may, in their discretion, consider this disparity and depart \nfrom a guideline sentence where the punishment is ``greater than \nnecessary'' to serve Congress's objectives.\n  Under current law, an offender apprehended with 5 grams of crack \ncocaine faces the same 5-year mandatory minimum sentence as an offender \nwith 500 grams of powder cocaine. That means existing law gives the \nsame sentence to a drug trafficker dealing crack cocaine as it would to \none dealing 100 times more powder cocaine.\n  This year, the Sentencing Commission has taken historic actions to \naddress the unfairness and injustice of this disparity. The Commission \nheld hearings and, after extensive study of this issue, reiterated its \nlong-held position that crack cocaine penalties continue to \ndisproportionately impact minorities and undermine various \ncongressional objectives set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act. Next, \nthe Commission attempted to correct this disparity and provide some \nrelief to some crack cocaine offenders by recommending that all crack \npenalties be lowered by two base offense levels. Last month, Congress \nallowed this new Commission amendment--the so-called ``Crack Minus 2'' \namendment--to be enacted in the Sentencing Guidelines.\n  Today, the Sentencing Commission has taken yet another positive step.\n  This amendment is consistent with Congress's intent in creating a \nsentencing guideline system. In its report to Congress, the Commission \nsaid that the Crack Minus 2 amendment was needed to address its long-\nheld finding that ``the 100-to-1 drug quantity ratio (for crack \ncocaine) significantly undermines the various congressional objectives \nset forth in the Sentencing Reform Act.'' I agree. I join the chorus of \nour esteemed Federal judges, articulated in the Judicial Commission's \ntestimony before the Sentencing Commission on this amendment, that \nfundamental fairness dictates that this amendment ``equally applies to \noffenders who were sentenced in the past as well as offenders [who] \nwill be sentenced in the future.''\n\n[[Page S15132]]\n\n  Fundamental fairness dictates that we undo past errors to build \npublic confidence in the rule of law. Americans must have faith and \nconfidence that our drug laws are fair and proportional, and a rule \ncorrecting a past injustice should be applied retroactively to restore \nthat public confidence. The public's faith is even more critical in \ncrack cocaine cases where 85 percent of the defendants are African \nAmericans--a fact which only enhances the public perception that harsh \nand punitive sentences are imposed disproportionately on persons of \ncolor.\n  Allowing judges to reconsider the sentences for crack offenders will \nnot threaten public safety. As the Judicial Conference noted in its \ntestimony before the Sentencing Commission, ``no offender would be \neligible for release without judicial approval.'' This amendment allows \njudges the discretion to give a sentence outside of the Federal \nguidelines but does not mandate that such a sentence must be imposed. \nAs chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have some experience \nwith the people who serve our Nation in lifetime positions on the \nFederal bench. Unlike those who argue that the sky is falling, I have \nevery confidence in the ability of our Federal judges to use this power \nsparingly and to provide a proper check when necessary to prevent the \nrelease of dangerous offenders back into our communities and \nneighborhoods.\n  Most importantly, while I abhor the damage done by drug abuse, I also \nabhor that the penalties for those in the inner city are different than \nfor those in affluent society. For 21 years, far too many African \nAmericans and low-level drug offenders were subject to unfair and \noverly punitive Federal crack cocaine sentencing laws. With the \nCommission's amendment to reduce this disparity, we begin the process \nof healing wounds which have long shaken the public's confidence in our \nFederal drug policy. Applying this fix retroactively is only fair and \njust.\n  The administration's failure to support retroactivity of even the \nslightest modification of crack penalties is both a surprise and a deep \ndisappointment. I recall that 2 days before taking office, President \nBush said that we should address this problem ``by making sure the \npowder cocaine and the crack cocaine sentences are the same.'' He also \nsaid, ``I don't believe we ought to be discriminatory.'' Yet his \nJustice Department has strongly opposed retroactive application of this \ncrack cocaine reform amendment, even though failure to act would once \nagain disparately impact African Americans, since an estimated 85 \npercent of those who would benefit from the policy are African \nAmericans. The Justice Department's position would also erode public \nconfidence that our drug laws are free from bias since previous drug \nreform amendments more likely to benefit Whites and Hispanics were made \nretroactive.\n  Thankfully, the Sentencing Commission accepted the administration's \nview. Their decision today was unanimous. I hope the Attorney General \nwill take notice and move to support drug laws that treat all Americans \nequally.\n  While fundamental change will require congressional action, I salute \nthe Sentencing Commission for its leadership on this issue. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Commission's decision and support additional \nchanges to our laws to further reduce the disparity in our Federal \ncocaine sentencing laws. It is long past time for us to rectify this \nproblem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/11/senate-section/article/S15132-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             RECOGNIZING HIDALGO EARLY COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I recognize the many schools \nin my State of Texas that are working to close achievement gaps and \nprovide their students with an excellent education. Last week, the U.S. \nNews and World Report issued the very first national rankings for the \nBest High Schools in America. Out of more than 20,000 schools that were \nevaluated, one school in south Texas, Hidalgo Early College High \nSchool, ranked 11th among the top schools that provide ``a good \neducation across their entire student body, not just for some \nstudents.''\n  I will have more to say about the other schools on the list in \nseparate remarks, but today I would like to focus on the extraordinary \nstory of Hidalgo High School, home of the Pirates and 850 Hispanic \nstudents in grades 9-12.\n  Hidalgo, TX, is a small town, population 7322, on the U.S.-Mexico \nborder about 250 miles south of San Antonio. Although Hidalgo is the \nfourth largest U.S. port of entry, unemployment tops 11 percent and \nnearly 40 percent of the population is below the poverty level. Over a \nquarter of the students at Hidalgo High are limited English proficient. \nYet this school has a 94-percent graduation rate.\n  A grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2006 has \nallowed Hidalgo High and the University of Texas-Pan American to \ndevelop an innovative partnership for college preparation. All students \nat Hidalgo High School are enrolled in the Early College High School \nProgram, where they will earn both a high school diploma and an \nassociate's degree or up to 2 years of credit toward a bachelor's \ndegree. Students receive college level credit from the University of \nTexas-Pan American. The class of 2010 will be the first class to \nparticipate in this program for a full 4 years.\n  According to Hidalgo High Principal Edward Blaha:\n\n       We continuously strive to seek high expectations for all \n     students in their academic, civic and social endeavors and to \n     provide them with opportunities for a successful transition \n     to higher education and the marketplace. . . . Our high \n     school program is designed to engage students in active, \n     collaborative learning that emphasizes the development of \n     critical thinking skills to be applied to real-world \n     concepts.\n\n  Congratulations to Principal Edward Blaha, the faculty and staff, and \nall of the students and their families at Hidalgo High School on \nachieving this distinction. The decision to pursue the Early College \nHigh School Program provides students with the educational \nopportunities necessary to generate economic and intellectual progress. \nI am proud of your vision, hard work and achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/11/senate-section/article/S15132-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15132-S15133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF ELESTINE SMITH NORMAN\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is my honor and distinct \npleasure to recognize Elestine Smith Norman for 34 years of public \nservice to South Carolina's Third Congressional District. Elestine's \ndedication to her community is without equal and I was fortunate to \nhave her as a member of my staff when I served in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Born on December 12, 1949, to the late Wilbert and Elese Morton Smith \nof Greenwood, SC, Elestine is the youngest of five children. She \nattended Brewer High School in Greenwood and became the first member of \nher family to graduate from college, receiving degrees from Piedmont \nTechnical College and Limestone College.\n  Elestine has been married to Willie Neal Norman for 37 years. Neal \nworks for the South Carolina Department of Social Service and is the \npastor of Weston Chapel AME Church in Greenwood where they have \nfaithfully served for 18 years.\n  She is a two-time survivor of breast cancer and will be the first to \ntell you that her faith in Jesus Christ provided her the strength to \nbeat this deadly disease.\n  Elestine's commitment to her community extends well beyond the office \ndoor. She was president of the Greenwood Business and Professional \nWomen's Club, a board member of the local United Way, and sat on the \nBoard of Visitors for both Piedmont Technical College and Lander \nUniversity. In 2007, she was recognized with the Women's History Month \nGovernment Award from the AME Church for the State of South Carolina.\n  Elestine began her career with the U.S. House of Representatives in \n1973. She has been a constituent service liaison for four consecutive \nMembers from the Third Congressional District, Democrat and Republican \nRepresentatives Bryan Dorn, Butler Derrick, me, and the current office \nholder Gresham Barrett.

A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation \nAct of 1977 to make certain technical corrections; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that is of \ngreat importance to my State. Last year a bipartisan coalition of \nSenators came together to pass the Surface Mining Control and \nReclamation Act Amendments of 2007. Since that time, some lawyers and \nbureaucrats in Washington have taken it upon themselves to misinterpret \nthe law. We need to fix this. The legislation I am introducing will yet \nagain reiterate congressional intent as to how the program should be \nrun. The bill that passed as part of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act \n2006, which was a part originally of the pension reform bill, fixed the \nabandoned mine land trust fund so it would run as Congress originally \nintended, which was some 30 years earlier. For the first time in years, \nStates were scheduled to receive funding they were promised that would \nbe used to clean up abandoned coal mines where that was needed.\n  For States that had been certified by the Office of Surface Mining as \nhaving completed their coal cleanup work, funding was expected to go to \nthese States to do whatever the State legislators chose to be a \npriority for that State.\n  The language is simple and straightforward. It reads:\n\n       Payments shall be made in 7 equal annual installments, \n     beginning in fiscal year 2008.\n\n  As we passed the legislation, everyone involved knew what that meant. \nFor years, our State's money has been held hostage to pay for other \nprograms. With the passage of the abandoned mine land bill, the money \nwould flow with no strings attached and no diversions to other \nprograms. Congressional intent was very clear. Unfortunately, last week \nI was told by lawyers and bureaucrats at the Department of Interior \nthat they have decided to ignore the congressional intent and have \nchosen to send the money to States such as Wyoming in the form of \ngrants. It seems they don't have enough Federal employees because their \nplan will create an onerous program that will undoubtedly require more \nhires.\n  As one of the lead Senators in passing the original legislation, I \nknow what Congress meant when we wrote:\n\n       Payments shall be made in 7 equal and annual installments, \n     beginning in fiscal year 2008.\n\n  To ensure that no confusion existed, I met with the Office of Surface \nMining and with the Office of Management and Budget on numerous \noccasions to discuss that particular issue. Congress intended for \npayments to be made. Congress did not expect the agency to create a new \ngrant program. When I realized this egregious misinterpretation of the \nlaw was a possibility, I took immediate action. I asked those same \nlawyers and bureaucrats who did not read the law to provide me with the \nlegislative language that makes it explicitly clear that they should \ninterpret the law the way Congress intended.\n  That is the bill I am introducing today with my colleague from \nMontana and the other Senator from Wyoming. Only in the absurd world \nthat is Washington could an agency believe the word ``payment'' means \ngrant. I look forward to working with my colleagues to swiftly move \nthis forward so the executive branch can finally follow what Congress \nintended.\n  I have to tell my colleagues it was quite a shock to find out a whole \nprogram was going to be set up so Wyoming could ask for its money \npiecemeal. We have been begging for 30 years to get this money. The \nmoney has been paid in by the coal companies to cover reclamation and \nthen anything that had to do with coal impact. We did the reclamation. \nWe are now handling the coal impact. But the money has been held \nhostage; $550 million worth of money has been held over that period.\n  Last year Congress said: Wyoming and Montana--Montana has $58 \nmillion--deserve their money. So do several other States. We will give \nit to them.\n  Now there was a little question about what that did with debt, but we \nwere able to show them that paying off debt with debt wound up with the \nsame amount of debt but wasn't stealing from the States. So we were \nable to get that confirmed by this body and put into law. It said we \nwould be paid in seven equal annual payments, beginning in the year \n2008. Now we find out it could be millions of payments over a number of \nyears under a grant program. They do realize they can't deny any grant \nrequest the State has, but each and every transaction would have to go \nthrough somebody. We are not about to hire that many people to do what \nis explicit in the language.\n  I will ask the rest of my colleagues to help us on this amendment. We \nwill find a place to put it, and we will get it done this year so the \nintent of the law we passed last year will get done.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2449. A bill to amend chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, \nrelating to protective orders, sealing of cases, disclosures of \ndiscovery information in civil actions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sunshine in \nLitigation Act of 2007, a bill to curb the ongoing abuse of secrecy \norders in Federal courts. The result of this abuse, which often comes \nin the form of sealed settlement agreements, is to keep important \nhealth and safety information from the public.\n  This problem has been recurring for decades, and most often arises in \nproduct liability cases. Typically, an individual brings a cause of \naction against a manufacturer for an injury or death that has resulted \nfrom a defect in one of its products. The injured party often faces a \nlarge corporation that can spend an unlimited amount of money defending \nthe lawsuit and prolong its resolution. Facing a formidable opponent \nand mounting medical bills, plaintiffs often have no choice but to \nsettle the litigation. In exchange for the award he or she was seeking, \nthe victim is forced to agree to a provision that prohibits him or her \nfrom revealing information disclosed during the litigation.\n  Plaintiffs get a respectable award, and the defendant is able to keep \ndamaging information from getting out. Because they remain unaware of \ncritical public health and safety information that could potentially \nsave lives, the American public incurs the greatest cost.\n  This concern for excessive secrecy is warranted by the fact that \ntobacco companies, automobile manufacturers, and pharmaceutical \ncompanies have settled with victims and used the legal system to hide \ninformation which, if it became public, could protect the American \npeople. Surely, there are appropriate uses for such orders, like \nprotecting trade secrets and other truly confidential company \ninformation. This legislation makes sure such information is protected. \nBut, protective orders are certainly not supposed to be used for the \nsole purpose of hiding damaging information from the public to protect \na company's reputation or profit margin.\n  One of the most famous cases of abuse involved Bridgestone/Firestone \ntires. From 1992-2000, tread separations of various Bridgestone and \nFirestone tires were causing accidents across the country, many \nresulting in serious injuries and even fatalities. Instead of owning up \nto their mistakes and acting responsibly, Bridgestone/Firestone quietly \nsettled dozens of lawsuits, most of which included secrecy agreements. \nIt wasn't until 1999, when a Houston public television station broke \nthe story, that the company acknowledged its wrongdoing and recalled \n6.5 million tires. By then, it was too late. More than 250 people had \ndied, and more than 800 were injured as a result of the defective \ntires.\n  If the story ended there, and the Bridgestone/Firestone cases were \njust\n\n[[Page S15141]]\n\nan aberration, one might argue that there is no urgent need for \nlegislation. But, unfortunately, the list goes on. There is the case of \nGeneral Motors. Although an internal memo demonstrated that GM was \naware of the risk of fire deaths from crashes of pickup trucks with \n``side saddle'' fuel tanks, an estimated 750 people were killed in \nfires involving these fuel tanks. When victims sued, GM disclosed \ndocuments only under protective orders and settled these cases on the \ncondition that the information in these documents remained secret. This \ntype of fuel tank was installed for 15 years before being discontinued.\n  Evidence suggests that the dangers posed by protective orders and \nsecret settlements continue. On December 11, 2007, at a hearing before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition \nPolicy and Consumer Rights, Johnny Bradley, Jr. described his tragic \npersonal story about the implications of court-endorsed secrecy. In \n2002, Mr. Bradley's wife was killed in a rollover accident allegedly \ncaused by tread separation in his Cooper tires. While litigating the \ncase, his attorney uncovered documented evidence of Cooper tire design \ndefects. Through aggressive litigation of protective orders and \nconfidential settlements in cases prior to the Bradleys' accident, \nCooper had managed to keep the documents confidential. Prior to the end \nof Mr. Bradley's trial, Cooper Tires settled with him on the condition \nthat almost all litigation documents would be kept confidential under a \nbroad protective order. With no access to documented evidence of design \ndefects, consumers will continue to remain in the dark.\n  In 2005, the drug company Eli Lilly settled 8,000 cases related to \nharmful side effects of its drug Zyprexa. All of those settlements \nrequired plaintiffs to agree, ``not to communicate, publish or cause to \nbe published. . .any statement. . .concerning the specific events, \nfacts or circumstances giving rise to [their] claims.'' In that case, \nthe plaintiffs uncovered documents that showed that, through its own \nresearch, Lilly knew about the side effects as early as 1999. While the \nplaintiffs kept quiet, Lilly continued to sell Zyprexa and generated \n$4.2 billion in sales that year. More than a year later, information \nabout the case was leaked to the New York Times and another 18,000 \ncases settled. Had the first settlement not included a secrecy \nagreement, consumers would have been able to make informed choices and \navoid the harmful side effects, including enormous weight gain, \ndangerously elevated blood sugar levels and diabetes.\n  There are no records kept of the number of confidentiality orders \naccepted by State or Federal courts. However, anecdotal evidence \nsuggests that court secrecy and confidential settlements are prevalent. \nBeyond General Motors, Bridgestone/Firestone, Cooper Tires, and \nZyprexa, secrecy agreements had real life consequences by allowing \nDalkon Shield, Bjork-Shiley heart valves, and numerous other dangerous \nproducts and drugs to remain on the market. And those are only the ones \nwe know about.\n  While some States have already begun to move in the right direction, \nwe still have a long way to go. It is time to initiate a Federal \nsolution for this problem. The Sunshine in Litigation Act is a modest \nproposal that would require Federal judges to perform a simple \nbalancing test to ensure that the defendant's interest in secrecy truly \noutweighs the public interest in information related to public health \nand safety.\n  Specifically, prior to making any portion of a case confidential or \nsealed, a judge would have to determine--by making a particularized \nfinding of fact--that doing so would not restrict the disclosure of \ninformation relevant to public health and safety. Moreover, all courts, \nboth Federal and State, would be prohibited from issuing protective \norders that prevent disclosure to relevant regulatory agencies.\n  This legislation does not prohibit secrecy agreements across the \nboard. It does not place an undue burden on judges or our courts. It \nsimply states that where the public interest in disclosure outweighs \nlegitimate interests in secrecy, courts should not shield important \nhealth and safety information from the public. The time to focus some \nsunshine on public hazards to prevent future harm is now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Rules of Evidence to address the \nwaiver of the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to create \nFederal Rule of Evidence 502. I am pleased that Senator Specter has \njoined me in this\n\n[[Page S15142]]\n\neffort. After much study, several hearings, and significant public \ncomment, the Judicial Conference's Standing Committee on Rules of \nPractice and Procedure, and the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules, \narrived at a proposed new rule that is intended to provide \npredictability and uniformity in a discovery process that has been made \nincreasingly difficult with the growing use of email and other \nelectronic media. I commend all of the judges, professors and \npractitioners who were involved in the rule's drafting and subsequent \nimprovement for their hard work and attention to this issue. The \nlegislation we are introducing today contains the text that the \nJudicial Conference recommends.\n  Billions of dollars are spent each year in litigation to protect \nagainst the inadvertent disclosure of privileged materials. With the \nroutine use of email and other electronic media in today's business \nenvironment, discovery can encompass millions of documents in a given \ncase, vastly expanding the risks of inadvertent disclosure. The rule \nproposed by the Standing Committee is aimed at adapting to the new \nrealities that accompany today's modes of communication, and reducing \nthe burdens associated with the conduct of diligent electronic \ndiscovery.\n  Our proposed legislation would set clear guidelines regarding the \nconsequences of inadvertent disclosure of privileged material, and \nprovides that so long as reasonable steps are taken in the prevention \nof such a disclosure, or to assure the prompt retrieval of disclosed \ninformation, no waiver will result. Moreover, an inadvertent disclosure \nof privileged information would not result in a broader subject matter \nwaiver beyond the specific materials disclosed.\n  If a disclosure of privileged material is made voluntarily, only the \nprivilege associated with the voluntarily disclosed material is waived, \nand not other undisclosed related materials. But if voluntary \ndisclosure of privileged material is done selectively in an effort to \nmislead or gain unfair advantage, then where fairness dictates, this \nwill result in a subject matter waiver.\n  This legislation would also provide that confidentiality agreements \nentered into by parties to litigation, and approved by the court, will \nbind all non-parties in other State or Federal litigation. This \nprovision will add meaningful protection to parties entering \nconfidentiality agreements and, along with other components of the \nproposed rule, will aid in reducing the burdens of excessive pre-\nproduction document review.\n  Unlike other Federal court rules, any proposed rule that modifies an \nevidentiary privilege must be approved by Congress pursuant to the \nRules Enabling Act. The modification of a privilege is an undertaking \nnot to be approached lightly, and the process that resulted in proposed \nRule 502 was thorough and thoughtful. It has resulted in widespread \napproval of the proposed rule from the bench and bar at both the State \nand Federal level.\n  I urge all Senators to join Senator Specter and me to pass this \nproposal and take a positive step toward modernizing and improving the \nFederal Rules of Evidence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2450\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND WORK PRODUCT; \n                   LIMITATIONS ON WAIVER.\n\n       (a) In General.--Article V of the Federal Rules of Evidence \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Rule 502. Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product; \n       Limitations on Waiver\n\n       ``The following provisions apply, in the circumstances set \n     out, to disclosure of a communication or information covered \n     by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.\n       ``(a) Disclosure Made in a Federal Proceeding or to a \n     Federal Office or Agency; Scope of a Waiver.--When the \n     disclosure is made in a federal proceeding or to a federal \n     office or agency and waives the attorney-client privilege or \n     work-product protection, the waiver extends to an undisclosed \n     communication or information in a federal or state proceeding \n     only if:\n       ``(1) the waiver is intentional;\n       ``(2) the disclosed and undisclosed communications or \n     information concern the same subject matter; and\n       ``(3) they ought in fairness to be considered together.\n       ``(b) Inadvertent Disclosure.--When made in a federal \n     proceeding or to a federal office or agency, the disclosure \n     does not operate as a waiver in a federal or state proceeding \n     if:\n       ``(1) the disclosure is inadvertent;\n       ``(2) the holder of the privilege or protection took \n     reasonable steps to prevent disclosure; and\n       ``(3) the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify \n     the error, including (if applicable) following Federal Rule \n     of Civil Procedure 26(b)(5)(B).\n       ``(c) Disclosure Made in a State Proceeding.--When the \n     disclosure is made in a state proceeding and is not the \n     subject of a state-court order concerning waiver, the \n     disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a federal \n     proceeding if the disclosure:\n       ``(1) would not be a waiver under this rule if it had been \n     made in a federal proceeding; or\n       ``(2) is not a waiver under the law of the state where the \n     disclosure occurred.\n       ``(d) Controlling Effect of a Court Order.--A federal court \n     may order that the privilege or protection is not waived by \n     disclosure connected with the litigation pending before the \n     court--in which event the disclosure is also not a waiver in \n     any other federal or state proceeding.\n       ``(e) Controlling Effect of a Party Agreement.--An \n     agreement on the effect of disclosure in a federal proceeding \n     is binding only on the parties to the agreement, unless it is \n     incorporated into a court order.\n       ``(f)  Controlling Effect of This Rule.--Notwithstanding \n     Rules 101 and 1101, this rule applies to state proceedings \n     and to federal court-annexed and federal court-mandated \n     arbitration proceedings, in the circumstances set out in the \n     rule. And notwithstanding Rule 501, this rule applies even if \n     state law provides the rule of decision.\n       ``(g) Definitions.--In this rule:\n       ``(1) `attorney-client privilege' means the protection that \n     applicable law provides for confidential attorney-client \n     communications; and\n       ``(2) `work-product protection' means the protection that \n     applicable law provides for tangible material (or its \n     intangible equivalent) prepared in anticipation of litigation \n     or for trial.''.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Changes.--The table of \n     contents for the Federal Rules of Evidence is amended by \n     inserting after the item relating to rule 501 the following:\n\n``502. Attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine; limitations \n              on waiver.''.\n       (c) Effective date.--The amendments made by this Act shall \n     apply in all proceedings commenced after the date of \n     enactment of this Act and, insofar as is just and \n     practicable, in all proceedings pending on such date of \n     enactment.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce \nlegislation, together with Senator Leahy, to enact Federal Rule of \nEvidence 502.\n  Federal Rule of Evidence 502, which was drafted and proposed to \nCongress by the Judicial Conference of the United States, is a rule to \nprovide heightened protection against inadvertent loss of the attorney-\nclient privilege during the discovery process. At a time when \nlitigation costs are skyrocketing and discovery alone can last for \nyears, this rule is urgently needed. And unlike other Federal rules of \nprocedure, which go into effect unless Congress acts, rules governing \nevidentiary privilege must be enacted by Congress.\n  Current law on attorney-client privilege and work product is \nresponsible in large part for the rising costs of discovery--especially \nelectronic discovery. Right now, it is far too easy to inadvertently \nlose--or ``waive''--the privilege. A single inadvertently disclosed \ndocument can result in waiving the privilege not only as to what was \nproduced, but as to all documents on the same subject matter. In some \ncourts, a waiver may be found even if the producing party took \nreasonable steps to avoid disclosure. Such waivers will not just affect \nthe case in which the accidental disclosure is made, but will also \nimpact other cases filed subsequently in State or Federal courts.\n  Thus, lawyers must spend significant amounts of time ensuring that \ndocuments containing privileged communications and work product are not \ninadvertently produced. In this day and age when there can be literally \nmillions of electronic files to comb through looking for privileged \nmaterial, the risk of one slipping through the cracks is very high. The \nfear of waiver leads to undue expense and to extravagant claims of \nprivilege.\n  The proposed rule will alleviate these burdens in two primary ways: \nFirst, it\n\n[[Page S15143]]\n\nprotects against undue forfeiture of attorney-client privilege and work \nproduct protections when privileged communications are inadvertently \nproduced in discovery--where the party producing the documents took \nreasonable steps to prevent the disclosure and does not try to use the \ndisclosed information in a misleading way. Second, it permits parties \nand courts to protect against the consequences of waiver by permitting \nlimited disclosure of privileged information between the parties to \nlitigation. This allows parties and courts to manage the effects of \ndisclosure and provide predictability in current and future litigation.\n  The proposed rule enjoys wide support from parties on both sides of \nthe ``v.'' Both plaintiffs and defendants want this rule because it \nmakes the litigation more efficient and less costly; it ensures that \nthe wheels of justice will not become bogged down in the mud of \ndiscovery.\n  The Judicial Conference, which is the body responsible for proposing \nnew procedural rules, has undertaken an extensive process in crafting \nthis rule over the last year and a half. The rule was approved by the \nJudicial Conference's Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules, the \nStanding Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, and the Judicial \nConference itself, after a public comment period that included several \nhearings with supportive comments and testimony from bench and bar. \nThere were more than 70 public comments, and more than 20 witnesses \ntestified.\n  The time is ripe to move forward and enact this proposed rule into \nlaw. Therefore, I have worked with Senator Leahy to bring this bill to \nthe floor in a timely and bipartisan fashion. This rule is necessary to \nprotect the attorney-client privilege, to bring clarity to the law, and \nto ensure fairness for all parties. And every day we wait wastes the \ntime and resources of litigants and the courts. I urge my colleagues to \njoin with Senator Leahy and me in supporting this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/11/senate-section/article/S15143-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 400--TO DESIGNATE FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2007, AS \n   ``NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE DAY'' IN HONOR OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND \n         CONTRIBUTIONS OF NATIVE AMERICANS TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Bingaman, \nMrs. Clinton, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nBaucus, and Mr. Tester) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. ___2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) State and local public safety officers play an \n     essential role in the efforts of the United States to detect, \n     prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and to respond to \n     natural disasters, hazardous materials, and other mass \n     casualty incidents. State and local public safety officers, \n     as first responders, are a component of our Nation's National \n     Incident Management System, developed by the Department of \n     Homeland Security to coordinate response to and recovery from \n     terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major \n     emergencies. Public safety employer-employee cooperation is \n     essential in meeting these needs and is, therefore, in the \n     National interest.\n       (3) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and the representatives of their employees to reach \n     and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and \n     working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts \n     through negotiations to settle their differences by mutual \n     agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such \n     methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement \n     for the settlement of disputes.\n       (4) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. ___3.

Mr. President, in passing the reauthorization of the \nTraumatic Brain Injury Act today, the Senate has taken an important \nstep toward making a difference in the lives of some of our Nation's \nmost deserving citizens: our soldiers and our children. It is a \nprivilege to have worked with my colleague, Senator Hatch, on this \nlegislation. It is an important and timely bill that helps an \nespecially deserving group of people.\n  Brain injuries have become the signature wound of the war in Iraq. Up \nto two-thirds of our wounded soldiers may have suffered such injuries. \nHere at home, an unacceptably large number of children from birth to \nage 14 experience traumatic brain injuries--approximately 475,000 a \nyear and some of the most frequent of these injuries are to children \nunder the age of five. In Massachusetts alone, more than 40,000 \nindividuals experience brain injuries each year.\n  As a result of such injuries, over 5.3 million Americans are now \nliving with a permanent disability. Today, we have taken a step toward \nensuring that these citizens and their families will receive the best \ncare we can provide.\n  The bill reauthorizes grants that assist States, Territories, and the \nDistrict of Columbia in establishing and expanding coordinated systems \nof community-based services and supports for those with such injuries.\n  When Congress approved the Traumatic Brain Injury Act as part of the \nChildren's Health Act of 2000, we included a specific provision called \nthe Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury \nProgram. This program has become essential because persons with these \ninjuries have an array of needs beyond treatment and health care, \nincluding assistance in returning to work, finding a place to live, \nobtaining supports and services such as attendant care and assistive \ntechnology, and obtaining appropriate mental health, substance abuse, \nand rehabilitation services.\n  Often these persons--especially our returning veterans--must remain \nin extremely expensive institutions far\n\n[[Page S15154]]\n\nlonger than necessary, because the community-based supports and \nservices they need are not available, even though they can lead to \nreduced government expenditures, increased productivity, independence \nand community integration. Those who provide such assistance must have \nspecial skills, and their work is often time-intensive.\n  Our legislation allocates funds for CDC programs that will provide \nimportant information and data on injury prevention. A recent Institute \nof Medicine report showed that such programs work. Their benefit is \nobvious, and we must do all we can to expand this appropriation in the \nyears ahead to meet the urgent and growing need for this assistance.\n  A recent report by the Institute of Medicine calls the current TBI \nprograms an ``overall success.'' It states that ``there is considerable \nvalue in providing funding,'' and ``it is worrisome that the modestly \nbudgeted TBI Program continues to be vulnerable to budget cuts.''\n  Current estimates show that the Federal Government spends less than \n$3 dollars per brain injury survivor on research and services. As the \nIOM study suggests, this program must be able to grow, so that each \nState has the resources necessary to maintain vital services and \nadvocacy for the large number of Americans who sustain such a brain \ninjury each year.\n  Today's passage of this bipartisan bill moves us closer to continuing \nand strengthening these important programs which say to our Nation's \nwounded soldiers and injured children: ``You deserve the best we can \nprovide''. I hope very much that Congress will continue to expand these \nprograms, so that we can truly do all we can for these deserving \nindividuals and their families.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be considered and agreed to; that the committee-reported \nsubstitute, as amended, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
